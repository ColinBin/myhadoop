 babet gueulemer claquesous and montparnasse 
 a quartette of ruffians claquesous gueulemer babet and montparnasse governed the third lower floor of paris from to 
 gueulemer was a hercules of no defined position 
 for his lair he had the sewer of the he was six feet high his pectoral muscles were of marble his biceps of brass his breath was that of a cavern his torso that of a colossus his head that of a bird 
 one thought one beheld the farnese hercules clad in duck trousers and a cotton velvet waistcoat 
 gueulemer built after this sculptural fashion might have subdued monsters he had found it more expeditious to be one 
 a low brow large temples less than forty years of age but with harsh short hair cheeks like a brush a beard like that of a wild boar the reader can see the man before him his muscles called for work his stupidity would have none of it he was a great idle force 
 he was an assassin through coolness he was thought to be a creole 
 he had probably somewhat to do with marshal brune having been a porter at avignon in after this stage he had turned ruffian 
 the diaphaneity of babet contrasted with the grossness of gueulemer babet was thin and learned 
 he was transparent but impenetrable daylight was visible through his bones but nothing through his eyes he declared that he was a chemist 
 he had been a jack of all trades he had played in vaudeville at he was a man of purpose a fine talker who underlined his smiles and accentuated his gestures his occupation consisted in selling in the open air plaster busts and portraits of the head of the state 
 in addition to this he extracted teeth 
 he had exhibited phenomena at fairs and he had owned a booth with a trumpet and this poster babet dental artist member of the academies makes physical experiments on metals and metalloids extracts teeth undertakes stumps abandoned by his brother practitioners 
 price 
 one tooth one franc fifty centimes two teeth two francs three teeth two francs fifty 
 take advantage of this opportunity this take advantage of this opportunity meant 
 have as many teeth extracted as possible 
 he had been married and had had children he did not know what had become of his wife and children 
 he had lost them as one loses his handkerchief 
 babet read the papers a striking exception in the world to which he belonged 
 one day at the period when he had his family with him in his booth on wheels he had read in the messager that a woman had just given birth to a child who was doing well and had a muzzle and he exclaimed a fortune my wife has not the wit to present me with a child like that 
 later on he had abandoned everything in order to undertake paris this was his expression 
 who was claquesous 
 he was night 
 he waited until the sky was daubed with black before he showed himself 
 at nightfall he emerged from the hole whither he returned before daylight 
 where was this hole no one knew 
 he only addressed his accomplices in the most absolute darkness and with his back turned to them 
 was his name claquesous certainly not 
 if a candle was brought he put on a mask he was a ventriloquist 
 babet said 
 claquesous is a nocturne for two voices 
 claquesous was vague terrible and a roamer no one was sure whether he had a name claquesous being a sobriquet none was sure that he had a voice as his stomach spoke more frequently than his voice no one was sure that he had a face as he was never seen without his mask 
 he disappeared as though he had vanished into thin air when he appeared it was as though he sprang from the earth 
 a lugubrious being was montparnasse 
 montparnasse was a child less than twenty years of age with a handsome face lips like cherries charming black hair the brilliant light of springtime in his eyes he had all vices and aspired to all crimes 
 the digestion of evil aroused in him an appetite for worse 
 it was the street boy turned pickpocket and a pickpocket turned garroter he was genteel effeminate graceful robust sluggish ferocious the rim of his hat was curled up on the left side in order to make room for a tuft of hair after the style of 
 he lived by robbery with violence 
 his coat was of the best cut but threadbare montparnasse was a in misery and given to the commission of murders 
 the cause of all this crimes was the desire to be the first grisette who had said to him you are handsome had cast the stain of darkness into his heart and had made a cain of this abel 
 finding that he was handsome he desired to be elegant 
 now the height of elegance is idleness idleness in a poor man means crime 
 few prowlers were so dreaded as montparnasse 
 at eighteen he had already numerous corpses in his past 
 more than one lay with outstretched arms in the presence of this wretch with his face in a pool of blood curled pomaded with laced waist the hips of a woman the bust of a prussian officer the murmur of admiration from the boulevard wenches surrounding him his cravat knowingly tied a bludgeon in his pocket a flower in his buttonhole such was this dandy of the sepulchre

 an hour later dunyasha came to tell the princess that dron had come and all the peasants had assembled at the barn by the princess order and wished to have word with their mistress 
 but i never told them to come said princess mary i only told dron to let them have the grain 
 only for sake princess dear have them sent away and go out to them all a trick said dunyasha and when yakov alpatych returns let us get away and please 
 what is a trick asked princess mary in surprise 
 i know it is only listen to me for sake ask nurse too they say they agree to leave bogucharovo as you ordered 
 making some mistake i never ordered them to go away said princess mary call dronushka 
 dron came and confirmed words the peasants had come by the princess order 
 but i never sent for them declared the princess you must have given my message wrong i only said that you were to give them the grain 
 dron only sighed in reply 
 if you order it they will go away said he 
 no no go out to them said princess mary and in spite of the and protests she went out into the porch dron dunyasha the nurse and michael ivanovich following her 
 they probably think i am offering them the grain to bribe them to remain here while i myself go away leaving them to the mercy of the french thought princess mary i will offer them monthly rations and housing at our moscow estate i am sure andrew would do even more in my place she thought as she went out in the twilight toward the crowd standing on the pasture by the barn 
 the men crowded closer together stirred and rapidly took off their hats princess mary lowered her eyes and tripping over her skirt came close up to them so many different eyes old and young were fixed on her and there were so many different faces that she could not distinguish any of them and feeling that she must speak to them all at once did not know how to do it but again the sense that she represented her father and her brother gave her courage and she boldly began her speech 
 i am very glad you have come she said without raising her eyes and feeling her heart beating quickly and violently dronushka tells me that the war has ruined you that is our common misfortune and i shall grudge nothing to help you i am myself going away because it is dangerous here the enemy is near because i am giving you everything my friends and i beg you to take everything all our grain so that you may not suffer want and if you have been told that i am giving you the grain to keep you here that is not true on the contrary i ask you to go with all your belongings to our estate near moscow and i promise you i will see to it that there you shall want for nothing you shall be given food and lodging 
 the princess stopped sighs were the only sound heard in the crowd 
 i am not doing this on my own account she continued i do it in the name of my dead father who was a good master to you and of my brother and his son 
 again she paused no one broke the silence 
 ours is a common misfortune and we will share it together all that is mine is yours she concluded scanning the faces before her 
 all eyes were gazing at her with one and the same expression she could not fathom whether it was curiosity devotion gratitude or apprehension and distrust but the expression on all the faces was identical 
 we are all very thankful for your bounty but it do for us to take the grain said a voice at the back of the crowd 
 but why not asked the princess 
 no one replied and princess mary looking round at the crowd found that every eye she met now was immediately dropped 
 but why you want to take it she asked again 
 no one answered 
 the silence began to oppress the princess and she tried to catch eye 
 why you speak she inquired of a very old man who stood just in front of her leaning on his stick if you think something more is wanted tell me i will do anything said she catching his eye 
 but as if this angered him he bent his head quite low and muttered 
 why should we agree we want the grain 
 why should we give up everything we agree agree we are sorry for you but not willing go away yourself alone came from various sides of the crowd 
 and again all the faces in that crowd bore an identical expression though now it was certainly not an expression of curiosity or gratitude but of angry resolve 
 but you have understood me said princess mary with a sad smile why you want to go i promise to house and feed you while here the enemy would ruin you 
 but her voice was drowned by the voices of the crowd 
 not willing let them ruin us we take your grain we agree 
 again princess mary tried to catch eye but not a single eye in the crowd was turned to her evidently they were all trying to avoid her look she felt strange and awkward 
 oh yes an artful tale follow her into slavery pull down your houses and go into bondage i dare say give you grain indeed she says voices in the crowd were heard saying 
 with drooping head princess mary left the crowd and went back to the house having repeated her order to dron to have horses ready for her departure next morning she went to her room and remained alone with her own thoughts

 these four ruffians formed a sort of proteus winding like a serpent among the police and striving to escape indiscreet glances under divers forms tree flame fountain lending each other their names and their traps hiding in their own shadows boxes with secret compartments and refuges for each other stripping off their personalities as one removes his false nose at a masked ball sometimes simplifying matters to the point of consisting of but one individual sometimes multiplying themselves to such a point that himself took them for a whole throng 
 these four men were not four men they were a sort of mysterious robber with four heads operating on a grand scale on paris they were that monstrous polyp of evil which inhabits the crypt of society 
 thanks to their ramifications and to the network underlying their relations babet gueulemer claquesous and montparnasse were charged with the general enterprise of the ambushes of the department of the seine 
 the inventors of ideas of that nature men with nocturnal imaginations applied to them to have their ideas executed 
 they furnished the canvas to the four rascals and the latter undertook the preparation of the scenery 
 they labored at the stage setting 
 they were always in a condition to lend a force proportioned and suitable to all crimes which demanded a lift of the shoulder and which were sufficiently lucrative when a crime was in quest of arms they their accomplices they kept a troupe of actors of the shadows at the disposition of all underground tragedies 
 they were in the habit of assembling at nightfall the hour when they woke up on the plains which adjoin the salpetriere 
 there they held their conferences 
 they had twelve black hours before them they regulated their employment accordingly 
 was the name which was bestowed in the subterranean circulation on the association of these four men in the fantastic ancient popular parlance which is vanishing day by day signifies the morning the same as entre chien et dog and the evening 
 this appellation was probably derived from the hour at which their work ended the dawn being the vanishing moment for phantoms and for the separation of ruffians 
 these four men were known under this title when the president of the assizes visited lacenaire in his prison and questioned him concerning a misdeed which lacenaire denied who did it demanded the president 
 lacenaire made this response enigmatical so far as the magistrate was concerned but clear to the police 
 perhaps it was 
 a piece can sometimes be divined on the enunciation of the personages in the same manner a band can almost be judged from the list of ruffians composing it 
 here are the appellations to which the principal members of the names have survived in special memoirs 
 panchaud alias printanier alias bigrenaille 
 brujon 
 there was a brujon dynasty we cannot refrain from interpolating this word 
 boulatruelle the already introduced 
 laveuve 
 finistere 
 a negro 
 mardisoir 
 tuesday evening 
 depeche 
 make haste 
 fauntleroy alias bouquetiere the flower girl 
 glorieux a discharged convict 
 barrecarrosse called monsieur dupont 
 
 poussagrive 
 carmagnolet 
 kruideniers called bizarro 
 mangedentelle 
 
 feet in the air 
 called 
 etc etc 
 we pass over some and not the worst of them 
 these names have faces attached 
 they do not express merely beings but species each one of these names corresponds to a variety of those misshapen fungi from the under side of civilization 
 those beings who were not very lavish with their countenances were not among the men whom one sees passing along the streets fatigued by the wild nights which they passed they went off by day to sleep sometimes in the sometimes in the abandoned quarries of montmatre or montrouge sometimes in the sewers they ran to earth 
 what became of these men 
 they still exist 
 they have always existed horace speaks of them 
 ambubaiarum collegia pharmacopolae mendici mimae and so long as society remains what it is they will remain what they are 
 beneath the obscure roof of their cavern they are continually born again from the social ooze they return spectres but always identical only they no longer bear the same names and they are no longer in the same skins the individuals extirpated the tribe subsists 
 they always have the same faculties 
 from the vagrant to the tramp the race is maintained in its purity 
 they divine purses in pockets they scent out watches in fobs 
 gold and silver possess an odor for them 
 there exist ingenuous bourgeois of whom it might be said that they have a stealable air 
 these men patiently pursue these bourgeois 
 they experience the quivers of a spider at the passage of a stranger or of a man from the country 
 these men are terrible when one encounters them or catches a glimpse of them towards midnight on a deserted boulevard they do not seem to be men but forms composed of living mists one would say that they habitually constitute one mass with the shadows that they are in no wise distinct from them that they possess no other soul than the darkness and that it is only momentarily and for the purpose of living for a few minutes a monstrous life that they have separated from the night 
 what is necessary to cause these spectres to vanish 
 light light in floods 
 not a single bat can resist the dawn light up society from below

 for a long time that night princess mary sat by the open window of her room hearing the sound of the peasants voices that reached her from the village but it was not of them she was thinking she felt that she could not understand them however much she might think about them she thought only of one thing her sorrow which after the break caused by cares for the present seemed already to belong to the past now she could remember it and weep or pray 
 after sunset the wind had dropped the night was calm and fresh toward midnight the voices began to subside a cock crowed the full moon began to show from behind the lime trees a fresh white dewy mist began to rise and stillness reigned over the village and the house 
 pictures of the near past her illness and last moments rose one after another to her memory with mournful pleasure she now lingered over these images repelling with horror only the last one the picture of his death which she felt she could not contemplate even in imagination at this still and mystic hour of night and these pictures presented themselves to her so clearly and in such detail that they seemed now present now past and now future 
 she vividly recalled the moment when he had his first stroke and was being dragged along by his armpits through the garden at bald hills muttering something with his helpless tongue twitching his gray eyebrows and looking uneasily and timidly at her 
 even then he wanted to tell me what he told me the day he died she thought he had always thought what he said then and she recalled in all its detail the night at bald hills before he had the last stroke when with a foreboding of disaster she had remained at home against his will she had not slept and had stolen downstairs on tiptoe and going to the door of the conservatory where he slept that night had listened at the door in a suffering and weary voice he was saying something to tikhon speaking of the crimea and its warm nights and of the empress evidently he had wanted to talk and why he call me why he let me be there instead of tikhon princess mary had thought and thought again now now he will never tell anyone what he had in his soul never will that moment return for him or for me when he might have said all he longed to say and not tikhon but i might have heard and understood him why i enter the room she thought perhaps he would then have said to me what he said the day he died while talking to tikhon he asked about me twice he wanted to see me and i was standing close by outside the door it was sad and painful for him to talk to tikhon who did not understand him i remember how he began speaking to him about lise as if she were alive he had forgotten she was dead and tikhon reminded him that she was no more and he shouted fool he was greatly depressed from behind the door i heard how he lay down on his bed groaning and loudly exclaimed my god why i go in then what could he have done to me what could i have lost and perhaps he would then have been comforted and would have said that word to me and princess mary uttered aloud the caressing word he had said to her on the day of his death she repeated and began sobbing with tears that relieved her soul she now saw his face before her and not the face she had known ever since she could remember and had always seen at a distance but the timid feeble face she had seen for the first time quite closely with all its wrinkles and details when she stooped near to his mouth to catch what he said 
 she repeated again 
 what was he thinking when he uttered that word what is he thinking now this question suddenly presented itself to her and in answer she saw him before her with the expression that was on his face as he lay in his coffin with his chin bound up with a white handkerchief and the horror that had seized her when she touched him and convinced herself that that was not he but something mysterious and horrible seized her again she tried to think of something else and to pray but could do neither with eyes she gazed at the moonlight and the shadows expecting every moment to see his dead face and she felt that the silence brooding over the house and within it held her fast 
 dunyasha she whispered dunyasha she screamed wildly and tearing herself out of this silence she ran to the servants quarters to meet her old nurse and the maidservants who came running toward her

 marius while seeking a girl in a bonnet encounters a man in a cap 
 
 summer passed then the autumn winter came 
 neither m leblanc nor the young girl had again set foot in the luxembourg garden thenceforth marius had but one gaze once more on that sweet and adorable face 
 he sought constantly he sought everywhere he found nothing 
 he was no longer marius the enthusiastic dreamer the firm resolute ardent man the bold defier of fate the brain which erected future on future the young spirit encumbered with plans with projects with pride with ideas and wishes he was a lost dog he fell into a black melancholy 
 all was over 
 work disgusted him walking tired him 
 vast nature formerly so filled with forms lights voices counsels perspectives horizons teachings now lay empty before him 
 it seemed to him that everything had disappeared 
 he thought incessantly for he could not do otherwise but he no longer took pleasure in his thoughts 
 to everything that they proposed to him in a whisper he replied in his darkness what is the use 
 he heaped a hundred reproaches on himself 
 why did i follow her i was so happy at the mere sight of her 
 she looked at me was not that immense 
 she had the air of loving me 
 was not that everything 
 i wished to have what 
 there was nothing after that 
 i have been absurd 
 it is my own fault etc etc courfeyrac to whom he confided was his nature but who made some little guess at was his nature had begun by congratulating him on being in love though he was amazed at it then seeing marius fall into this melancholy state he ended by saying to him 
 i see that you have been simply an animal 
 here come to the chaumiere 
 once having confidence in a fine september sun marius had allowed himself to be taken to the ball at sceaux by courfeyrac bossuet and grantaire hoping what a dream that he might perhaps find her there 
 of course he did not see the one he this is the place all the same where all lost women are found grumbled grantaire in an aside 
 marius left his friends at the ball and returned home on foot alone through the night weary feverish with sad and troubled eyes stunned by the noise and dust of the merry wagons filled with singing creatures on their way home from the feast which passed close to him as he in his discouragement breathed in the acrid scent of the along the road in order to refresh his head 
 he took to living more and more alone utterly overwhelmed wholly given up to his inward anguish going and coming in his pain like the wolf in the trap seeking the absent one everywhere stupefied by love 
 on another occasion he had an encounter which produced on him a singular effect 
 he met in the narrow streets in the vicinity of the boulevard des invalides a man dressed like a workingman and wearing a cap with a long visor which allowed a glimpse of locks of very white hair 
 marius was struck with the beauty of this white hair and scrutinized the man who was walking slowly and as though absorbed in painful meditation 
 strange to say he thought that he recognized m leblanc 
 the hair was the same also the profile so far as the cap permitted a view of it the mien identical only more depressed 
 but why these clothes what was the meaning of this 
 what signified that disguise marius was greatly astonished 
 when he recovered himself his first impulse was to follow the man who knows whether he did not hold at last the clue which he was seeking 
 in any case he must see the man near at hand and clear up the mystery but the idea occurred to him too late the man was no longer there he had turned into some little side street and marius could not find him 
 this encounter occupied his mind for three days and then was effaced 
 after all he said to himself it was probably only a resemblance

 on the seventeenth of august rostov and ilyin accompanied by lavrushka who had just returned from captivity and by an hussar orderly left their quarters at yankovo ten miles from bogucharovo and went for a ride to try a new horse ilyin had bought and to find out whether there was any hay to be had in the villages 
 for the last three days bogucharovo had lain between the two hostile armies so that it was as easy for the russian rearguard to get to it as for the french vanguard rostov as a careful squadron commander wished to take such provisions as remained at bogucharovo before the french could get them 
 rostov and ilyin were in the merriest of moods on the way to bogucharovo a princely estate with a dwelling house and farm where they hoped to find many domestic serfs and pretty girls they questioned lavrushka about napoleon and laughed at his stories and raced one another to try horse 
 rostov had no idea that the village he was entering was the property of that very bolkonski who had been engaged to his sister 
 rostov and ilyin gave rein to their horses for a last race along the incline before reaching bogucharovo and rostov outstripping ilyin was the first to gallop into the village street 
 first cried ilyin flushed 
 yes always first both on the grassland and here answered rostov stroking his heated donets horse 
 and have won on my frenchy your excellency said lavrushka from behind alluding to his shabby cart horse only i wish to mortify you 
 they rode at a footpace to the barn where a large crowd of peasants was standing 
 some of the men bared their heads others stared at the new arrivals without doffing their caps two tall old peasants with wrinkled faces and scanty beards emerged from the tavern smiling staggering and singing some incoherent song and approached the officers 
 fine fellows said rostov laughing is there any hay here 
 and how like one another said ilyin 
 a sang one of the peasants with a blissful smile 
 one of the men came out of the crowd and went up to rostov 
 who do you belong to he asked 
 the french replied ilyin jestingly and here is napoleon himself and he pointed to lavrushka 
 then you are russians the peasant asked again 
 and is there a large force of you here said another a short man coming up 
 very large answered rostov but why have you collected here he added is it a holiday 
 the old men have met to talk over the business of the commune replied the peasant moving away 
 at that moment on the road leading from the big house two women and a man in a white hat were seen coming toward the officers 
 the one in pink is mine so keep off said ilyin on seeing dunyasha running resolutely toward him 
 be ours said lavrushka to ilyin winking 
 what do you want my pretty said ilyin with a smile 
 the princess ordered me to ask your regiment and your name 
 this is count rostov squadron commander and i am your humble servant 
 roared the tipsy peasant with a beatific smile as he looked at ilyin talking to the girl following dunyasha alpatych advanced to rostov having bared his head while still at a distance 
 may i make bold to trouble your honor said he respectfully but with a shade of contempt for the youthfulness of this officer and with a hand thrust into his bosom my mistress daughter of general in chief prince nicholas bolkonski who died on the fifteenth of this month finding herself in difficulties owing to the boorishness of these people he pointed to the peasants asks you to come up to the house you please ride on a little farther said alpatych with a melancholy smile as it is not convenient in the presence of he pointed to the two peasants who kept as close to him as horseflies to a horse 
 ah alpatych ah yakov alpatych grand forgive us for sake eh said the peasants smiling joyfully at him 
 rostov looked at the tipsy peasants and smiled 
 or perhaps they amuse your honor remarked alpatych with a staid air as he pointed at the old men with his free hand 
 no not much to be amused at here said rostov and rode on a little way the matter he asked 
 i make bold to inform your honor that the rude peasants here wish to let the mistress leave the estate and threaten to unharness her horses so that though everything has been packed up since morning her excellency cannot get away 
 impossible exclaimed rostov 
 i have the honor to report to you the actual truth said alpatych 
 rostov dismounted gave his horse to the orderly and followed alpatych to the house questioning him as to the state of affairs it appeared that the princess offer of corn to the peasants the previous day and her talk with dron and at the meeting had actually had so bad an effect that dron had finally given up the keys and joined the peasants and had not appeared when alpatych sent for him and that in the morning when the princess gave orders to harness for her journey the peasants had come in a large crowd to the barn and sent word that they would not let her leave the village that there was an order not to move and that they would unharness the horses alpatych had gone out to admonish them but was told it was chiefly karp who did the talking dron not showing himself in the crowd that they could not let the princess go that there was an order to the contrary but that if she stayed they would serve her as before and obey her in everything 
 at the moment when rostov and ilyin were galloping along the road princess mary despite the dissuasions of alpatych her nurse and the maids had given orders to harness and intended to start but when the cavalrymen were espied they were taken for frenchmen the coachman ran away and the women in the house began to wail 
 father benefactor god has sent you exclaimed deeply moved voices as rostov passed through the anteroom 
 princess mary was sitting helpless and bewildered in the large sitting room when rostov was shown in she could not grasp who he was and why he had come or what was happening to her when she saw his russian face and by his walk and the first words he uttered recognized him as a man of her own class she glanced at him with her deep radiant look and began speaking in a voice that faltered and trembled with emotion this meeting immediately struck rostov as a romantic event a helpless girl overwhelmed with grief left to the mercy of coarse rioting peasants and what a strange fate sent me here what gentleness and nobility there are in her features and expression thought he as he looked at her and listened to her timid story 
 when she began to tell him that all this had happened the day after her funeral her voiced trembled she turned away and then as if fearing he might take her words as meant to move him to pity looked at him with an apprehensive glance of inquiry there were tears in eyes princess mary noticed this and glanced gratefully at him with that radiant look which caused the plainness of her face to be forgotten 
 i cannot express princess how glad i am that i happened to ride here and am able to show my readiness to serve you said rostov rising go when you please and i give you my word of honor that no one shall dare to cause you annoyance if only you will allow me to act as your escort and bowing respectfully as if to a lady of royal blood he moved toward the door 
 deferential tone seemed to indicate that though he would consider himself happy to be acquainted with her he did not wish to take advantage of her misfortunes to intrude upon her 
 princess mary understood this and appreciated his delicacy 
 i am very very grateful to you she said in french but i hope it was all a misunderstanding and that no one is to blame for it she suddenly began to cry 
 excuse me she said 
 rostov knitting his brows left the room with another low bow

 treasure trove 
 marius had not left the gorbeau house 
 he paid no attention to any one there 
 at that epoch to tell the truth there were no other inhabitants in the house except himself and those jondrettes whose rent he had once paid without moreover ever having spoken to either father mother or daughters 
 the other lodgers had moved away or had died or had been turned out in default of payment 
 one day during that winter the sun had shown itself a little in the afternoon but it was the d of february that ancient candlemas day whose treacherous sun the precursor of a six weeks cold spell inspired mathieu laensberg with these two lines which have with justice remained classic 
 luise ou luiserne 
 rentre dans en sa caverne 
 whether the sun shines brightly or dim the bear returns to his cave 
 marius had just emerged from his 
 night was falling 
 it was the hour for his dinner for he had been obliged to take to dining again alas oh infirmities of ideal passions 
 he had just crossed his threshold where bougon was sweeping at the moment as she uttered this memorable monologue 
 what is there that is cheap now 
 everything is dear 
 there is nothing in the world that is cheap except trouble you can get that for nothing the trouble of the world 
 marius slowly ascended the boulevard towards the barrier in order to reach the rue he was walking along with drooping head 
 all at once he felt some one elbow him in the dusk he wheeled round and saw two young girls clad in rags the one tall and slim the other a little shorter who were passing rapidly all out of breath in terror and with the appearance of fleeing they had been coming to meet him had not seen him and had jostled him as they passed through the twilight marius could distinguish their livid faces their wild heads their dishevelled hair their hideous bonnets their ragged petticoats and their bare feet 
 they were talking as they ran 
 the taller said in a very low voice 
 the bobbies have come 
 they came near nabbing me at the the other answered 
 i saw them 
 i bolted bolted bolted 
 through this repulsive slang marius understood that gendarmes or the police had come near apprehending these two children and that the latter had escaped 
 they plunged among the trees of the boulevard behind him and there created for a few minutes in the gloom a sort of vague white spot then disappeared 
 marius had halted for a moment 
 he was about to pursue his way when his eye lighted on a little grayish package lying on the ground at his feet 
 he stooped and picked it up 
 it was a sort of envelope which appeared to contain papers 
 good he said to himself those unhappy girls dropped it 
 he retraced his steps he called he did not find them he reflected that they must already be far away put the package in his pocket and went off to dine 
 on the way he saw in an alley of the rue mouffetard a coffin covered with a black cloth resting on three chairs and illuminated by a candle 
 the two girls of the twilight recurred to his mind 
 poor mothers he thought 
 there is one thing sadder than to see children die it is to see them leading an evil life 
 then those shadows which had varied his melancholy vanished from his thoughts and he fell back once more into his habitual preoccupations 
 he fell to thinking once more of his six months of love and happiness in the open air and the broad daylight beneath the beautiful trees of luxembourg 
 how gloomy my life has become he said to himself 
 young girls are always appearing to me only formerly they were angels and now they are ghouls

 well is she pretty ah friend my pink one is delicious her name is dunyasha 
 but on glancing at face ilyin stopped short he saw that his hero and commander was following quite a different train of thought 
 rostov glanced angrily at ilyin and without replying strode off with rapid steps to the village 
 show them give it to them the brigands said he to himself 
 alpatych at a gliding trot only just managing not to run kept up with him with difficulty 
 what decision have you been pleased to come to said he 
 rostov stopped and clenching his fists suddenly and sternly turned on alpatych 
 decision what decision old dotard cried he what have you been about eh the peasants are rioting and you manage them a traitor youself i know you flay you all alive and as if afraid of wasting his store of anger he left alpatych and went rapidly forward alpatych mastering his offended feelings kept pace with rostov at a gliding gait and continued to impart his views he said the peasants were obdurate and that at the present moment it would be imprudent to overresist them without an armed force and would it not be better first to send for the military 
 give them armed force overresist them uttered rostov meaninglessly breathless with irrational animal fury and the need to vent it 
 without considering what he would do he moved unconciously with quick resolute steps toward the crowd and the nearer he drew to it the more alpatych felt that this unreasonable action might produce good results the peasants in the crowd were similarly impressed when they saw rapid firm steps and resolute frowning face 
 after the hussars had come to the village and rostov had gone to see the princess a certain confusion and dissension had arisen among the crowd some of the peasants said that these new arrivals were russians and might take it amiss that the mistress was being detained dron was of this opinion but as soon as he expressed it karp and others attacked their 
 how many years have you been fattening on the commune karp shouted at him all one to you dig up your pot of money and take it away with you what does it matter to you whether our homes are ruined or not 
 been told to keep order and that no one is to leave their homes or take away a single grain and all about it cried another 
 it was your turn to be conscripted but no fear you begrudged your lump of a son a little old man suddenly began attacking dron and so they took my vanka to be shaved for a soldier but we all have to die 
 to be sure we all have to die not against the commune said dron 
 it not against it filled your belly 
 the two tall peasants had their say as soon as rostov followed by ilyin lavrushka and alpatych came up to the crowd karp thrusting his fingers into his belt and smiling a little walked to the front dron on the contrary retired to the rear and the crowd drew closer together 
 who is your elder here hey shouted rostov coming up to the crowd with quick steps 
 the elder what do you want with him asked karp 
 but before the words were well out of his mouth his cap flew off and a fierce blow jerked his head to one side 
 caps off traitors shouted rostov in a wrathful voice the elder he cried furiously 
 the elder he wants the elder dron zakharych you meek and flustered voices here and there were heard calling and caps began to come off their heads 
 we riot following the orders declared karp and at that moment several voices began speaking together 
 as the old men have decided too many of you giving orders 
 arguing mutiny brigands traitors cried rostov unmeaningly in a voice not his own gripping karp by the collar bind him bind him he shouted though there was no one to bind him but lavrushka and alpatych 
 lavrushka however ran up to karp and seized him by the arms from behind 
 shall i call up our men from beyond the hill he called out 
 alpatych turned to the peasants and ordered two of them by name to come and bind karp the men obediently came out of the crowd and began taking off their belts 
 the elder demanded rostov in a loud voice 
 with a pale and frowning face dron stepped out of the crowd 
 are you the elder bind him lavrushka shouted rostov as if that order too could not possibly meet with any opposition 
 and in fact two more peasants began binding dron who took off his own belt and handed it to them as if to aid them 
 and you all listen to me said rostov to the peasants be off to your houses at once and let one of your voices be heard 
 why not done any harm we did it just out of foolishness all nonsense i said then that it was not in order voices were heard bickering with one another 
 there what did i say said alpatych coming into his own again wrong lads 
 all our stupidity yakov alpatych came the answers and the crowd began at once to disperse through the village 
 the two bound men were led off to the house the two drunken peasants followed them 
 aye when i look at you said one of them to karp 
 how can one talk to the masters like that what were you thinking of you fool added the other a real fool 
 two hours later the carts were standing in the courtyard of the bogucharovo house the peasants were briskly carrying out the goods and packing them on the carts and dron liberated at princess wish from the cupboard where he had been confined was standing in the yard directing the men 
 put it in so carelessly said one of the peasants a man with a round smiling face taking a casket from a housemaid you know it has cost money how can you chuck it in like that or shove it under the cord where get rubbed i like that way of doing things let it all be done properly according to rule look here put it under the bast matting and cover it with hay the way 
 eh books books said another peasant bringing out prince library cupboards catch up against it heavy lads solid books 
 yes they worked all day and play remarked the tall peasant gravely pointing with a significant wink at the dictionaries that were on the top 
 unwilling to obtrude himself on the princess rostov did not go back to the house but remained in the village awaiting her departure when her carriage drove out of the house he mounted and accompanied her eight miles from bogucharovo to where the road was occupied by our troops at the inn at yankovo he respectfully took leave of her for the first time permitting himself to kiss her hand 
 how can you speak so he blushingly replied to princess expressions of gratitude for her deliverance as she termed what had occurred any police officer would have done as much if we had had only peasants to fight we should not have let the enemy come so far said he with a sense of shame and wishing to change the subject i am only happy to have had the opportunity of making your acquaintance princess i wish you happiness and consolation and hope to meet you again in happier circumstances if you want to make me blush please thank me 
 but the princess if she did not again thank him in words thanked him with the whole expression of her face radiant with gratitude and tenderness she could not believe that there was nothing to thank him for on the contrary it seemed to her certain that had he not been there she would have perished at the hands of the mutineers and of the french and that he had exposed himself to terrible and obvious danger to save her and even more certain was it that he was a man of lofty and noble soul able to understand her position and her sorrow his kind honest eyes with the tears rising in them when she herself had begun to cry as she spoke of her loss did leave her memory 
 when she had taken leave of him and remained alone she suddenly felt her eyes filling with tears and then not for the first time the strange question presented itself to her did she love him 
 on the rest of the way to moscow though the princess position was not a cheerful one dunyasha who went with her in the carriage more than once noticed that her mistress leaned out of the window and smiled at something with an expression of mingled joy and sorrow 
 well supposing i do love him thought princess mary 
 ashamed as she was of acknowledging to herself that she had fallen in love with a man who would perhaps never love her she comforted herself with the thought that no one would ever know it and that she would not be to blame if without ever speaking of it to anyone she continued to the end of her life to love the man with whom she had fallen in love for the first and last time in her life 
 sometimes when she recalled his looks his sympathy and his words happiness did not appear impossible to her it was at those moments that dunyasha noticed her smiling as she looked out of the carriage window 
 was it not fate that brought him to bogucharovo and at that very moment thought princess mary and that caused his sister to refuse my brother and in all this princess mary saw the hand of providence 
 the impression the princess made on rostov was a very agreeable one to remember her gave him pleasure and when his comrades hearing of his adventure at bogucharovo rallied him on having gone to look for hay and having picked up one of the wealthiest heiresses in russia he grew angry it made him angry just because the idea of marrying the gentle princess mary who was attractive to him and had an enormous fortune had against his will more than once entered his head for himself personally nicholas could not wish for a better wife by marrying her he would make the countess his mother happy would be able to put his affairs in order and would even he felt it ensure princess happiness 
 but sonya and his plighted word that was why rostov grew angry when he was rallied about princess bolkonskaya

 book wicked poor man 
 chapter iii 
 
 quadrifrons 
 that evening as he was undressing preparatory to going to bed his hand came in contact in the pocket of his coat with the packet which he had picked up on the boulevard 
 he had forgotten it he thought that it would be well to open it and that this package might possibly contain the address of the young girls if it really belonged to them and in any case the information necessary to a restitution to the person who had lost it 
 he opened the envelope 
 it was not sealed and contained four letters also unsealed 
 they bore addresses 
 all four exhaled a horrible odor of tobacco 
 the first was addressed 
 to madame madame la marquise de grucheray the place opposite the chamber of deputies no 
 marius said to himself that he should probably find in it the information which he sought and that moreover the letter being open it was probable that it could be read without impropriety 
 it was conceived as follows 
 madame la marquise 
 the virtue of clemency and piety is that which most closely unites sosiety 
 turn your christian spirit and cast a look of compassion on this unfortunate spanish victim of loyalty and attachment to the sacred cause of legitimacy who has given with his blood consecrated his fortune evverything to defend that cause and finds himself in the greatest missery he doubts not that your honorable person will grant succor to preserve an existence exteremely painful for a military man of education and honor full of wounds counts in advance on the humanity which animates you and on the interest which madame la marquise bears to a nation so unfortunate 
 their prayer will not be in vain and their gratitude will preserve theirs charming souvenir 
 my respectful sentiments with which i have the honor to be 
 madame 
 don alvares spanish captain 
 of cavalry a royalist who 
 has take refuge in france 
 who finds himself on travells 
 for his country and the 
 resources are lacking him to 
 continue his travells 
 no address was joined to the signature 
 marius hoped to find the address in the second letter whose superscription read a madame madame la comtesse de montvernet rue cassette no this is what marius read in it 
 madame la comtesse 
 it is an unhappy mother of a family of six children the last of which is only eight months old 
 i sick since my last confinement abandoned by my husband five months ago haveing no resources in the world the most frightful indigance 
 in the hope of madame la comtesse she has the honor to be madame with profound respect 
 mistress balizard 
 marius turned to the third letter which was a petition like the preceding he read 
 monsieur pabourgeot elector wholesale stocking merchant 
 rue on the corner of the rue aux fers 
 i permit myself to address you this letter to beg you to grant me the pretious favor of your simpaties and to interest yourself in a man of letters who has just sent a drama to the the subject is historical and the action takes place in auvergne in the time of the empire the style i think is natural laconic and may have some merit 
 there are couplets to be sung in four places 
 the comic the serious the unexpected are mingled in a variety of characters and a tinge of romanticism lightly spread through all the intrigue which proceeds misteriously and ends after striking altarations in the midst of many beautiful strokes of brilliant scenes 
 my principal object is to satisfi the desire which progressively animates the man of our century that is to say the fashion that capritious and bizarre weathervane which changes at almost every new wind 
 in spite of these qualities i have reason to fear that jealousy the egotism of priviliged authors may obtaine my exclusion from the theatre for i am not ignorant of the mortifications with which are treated 
 monsiuer pabourgeot your just reputation as an enlightened protector of men of litters emboldens me to send you my daughter who will explain our indigant situation to you lacking bread and fire in this wynter season 
 when i say to you that i beg you to accept the dedication of my drama which i desire to make to you and of all those that i shall make is to prove to you how great is my ambition to have the honor of sheltering myself under your protection and of adorning my writings with your name 
 if you deign to honor me with the most modest offering i shall immediately occupy myself in making a piesse of verse to pay you my tribute of gratitude which i shall endeavor to render this piesse as perfect as possible will be sent to you before it is inserted at the beginning of the drama and delivered on the stage 
 to monsieur 
 and madame pabourgeot 
 my most respectful complements 
 genflot man of letters 
 p s even if it is only forty sous 
 excuse me for sending my daughter and not presenting myself but sad motives connected with the toilet do not permit me alas to go out 
 finally marius opened the fourth letter 
 the address ran to the benevolent gentleman of the church of it contained the following lines 
 benevolent man 
 if you deign to accompany my daughter you will behold a misserable calamity and i will show you my certificates 
 at the aspect of these writings your generous soul will be moved with a sentiment of obvious benevolence for true philosophers always feel lively emotions 
 admit compassionate man that it is necessary to suffer the most cruel need and that it is very painful for the sake of obtaining a little relief to get oneself attested by the authorities as though one were not free to suffer and to die of inanition while waiting to have our misery relieved 
 destinies are very fatal for several and too prodigal or too protecting for others 
 i await your presence or your offering if you deign to make one and i beseech you to accept the respectful sentiments with which i have the honor to be truly magnanimous man your very humble and very obedient servant p fabantou dramatic artist 
 after perusing these four letters marius did not find himself much further advanced than before 
 in the first place not one of the signers gave his address 
 then they seemed to come from four different individuals don alveras mistress balizard the poet genflot and dramatic artist fabantou but the singular thing about these letters was that all four were written by the same hand 
 what conclusion was to be drawn from this except that they all come from the same person 
 moreover and this rendered the conjecture all the more probable the coarse and yellow paper was the same in all four the odor of tobacco was the same and although an attempt had been made to vary the style the same orthographical faults were reproduced with the greatest tranquillity and the man of letters genflot was no more exempt from them than the spanish captain 
 it was waste of trouble to try to solve this petty mystery 
 had it not been a chance find it would have borne the air of a mystification marius was too melancholy to take even a chance pleasantry well and to lend himself to a game which the pavement of the street seemed desirous of playing with him 
 it seemed to him that he was playing the part of the blind man in blind buff between the four letters and that they were making sport of him 
 nothing however indicated that these letters belonged to the two young girls whom marius had met on the boulevard 
 after all they were evidently papers of no value 
 marius replaced them in their envelope flung the whole into a corner and went to bed about seven in the morning he had just risen and breakfasted and was trying to settle down to work when there came a soft knock at his door 
 as he owned nothing he never locked his door unless occasionally though very rarely when he was engaged in some pressing work even when absent he left his key in the lock 
 you will be robbed said bougon 
 of what said marius 
 the truth is however that he had one day been robbed of an old pair of boots to the great triumph of bougon 
 there came a second knock as gentle as the first 
 come in said marius 
 the door opened 
 what do you want bougon asked marius without raising his eyes from the books and manuscripts on his table 
 a voice which did not belong to bougon replied 
 excuse me sir 
 it was a dull broken hoarse strangled voice the voice of an old man roughened with brandy and liquor 
 marius turned round hastily and beheld a young girl

 book ten 
 chapter xv 
 
 on receiving command of the armies kutuzov remembered prince andrew and sent an order for him to report at headquarters 
 prince andrew arrived at on the very day and at the very hour that kutuzov was reviewing the troops for the first time he stopped in the village at the house in front of which stood the commander in carriage and he sat down on the bench at the gate awaiting his serene highness as everyone now called kutuzov from the field beyond the village came now sounds of regimental music and now the roar of many voices shouting hurrah to the new commander in chief two orderlies a courier and a stood near by some ten paces from prince andrew availing themselves of absence and of the fine weather a short swarthy lieutenant colonel of hussars with thick mustaches and whiskers rode up to the gate and glancing at prince andrew inquired whether his serene highness was putting up there and whether he would soon be back 
 prince andrew replied that he was not on his serene highness staff but was himself a new arrival the lieutenant colonel turned to a smart orderly who with the peculiar contempt with which a commander in orderly speaks to officers replied 
 what his serene highness i expect be here soon what do you want 
 the lieutenant colonel of hussars smiled beneath his mustache at the tone dismounted gave his horse to a dispatch runner and approached bolkonski with a slight bow bolkonski made room for him on the bench and the lieutenant colonel sat down beside him 
 also waiting for the commander in chief said he they say he weceives evewyone thank god awful with those sausage eaters ermolov had weason to ask to be pwomoted to be a german now wussians will get a look in as it was devil only knows what was happening we kept wetweating and wetweating did you take part in the campaign he asked 
 i had the pleasure replied prince andrew not only of taking part in the retreat but of losing in that retreat all i held dear not to mention the estate and home of my birth my father who died of grief i belong to the province of smolensk 
 ah pwince bolkonski vewy glad to make your acquaintance lieutenant colonel denisov better known as vaska said denisov pressing prince hand and looking into his face with a particularly kindly attention yes i heard said he sympathetically and after a short pause added yes scythian warfare all vewy well only not for those who get it in the neck so you are pwince andwew bolkonski he swayed his head vewy pleased pwince to make your acquaintance he repeated again smiling sadly and he again pressed prince hand 
 prince andrew knew denisov from what natasha had told him of her first suitor this memory carried him sadly and sweetly back to those painful feelings of which he had not thought lately but which still found place in his soul of late he had received so many new and very serious impressions such as the retreat from smolensk his visit to bald hills and the recent news of his death and had experienced so many emotions that for a long time past those memories had not entered his mind and now that they did they did not act on him with nearly their former strength for denisov too the memories awakened by the name of bolkonski belonged to a distant romantic past when after supper and after singing he had proposed to a little girl of fifteen without realizing what he was doing he smiled at the recollection of that time and of his love for natasha and passed at once to what now interested him passionately and exclusively this was a plan of campaign he had devised while serving at the outposts during the retreat he had proposed that plan to barclay de tolly and now wished to propose it to kutuzov the plan was based on the fact that the french line of operation was to extended and it proposed that instead of or concurrently with action on the front to bar the advance of the french we should attack their line of communication he began explaining his plan to prince andrew 
 they hold all that line impossible i will undertake to bweak thwough give me five hundwed men and i will bweak the line certain only one way guewilla warfare 
 denisov rose and began gesticulating as he explained his plan to bolkonski in the midst of his explanation shouts were heard from the army growing more incoherent and more diffused mingling with music and songs and coming from the field where the review was held sounds of hoofs and shouts were nearing the village 
 coming coming shouted a cossack standing at the gate 
 bolkonski and denisov moved to the gate at which a knot of soldiers a guard of honor was standing and they saw kutuzov coming down the street mounted on a rather small sorrel horse a huge suite of generals rode behind him barclay was riding almost beside him and a crowd of officers ran after and around them shouting hurrah 
 his adjutants galloped into the yard before him kutuzov was impatiently urging on his horse which ambled smoothly under his weight and he raised his hand to his white horse cap with a red band and no peak nodding his head continually when he came up to the guard of honor a fine set of grenadiers mostly wearing decorations who were giving him the salute he looked at them silently and attentively for nearly a minute with the steady gaze of a commander and then turned to the crowd of generals and officers surrounding him suddenly his face assumed a subtle expression he shrugged his shoulders with an air of perplexity 
 and with such fine fellows to retreat and retreat well general he added and rode into the yard past prince andrew and denisov 
 hurrah hurrah hurrah shouted those behind him 
 since prince andrew had last seen him kutuzov had grown still more corpulent flaccid and fat but the bleached eyeball the scar and the familiar weariness of his expression were still the same he was wearing the white horse cap and a military overcoat with a whip hanging over his shoulder by a thin strap he sat heavily and swayed limply on his brisk little horse 
 whew whew whew he whistled just audibly as he rode into the yard his face expressed the relief of relaxed strain felt by a man who means to rest after a ceremony he drew his left foot out of the stirrup and lurching with his whole body and puckering his face with the effort raised it with difficulty onto the saddle leaned on his knee groaned and slipped down into the arms of the cossacks and adjutants who stood ready to assist him 
 he pulled himself together looked round screwing up his eyes glanced at prince andrew and evidently not recognizing him moved with his waddling gait to the porch whew whew whew he whistled and again glanced at prince andrew as often occurs with old men it was only after some seconds that the impression produced by prince face linked itself up with remembrance of his personality 
 ah how do you do my dear prince how do you do my dear boy come along said he glancing wearily round and he stepped onto the porch which creaked under his weight 
 he unbuttoned his coat and sat down on a bench in the porch 
 and your father 
 i received news of his death yesterday replied prince andrew abruptly 
 kutuzov looked at him with eyes wide open with dismay and then took off his cap and crossed himself 
 may the kingdom of heaven be his will be done to us all he sighed deeply his whole chest heaving and was silent for a while i loved him and respected him and sympathize with you with all my heart 
 he embraced prince andrew pressing him to his fat breast and for some time did not let him go when he released him prince andrew saw that flabby lips were trembling and that tears were in his eyes he sighed and pressed on the bench with both hands to raise himself 
 come come with me have a talk said he 
 but at that moment denisov no more intimidated by his superiors than by the enemy came with jingling spurs up the steps of the porch despite the angry whispers of the adjutants who tried to stop him kutuzov his hands still pressed on the seat glanced at him glumly denisov having given his name announced that he had to communicate to his serene highness a matter of great importance for their welfare kutuzov looked wearily at him and lifting his hands with a gesture of annoyance folded them across his stomach repeating the words for our welfare well what is it speak denisov blushed like a girl it was strange to see the color rise in that shaggy bibulous face and boldly began to expound his plan of cutting the lines of communication between smolensk and vyazma denisov came from those parts and knew the country well his plan seemed decidedly a good one especially from the strength of conviction with which he spoke kutuzov looked down at his own legs occasionally glancing at the door of the adjoining hut as if expecting something unpleasant to emerge from it and from that hut while denisov was speaking a general with a portfolio under his arm really did appear 
 what said kutuzov in the midst of explanations are you ready so soon 
 ready your serene highness replied the general 
 kutuzov swayed his head as much as to say how is one man to deal with it all and again listened to denisov 
 i give my word of honor as a wussian officer said denisov that i can bweak line of communication 
 what relation are you to intendant general kiril andreevich denisov asked kutuzov interrupting him 
 he is my uncle your sewene highness 
 ah we were friends said kutuzov cheerfully all right all right friend stay here at the staff and tomorrow have a talk 
 with a nod to denisov he turned away and put out his hand for the papers konovnitsyn had brought him 
 would not your serene highness like to come inside said the general on duty in a discontented voice the plans must be examined and several papers have to be signed 
 an adjutant came out and announced that everything was in readiness within but kutuzov evidently did not wish to enter that room till he was disengaged he made a grimace 
 no tell them to bring a small table out here my dear boy look at them here said he go away he added turning to prince andrew who remained in the porch and listened to the report 
 while this was being given prince andrew heard the whisper of a voice and the rustle of a silk dress behind the door several times on glancing that way he noticed behind that door a plump rosy handsome woman in a pink dress with a lilac silk kerchief on her head holding a dish and evidently awaiting the entrance of the commander in chief adjutant whispered to prince andrew that this was the wife of the priest whose home it was and that she intended to offer his serene highness bread and salt her husband has welcomed his serene highness with the cross at the church and she intends to welcome him in the house very pretty added the adjutant with a smile at those words kutuzov looked round he was listening to the report which consisted chiefly of a criticism of the position at as he had listened to denisov and seven years previously had listened to the discussion at the austerlitz council of war he evidently listened only because he had ears which though there was a piece of tow in one of them could not help hearing but it was evident that nothing the general could say would surprise or even interest him that he knew all that would be said beforehand and heard it all only because he had to as one has to listen to the chanting of a service of prayer all that denisov had said was clever and to the point what the general was saying was even more clever and to the point but it was evident that kutuzov despised knowledge and cleverness and knew of something else that would decide the matter something independent of clever ness and knowledge prince andrew watched the commander in face attentively and the only expression he could see there was one of boredom curiosity as to the meaning of the feminine whispering behind the door and a desire to observe propriety it was evident that kutuzov despised cleverness and learning and even the patriotic feeling shown by denisov but despised them not because of his own intellect feelings or knowledge he did not try to display any of these but because of something else he despised them because of his old age and experience of life the only instruction kutuzov gave of his own accord during that report referred to looting by the russian troops at the end of the report the general put before him for signature a paper relating to the recovery of payment from army commanders for green oats mown down by the soldiers when landowners lodged petitions for compensation 
 after hearing the matter kutuzov smacked his lips together and shook his head 
 into the stove into the fire with it i tell you once for all my dear fellow said he into the fire with all such things let them cut the crops and burn wood to their hearts content i order it or allow it but i exact compensation either one get on without it when wood is chopped the chips will fly he looked at the paper again oh this german precision he muttered shaking his head

 book wicked poor man 
 chapter iv 
 
 a rose in misery 
 a very young girl was standing in the door 
 the dormer window of the garret through which the light fell was precisely opposite the door and illuminated the figure with a wan light she was a frail emaciated slender creature there was nothing but a chemise and a petticoat upon that chilled and shivering nakedness her girdle was a string her head ribbon a string her pointed shoulders emerged from her chemise a blond and lymphatic pallor red hands a and degraded mouth missing teeth dull bold base eyes she had the form of a young girl who has missed her youth and the look of a corrupt old woman fifty years mingled with fifteen one of those beings which are both feeble and horrible and which cause those to shudder whom they do not cause to weep 
 marius had risen and was staring in a sort of stupor at this being who was almost like the forms of the shadows which traverse dreams 
 the most thing of all was that this young girl had not come into the world to be homely 
 in her early childhood she must even have been pretty 
 the grace of her age was still struggling against the hideous premature decrepitude of debauchery and poverty the remains of beauty were dying away in that face of sixteen like the pale sunlight which is extinguished under hideous clouds at dawn on a day 
 that face was not wholly unknown to marius 
 he thought he remembered having seen it somewhere 
 what do you wish mademoiselle he asked 
 the young girl replied in her voice of a drunken convict 
 here is a letter for you monsieur marius 
 she called marius by his name he could not doubt that he was the person whom she wanted but who was this girl 
 how did she know his name 
 without waiting for him to tell her to advance she entered she entered resolutely staring with a sort of assurance that made the heart bleed at the whole room and the unmade bed 
 her feet were bare 
 large holes in her petticoat permitted glimpses of her long legs and her thin knees 
 she was shivering 
 she held a letter in her hand which she presented to marius 
 marius as he opened the letter noticed that the enormous wafer which sealed it was still moist 
 the message could not have come from a distance 
 he read 
 my amiable neighbor young man 
 i have learned of your goodness to me that you paid my rent six months ago 
 i bless you young man my eldest daughter will tell you that we have been without a morsel of bread for two days four persons and my spouse ill 
 if i am not deseaved in my opinion i think i may hope that your generous heart will melt at this statement and the desire will subjugate you to be propitious to me by daigning to lavish on me a slight favor 
 i am with the distinguished consideration which is due to the benefactors of humanity 
 jondrette 
 my eldest daughter will await your orders dear monsieur marius 
 this letter coming in the very midst of the mysterious adventure which had occupied marius thoughts ever since the preceding evening was like a candle in a cellar 
 all was suddenly illuminated 
 this letter came from the same place as the other four there was the same writing the same style the same orthography the same paper the same odor of tobacco 
 there were five missives five histories five signatures and a single signer 
 the spanish captain don alvares the unhappy mistress balizard the dramatic poet genflot the old comedian fabantou were all four named jondrette if indeed jondrette himself were named jondrette 
 marius had lived in the house for a tolerably long time and he had had as we have said but very rare occasion to see to even catch a glimpse of his extremely mean neighbors 
 his mind was elsewhere and where the mind is there the eyes are also he had been obliged more than once to pass the jondrettes in the corridor or on the stairs but they were mere forms to him he had paid so little heed to them that on the preceding evening he had jostled the jondrette girls on the boulevard without recognizing them for it had evidently been they and it was with great difficulty that the one who had just entered his room had awakened in him in spite of disgust and pity a vague recollection of having met her elsewhere 
 now he saw everything clearly 
 he understood that his neighbor jondrette in his distress exercised the industry of speculating on the charity of benevolent persons that he procured addresses and that he wrote under feigned names to people whom he judged to be wealthy and compassionate letters which his daughters delivered at their risk and peril for this father had come to such a pass that he risked his daughters he was playing a game with fate and he used them as the stake 
 marius understood that probably judging from their flight on the evening before from their breathless condition from their terror and from the words of slang which he had overheard these unfortunate creatures were plying some inexplicably sad profession and that the result of the whole was in the midst of human society as it is now constituted two miserable beings who were neither girls nor women a species of impure and innocent monsters produced by misery 
 sad creatures without name or sex or age to whom neither good nor evil were any longer possible and who on emerging from childhood have already nothing in this world neither liberty nor virtue nor responsibility 
 souls which blossomed out yesterday and are faded like those flowers let fall in the streets which are soiled with every sort of mire while waiting for some wheel to crush them nevertheless while marius bent a pained and astonished gaze on her the young girl was wandering back and forth in the garret with the audacity of a spectre 
 she kicked about without troubling herself as to her nakedness 
 occasionally her chemise which was untied and torn fell almost to her waist 
 she moved the chairs about she disarranged the toilet articles which stood on the commode she handled marius clothes she rummaged about to see what there was in the corners 
 hullo said she you have a mirror 
 and she hummed scraps of vaudevilles as though she had been alone frolicsome refrains which her hoarse and guttural voice rendered lugubrious 
 an indescribable constraint weariness and humiliation were perceptible beneath this hardihood 
 effrontery is a disgrace 
 nothing could be more melancholy than to see her sport about the room and so to speak flit with the movements of a bird which is frightened by the daylight or which has broken its wing one felt that under other conditions of education and destiny the gay and mien of this young girl might have turned out sweet and charming 
 never even among animals does the creature born to be a dove change into an osprey 
 that is only to be seen among men 
 marius reflected and allowed her to have her way 
 she approached the table 
 ah said she books 
 a flash pierced her glassy eye 
 she resumed and her accent expressed the happiness which she felt in boasting of something to which no human creature is insensible 
 i know how to read i do 
 she eagerly seized a book which lay open on the table and read with tolerable fluency 
 general bauduin received orders to take the chateau of hougomont which stands in the middle of the plain of waterloo with five battalions of his brigade 
 she paused 
 ah 
 waterloo 
 i know about that 
 it was a battle long ago my father was there 
 my father has served in the armies 
 we are fine bonapartists in our house that we are 
 waterloo was against the english 
 she laid down the book caught up a pen and exclaimed 
 and i know how to write too 
 she dipped her pen in the ink and turning to marius 
 do you want to see 
 look here going to write a word to show you 
 and before he had time to answer she wrote on a sheet of white paper which lay in the middle of the table 
 the bobbies are here 
 then throwing down the pen 
 there are no faults of orthography 
 you can look 
 we have received an education my sister and i we have not always been as we are now we were not made 
 here she paused fixed her dull eyes on marius and burst out laughing saying with an intonation which contained every form of anguish stifled by every form of cynicism 
 bah 
 and she began to hum these words to a gay faim mon pere 
 i am hungry father 
 pas de fricot i have no food 
 froid ma mere 
 i am cold mother 
 pas de tricot i have no clothes 
 grelotte 
 lolotte lolotte 
 shiver sanglote 
 sob jacquot 
 jacquot 
 she had hardly finished this couplet when she exexclaimed 
 do you ever go to the play monsieur marius 
 i do 
 i have a little brother who is a friend of the artists and who gives me tickets sometimes 
 but i like the benches in the galleries one is cramped and uncomfortable there 
 there are rough people there sometimes and people who smell bad 
 then she scrutinized marius assumed a singular air and said 
 do you know mr marius that you are a very handsome fellow 
 and at the same moment the same idea occurred to them both and made her smile and him blush 
 she stepped up to him and laid her hand on his shoulder 
 you pay no heed to me but i know you mr marius 
 i meet you here on the staircase and then i often see you going to a person named father mabeuf who lives in the direction of austerlitz sometimes when i have been strolling in that quarter it is very becoming to you to have your hair tumbled thus 
 she tried to render her voice soft but only succeeded in making it very deep 
 a portion of her words was lost in the transit from her larynx to her lips as though on a piano where some notes are missing 
 marius had retreated gently 
 mademoiselle said he with his cool gravity i have here a package which belongs to you i think 
 permit me to return it to you 
 and he held out the envelope containing the four letters 
 she clapped her hands and exclaimed 
 we have been looking everywhere for that 
 then she eagerly seized the package and opened the envelope saying as she did so 
 dieu de dieu how my sister and i have hunted 
 and it was you who found it 
 on the boulevard was it not 
 it must have been on the boulevard 
 you see we let it fall when we were running it was that brat of a sister of mine who was so stupid 
 when we got home we could not find it anywhere 
 as we did not wish to be beaten as that is useless as that is entirely useless as that is absolutely useless we said that we had carried the letters to the proper persons and that they had said to us nix so here they are those poor letters 
 and how did you find out that they belonged to me 
 ah yes the writing 
 so it was you that we jostled as we passed last night 
 we see i said to my sister 
 is it a gentleman 
 my sister said to me i think it is a gentleman 
 in the meanwhile she had unfolded the petition addressed to the benevolent gentleman of the church of 
 here said she this is for that old fellow who goes to mass by the way this is his hour 
 go and carry it to him perhaps he will give us something to breakfast on 
 then she began to laugh again and added 
 do you know what it will mean if we get a breakfast today it will mean that we shall have had our breakfast of the day before yesterday our breakfast of yesterday our dinner of and all that at once and this morning 
 come 
 parbleu if you are not satisfied dogs burst 
 this reminded marius of the wretched errand to himself he fumbled in his waistcoat pocket and found nothing there 
 the young girl went on and seemed to have no consciousness of marius presence 
 i often go off in the evening 
 sometimes i come home again last winter before we came here we lived under the arches of the bridges 
 we huddled together to keep from freezing my little sister cried 
 how melancholy the water is 
 when i thought of drowning myself i said to myself 
 no too cold i go out alone whenever i choose i sometimes sleep in the ditches do you know at night when i walk along the boulevard i see the trees like forks i see houses all black and as big as notre dame i fancy that the white walls are the river i say to myself 
 why water there 
 the stars are like the lamps in illuminations one would say that they smoked and that the wind blew them out i am bewildered as though horses were breathing in my ears although it is night i hear and and i know what all 
 i think people are flinging stones at me i flee without knowing whither everything whirls and whirls you feel very queer when you have had no food 
 and then she stared at him with a bewildered air 
 by dint of searching and ransacking his pockets marius had finally collected five francs sixteen sous 
 this was all he owned in the world for the moment 
 at all events he thought there is my dinner for and we will see 
 he kept the sixteen sous and handed the five francs to the young girl 
 she seized the coin 
 good said she the sun is shining 
 and as though the sun had possessed the property of melting the avalanches of slang in her brain she went on 
 five francs the shiner a monarch in this hole 
 this fine a jolly thief 
 your humble servant 
 bravo for the good fellows 
 two days wine and meat and stew have a royal feast and a good fill 
 she pulled her chemise up on her shoulders made a low bow to marius then a familiar sign with her hand and went towards the door saying 
 good morning sir 
 all right 
 go and find my old man 
 as she passed she caught sight of a dry crust of bread on the commode which was moulding there amid the dust she flung herself upon it and bit into it muttering 
 good hard it breaks my teeth 
 then she departed 
 a rose in misery 
 a very young girl was standing in the door 
 the dormer window of the garret through which the light fell was precisely opposite the door and illuminated the figure with a wan light she was a frail emaciated slender creature there was nothing but a chemise and a petticoat upon that chilled and shivering nakedness her girdle was a string her head ribbon a string her pointed shoulders emerged from her chemise a blond and lymphatic pallor red hands a and degraded mouth missing teeth dull bold base eyes she had the form of a young girl who has missed her youth and the look of a corrupt old woman fifty years mingled with fifteen one of those beings which are both feeble and horrible and which cause those to shudder whom they do not cause to weep 
 marius had risen and was staring in a sort of stupor at this being who was almost like the forms of the shadows which traverse dreams 
 the most thing of all was that this young girl had not come into the world to be homely 
 in her early childhood she must even have been pretty 
 the grace of her age was still struggling against the hideous premature decrepitude of debauchery and poverty the remains of beauty were dying away in that face of sixteen like the pale sunlight which is extinguished under hideous clouds at dawn on a day 
 that face was not wholly unknown to marius 
 he thought he remembered having seen it somewhere 
 what do you wish mademoiselle he asked 
 the young girl replied in her voice of a drunken convict 
 here is a letter for you monsieur marius 
 she called marius by his name he could not doubt that he was the person whom she wanted but who was this girl 
 how did she know his name 
 without waiting for him to tell her to advance she entered she entered resolutely staring with a sort of assurance that made the heart bleed at the whole room and the unmade bed 
 her feet were bare 
 large holes in her petticoat permitted glimpses of her long legs and her thin knees 
 she was shivering 
 she held a letter in her hand which she presented to marius 
 marius as he opened the letter noticed that the enormous wafer which sealed it was still moist 
 the message could not have come from a distance 
 he read 
 my amiable neighbor young man 
 i have learned of your goodness to me that you paid my rent six months ago 
 i bless you young man my eldest daughter will tell you that we have been without a morsel of bread for two days four persons and my spouse ill 
 if i am not deseaved in my opinion i think i may hope that your generous heart will melt at this statement and the desire will subjugate you to be propitious to me by daigning to lavish on me a slight favor 
 i am with the distinguished consideration which is due to the benefactors of humanity 
 jondrette 
 my eldest daughter will await your orders dear monsieur marius 
 this letter coming in the very midst of the mysterious adventure which had occupied marius thoughts ever since the preceding evening was like a candle in a cellar 
 all was suddenly illuminated 
 this letter came from the same place as the other four there was the same writing the same style the same orthography the same paper the same odor of tobacco 
 there were five missives five histories five signatures and a single signer 
 the spanish captain don alvares the unhappy mistress balizard the dramatic poet genflot the old comedian fabantou were all four named jondrette if indeed jondrette himself were named jondrette 
 marius had lived in the house for a tolerably long time and he had had as we have said but very rare occasion to see to even catch a glimpse of his extremely mean neighbors 
 his mind was elsewhere and where the mind is there the eyes are also he had been obliged more than once to pass the jondrettes in the corridor or on the stairs but they were mere forms to him he had paid so little heed to them that on the preceding evening he had jostled the jondrette girls on the boulevard without recognizing them for it had evidently been they and it was with great difficulty that the one who had just entered his room had awakened in him in spite of disgust and pity a vague recollection of having met her elsewhere 
 now he saw everything clearly 
 he understood that his neighbor jondrette in his distress exercised the industry of speculating on the charity of benevolent persons that he procured addresses and that he wrote under feigned names to people whom he judged to be wealthy and compassionate letters which his daughters delivered at their risk and peril for this father had come to such a pass that he risked his daughters he was playing a game with fate and he used them as the stake 
 marius understood that probably judging from their flight on the evening before from their breathless condition from their terror and from the words of slang which he had overheard these unfortunate creatures were plying some inexplicably sad profession and that the result of the whole was in the midst of human society as it is now constituted two miserable beings who were neither girls nor women a species of impure and innocent monsters produced by misery 
 sad creatures without name or sex or age to whom neither good nor evil were any longer possible and who on emerging from childhood have already nothing in this world neither liberty nor virtue nor responsibility 
 souls which blossomed out yesterday and are faded like those flowers let fall in the streets which are soiled with every sort of mire while waiting for some wheel to crush them nevertheless while marius bent a pained and astonished gaze on her the young girl was wandering back and forth in the garret with the audacity of a spectre 
 she kicked about without troubling herself as to her nakedness 
 occasionally her chemise which was untied and torn fell almost to her waist 
 she moved the chairs about she disarranged the toilet articles which stood on the commode she handled marius clothes she rummaged about to see what there was in the corners 
 hullo said she you have a mirror 
 and she hummed scraps of vaudevilles as though she had been alone frolicsome refrains which her hoarse and guttural voice rendered lugubrious 
 an indescribable constraint weariness and humiliation were perceptible beneath this hardihood 
 effrontery is a disgrace 
 nothing could be more melancholy than to see her sport about the room and so to speak flit with the movements of a bird which is frightened by the daylight or which has broken its wing one felt that under other conditions of education and destiny the gay and mien of this young girl might have turned out sweet and charming 
 never even among animals does the creature born to be a dove change into an osprey 
 that is only to be seen among men 
 marius reflected and allowed her to have her way 
 she approached the table 
 ah said she books 
 a flash pierced her glassy eye 
 she resumed and her accent expressed the happiness which she felt in boasting of something to which no human creature is insensible 
 i know how to read i do 
 she eagerly seized a book which lay open on the table and read with tolerable fluency 
 general bauduin received orders to take the chateau of hougomont which stands in the middle of the plain of waterloo with five battalions of his brigade 
 she paused 
 ah

 well all said kutuzov as he signed the last of the documents and rising heavily and smoothing out the folds in his fat white neck he moved toward the door with a more cheerful expression 
 the wife flushing rosy red caught up the dish she had after all not managed to present at the right moment though she had so long been preparing for it and with a low bow offered it to kutuzov 
 he screwed up his eyes smiled lifted her chin with his hand and said 
 ah what a beauty thank you sweetheart 
 he took some gold pieces from his trouser pocket and put them on the dish for her well my dear and how are we getting on he asked moving to the door of the room assigned to him the wife smiled and with dimples in her rosy cheeks followed him into the room the adjutant came out to the porch and asked prince andrew to lunch with him half an hour later prince andrew was again called to kutuzov he found him reclining in an armchair still in the same unbuttoned overcoat he had in his hand a french book which he closed as prince andrew entered marking the place with a knife prince andrew saw by the cover that it was les chevaliers du cygne by madame de genlis 
 well sit down sit down here have a talk said kutuzov sad very sad but remember my dear fellow that i am a father to you a second father 
 prince andrew told kutuzov all he knew of his death and what he had seen at bald hills when he passed through it 
 what what they have brought us to kutuzov suddenly cried in an agitated voice evidently picturing vividly to himself from prince story the condition russia was in but give me time give me time he said with a grim look evidently not wishing to continue this agitating conversation and added i sent for you to keep you with me 
 i thank your serene highness but i fear i am longer fit for the staff replied prince andrew with a smile which kutuzov noticed 
 kutuzov glanced inquiringly at him 
 but above all added prince andrew i have grown used to my regiment am fond of the officers and i fancy the men also like me i should be sorry to leave the regiment if i decline the honor of being with you believe me 
 a shrewd kindly yet subtly derisive expression lit up podgy face he cut bolkonski short 
 i am sorry for i need you but right right not here that men are needed advisers are always plentiful but men are not the regiments would not be what they are if the advisers served there as you do i remember you at austerlitz i remember yes i remember you with the standard said kutuzov and a flush of pleasure suffused prince face at this recollection 
 taking his hand and drawing him downwards kutuzov offered his cheek to be kissed and again prince andrew noticed tears in the old eyes though prince andrew knew that tears came easily and that he was particularly tender to and considerate of him from a wish to show sympathy with his loss yet this reminder of austerlitz was both pleasant and flattering to him 
 go your way and god be with you i know your path is the path of honor he paused i missed you at bucharest but i needed someone to send and changing the subject kutuzov began to speak of the turkish war and the peace that had been concluded yes i have been much blamed he said both for that war and the peace but everything came at the right time tout vient a point a celui qui sait attendre and there were as many advisers there as here he went on returning to the subject of advisers which evidently occupied him ah those advisers said he if we had listened to them all we should not have made peace with turkey and should not have been through with that war everything in haste but more haste less speed kamenski would have been lost if he had not died he stormed fortresses with thirty thousand men it is not difficult to capture a fortress but it is difficult to win a campaign for that storming and attacking but patience and time are wanted kamenski sent soldiers to rustchuk but i only employed these two things and took more fortresses than kamenski and made the but eat horseflesh he swayed his head and the french shall too believe me he went on growing warmer and beating his chest make them eat horseflesh and tears again dimmed his eyes 
 everything comes in time to him who knows how to wait 
 but we have to accept battle remarked prince andrew 
 we shall if everybody wants it it be helped but believe me my dear boy there is nothing stronger than those two patience and time they will do it all but the advisers pas de cette oreille voila le mal some want a thing others one to do he asked evidently expecting an answer well what do you want us to do he repeated and his eye shone with a deep shrewd look tell you what to do he continued as prince andrew still did not reply i will tell you what to do and what i do dans le doute mon cher he paused he articulated the french proverb deliberately 
 see it that way the trouble 
 when in doubt my dear fellow do nothing 
 well my dear fellow remember that with all my heart i share your sorrow and that for you i am not a serene highness nor a prince nor a commander in chief but a father if you want anything come straight to me my dear boy 
 again he embraced and kissed prince andrew but before the latter had left the room kutuzov gave a sigh of relief and went on with his unfinished novel les chevaliers du cygne by madame de genlis 
 prince andrew could not have explained how or why it was but after that interview with kutuzov he went back to his regiment reassured as to the general course of affairs and as to the man to whom it had been entrusted the more he realized the absence of all personal motive in that old man in whom there seemed to remain only the habit of passions and in place of an intellect grouping events and drawing conclusions only the capacity calmly to contemplate the course of events the more reassured he was that everything would be as it should he will not bring in any plan of his own he will not devise or undertake anything thought prince andrew but he will hear everything remember everything and put everything in its place he will not hinder anything useful nor allow anything harmful he understands that there is something stronger and more important than his own will the inevitable course of events and he can see them and grasp their significance and seeing that significance can refrain from meddling and renounce his personal wish directed to something else and above all thought prince andrew one believes in him because russian despite the novel by genlis and the french proverbs and because his voice shook when he said what they have brought us to and had a sob in it when he said he would make them eat horseflesh 
 on such feelings more or less dimly shared by all the unanimity and general approval were founded with which despite court influences the popular choice of kutuzov as commander in chief was received

 book wicked poor man 
 chapter v 
 
 a providential 
 marius had lived for five years in poverty in destitution even in distress but he now perceived that he had not known real misery 
 true misery he had but just had a view of it was its spectre which had just passed before his eyes in fact he who has only beheld the misery of man has seen nothing the misery of woman is what he must see he who has seen only the misery of woman has seen nothing he must see the misery of the child 
 when a man has reached his last extremity he has reached his last resources at the same time 
 woe to the defenceless beings who surround him 
 work wages bread fire courage good will all fail him simultaneously 
 the light of day seems extinguished without the moral light within in these shadows man encounters the feebleness of the woman and the child and bends them violently to ignominy 
 then all horrors become possible 
 despair is surrounded with fragile partitions which all open on either vice or crime 
 health youth honor all the shy delicacies of the young body the heart virginity modesty that epidermis of the soul are manipulated in sinister wise by that fumbling which seeks resources which encounters opprobrium and which accomodates itself to it fathers mothers children brothers sisters men women daughters adhere and become incorporated almost like a mineral formation in that dusky promiscuousness of sexes relationships ages infamies and innocences 
 they crouch back to back in a sort of hut of fate they exchange glances 
 oh the unfortunate wretches how pale they are 
 how cold they are 
 it seems as though they dwelt in a planet much further from the sun than ours 
 this young girl was to marius a sort of messenger from the realm 
 of sad shadows 
 she revealed to him a hideous side of the night 
 marius almost reproached himself for the preoccupations of revery and passion which had prevented his bestowing a glance on his neighbors up to that day 
 the payment of their rent had been a mechanical movement which any one would have yielded to but he marius should have done better than that 
 what only a wall separated him from those abandoned beings who lived gropingly in the dark outside the pale of the rest of the world he was elbow to elbow with them he was in some sort the last link of the human race which they touched he heard them live or rather rattle in the death agony beside him and he paid no heed to them every day every instant he heard them walking on the other side of the wall he heard them go and come and speak and he did not even lend an ear 
 and groans lay in those words and he did not even listen to them his thoughts were elsewhere given up to dreams to impossible radiances to loves in the air to follies and all the while human creatures his brothers in jesus christ his brothers in the people were agonizing in vain beside him he even formed a part of their misfortune and he aggravated it for if they had had another neighbor who was less chimerical and more attentive any ordinary and charitable man evidently their indigence would have been noticed their signals of distress would have been perceived and they would have been taken hold of and rescued they appeared very corrupt and very depraved no doubt very vile very odious even but those who fall without becoming degraded are rare besides there is a point where the unfortunate and the infamous unite and are confounded in a single word a fatal word the miserable whose fault is this 
 and then should not the charity be all the more profound in proportion as the fall is great 
 while reading himself this moral lesson for there were occasions on which marius like all truly honest hearts was his own pedagogue and scolded himself more than he deserved he stared at the wall which separated him from the jondrettes as though he were able to make his gaze full of pity penetrate that partition and warm these wretched people 
 the wall was a thin layer of plaster upheld by lathes and beams and as the reader had just learned it allowed the sound of voices and words to be clearly distinguished only a man as dreamy as marius could have failed to perceive this long before 
 there was no paper pasted on the wall either on the side of the jondrettes or on that of marius the coarse construction was visible in its nakedness 
 marius examined the partition almost unconsciously sometimes revery examines observes and scrutinizes as thought would 
 all at once he sprang up he had just perceived near the top close to the ceiling a triangular hole which resulted from the space between three lathes the plaster which should have filled this cavity was missing and by mounting on the commode a view could be had through this aperture into the jondrettes attic 
 commiseration has and should have its curiosity 
 this aperture formed a sort of it is permissible to gaze at misfortune like a traitor in order to succor it 
 the is a judas in french 
 hence the allusion 
 let us get some little idea of what these people are like thought marius and in what condition they are 
 he climbed upon the commode put his eye to the crevice and looked

 book ten 
 chapter xvii 
 
 after the emperor had left moscow life flowed on there in its usual course and its course was so very usual that it was difficult to remember the recent days of patriotic elation and ardor hard to believe that russia was really in danger and that the members of the english club were also sons of the fatherland ready to sacrifice everything for it the one thing that recalled the patriotic fervor everyone had displayed during the stay was the call for contributions of men and money a necessity that as soon as the promises had been made assumed a legal official form and became unavoidable 
 with the approach to moscow the moscovites view of their situation did not grow more serious but on the contrary became even more frivolous as always happens with people who see a great danger approaching at the approach of danger there are always two voices that speak with equal power in the human soul one very reasonably tells a man to consider the nature of the danger and the means of escaping it the other still more reasonably says that it is too depressing and painful to think of the danger since it is not in power to foresee everything and avert the general course of events and it is therefore better to disregard what is painful till it comes and to think about what is pleasant in solitude a man generally listens to the first voice but in society to the second so it was now with the inhabitants of moscow it was long since people had been as gay in moscow as that year 
 broadsheets headed by woodcuts of a drink shop a potman and a moscow burgher called karpushka chigirin who having been a militiaman and having had rather too much at the pub heard that napoleon wished to come to moscow grew angry abused the french in very bad language came out of the drink shop and under the sign of the eagle began to address the assembled people were read and discussed together with the latest of vasili lvovich bouts rimes 
 in the corner room at the club members gathered to read these broadsheets and some liked the way karpushka jeered at the french saying they will swell up with russian cabbage burst with our buckwheat porridge and choke themselves with cabbage soup they are all dwarfs and one peasant woman will toss three of them with a hayfork others did not like that tone and said it was stupid and vulgar it was said that rostopchin had expelled all frenchmen and even all foreigners from moscow and that there had been some spies and agents of napoleon among them but this was told chiefly to introduce witty remark on that occasion the foreigners were deported to nizhni by boat and rostopchin had said to them in french rentrez en vousmemes entrez dans la barque et faites pas une barque de charon there was talk of all the government offices having been already removed from moscow and to this witticism was added that for that alone moscow ought to be grateful to napoleon it was said that regiment would cost him eight hundred thousand rubles and that bezukhov had spent even more on his but that the best thing about action was that he himself was going to don a uniform and ride at the head of his regiment without charging anything for the show 
 think it over get into the barque and take care not to make it a barque of charon 
 you spare anyone said julie drubetskaya as she collected and pressed together a bunch of raveled lint with her thin beringed fingers 
 julie was preparing to leave moscow next day and was giving a farewell soiree 
 bezukhov est ridicule but he is so kind and what pleasure is there to be so caustique 
 a forfeit cried a young man in militia uniform whom julie called mon chevalier and who was going with her to nizhni 
 in set as in many other circles in moscow it had been agreed that they would speak nothing but russian and that those who made a slip and spoke french should pay fines to the committee of voluntary contributions 
 another forfeit for a gallicism said a russian writer who was present what pleasure is there to be is not russian 
 you spare no one continued julie to the young man without heeding the remark 
 for caustique i am guilty and will pay and i am prepared to pay again for the pleasure of telling you the truth for gallicisms i be responsible she remarked turning to the author i have neither the money nor the time like prince galitsyn to engage a master to teach me russian 
 ah here he is she added quand on no no she said to the militia officer you catch me speak of the sun and you see its rays and she smiled amiably at pierre we were just talking of you she said with the facility in lying natural to a society woman we were saying that your regiment would be sure to be better than 
 oh talk to me of my regiment replied pierre kissing his hostess hand and taking a seat beside her i am so sick of it 
 you will of course command it yourself said julie directing a sly sarcastic glance toward the militia officer 
 the latter in presence had ceased to be caustic and his face expressed perplexity as to what smile might mean in spite of his and good nature personality immediately checked any attempt to ridicule him to his face 
 no said pierre with a laughing glance at his big stout body i should make too good a target for the french besides i am afraid i should hardly be able to climb onto a horse 
 among those whom guests happened to choose to gossip about were the rostovs 
 i hear that their affairs are in a very bad way said julie and he is so unreasonable the count himself i mean the razumovskis wanted to buy his house and his estate near moscow but it drags on and on he asks too much 
 no i think the sale will come off in a few days said someone though it is madness to buy anything in moscow now 
 why asked julie you think moscow is in danger 
 then why are you leaving 
 i what a question i am going because well because everyone is going and besides i am not joan of arc or an amazon 
 well of course of course let me have some more strips of linen 
 if he manages the business properly he will be able to pay off all his debts said the militia officer speaking of rostov 
 a kindly old man but not up to much and why do they stay on so long in moscow they meant to leave for the country long ago natalie is quite well again now she julie asked pierre with a knowing smile 
 they are waiting for their younger son pierre replied he joined cossacks and went to belaya tserkov where the regiment is being formed but now they have had him transferred to my regiment and are expecting him every day the count wanted to leave long ago but the countess on any account leave moscow till her son returns 
 i met them the day before yesterday at the arkharovs natalie has recovered her looks and is brighter she sang a song how easily some people get over everything 
 get over what inquired pierre looking displeased 
 julie smiled 
 you know count such knights as you are only found in madame de novels 
 what knights what do you mean demanded pierre blushing 
 oh come my dear count la fable de tout moscou je vous admire ma parole 
 it is the talk of all moscow my word i admire you 
 forfeit forfeit cried the militia officer 
 all right one talk how tiresome 
 what is the talk of all moscow pierre asked angrily rising to his feet 
 come now count you know 
 i know anything about it said pierre 
 i know you were friendly with natalie and so but i was always more friendly with vera that dear vera 
 no madame pierre continued in a tone of displeasure i have not taken on myself the role of natalie knight at all and have not been their house for nearly a month but i cannot understand the cruelty 
 qui said julie smiling and waving the lint triumphantly and to have the last word she promptly changed the subject do you know what i heard today poor mary bolkonskaya arrived in moscow yesterday do you know that she has lost her father 
 who excuses himself accuses himself 
 really where is she i should like very much to see her said pierre 
 i spent the evening with her yesterday she is going to their estate near moscow either today or tomorrow morning with her nephew 
 well and how is she asked pierre 
 she is well but sad but do you know who rescued her it is quite a romance nicholas rostov she was surrounded and they wanted to kill her and had wounded some of her people he rushed in and saved her 
 another romance said the militia officer really this general flight has been arranged to get all the old maids married off catiche is one and princess bolkonskaya another 
 do you know i really believe she is un petit peu amoureuse du jeune homme 
 a little bit in love with the young man

 book wicked poor man 
 chapter vi 
 
 the wild man in his lair 
 cities like forests have their caverns in which all the most wicked and formidable creatures which they contain conceal themselves 
 only in cities that which thus conceals itself is ferocious unclean and petty that is to say ugly in forests that which conceals itself is ferocious savage and grand that is to say beautiful 
 taking one lair with another the is preferable to the caverns are better than hovels 
 what marius now beheld was a hovel 
 marius was poor and his chamber was but as his poverty was noble his garret was neat 
 the den upon which his eye now rested was abject dirty fetid pestiferous mean sordid 
 the only furniture consisted of a straw chair an infirm table some old bits of crockery and in two of the corners two indescribable pallets all the light was furnishd by a dormer window of four panes draped with spiders webs 
 through this aperture there penetrated just enough light to make the face of a man appear like the face of a phantom 
 the walls had a leprous aspect and were covered with seams and scars like a visage disfigured by some horrible malady a repulsive moisture exuded from them 
 obscene sketches roughly sketched with charcoal could be distinguished upon them 
 the chamber which marius occupied had a dilapidated brick pavement this one was neither tiled nor planked its inhabitants stepped directly on the antique plaster of the hovel which had grown black under the pressure of feet 
 upon this uneven floor where the dirt seemed to be fairly incrusted and which possessed but one virginity that of the broom were capriciously grouped constellations of old shoes socks and repulsive rags however this room had a fireplace so it was let for forty francs a year there was every sort of thing in that fireplace a brazier a pot broken boards rags suspended from nails a ashes and even a little fire 
 two brands were smouldering there in a melancholy way 
 one thing which added still more to the horrors of this garret was that it was large 
 it had projections and angles and black holes the lower sides of roofs bays and promontories 
 hence horrible unfathomable nooks where it seemed as though spiders as big as fist as large as foot and perhaps knows some monstrous human beings must be hiding 
 one of the pallets was near the door the other near the window one end of each touched the fireplace and faced marius 
 in a corner near the aperture through which marius was gazing a colored engraving in a black frame was suspended to a nail on the wall and at its bottom in large letters was the inscription 
 the dream this represented a sleeping woman and a child also asleep the child on the lap an eagle in a cloud with a crown in his beak and the woman thrusting the crown away from the head without awaking the latter in the background napoleon in a glory leaning on a very blue column with a yellow capital ornamented with this inscription 
 maringo 
 austerlits 
 iena wagramme 
 elot 
 beneath this frame a sort of wooden panel which was no longer than it was broad stood on the ground and rested in a sloping attitude against the wall 
 it had the appearance of a picture with its face turned to the wall of a frame probably showing a daub on the other side of some detached from a wall and lying forgotten there while waiting to be rehung 
 near the table upon which marius descried a pen ink and paper sat a man about sixty years of age small thin livid haggard with a cunning cruel and uneasy air a hideous scoundrel 
 if lavater had studied this visage he would have found the vulture mingled with the attorney there the bird of prey and the pettifogger rendering each other mutually hideous and complementing each other the pettifogger making the bird of prey ignoble the bird of prey making the pettifogger horrible 
 this man had a long gray beard 
 he was clad in a chemise which allowed his hairy breast and his bare arms bristling with gray hair to be seen 
 beneath this chemise muddy trousers and boots through which his toes projected were visible 
 he had a pipe in his mouth and was smoking 
 there was no bread in the hovel but there was still tobacco 
 he was writing probably some more letters like those which marius had read 
 on the corner of the table lay an ancient dilapidated reddish volume and the size which was the antique mo of betrayed a romance 
 on the cover sprawled the following title printed in large capitals 
 god the king honor and the ladies by ducray duminil 
 as the man wrote he talked aloud and marius heard his words 
 the idea that there is no equality even when you are dead just look at pere lachaise 
 the great those who are rich are up above in the acacia alley which is paved 
 they can reach it in a carriage the little people the poor the unhappy well what of them they are put down below where the mud is up to your knees in the damp places 
 they are put there so that they will decay the sooner you cannot go to see them without sinking into the earth 
 he paused smote the table with his fist and added as he ground his teeth 
 oh 
 i could eat the whole world 
 a big woman who might be forty years of age or a hundred was crouching near the fireplace on her bare heels 
 she too was clad only in a chemise and a knitted petticoat patched with bits of old cloth 
 a coarse linen apron concealed the half of her petticoat 
 although this woman was doubled up and bent together it could be seen that she was of very lofty stature she was a sort of giant beside her husband 
 she had hideous hair of a reddish blond which was turning gray and which she thrust back from time to time with her enormous shining hands with their flat nails 
 beside her on the floor wide open lay a book of the same form as the other and probably a volume of the same romance 
 on one of the pallets marius caught a glimpse of a sort of tall pale young girl who sat there half naked and with pendant feet and who did not seem to be listening or seeing or living 
 no doubt the younger sister of the one who had come to his room 
 she seemed to be eleven or twelve years of age 
 on closer scrutiny it was evident that she really was fourteen 
 she was the child who had said on the boulevard the evening before i bolted bolted bolted 
 she was of that puny sort which remains backward for a long time then suddenly starts up rapidly 
 it is indigence which produces these melancholy human plants 
 these creatures have neither childhood nor youth 
 at fifteen years of age they appear to be twelve at sixteen they seem twenty 
 a little girl a woman one might say that they stride through life in order to get through with it the more speedily 
 at this moment this being had the air of a child 
 moreover no trace of work was revealed in that dwelling no handicraft no not a tool 
 in one corner lay some ironmongery of dubious aspect 
 it was the dull listlessness which follows despair and precedes the death agony 
 marius gazed for a while at this gloomy interior more terrifying than the interior of a tomb for the human soul could be felt fluttering there and life was palpitating there 
 the garret the cellar the lowly ditch where certain indigent wretches crawl at the very bottom of the social edifice is not exactly the sepulchre but only its antechamber but as the wealthy display their greatest magnificence at the entrance of their palaces it seems that death which stands directly side by side with them places its greatest miseries in that vestibule 
 the man held his peace the woman spoke no word the young girl did not even seem to breathe 
 the scratching of the pen on the paper was audible 
 the man grumbled without pausing in his writing 
 canaille canaille everybody is canaille 
 this variation to exclamation elicited a sigh from the woman 
 calm yourself my little friend she said 
 hurt yourself my dear 
 you are too good to write to all those people husband 
 bodies press close to each other in misery as in cold but hearts draw apart 
 this woman must have loved this man to all appearance judging from the amount of love within her but probably in the daily and reciprocal reproaches of the horrible distress which weighed on the whole group this had become extinct 
 there no longer existed in her anything more than the ashes of affection for her husband 
 nevertheless caressing appellations had survived as is often the case 
 she called him 
 my dear my little friend my good man etc with her mouth while her heart was silent 
 the man resumed his writing

 book ten 
 chapter xviii 
 
 when pierre returned home he was handed two of broadsheets that had been brought that day 
 the first declared that the report that count rostopchin had forbidden people to leave moscow was false on the contrary he was glad that ladies and wives were leaving the city there will be less panic and less gossip ran the broadsheet but i will stake my life on it that that will not enter moscow these words showed pierre clearly for the first time that the french would enter moscow the second broadsheet stated that our headquarters were at vyazma that count wittgenstein had defeated the french but that as many of the inhabitants of moscow wished to be armed weapons were ready for them at the arsenal sabers pistols and muskets which could be had at a low price the tone of the proclamation was not as jocose as in the former chigirin talks pierre pondered over these broadsheets evidently the terrible stormcloud he had desired with the whole strength of his soul but which yet aroused involuntary horror in him was drawing near 
 shall i join the army and enter the service or wait he asked himself for the hundredth time he took a pack of cards that lay on the table and began to lay them out for a game of patience 
 if this patience comes out he said to himself after shuffling the cards holding them in his hand and lifting his head if it comes out it means what does it mean 
 he had not decided what it should mean when he heard the voice of the eldest princess at the door asking whether she might come in 
 then it will mean that i must go to the army said pierre to himself come in come in he added to the princess 
 only the eldest princess the one with the stony face and long waist was still living in house the two younger ones had both married 
 excuse my coming to you cousin she said in a reproachful and agitated voice you know some decision must be come to what is going to happen everyone has left moscow and the people are rioting how is it that we are staying on 
 on the contrary things seem satisfactory ma cousine said pierre in the bantering tone he habitually adopted toward her always feeling uncomfortable in the role of her benefactor 
 satisfactory indeed very satisfactory barbara ivanovna told me today how our troops are distinguishing themselves it certainly does them credit and the people too are quite mutinous they no longer obey even my maid has taken to being rude at this rate they will soon begin beating us one walk in the streets but above all the french will be here any day now so what are we waiting for i ask just one thing of you cousin she went on arrange for me to be taken to petersburg whatever i may be i live under rule 
 oh come ma cousine where do you get your information from on the contrary 
 i submit to your napoleon others may if they please if you want to do this 
 but i will give the order at once 
 the princess was apparently vexed at not having anyone to be angry with muttering to herself she sat down on a chair 
 but you have been misinformed said pierre everything is quiet in the city and there is not the slightest danger see just been reading he showed her the broadsheet count rostopchin writes that he will stake his life on it that the enemy will not enter moscow 
 oh that count of yours said the princess malevolently he is a hypocrite a rascal who has himself roused the people to riot he write in those idiotic broadsheets that anyone whoever it might be should be dragged to the lockup by his hair how silly and honor and glory to whoever captures him he says this is what his cajolery has brought us to barbara ivanovna told me the mob near killed her because she said something in french 
 oh but so you take everything so to heart said pierre and began laying out his cards for patience 
 although that patience did come out pierre did not join the army but remained in deserted moscow ever in the same state of agitation irresolution and alarm yet at the same time joyfully expecting something terrible 
 next day toward evening the princess set off and head steward came to inform him that the money needed for the equipment of his regiment could not be found without selling one of the estates in general the head steward made out to pierre that his project of raising a regiment would ruin him pierre listened to him scarcely able to repress a smile 
 well then sell it said he to be done i draw back now 
 the worse everything became especially his own affairs the better was pierre pleased and the more evident was it that the catastrophe he expected was approaching hardly anyone he knew was left in town julie had gone and so had princess mary of his intimate friends only the rostovs remained but he did not go to see them 
 to distract his thoughts he drove that day to the village of vorontsovo to see the great balloon leppich was constructing to destroy the foe and a trial balloon that was to go up next day the balloon was not yet ready but pierre learned that it was being constructed by the desire the emperor had written to count rostopchin as follows 
 as soon as leppich is ready get together a crew of reliable and intelligent men for his car and send a courier to general kutuzov to let him know i have informed him of the matter 
 please impress upon leppich to be very careful where he descends for the first time that he may not make a mistake and fall into the hands it is essential for him to combine his movements with those of the commander in chief 
 on his way home from vorontsovo as he was passing the bolotnoe place pierre seeing a large crowd round the lobnoe place stopped and got out of his trap a french cook accused of being a spy was being flogged the flogging was only just over and the executioner was releasing from the flogging bench a stout man with red whiskers in blue stockings and a green jacket who was moaning piteously another criminal thin and pale stood near judging by their faces they were both frenchmen with a frightened and suffering look resembling that on the thin face pierre pushed his way in through the crowd 
 what is it who is it what is it for he kept asking 
 but the attention of the crowd officials burghers shopkeepers peasants and women in cloaks and in pelisses was so eagerly centered on what was passing in lobnoe place that no one answered him the stout man rose frowned shrugged his shoulders and evidently trying to appear firm began to pull on his jacket without looking about him but suddenly his lips trembled and he began to cry in the way men cry though angry with himself for doing so in the crowd people began talking loudly to stifle their feelings of pity as it seemed to pierre 
 cook to some prince 
 eh mounseer russian sauce seems to be sour to a frenchman sets his teeth on edge said a wrinkled clerk who was standing behind pierre when the frenchman began to cry 
 the clerk glanced round evidently hoping that his joke would be appreciated some people began to laugh others continued to watch in dismay the executioner who was undressing the other man 
 pierre choked his face puckered and he turned hastily away went back to his trap muttering something to himself as he went and took his seat as they drove along he shuddered and exclaimed several times so audibly that the coachman asked him 
 what is your pleasure 
 where are you going shouted pierre to the man who was driving to lubyanka street 
 to the as you ordered answered the coachman 
 fool idiot shouted pierre abusing his coachman a thing he rarely did home i told you and drive faster blockhead i must get away this very day he murmured to himself 
 at the sight of the tortured frenchman and the crowd surrounding the lobnoe place pierre had so definitely made up his mind that he could no longer remain in moscow and would leave for the army that very day that it seemed to him that either he had told the coachman this or that the man ought to have known it for himself 
 on reaching home pierre gave orders to evstafey his head coachman who knew everything could do anything and was known to all moscow that he would leave that night for the army at mozhaysk and that his saddle horses should be sent there this could not all be arranged that day so on representation pierre had to put off his departure till next day to allow time for the relay horses to be sent on in advance 
 on the the weather cleared up after a spell of rain and after dinner pierre left moscow when changing horses that night in perkhushkovo he learned that there had been a great battle that evening this was the battle of shevardino he was told that there in perkhushkovo the earth trembled from the firing but nobody could answer his questions as to who had won at dawn next day pierre was approaching mozhaysk 
 every house in mozhaysk had soldiers quartered in it and at the hostel where pierre was met by his groom and coachman there was no room to be had it was full of officers 
 everywhere in mozhaysk and beyond it troops were stationed or on the march cossacks foot and horse soldiers wagons caissons and cannon were everywhere pierre pushed forward as fast as he could and the farther he left moscow behind and the deeper he plunged into that sea of troops the more was he overcome by restless agitation and a new and joyful feeling he had not experienced before it was a feeling akin to what he had felt at the sloboda palace during the visit a sense of the necessity of undertaking something and sacrificing something he now experienced a glad consciousness that everything that constitutes happiness the comforts of life wealth even life itself is rubbish it is pleasant to throw away compared with something with what pierre could not say and he did not try to determine for whom and for what he felt such particular delight in sacrificing everything he was not occupied with the question of what to sacrifice for the fact of sacrificing in itself afforded him a new and joyous sensation

 strategy and tactics 
 marius with a load upon his breast was on the point of descending from the species of observatory which he had improvised when a sound attracted his attention and caused him to remain at his post 
 the door of the attic had just burst open abruptly 
 the eldest girl made her appearance on the threshold 
 on her feet she had large coarse shoes bespattered with mud which had splashed even to her red ankles and she was wrapped in an old mantle which hung in tatters 
 marius had not seen it on her an hour previously but she had probably deposited it at his door in order that she might inspire the more pity and had picked it up again on emerging she entered pushed the door to behind her paused to take breath for she was completely breathless then exclaimed with an expression of triumph and joy 
 he is coming 
 the father turned his eyes towards her the woman turned her head the little sister did not stir 
 who demanded her father 
 the gentleman 
 the philanthropist 
 yes 
 from the church of 
 yes 
 that old fellow 
 yes 
 and he is coming 
 he is following me 
 you are sure 
 i am sure 
 there truly he is coming 
 he is coming in a fiacre 
 in a fiacre 
 he is rothschild 
 the father rose 
 how are you sure 
 if he is coming in a fiacre how is it that you arrive before him 
 you gave him our address at least 
 did you tell him that it was the last door at the end of the corridor on the right if he only does not make a mistake 
 so you found him at the church did he read my letter 
 what did he say to you 
 ta ta ta said the girl how you do gallop on my good man see here 
 i entered the church he was in his usual place i made him a reverence and i handed him the letter he read it and said to me where do you live my child 
 i said 
 monsieur i will show you he said to me 
 no give me your address my daughter has some purchases to make i will take a carriage and reach your house at the same time that you do 
 i gave him the address 
 when i mentioned the house he seemed surprised and hesitated for an instant then he said never mind i will come 
 when the mass was finished i watched him leave the church with his daughter and i saw them enter a carriage 
 i certainly did tell him the last door in the corridor on the right 
 and what makes you think that he will come 
 i have just seen the fiacre turn into the rue that is what made me run so 
 how do you know that it was the same fiacre 
 because i took notice of the number so there 
 what was the number 
 
 good you are a clever girl 
 the girl stared boldly at her father and showing the shoes which she had on her feet 
 a clever girl possibly but i tell you i put these shoes on again and that i for the sake of my health in the first place and for the sake of cleanliness in the next i know anything more irritating than shoes that squelch and go ghi ghi ghi the whole time 
 i prefer to go barefoot 
 you are right said her father in a sweet tone which contrasted with the young rudeness but then you will not be allowed to enter churches for poor people must have shoes to do that one cannot go barefoot to the good god he added bitterly 
 then returning to the subject which absorbed him 
 so you are sure that he will come 
 he is following on my heels said she 
 the man started up 
 a sort of illumination appeared on his countenance 
 wife he exclaimed you hear 
 here is the philanthropist extinguish the fire 
 the stupefied mother did not stir 
 the father with the agility of an acrobat seized a jug which stood on the chimney and flung the water on the brands 
 then addressing his eldest daughter 
 here you 
 pull the straw off that chair 
 his daughter did not understand 
 he seized the chair and with one kick he rendered it seatless his leg passed through it 
 as he withdrew his leg he asked his daughter 
 is it cold 
 very cold 
 it is snowing 
 the father turned towards the younger girl who sat on the bed near the window and shouted to her in a thundering voice 
 quick get off that bed you lazy thing will you never do anything break a pane of glass 
 the little girl jumped off the bed with a shiver 
 break a pane he repeated 
 the child stood still in bewilderment 
 do you hear me repeated her father i tell you to break a pane 
 the child with a sort of terrified obedience rose on tiptoe and struck a pane with her fist 
 the glass broke and fell with a loud clatter 
 good said the father 
 he was grave and abrupt 
 his glance swept rapidly over all the crannies of the garret 
 one would have said that he was a general making the final preparation at the moment when the battle is on the point of beginning 
 the mother who had not said a word so far now rose and demanded in a dull slow languid voice whence her words seemed to emerge in a congealed state 
 what do you mean to do my dear 
 get into bed replied the man 
 his intonation admitted of no deliberation 
 the mother obeyed and threw herself heavily on one of the pallets 
 in the meantime a sob became audible in one corner 
 that cried the father 
 the younger daughter exhibited her bleeding fist without quitting the corner in which she was cowering 
 she had wounded herself while breaking the window she went off near her pallet and wept silently 
 it was now the turn to start up and exclaim 
 just see there 
 what follies you commit 
 she has cut herself breaking that pane for you 
 so much the better said the man 
 i foresaw that 
 what 
 so much the better retorted his wife 
 peace replied the father i suppress the liberty of the press 
 then tearing the chemise which he was wearing he made a strip of cloth with which he hastily swathed the little bleeding wrist 
 that done his eye fell with a satisfied expression on his torn chemise 
 and the chemise too said he this has a good appearance 
 an icy breeze whistled through the window and entered the room the outer mist penetrated thither and diffused itself like a whitish sheet of wadding vaguely spread by invisible fingers 
 through the broken pane the snow could be seen falling 
 the snow promised by the candlemas sun of the preceding day had actually come 
 the father cast a glance about him as though to make sure that he had forgotten nothing 
 he seized an old shovel and spread ashes over the wet brands in such a manner as to entirely conceal them 
 then drawing himself up and leaning against the 
 now said he we can receive the philanthropist

 book ten 
 chapter xix 
 
 on the of august the battle of the shevardino redoubt was fought on the not a shot was fired by either side and on the the battle of borodino itself took place 
 why and how were the battles of shevardino and borodino given and accepted why was the battle of borodino fought there was not the least sense in it for either the french or the russians its immediate result for the russians was and was bound to be that we were brought nearer to the destruction of moscow which we feared more than anything in the world and for the french its immediate result was that they were brought nearer to the destruction of their whole army which they feared more than anything in the world what the result must be was quite obvious and yet napoleon offered and kutuzov accepted that battle 
 if the commanders had been guided by reason it would seem that it must have been obvious to napoleon that by advancing thirteen hundred miles and giving battle with a probability of losing a quarter of his army he was advancing to certain destruction and it must have been equally clear to kutuzov that by accepting battle and risking the loss of a quarter of his army he would certainly lose moscow for kutuzov this was mathematically clear as it is that if when playing draughts i have one man less and go on exchanging i shall certainly lose and therefore should not exchange when my opponent has sixteen men and i have fourteen i am only one eighth weaker than he but when i have exchanged thirteen more men he will be three times as strong as i am 
 before the battle of borodino our strength in proportion to the french was about as five to six but after that battle it was little more than one to two previously we had a hundred thousand against a hundred and twenty thousand afterwards little more than fifty thousand against a hundred thousand yet the shrewd and experienced kutuzov accepted the battle while napoleon who was said to be a commander of genius gave it losing a quarter of his army and lengthening his lines of communication still more if it is said that he expected to end the campaign by occupying moscow as he had ended a previous campaign by occupying vienna there is much evidence to the contrary historians themselves tell us that from smolensk onwards he wished to stop knew the danger of his extended position and knew that the occupation of moscow would not be the end of the campaign for he had seen at smolensk the state in which russian towns were left to him and had not received a single reply to his repeated announcements of his wish to negotiate 
 in giving and accepting battle at borodino kutuzov acted involuntarily and irrationally but later on to fit what had occurred the historians provided cunningly devised evidence of the foresight and genius the generals who of all the blind tools of history were the most enslaved and involuntary 
 the ancients have left us model heroic poems in which the heroes furnish the whole interest of the story and we are still unable to accustom ourselves to the fact that for our epoch histories of that kind are meaningless 
 on the other question how the battle of borodino and the preceding battle of shevardino were fought there also exists a definite and but quite false conception all the historians describe the affair as follows 
 the russian army they say in its retreat from smolensk sought out for itself the best position for a general engagement and found such a position at borodino 
 the russians they say fortified this position in advance on the left of the highroad from moscow to smolensk and almost at a right angle to it from borodino to utitsa at the very place where the battle was fought 
 in front of this position they say a fortified outpost was set up on the shevardino mound to observe the enemy on the we are told napoleon attacked this advanced post and took it and on the attacked the whole russian army which was in position on the field of borodino 
 so the histories say and it is all quite wrong as anyone who cares to look into the matter can easily convince himself 
 the russians did not seek out the best position but on the contrary during the retreat passed many positions better than borodino they did not stop at any one of these positions because kutuzov did not wish to occupy a position he had not himself chosen because the popular demand for a battle had not yet expressed itself strongly enough and because miloradovich had not yet arrived with the militia and for many other reasons the fact is that other positions they had passed were stronger and that the position at borodino the one where the battle was fought far from being strong was no more a position than any other spot one might find in the russian empire by sticking a pin into the map at hazard 
 not only did the russians not fortify the position on the field of borodino to the left of and at a right angle to the highroad that is the position on which the battle took place but never till the of august did they think that a battle might be fought there this was shown first by the fact that there were no entrenchments there by the twenty fifth and that those begun on the and were not completed and secondly by the position of the shevardino redoubt that redoubt was quite senseless in front of the position where the battle was accepted why was it more strongly fortified than any other post and why were all efforts exhausted and six thousand men sacrificed to defend it till late at night on the a cossack patrol would have sufficed to observe the enemy thirdly as proof that the position on which the battle was fought had not been foreseen and that the shevardino redoubt was not an advanced post of that position we have the fact that up to the barclay de tolly and bagration were convinced that the shevardino redoubt was the left flank of the position and that kutuzov himself in his report written in hot haste after the battle speaks of the shevardino redoubt as the left flank of the position it was much later when reports on the battle of borodino were written at leisure that the incorrect and extraordinary statement was invented probably to justify the mistakes of a commander in chief who had to be represented as infallible that the shevardino redoubt was an advanced post whereas in reality it was simply a fortified point on the left flank and that the battle of borodino was fought by us on an entrenched position previously selected where as it was fought on a quite unexpected spot which was almost unentrenched 
 the case was evidently this a position was selected along the river kolocha which crosses the highroad not at a right angle but at an acute angle so that the left flank was at shevardino the right flank near the village of novoe and the center at borodino at the confluence of the rivers kolocha and voyna 
 to anyone who looks at the field of borodino without thinking of how the battle was actually fought this position protected by the river kolocha presents itself as obvious for an army whose object was to prevent an enemy from advancing along the smolensk road to moscow 
 napoleon riding to valuevo on the did not see as the history books say he did the position of the russians from utitsa to borodino he could not have seen that position because it did not exist nor did he see an advanced post of the russian army but while pursuing the russian rearguard he came upon the left flank of the russian position at the shevardino redoubt and unexpectedly for the russians moved his army across the kolocha and the russians not having time to begin a general engagement withdrew their left wing from the position they had intended to occupy and took up a new position which had not been foreseen and was not fortified by crossing to the other side of the kolocha to the left of the highroad napoleon shifted the whole forthcoming battle from right to left looking from the russian side and transferred it to the plain between utitsa semenovsk and borodino a plain no more advantageous as a position than any other plain in russia and there the whole battle of the of august took place 
 had napoleon not ridden out on the evening of the to the kolocha and had he not then ordered an immediate attack on the redoubt but had begun the attack next morning no one would have doubted that the shevardino redoubt was the left flank of our and the battle would have taken place where we expected it in that case we should probably have defended the shevardino redoubt our left flank still more obstinately we should have attacked napoleon in the center or on the right and the engagement would have taken place on the in the position we intended and had fortified but as the attack on our left flank took place in the evening after the retreat of our rea guard that is immediately after the fight at gridneva and as the russian commanders did not wish or were not in time to begin a general engagement then on the evening of the the first and chief action of the battle of borodino was already lost on the and obviously led to the loss of the one fought on the 
 after the loss of the shevardino redoubt we found ourselves on the morning of the without a position for our left flank and were forced to bend it back and hastily entrench it where it chanced to be 
 not only was the russian army on the defended by weak unfinished entrenchments but the disadvantage of that position was increased by the fact that the russian commanders not having fully realized what had happened namely the loss of our position on the left flank and the shifting of the whole field of the forthcoming battle from right to left maintained their extended position from the village of novoe to utitsa and consequently had to move their forces from right to left during the battle so it happened that throughout the whole battle the russians opposed the entire french army launched against our left flank with but half as many men action against utitsa and on the right flank against the french were actions distinct from the main course of the battle so the battle of borodino did not take place at all as in an effort to conceal our commanders mistakes even at the cost of diminishing the glory due to the russian army and people it has been described the battle of borodino was not fought on a chosen and entrenched position with forces only slightly weaker than those of the enemy but as a result of the loss of the shevardino redoubt the russians fought the battle of borodino on an open and almost unentrenched position with forces only half as numerous as the french that is to say under conditions in which it was not merely unthinkable to fight for ten hours and secure an indecisive result but unthinkable to keep an army even from complete disintegration and flight

 of counsel 
 the greatest trust between man and man is the trust of giving counsel for in other confidences men commit the parts of life their lands their goods their children their credit some particular affair but to such as they make their counsellors they commit the whole by how much the more they are obliged to all faith and integrity 
 
 the wisest princes need not think it any diminution to their greatness or derogation to their sufficiency to rely upon counsel god himself is not without but hath made it one of the great names of his blessed son the counsellor solomon hath pronounced that in counsel is stability things will have their first or second agitation if they be not tossed upon the arguments of counsel they will be tossed upon the waves of fortune and be full of inconstancy doing and undoing like the reeling of a drunken man son found the force of counsel as his father saw the necessity of it 
 for the beloved kingdom of god was first rent and broken by ill counsel upon 
 which counsel there are set for our instruction the two marks whereby bad counsel is for ever best discerned that it was young counsel for the persons 
 and violent counsel for the matter 
 
 the ancient times do set forth in figure both the incorporation and inseparable 
 conjunction of counsel with kings and the wise and politic use of counsel by kings the one in that they say jupiter did many metis which signifieth counsel whereby they intend that sovereignty is married to counsel the other in that which followeth which was thus they say after jupiter was married to metis she conceived by him and was with child but jupiter suffered her not to stay till she brought forth but ate her up whereby he became himself with child and was delivered of pallas armed out of his head which monstrous fable contained a secret of empire how kings are to make use of their counsel of state 
 that first they ought to refer matters unto them which is the first begetting or impregnation but when they are elaborate moulded and shaped in the womb of their counsel and grow ripe and ready to be brought forth that then they suffer not their counsel to go through with the resolution and direction as if it depended on them but take the matter back into their own hands and make it appear to the world that the decrees and final directions which because they come forth with prudence and power are resembled to pallas armed proceeded from themselves and not only from their authority but 
 the more to add reputation to themselves from their head and device 
 
 let us now speak of the inconveniences of counsel and of the remedies the 
 inconveniences that have been noted in calling and using counsel are three 
 first the revealing of affairs whereby they become less secret secondly the weakening of the authority of princes as if they were less of themselves thirdly the danger of being unfaithfully counselled and more for me good of them that counsel than of him that is counselled for which inconveniences the doctrine of italy and practice of france in some kings times haul introduced cabinet counsels a remedy worse then the disease 
 
 as to secrecy princes are not bound to communicate all matters with all counsellors but may extract and select neither is it necessary that he that consulteth what he should do should declare what he will do but let princes beware that the unsecreting of their affairs comes not from themselves and as for cabinet counsels it may be their motto plows rimarum sum one futile person that maketh it his glory to tell will do more hurt than many that know it their duty to conceal it is true there be some affairs which require extreme secrecy which will hardly go beyond one or two persons besides the king neither are those counsels unprosperous for besides the secrecy they commonly go on constantly in one spirit of direction without distraction 
 but then it must be a prudent king such as is able to grind with a 
 and those inward counsellors had need also be wise men and especially true and trusty to the ends as it was with king henry the seventh of england who in his greatest business imparted himself to none except it were to morton and fox 
 
 for weakening of authority the fable showeth the remedy nay the majesty of kings is rather exalted than diminished when they are in the chair of counsel neither was there ever prince bereaved of his dependencies by his counsel except where there hath been either an overgreatness in one counsellor or an overstrict combination in divers which are things soon found and holpen 
 
 for the last inconvenience that men will counsel with an eye to themselves certainly non inveniet fidem super terrain is meant of the nature of times and not of all particular persons there be that are in nature faithful and sincere and plain and direct not crafty and involved let princes above all draw to themselves such natures besides counsellors are not commonly so united but that one counsellor keepeth sentinel over another so that if any do counsel out of faction or private ends it commonly comes to the ear but the best remedy is if princes know their counsellors as well as their counsellors know them principis est virtus maxima nosse suos 
 
 and on the other side counsellors should not be too speculative into their 
 person the true composition of a counsellor is rather to be skilful 
 in their business than in his nature for then he is like to advise him 
 and not to feed his humour it is of singular use to princes if they take the opinions of their counsel both separately and together 
 for private opinion is more free but opinion before others is more reverend in private men are more bold in their own humours and in consort men are more obnoxious to others humours therefore it is good to take both and of the inferior sort rather in private to preserve freedom of the greater rather in consort to preserve respect it is in vain for princes to take counsel concerning matters if they take no counsel likewise concerning persons for all matters are as dead images and me life of the execution of affairs resteth in the good choice of persons neither is it enough to consult concerning persons secundurn genera as in an idea or mathematical description what the kind and 
 character of the person should be for the greatest errors are committed and the 
 most judgement is shown in the choice of individuals it was truly said 
 optimi consiliarii maud books will speak plain when counsellors blanch 
 therefore it is good to be conversant in them specially the books of such as themselves have been actors upon me stage 
 
 the counsels at this day in most places are but familiar meetings 
 where matters are rather talked on than debated and they run too swift to the order or act of counsel it were better that in causes of weight the matter were propounded one day and not spoken to till the next day in nocte consilium so was it done in die commission of union between england and scotland which was a grave and orderly assembly i commend set days for petitions for both it gives the suitors more certainty for their attendance and it frees the meetings for matters of estate that they may hoc agere in choice of committees for ripening business for the counsel it is better to choose indifferent persons than to make an indifference by putting in those that are strong on both sides i commend also standing commissions as for trade for treasure for war for suits for some provinces for where there be divers particular counsels and but one counsel of estate as it is in spain they are in effect no more than standing commissions save that they have greater authority let such as are to inform counsels out of their particular professions as lawyers seamen mintmen and the like be first heard before committees and then as occasion serves before the counsel 
 and let them not come in multitudes or in a tribunitious manner for that is to clamour counsels not to inform them a long table and a square table or seats about the walls seem things of form but are things of substance for at a long table a few at the upper end in effect sway all the business but in the other form there is more use of the counsellors opinions that sit lower 
 
 a king when he presides in counsel let him beware how he opens his own inclination too much in that which he propounded for else counsellors will but take the wind of him and instead of giving free counsel sing him a song of placebo

 tranquillity 
 after bidding his sister good night monseigneur bienvenu took one of the two silver candlesticks from the table handed the other to his guest and said to him 
 monsieur i will conduct you to your room 
 the man followed him 
 as might have been observed from what has been said above the house was so arranged that in order to pass into the oratory where the alcove was situated or to get out of it it was necessary to traverse the bedroom 
 at the moment when he was crossing this apartment madame magloire was putting away the silverware in the cupboard near the head of the bed this was her last care every evening before she went to bed 
 the bishop installed his guest in the alcove 
 a fresh white bed had been prepared there 
 the man set the candle down on a small table 
 well said the bishop may you pass a good night 
 morning before you set out you shall drink a cup of warm milk from our cows 
 thanks monsieur said the man 
 hardly had he pronounced these words full of peace when all of a sudden and without transition he made a strange movement which would have frozen the two sainted women with horror had they witnessed it 
 even at this day it is difficult for us to explain what inspired him at that moment 
 did he intend to convey a warning or to throw out a menace 
 was he simply obeying a sort of instinctive impulse which was obscure even to himself he turned abruptly to the old man folded his arms and bending upon his host a savage gaze he exclaimed in a hoarse voice 
 ah really 
 you lodge me in your house close to yourself like this 
 he broke off and added with a laugh in which there lurked something monstrous 
 have you really reflected well 
 how do you know that i have not been an assassin 
 the bishop replied 
 that is the concern of the good god 
 then gravely and moving his lips like one who is praying or talking to himself he raised two fingers of his right hand and bestowed his benediction on the man who did not bow and without turning his head or looking behind him he returned to his bedroom 
 when the alcove was in use a large serge curtain drawn from wall to wall concealed the altar 
 the bishop knelt before this curtain as he passed and said a brief prayer 
 a moment later he was in his garden walking meditating conteplating his heart and soul wholly absorbed in those grand and mysterious things which god shows at night to the eyes which remain open 
 as for the man he was actually so fatigued that he did not even profit by the nice white sheets 
 snuffing out his candle with his nostrils after the manner of convicts he dropped all dressed as he was upon the bed where he immediately fell into a profound sleep 
 midnight struck as the bishop returned from his garden to his apartment 
 a few minutes later all were asleep in the little house

 the empire strikes back 
 vi 
 
 the rebel command center its walls and ceiling still shaking and cracking under theforce of the battle on the surface was attempting to operate amid the torn apart by the blasting belched sprays of scalding stem the white floorwere littered with broken pieces of machinery and chunks of ice were scatteredeverywhere except for the distant rumbling of laser fire the command center wasforebodingly quiet 
 there were still rebel personnel on duty including princess leia who watchedthe images on the few console screens she wanted to be certainthat the last of the transport ships had slipped past the imperial armada and wereapproaching their rendezvous point in space 
 han solo rushed into the command center dodging great sections of the iceceiling that came plunging down at him one great chunk was followed by anavalanche of ice that poured onto the floor near the entrance to the han hurried to the control board where leia stood beside 
 i heard the command center was hit han appeared concerned are you allright 
 the princess nodded she was surprised to see him there where the danger wasseverest 
 come on he urged before she could reply got to get to your ship 
 leia looked exhausted she had been standing at the console viewscreens forhours and had participated in dispatching rebel personnel to their posts taking herhand han led her from the chamber with the protocol droid clacking after them 
 as they left leia gave one final order to the controller give the evacuationcode signaland get to the transport 
 then as leia han and threepio made their hasty exit from the command voice blared from the public address speakers echoing in the nearby deserted icecorridors disengage disengage begin retreat action 
 come on han urged grimacing if you get there fast your be able to take off 
 the walls quaked even more violently than before ice chunks continued to fallthroughout the underground base as the three hurried toward the transport had nearly reached the hangar where transport ship was waiting ready fordeparture but as they neared the corner they found the entrance to the hangarcompletely blocked by ice and snow 
 han knew they would have to find some other route to escape he began to lead them back down the corridor careful to avoid falling snapped on his comlink as they hurried toward the ship transport c oneseven he yelled into the small microphone coming hold on 
 they were close enough to the hangar to hear escape vessel preparing from the rebel ice base if he could lead them safely just a few meters princess would be safe and 
 the chamber suddenly quaked with a terrible noise that thundered through theunderground base in an instant the entire ceiling had crashed down in front of a solid barrier of ice between them and the hangar docks they stared inshock at the dense white mass 
 cut off han yelled into his comlink knowing that if the transport wereto make good its escape there could be no time wasted in melting down or blastingthrough the barricade have to take off without princess organa heturned to her if lucky we can still make it to the falcon 
 the princess and followed as han dashed toward another that the millennium falcon and his wookiee copilot had not already beenburied under an avalanche of ice 
 looking out across the white battlefield the rebel officer watched the remainingsnowspeeders whisking through the air and the last of the imperial vehicles as theypassed the wreckage of the exploded walker he flipped on his comlink and heardthe order to retreat disengage disengage begin retreat action as he signaledhis men to move back inside the ice cavern he noticed that the lead walker was stilltreading heavily in the direction of the power generators 
 in the cockpit of that assault machine general veers stepped close to the this position he could clearly see the target below he studied the cracklingpower generators and observed the rebel troops defending them 
 within range sir reported hispilot 
 the general turned to his assault officer all troops will debark for groundassault veers said prepare to target the main generator 
 the lead walker flanked by two of the hulking machines lurched forward itsguns blazing to scatter the retreating rebel troops 
 as more laser fire came from the oncoming walkers rebel bodies and parts ofrebel bodies were flung through the air many of the soldiers who had managed toavoid the obliterating laser beams were crushed into unrecognizable pulp beneath thewalkers stomping feet the air was charged with the stink of blood and burningflesh and thundering with the explosive noises of battle 
 as they fled the few surviving rebel soldiers glimpsed a long snowspeeder as itretreated in the distance a black trail of smoke escaping its burning hull 
 although the smoke rising from his crippled speeder obstructed his view hobbiecould still see some of the carnage that raged on the ground his wounds from laser fire made it torture even to move let alone operate the controls of hiscraft but if he could mange to work them just long enough to return to the base hemight be able to find a medical robot and 
 no he doubted he would survive even that long he was that he wasnow the men in the trench would soon be dead too unless somethingwere done to save them 
 general veers proudly transmitting his report to imperial headquarters wastotally unaware of rogue approach yes lord vader reached the mainpower generators the shield will be down in moments you may commence yourlanding 
 as he ended his transmission general veers reached for the electrorangefinderand looked through the eyepiece to line up the main power generators electroniccrosshairs aligned according to the information from the computer thensuddenly the readouts on the small monitor screens mysteriously vanished 
 confounded general veers moved away from the eyepiece of theelectrorangefinder and turned instinctively toward a cockpit window he flinched interror at seeing a smoking projectile heading on the direct course toward his 
 the other pilots also saw the hurtling speeder and knew that there was no timeto turn the massive assault machine going to one of the pilots began 
 at that instant burning ship crashed through the walker cockpit like amanned bomb its fuel igniting into a cascade of flame and debris for a secondthere were human screams then fragments and the entire machine crashed to theground 
 perhaps it was the sound of this nearby blast that jarred luke skywalker back toconsciousness dazed he slowly lifted his head from the snow he felt very weakand was achingly stiff with cold the thought crossed his mind that frostbite mightalready have damaged his tissues he hoped not he had no desire to spend any moretime in that sticky bacta fluid 
 he tried to stand but fell back against the snow hoping he would not be spottedby any of the walker pilots his comlink whistled and somehow he found thestrength to flick on its receiver 
 forward units withdrawal complete the broadcast voice reported 
 withdrawal luke thought a moment then leia and the others must haveescaped luke suddenly felt that all the fighting and the deaths of loyal rebelpersonnel had not been for nothing a warmth rushed through his body and hegathered his strength to rise and begin making the long trek back toward a distantformation of ice 
 another explosion rocked the rebel hangar deck cracking the ceiling and almostburying the docked millennium falcon in a mound of ice at any moment the entireceiling might cave in the only safe place in the hangar seemed to be underneath theship itself where chewbacca was impatiently awaiting the return of his captain thewookiee had begun to worry if han did not return soon the falcon would surelybe buried in a tomb of ice but loyalty to his partner kept chewie from taking off inthe freighter alone 
 as the hangar started to tremble more violently chewbacca detected movementin the adjoining chamber throwing back his head the shaggy giant filled thehangar with his loudest roar as he saw han solo climb over hills of ice and snow andenter the chamber followed closely by princess leia and an obviously 
 not far from the hangar imperial stormtroopers their faces shielded by whitehelmets and white snowscreens had begun moving down deserted corridors withthem strode their leader the figure who surveyed the shambles that hadbeen the rebel base at hoth darth black image stood out starkly against thewhite walls ceiling and floor as he moved through the white catacombs heregally stepped aside to avoid a falling section of ice ceiling then he continued onhis way with such quick strides that his troops had to hurry to keep up 
 a low whine rising in pitch began to issue from the solo stood at the controls in the millennium cockpit at last feeling athome he quickly flipped one switch after another expecting to see the board flashits familiar mosaic of light but only some of the lights were working 
 chewbacca had also noticed something amiss and barked with concern as leiaexamined a gauge that seemed to be malfunctioning 
 that chewie asked han anxiously 
 the bark was distinctly negative 
 would it help if i got out and pushed snapped princess leia who wasbeginning to wonder if it were the spit that held the ship together 
 worry your holiness get it started 
 clanked into the hold and gesturing tried to get the robot volunteered i was wondering if i might but his scanners readthe scowl on the face staring at him it can wait he concluded 
 imperial stormtroopers accompanied by the rapidly moving darth through the ice corridors of the rebel base their pace quickened as theyrushed in the direction of the low whine coming from the ion engines bodytensed slightly as entering the hangar he perceived the familiar formof the millennium falcon 
 within the battered freighter ship han solo and chewbacca were tryingdesperately to get the craft moving 
 this bucket of bolts is never going to get us past that blockade princess leiacomplained 
 han pretended that he hear her instead he checked the and struggled to keep his patience even though his companion had soobviously lost hers he flipped switches on the control console ignoring look of disdain clearly she doubted that this assemblage of spare partsand welded hunks of scrap metal would hold together even if they did manage to getbeyond the blockade 
 han pushed a button on the intercom chewiecome on then winking atleia he said this still got a few surprise left in her 
 be surprised if we start moving 
 before han could make a carefully honed retort the falcon was jolted by a blastof imperial laser fire that flashed outside the cockpit window they could all see thesquad of imperial stormtroopers rushing with drawn weapons into the far end of theice hangar han knew that the dented hull might resist the force of thosehand weapons but would be destroyed by the more powerful weaponthat two of the imperial troopers were hurriedly setting up 
 chewie han yelled as he quickly strapped himself into his a somewhat subdued young woman seated herself in the 
 outside the millennium falcon stormtroopers worked with military efficiency toset up their enormous gun behind them the hangar doors began to open one ofthe powerful laser weapons appeared from the hull and swung about aimingdirectly at the stormtroopers 
 han moved urgently to block the imperial efforts without hesitationhe released a deadly blast from the powerful laser weapon he had aimed at thestormtroopers the explosion scattered their armored bodies all over the hangar 
 chewbacca dashed into the cockpit 
 just have to switch over han announced and hope for the best 
 the wookiee hurled his hairy bulk into the seat as yet another laserblast erupted outside the window next to him he yelled indignantly then yankedback on the controls to bring the welcome roar of engine fire from deep inside thefalcon 
 the corellian grinned at the princess a gleeful gleam in his eyes 
 someday she said with mild disgust going to be wrong and i justhope there to see it 
 han just smiled then turned to his copilot punch it he shouted 
 the huge engines roared and everything behind the craft instantlymelted in the fiery exhaust billowing from its tailpiece chewbacca furiously workedthe controls watching out of the corner of his eyes the ice walls rushing past as thefreighter blasted away 
 at the last moment just before takeoff han caught a glimpse of additionalstormtroopers running into the hangar in their wake strode a foreboding giant cladentirely in black then there was only the blur and the beckoning of billions of stars 
 as the millennium falcon soared from the hangar its flight was detected bycommander luke skywalker who turned to smile at wedge and his gunner atleast han got away the three then trudged along to their waiting fighterships when they finally reached them they shook hands and moved off towardtheir separate vehicles 
 good luck luke wedge said as they parted see you at the rendezvous 
 luke waved and began to walk toward his standing there amid themountains of ice and snow he was overcome by a surge of loneliness he feltdesperately alone now that even han was gone worse than that princess leia wasalso somewhere else she might just as well be an entire universe away 
 then out of nowhere a familiar whistle greeted luke 
 artoo he exclaimed is that you 
 sitting snugly in the socket that had been installed for these helpful r units wasthe little droid his head peeking from the top of the ship artoo hadscanned the approaching figure and had whistled with relief when his computersinformed him it was luke the young commander was equally relieved toreencounter the robot that had accompanied him on so many of his previousadventures 
 as he climbed into the cockpit and seated himself behind the controls lukecould hear the sound of fighter roaring into the sky toward the rebelrendezvous point activate the power and stop worrying soon beairborne luke said in response to nervous beeping 
 his was the last rebel ship to abandon what had for a very brief time been asecret outpost in the revolution against the tyranny of the empire 
 darth vader a raven specter quickly strode through the ruins of the rebel icefortress forcing his accompanying men into a brisk jog to keep up as they movedthrough the corridors admiral piett rushed up to overtake his master 
 seventeen ships destroyed he reported to the dark lord we knowhow many got away 
 without turning his head vader snarled through his mask the millenniumfalcon 
 piett paused a moment before replying he would have preferred to avoid thatissue our tracking scanners are on it now he responded a bit fearfully 
 vader turned to face the admiral his towering figure looming over the frightenedofficer piett felt a chill course through his veins and when the dark lord spokeagain his voice conveyed an image of the dreadful fate that would be inflicted if hiscommands were not executed 
 i want that ship he hissed 
 the ice planet was rapidly shrinking to a point of dim light as the millenniumfalcon sped into space soon that planet seemed nothing more than one of thebillions of light specks scattered throughout the black void 
 but the falcon was not alone in its escape into deep space rather it wasfollowed by an imperial fleet that included the avenger star destroyer and tie fighter the fighters moved ahead of the huge and closed in on the fleeing millennium falcon 
 chewbacca howled over the roar of the engines the ship wasbeginning to lurch with the buffeting flak blasted at it by the fighters 
 i know i know i see them han shouted it was taking everything he had tomaintain control of the ship 
 see what leia asked 
 han pointed out the window at two very bright objects 
 two more star destroyers and heading right at us 
 glad you said there was going to be no problem she commented withmore than a touch of sarcasm or be worried 
 the ship rocked under the steady fire from the tie fighters making it difficult forthreepio to maintain his balance as he returned to the cockpit his metal skinbumped and banged against the walls as he approached han sir he begantentatively i was wondering 
 han solo shot him a threatening glance either shut up or shut down hanwarned the robot who immediately did the former 
 still struggling with the controls to keep the millennium falcon on course thepilot turned to wookiee chewie the deflector shield holding up 
 the cockpit adjusted an overhead switch and barked a reply that solo interpretedas positive 
 good said han at sublight they may be faster but we can them hold on suddenly the corellian shifted his course 
 the two imperial star destroyers had com almost within firing range of thefalcon as they loomed ahead the pursuing tie fighters and the avenger were alsodangerously close han felt he had no choice but to take the falcon into dive 
 leia and chewbacca felt their stomachs leap into their throats as the falconexecuted its steep dive poor threepio quickly had to alter his inner mechanism if hewanted to remain on his metallic fee 
 han realized that his crew might think he was some kind of lunatic star his ship on this course but he had a strategy in mind with thefalcon no longer between them the two star destroyers were now on a directcollision course with the avenger all he had to do was sit back and watch 
 alarms blared through the interiors of all three star destroyers theseponderously massive ships could not respond quickly enough to such one of the destroyers began to move to the left in its effort to avoidcollision with the avenger unfortunately as it veered it brushed its companion shaking up both spaceborne fortresses the damaged destroyers began todrift through space while the avenger continued in pursuit of the millennium falconand its obviously insane pilot 
 two down han thought but there was still a quartet of tie fighters tailing thefalcon blasting at its stern with full laser fire but han thought he could outstrip ship was buffeted violently by the fighters laser blasts forcing leia to hold on ina desperate attempt to keep her seat 
 that slowed them down a bit han exulted chewie stand by to make thejump to there was not a moment to laser attack wasintense now and the tie fighters were almost on top of them 
 very close leia warned finally able to speak 
 han looked at her with a wicked glint in his eyes oh yeah watch this 
 he threw the hyperspace throttle forward desperate to escape but also eager toimpress the princess with both his own cleverness and his fantastic happened the stars that should by then have been mere blurs of light werestill something was definitely wrong 
 watch what leia asked impatiently 
 instead of responding han worked the controls a second nothing i think in trouble he muttered his throat tightened heknew trouble was a gross understatement 
 if i may say so sir threepio volunteered i noticed earlier that the entiremain system seemed to have been damaged 
 chewbacca threw back his head and let out a loud and miserable wail 
 in trouble han repeated 
 all around them the laser attack had increased violently the millenniumfalcon could only continue at its maximum sublight velocity as it moved deeper intospace closely followed by a swarm of tie fighters and one gigantic imperial stardestroyer

 chapter xx 
 
 the card tables were drawn out sets made up for boston and the visitors settled themselves some in the two drawing rooms some in the sitting room some in the library 
 the count holding his cards fanwise kept himself with difficulty from dropping into his usual nap and laughed at everything the young people at the countess instigation gathered round the clavichord and harp julie by general request played first after she had played a little air with variations on the harp she joined the other young ladies in begging natasha and 
 nicholas who were noted for their musical talent to sing something natasha who was treated as though she were grown up was evidently very proud of this but at the same time felt shy 
 what shall we sing she said 
 the brook suggested nicholas 
 well be quick boris come here said natasha but where is sonya 
 she looked round and seeing that her friend was not in the room ran to look for her 
 running into room and not finding her there natasha ran to the nursery but sonya was not there either natasha concluded that she must be on the chest in the passage the chest in the passage was the place of mourning for the younger female generation in the rostov household and there in fact was sonya lying face downward on dirty feather bed on the top of the chest crumpling her gauzy pink dress under her hiding her face with her slender fingers and sobbing so convulsively that her bare little shoulders shook face which had been so radiantly happy all that day suddenly changed her eyes became fixed and then a shiver passed down her broad neck and the corners of her mouth drooped 
 sonya what is it what is the matter oo oo oo and large mouth widened making her look quite ugly and she began to wail like a baby without knowing why except that sonya was crying sonya tried to lift her head to answer but could not and hid her face still deeper in the bed natasha wept sitting on the feather bed and hugging her friend with an effort sonya sat up and began wiping her eyes and explaining 
 nicholas is going away in a time his papers have come he told me himself but still i should not cry and she showed a paper she held in her hand with the verses nicholas had written still i should not cry but you no one can understand what a soul he has 
 and she began to cry again because he had such a noble soul 
 all very well for you i am not envious i love you and boris also she went on gaining a little strength he is nice there are no difficulties in your way but nicholas is my cousin one would have to the metropolitan himself and even then it be done and besides if she tells mamma sonya looked upon the countess as her mother and called her so that i am spoiling nicholas career and am heartless and ungrateful while truly god is my witness and she made the sign of the cross i love her so much and all of you only vera and what for what have i done to her i am so grateful to you that i would willingly sacrifice everything only i have nothing 
 sonya could not continue and again hid her face in her hands and in the feather bed natasha began consoling her but her face showed that she understood all the gravity of her trouble 
 sonya she suddenly exclaimed as if she had guessed the true reason of her sorrow sure vera has said something to you since dinner she 
 yes these verses nicholas wrote himself and i copied some others and she found them on my table and said show them to mamma and that i was ungrateful and that mamma would never allow him to marry me but that marry julie you see how been with her all day natasha what have i done to deserve it 
 and again she began to sob more bitterly than before natasha lifted her up hugged her and smiling through her tears began comforting her 
 sonya believe her darling believe her do you remember how we and nicholas all three of us talked in the sitting room after supper why we settled how everything was to be i quite remember how but you remember that it could all be arranged and how nice it all was uncle brother has married his first cousin and we are only second cousins you know and boris says it is quite possible you know i have told him all about it and he is so clever and so good said natasha you cry sonya dear love darling sonya and she kissed her and laughed spiteful never mind her and all will come right and she say anything to mamma nicholas will tell her himself and he care at all for julie 
 natasha kissed her on the hair 
 sonya sat up the little kitten brightened its eyes shone and it seemed ready to lift its tail jump down on its soft paws and begin playing with the ball of worsted as a kitten should 
 do you think so really truly she said quickly smoothing her frock and hair 
 really truly answered natasha pushing in a crisp lock that had strayed from under her plaits 
 both laughed 
 well go and sing the brook 
 come along 
 do you know that fat pierre who sat opposite me is so funny said natasha stopping suddenly i feel so happy 
 and she set off at a run along the passage 
 sonya shaking off some down which clung to her and tucking away the verses in the bosom of her dress close to her bony little chest ran after natasha down the passage into the sitting room with flushed face and light joyous steps at the visitors request the young people sang the quartette the brook with which everyone was delighted then nicholas sang a song he had just learned 
 at nighttime in the fair glow 
 how sweet as fancies wander free 
 to feel that in this world one 
 who still is thinking but of thee 
 that while her fingers touch the harp 
 wafting sweet music music the lea 
 it is for thee thus swells her heart 
 sighing its message out to thee 
 a day or two then bliss unspoilt 
 but oh till then i cannot live 
 he had not finished the last verse before the young people began to get ready to dance in the large hall and the sound of the feet and the coughing of the musicians were heard from the gallery 
 pierre was sitting in the where shinshin had engaged him as a man recently returned from abroad in a political conversation in which several others joined but which bored pierre when the music began natasha came in and walking straight up to pierre said laughing and blushing 
 mamma told me to ask you to join the dancers 
 i am afraid of mixing the figures pierre replied but if you will be my teacher and lowering his big arm he offered it to the slender little girl 
 while the couples were arranging themselves and the musicians tuning up pierre sat down with his little partner natasha was perfectly happy she was dancing with a man who had been abroad she was sitting in a conspicuous place and talking to him like a lady she had a fan in her hand that one of the ladies had given her to hold assuming quite the pose of a society woman heaven knows when and where she had learned it she talked with her partner fanning herself and smiling over the fan 
 dear dear just look at her exclaimed the countess as she crossed the ballroom pointing to natasha 
 natasha blushed and laughed 
 well really mamma why should you what is there to be surprised at 
 in the midst of the third ecossaise there was a clatter of chairs being pushed back in the sitting room where the count and marya dmitrievna had been playing cards with the majority of the more distinguished and older visitors they now stretching themselves after sitting so long and replacing their purses and pocketbooks entered the ballroom first came marya dmitrievna and the count both with merry countenances the count with playful ceremony somewhat in ballet style offered his bent arm to marya dmitrievna he drew himself up a smile of debonair gallantry lit up his face and as soon as the last figure of the ecossaise was ended he clapped his hands to the musicians and shouted up to their gallery addressing the first violin 
 semen do you know the daniel cooper 
 this was the favorite dance which he had danced in his youth strictly speaking daniel cooper was one figure of the anglaise 
 look at papa shouted natasha to the whole company and quite forgetting that she was dancing with a partner she bent her curly head to her knees and made the whole room ring with her laughter 
 and indeed everybody in the room looked with a smile of pleasure at the jovial old gentleman who standing beside his tall and stout partner marya dmitrievna curved his arms beat time straightened his shoulders turned out his toes tapped gently with his foot and by a smile that broadened his round face more and more prepared the onlookers for what was to follow as soon as the provocatively gay strains of daniel cooper somewhat resembling those of a merry peasant dance began to sound all the doorways of the ballroom were suddenly filled by the domestic serfs the men on one side and the women on the other who with beaming faces had come to see their master making merry 
 just look at the master a regular eagle he is loudly remarked the nurse as she stood in one of the doorways 
 the count danced well and knew it but his partner could not and did not want to dance well her enormous figure stood erect her powerful arms hanging down she had handed her reticule to the countess and only her stern but handsome face really joined in the dance what was expressed by the whole of the plump figure in marya dmitrievna found expression only in her more and more beaming face and quivering nose but if the count getting more and more into the swing of it charmed the spectators by the unexpectedness of his adroit maneuvers and the agility with which he capered about on his light feet marya dmitrievna produced no less impression by slight exertions the least effort to move her shoulders or bend her arms when turning or stamp her foot which everyone appreciated in view of her size and habitual severity the dance grew livelier and livelier the other couples could not attract a attention to their own evolutions and did not even try to do so all were watching the count and marya dmitrievna natasha kept pulling everyone by sleeve or dress urging them to look at papa though as it was they never took their eyes off the couple in the intervals of the dance the count breathing deeply waved and shouted to the musicians to play faster faster faster and faster lightly more lightly and yet more lightly whirled the count flying round marya dmitrievna now on his toes now on his heels until turning his partner round to her seat he executed the final pas raising his soft foot backwards bowing his perspiring head smiling and making a wide sweep with his arm amid a thunder of applause and laughter led by natasha both partners stood still breathing heavily and wiping their faces with their cambric handkerchiefs 
 how we used to dance in our time ma chere said the count 
 that was a daniel cooper exclaimed marya dmitrievna tucking up her sleeves and puffing heavily

 chapter 
 
 to obviate the danger of this threat being fulfilled mr linton commissioned me to take the boy home early on pony and said he as we shall now have no influence over his destiny good or bad you must say nothing of where he is gone to my daughter she cannot associate with him hereafter and it is better for her to remain in ignorance of his proximity lest she should be restless and anxious to visit the heights merely tell her his father sent for him suddenly and he has been obliged to leave us 
 linton was very reluctant to be roused from his bed at five and astonished to be informed that he must prepare for further travelling but i softened off the matter by stating that he was going to spend some time with his father mr heathcliff who wished to see him so much he did not like to defer the pleasure till he should recover from his late journey 
 my father he cried in strange perplexity mamma never told me i had a father where does he live rather stay with uncle 
 he lives a little distance from the grange i replied just beyond those hills not so far but you may walk over here when you get hearty and you should be glad to go home and to see him you must try to love him as you did your mother and then he will love you 
 but why have i not heard of him before asked linton why mamma and he live together as other people do 
 he had business to keep him in the north i answered and your health required her to reside in the south 
 and why mamma speak to me about him persevered the child she often talked of uncle and i learnt to love him long ago how am i to love papa i know him 
 oh all children love their parents i said your mother perhaps thought you would want to be with him if she mentioned him often to you let us make haste an early ride on such a beautiful morning is much preferable to an more sleep 
 is she to go with us he demanded the little girl i saw yesterday replied i 
 is uncle he continued 
 no i shall be your companion there i said 
 linton sank back on his pillow and fell into a brown study 
 i go without uncle he cried at length i tell where you mean to take me 
 i attempted to persuade him of the naughtiness of showing reluctance to meet his father still he obstinately resisted any progress towards dressing and i had to call for my assistance in coaxing him out of bed the poor thing was finally got off with several delusive assurances that his absence should be short that mr edgar and cathy would visit him and other promises equally which i invented and reiterated at intervals throughout the way the pure air and the bright sunshine and the gentle canter of minny relieved his despondency after a while he began to put questions concerning his new home and its inhabitants with greater interest and liveliness 
 is wuthering heights as pleasant a place as thrushcross grange he inquired turning to take a last glance into the valley whence a light mist mounted and formed a fleecy cloud on the skirts of the blue 
 it is not so buried in trees i replied and it is not quite so large but you can see the country beautifully all round and the air is healthier for and dryer you will perhaps think the building old and dark at first though it is a respectable house the next best in the neighbourhood and you will have such nice rambles on the moors hareton is miss other cousin and so yours in a show you all the sweetest spots and you can bring a book in fine weather and make a green hollow your study and now and then your uncle may join you in a walk he does frequently walk out on the hills 
 and what is my father like he asked is he as young and handsome as uncle 
 as young said i but he has black hair and eyes and looks sterner and he is taller and bigger altogether not seem to you so gentle and kind at first perhaps because it is not his way still mind you be frank and cordial with him and naturally be fonder of you than any uncle for you are his own 
 black hair and eyes mused linton i fancy him then i am not like him am i 
 not much i answered not a morsel i thought surveying with regret the white complexion and slim frame of my companion and his large languid eyes save that unless a morbid touchiness kindled them a moment they had not a vestige of her sparkling spirit 
 how strange that he should never come to see mamma and me he murmured has he ever seen me if he have i must have been a baby i remember not a single thing about him 
 why master linton said i three hundred miles is a great distance and ten years seem very different in length to a person compared with what they do to you it is probable mr heathcliff proposed going from summer to summer but never found a convenient opportunity and now it is too late trouble him with questions on the subject it will disturb him for no good 
 the boy was fully occupied with his own cogitations for the remainder of the ride till we halted before the farmhouse garden gate i watched to catch his impressions in his countenance he surveyed the carved front and lattices the straggling gooseberry bushes and crooked firs with solemn intentness and then shook his head his private feelings entirely disapproved of the exterior of his new abode but he had sense to postpone complaining there might be compensation within before he dismounted i went and opened the door it was half past six the family had just finished breakfast the servant was clearing and wiping down the table joseph stood by his chair telling some tale concerning a lame horse and hareton was preparing for the hay field 
 hallo nelly cried mr heathcliff when he saw me i feared i should have to come down and fetch my property myself brought it have you let us see what we can make of it 
 he got up and strode to the door hareton and joseph followed in gaping curiosity poor linton ran a frightened eye over the faces of the three 
 said joseph after a grave inspection swopped wi ye maister an his lass 
 heathcliff having stared his son into an ague of confusion uttered a scornful laugh 
 god what a beauty what a lovely charming thing he exclaimed they reared it on snails and sour milk nelly oh damn my soul but worse than i the devil knows i was not sanguine 
 i bid the trembling and bewildered child get down and enter he did not thoroughly comprehend the meaning of his speech or whether it were intended for him indeed he was not yet certain that the grim sneering stranger was his father but he clung to me with growing trepidation and on mr taking a seat and bidding him come hither he hid his face on my shoulder and wept 
 tut tut said heathcliff stretching out a hand and dragging him roughly between his knees and then holding up his head by the chin none of that nonsense not going to hurt thee that thy name thou art thy child entirely where is my share in thee puling chicken 
 he took off the cap and pushed back his thick flaxen curls felt his slender arms and his small fingers during which examination linton ceased crying and lifted his great blue eyes to inspect the inspector 
 do you know me asked heathcliff having satisfied himself that the limbs were all equally frail and feeble 
 no said linton with a gaze of vacant fear 
 heard of me i dare say 
 no he replied again 
 no what a shame of your mother never to waken your filial regard for me you are my son then tell you and your mother was a wicked slut to leave you in ignorance of the sort of father you possessed now wince and colour up though it is something to see you have not white blood be a good lad and do for you nelly if you be tired you may sit down if not get home again i guess report what you hear and see to the cipher at the grange and this thing be settled while you linger about it 
 well replied i i hope be kind to the boy mr heathcliff or not keep him long and all you have akin in the wide world that you will ever 
 be very kind to him you fear he said laughing only nobody else must be kind to him jealous of monopolizing his affection and to begin my kindness joseph bring the lad some breakfast hareton you infernal calf begone to your work yes nell he added when they had departed my son is prospective owner of your place and i should not wish him to die till i was certain of being his successor besides mine and i want the triumph of seeing my descendant fairly lord of their estates my child hiring their children to till their lands for wages that is the sole consideration which can make me endure the whelp i despise him for himself and hate him for the memories he revives but that consideration is sufficient as safe with me and shall be tended as carefully as your master tends his own i have a room upstairs furnished for him in handsome style engaged a tutor also to come three times a week from twenty miles distance to teach him what he pleases to learn ordered hareton to obey him and in fact arranged everything with a view to preserve the superior and the gentleman in him above his associates i do regret however that he so little deserves the trouble if i wished any blessing in the world it was to find him a worthy object of pride and bitterly disappointed with the whining wretch 
 while he was speaking joseph returned bearing a basin of milk porridge and placed it before linton he stirred round the homely mess with a look of aversion and affirmed he could not eat it i saw the old manservant shared largely in his scorn of the child though he was compelled to retain the sentiment in his heart because heathcliff plainly meant his underlings to hold him in honour 
 cannot ate it repeated he peering in face and subduing his voice to a whisper for fear of being overheard but maister hareton nivir ate naught else when he wer a little un and what were gooid eneugh for gooid eneugh for ye rayther think 
 i eat it answered linton snappishly take it away joseph snatched up the food indignantly and brought it to us is there aught ails th victuals he asked thrusting the tray under nose 
 what should ail them he said 
 wah answered joseph yon dainty chap says he cannut ate em but aw guess raight his mother wer just wer too mucky to sow t corn for makking her breead 
 mention his mother to me said the master angrily get him something that he can eat all what is his usual food nelly 
 i suggested boiled milk or tea and the housekeeper received instructions to prepare some come i reflected his selfishness may contribute to his comfort he perceives his delicate constitution and the necessity of treating him tolerably console mr edgar by acquainting him with the turn humour has taken having no excuse for lingering longer i slipped out while linton was engaged in timidly rebuilding the advances of a friendly sheepdog but he was too much on the alert to be cheated as i closed the door i heard a cry and a frantic repetition of the words 
 leave me not stay here not stay here 
 then the latch was raised and fell they did not suffer him to come forth i mounted minny and urged her to a trot and so my brief guardianship ended

 chapter twenty 
 
 i think i have any words in which to tell the meeting of the mother and daughters such hours are beautiful to live but very hard to describe so i will leave it to the imagination of my readers merely saying that the house was full of genuine happiness and that tender hope was realized for when beth woke from that long healing sleep the first objects on which her eyes fell were the little rose and face too weak to wonder at anything she only smiled and nestled close in the loving arms about her feeling that the hungry longing was satisfied at last then she slept again and the girls waited upon their mother for she would not unclasp the thin hand which clung to hers even in sleep 
 hannah had dished up and astonishing breakfast for the traveler finding it impossible to vent her excitement in any other way and meg and jo fed their mother like dutiful young storks while they listened to her whispered account of state mr promise to stay and nurse him the delays which the storm occasioned on the homeward journey and the unspeakable comfort hopeful face had given her when she arrived worn out with fatigue anxiety and cold 
 
 what a strange yet pleasant day that was so brilliant and gay without for all the world seemed abroad to welcome the first snow so quiet and reposeful within for everyone slept spent with watching and a sabbath stillness reigned through the house while nodding hannah mounted guard at the door with a blissful sense of burdens lifted off meg and jo closed their weary eyes and lay at rest like boats safe at anchor in a quiet harbor mrs march would not leave side but rested in the big chair waking often to look at touch and brood over her child like a miser over some recovered treasure laurie meanwhile posted off to comfort amy and told his story so well that aunt march actually sniffed herself and never once said i told you so amy came out so strong on this occasion that i think the good thoughts in the little chapel really began to bear fruit she dried her tears quickly restrained her impatience to see her mother and never even thought of the turquoise ring when the old lady heartily agreed in opinion that she behaved like a capital little woman even polly seemed impressed for he called her a good girl blessed her buttons and begged her to come and take a walk dear in his most affable tone she would very gladly have gone out to enjoy the bright wintry weather but discovering that laurie was dropping with sleep in spite of manful efforts to conceal the fact she persuaded him to rest on the sofa while she wrote a note to her mother she was a long time about it and when she returned he was stretched out with both arms under his head sound asleep while aunt march had pulled down the curtains and sat doing nothing in an unusual fit of benignity 
 after a while they began to think he was not going to wake up till night and not sure that he would had he not been effectually roused by cry of joy at sight of her mother 
 there probably were a good many happy little girls in and about the city that day but it is my private opinion that amy was the happiest of all when she sat in her lap and told her trials receiving consolation and compensation in the shape of approving smiles and fond caresses they were alone together in the chapel to which her mother did not object when its purpose was explained to her 
 
 on the contrary i like it very much dear looking from the dusty rosary to the little book and the lovely picture with its garland of evergreen it is an excellent plan to have some place where we can go to be quiet when things vex or grieve us there are a good many hard times in this life of ours but we can always bear them if we ask help in the right way i think my little girl is learning this 
 
 yes mother and when i go home i mean to have a corner in the big closet to put my books and the copy of that picture which tried to make the face is not good too beautiful for me to draw but the baby is done better and i love it very much i like to think he was a little child once for then i seem so far away and that helps me 
 as amy pointed to the smiling christ child on his knee mrs march saw something on the lifted hand that made her smile she said nothing but amy understood the look and after a pause she added gravely i wanted to speak to you about this but i forgot it aunt gave me the ring today she called me to her and kissed me and put it on my finger and said i was a credit to her and like to keep me always she gave that funny guard to keep the turquoise on as too big like to wear them mother can i 
 they are very pretty but i think rather too young for such ornaments amy said mrs march looking at the plump little hand with the band of stones on the forefinger and the quaint guard formed of two tiny golden hands clasped together 
 try not to be vain said amy i think i like it only because so pretty but i want to wear it as the girl in the story wore her bracelet to remind me of something 
 do you mean aunt march asked her mother laughing 
 no to remind me not to be selfish amy looked so earnest and sincere about it that her mother stopped laughing and listened respectfully to the little plan 
 thought a great deal lately about my bundle of naughties and being selfish is the largest one in it so going to try hard to cure it if i can beth selfish and the reason everyone loves her and feels so bad at the thoughts of losing her people feel so bat about me if i was sick and i deserve to have them but like to be loved and missed by a great many friends so going to try and be like beth all i can apt to forget my resolutions but if i had something always about me to remind me i guess i should do better may we try this way 
 yes but i have more faith in the corner of the big closet wear your ring dear and do your best i think you will prosper for the sincere wish to be good is half the battle now i must go back to beth keep up your heart little daughter and we will soon have you home again 
 that evening while meg was writing to her father to report the safe arrival jo slipped upstairs into room and finding her mother in her usual place stood a minute twisting her fingers in her hair with a worried gesture and an undecided look 
 what is it deary asked mrs march holding out her hand with a face which invited confidence 
 i want to tell you something mother 
 about meg 
 how quickly you guessed yes about her and though a little thing it fidgets me 
 beth is asleep speak low and tell me all about it that moffat been here i hope asked mrs march rather sharply 
 no i should have shut the door in his face if he had said jo settling herself on the floor at her feet last summer meg left a pair of gloves over at the laurences and only one was returned we forgot about it till teddy told me that mr brooke owned that he liked meg but dare say so she was so young and he so poor now it a dreadful state of things 
 do you think meg cares for him asked mrs march with an anxious look 
 mercy me i know anything about love and such nonsense cried jo with a funny mixture of interest and contempt in novels the girls show it by starting and blushing faintingaway growing thin and acting like fools now meg does not doanything of the sort she eats and drinks and sleeps like a sensible creature she looks straight in my face when i talk about that man and only blushes a little bit when teddy jokes about lovers i forbid him to do it but he mind me as he ought 
 then you fancy that meg is not interested in john 
 who cried jo staring 
 mr brooke i call him john now we fell into the way of doing so at the hospital and he likes it 
 oh dear i know take his part been good to father and you send him away but let meg marry him if she wants to mean thing to go petting papa and helping you just to wheedle you into liking him and jo pulled her hair again with a wrathful tweak 
 my dear get angry about it and i will tell you how it happened john went with me at mr request and was so devoted to poor father that we help getting fond of him he was perfectly open and honorable about meg for he told us he loved her but would earn a comfortable home before he asked her to marry him he only wanted our leave to love her and work for her and the right to make her love him if he could he is a truly excellent young man and we could not refuse to listen to him but i will not consent to engaging herself so young 
 of course not it would be idiotic i knew there was mischief brewing i felt it and now worse than i imagined i just wish i could marry meg myself and keep her safe in the family 
 this odd arrangement made mrs march smile but she said gravely jo i confide in you and wish you to say anything to meg yet when john comes back and i see them together i can judge better of her feelings toward him 
 see those handsome eyes that she talks about and then it will be all up with her got such a soft heart it will melt like butter in the sun if anyone looks sentimentlly at her she read the short reports he sent more than she did your letters and pinched me when i spoke of it and likes brown eyes and think john an ugly name and go and fall in love and an end of peace and fun and cozy times together i see it all go lovering around the house and we shall have to dodge meg will be absorbed and no good to me any more brooke will scratch up a fortune somehow carry her off and make a hole in the family and i shall break my heart and everything will be abominably uncomfortable oh dear me why we all boys then there be any bother 
 jo leaned her chin on her knees in a disconsolate attitude and shook her fist at the reprehensible john mrs march sighed and jo looked up with an air of relief 
 you like it mother glad of it send him about his business and not tell meg a word of it but all be happy together as we always have been 
 i did wrong to sigh jo it is natural and right you should all go to homes of your own in time but i do want to keep my girls as long as i can and i am sorry that this happened so soon for meg is only seventeen and it will be some years before john can make a home for her your father and i have agreed that she shall not bind herself in any way nor be married before twenty if she and john love one another they can wait and test the love by doing so she is conscientious and i have no fear of her treating him unkindly my pretty tender hearted girl i hope things will go happily with her 
 you rather have her marry a rich man asked jo as her voice faltered a little over the last words 
 money is a good and useful thing jo and i hope my girls will never feel the need of it too bitterly not be tempted by too much i should like to know that john was firmly established in some good business which gave him an income large enough to keep free from debt and make meg comfortable not ambitious for a splendid fortune a fashionable position or a great name for my girls if rank and money come with love and virtue also i should accept them gratefully and enjoy your good fortune but i know by experience how much genuine happiness can be had in a plain little house where the daily bread is earned and some privations give sweetness to the few pleasures i am content to see meg begin humbly for if i am not mistaken she will be rich in the possession of a good heart and that is better than a fortune 
 i understand mother and quite agree but disappointed about meg for planned to have her marry teddy and sit in the lap of luxury all her days it be nice asked jo looking up with a brighter face 
 he is younger than she you know began mrs march but jo broke in 
 only a little old for his age and tall and can be quite in his manners if he likes then rich and generous and good and loves us all and i say a pity my plan is spoiled 
 afraid laurie is hardly enough for meg and altogether too much of a weathercock just now for anyone to depend on make plans jo but let time and their own hearts mate your friends we meddle safely in such matters and had better not get romantic rubbish as you call it into our heads lest it spoil our friendship 
 well i but i hate to see things going all crisscross and getting snarled up when a pull her and a snip there would straighten it out i wish wearing flatirons on our heads would keep us from growing up but buds will be roses and kittens cats the pity 
 that about flatirons and cats asked meg as she crept into the room with the finished letter in her hand 
 only one of my stupid speeches going to bed come peggy said jo unfolding herself like an animated puzzle 
 quite right and beautifully written please add that i send my love to john said mrs march as she glanced over the letter and gave it back 
 do you call him john asked meg smiling with her innocent eyes looking down into her 
 yes he has been like a son to us and we are very fond of him replied mrs march returning the look with a keen one 
 glad of that he is so lonely good night mother dear it is so inexpressibly comfortable to have you here was answer 
 the kiss her mother gave her was a very tender one and as she went away mrs march said with a mixture of satisfaction and regret she does not love john yet but will soon learn to

 marines trying to communicate with the men on the roof 
 are beginning to panic when agent jones comes around the 
 corner 
 sergeant 
 sir sir there was gunfire 
 lost communication with the roof 
 agent jones 
 remain at your posts 
 sergeant 
 but sir the fire we should evacuate 
 agent jones 
 you will do as you are ordered 
 sergeant 
 yes sir 
 agent jones marches into the presidential suite 
 
 int presidential suite matrix day 
 agent jones throws open the bedroom door and enters 
 walking through the puddles pooling in the carpet 
 over the rushing water and the alarms agent smith hears 
 a sound and understands the seriousness of the attack 
 he turns to the wall of windows as the helicopter drops 
 into view 
 neo is in the back bay aiming the mounted machine 
 gun 
 agent smith 
 no 
 the gun jumps and bullets explode through the window in a cacophony of crashing glass 
 as the agents go for their weapons 
 but neo is too close the caliber too fast and 
 bullets are everywhere perforating the room 
 agent smith is hit first his body back 
 blood arcing out with a sudden flash of light 
 then agent brown his gun still firing as his body falls 
 and finally agent jones 
 neo stares at morpheus trying to will him into action 
 neo 
 get up morpheus get up 
 morpheus sits unmoving his head still down 
 neo grabs the climbing rope just as marines burst into 
 the adjoining room 
 he attaches only one end to his harness when they open 
 fire 
 quickly he swings the gun spraying the other room 
 windows shattering furniture exploding marines diving for cover 
 
 int hall matrix day 
 just outside the presidential suite three marines 
 blister with 
 
 int presidential suite matrix day 
 morpheus lifts his face into the rain his eyes 
 still white begin to blink twitch then close 
 and when he opens them they are again dark and flashing 
 with fire 
 the agents knife into the room firing even as 
 bullet trails chase them 
 morpheus strains at his handcuffs 
 the agents and the marines turn the tide blasting lead 
 ricocheting the copter 
 firing wildly neo turns to see morpheus rising snapping 
 the handcuffs starting for the window 
 agent smith stops and sees morpheus run past the open 
 bedroom door 
 agent smith 
 nooo 
 he fires sweeping across the sheetrocked wall in a 
 perfect line 
 for an instant we see the bullets shred puncturing the 
 wall searing through the wet air with jet trails of 
 chalk 
 and as morpheus starts to dive for the window a bullet 
 buries itself in his leg 
 knocking him off balance 
 neo 
 he make it 
 morpheus lunges out of control 
 as neo spins every move a whip crack 
 snapping the other onto a bolted bar 
 morpheus begins to fall when neo hurls himself into the 
 wide blue empty space 
 flying for a moment 
 the rope snaking out behind him an umbilical cord 
 attached to a machine 
 as their two bodies set in motion rushing at each other 
 on a seemingly magnetic course until 
 they collide 
 almost bouncing free of each other arms legs 
 scrambling hands searching in furious desperation 
 finding hold and clinging 
 until the line ends snapping taut cracking their 
 fragile embrace morpheus tumbles legs flipping over 
 falling down 
 the ground deliriously distant 
 as neo snatches hold of his still handcuffed wrist 
 neo 
 gotcha 
 trinity is already pulling the copter up and away 
 as agent smith grabs the m from the nearest marine 
 bring them all down targeting the helicopter he 
 aims at something only he can see the oil line 
 ponk ponk ponk the rear hull is punched full of 
 holes and smoke and oil pours out like black blood

 neo is pulling morpheus up to him when he hears the 
 helicopter begin to die 
 neo 
 oh fuck 
 trinity throws the helicopter towards the roof of the 
 nearest building 
 morpheus and neo cling to one another as they and the 
 machine above them begin to fall 
 the engine grinds the chopping blades start to slow 
 while 
 the agents stand in the open shattered window watching 
 the helicopter disappear behind taller buildings 
 carried by its nomentum trinity guides the parabolic 
 fall over the nearest roof where 
 neo and morpheus drop safely rolling free as the rope 
 goes slack neo gets to his feet trying to detach 
 himself but 
 the helicopter is falling too fast arcing over the roof 
 like a setting sun 
 the coils of slack snap taught 
 yanking neo off his feet dragging him with ferocious 
 speed towards the edge even as 
 trinity lunges for the back door her gun in one hand 
 grabbing for the rope with the other 
 neo flies like a skipping stone hurtling straight at us 
 when his feet hit the rain gutter 
 a fulcrum that levers him up just as 
 trinity fires severing the cord from the helicopter 
 falling free of it as it smashes blades first into a 
 glass skyscraper 
 holding onto the rope she swings connected to neo who 
 stands on the edge watching her arc beneath 
 him as the helicopter explodes 
 she bounces against a shatterproof window that spider 
 cracks out while flames erupt behind her

 harry had never been part of a stranger group crookshanks led the way down the stairs lupin pettigrew and ron went next looking like entrants in a race next came professor snape drifting creepily along his toes hitting each stair as they descended held up by his own wand which was being pointed at him by sirius harry and hermione brought up the rear 
 
 getting back into the tunnel was difficult lupin pettigrew and ron had to turn sideways to manage it lupin still had pettigrew covered with his wand harry could see them edging awkwardly along the tunnel in single file crookshanks was still in the lead harry went right after black who was still making snape drift along ahead of them he kept bumping his lolling head on the low ceiling harry had the impression black was making no effort to prevent this 
 
 you know what this means black said abruptly to harry as they made their slow progress along the tunnel turning pettigrew in 
 
 free said harry 
 
 yes said black but also i know if anyone ever told you your godfather 
 
 yeah i knew that said harry 
 
 well your parents appointed me your guardian said black stiffly if anything happened to them 
 
 harry waited did black mean what he thought he meant 
 
 understand of course if you want to stay with your aunt and uncle said black but well think about it once my cleared if you wanted a a different home 
 
 some sort of explosion took place in the pit of stomach 
 
 what live with you he said accidentally cracking his head on a bit of rock protruding from the ceiling leave the dursleys 
 
 of course i thought you want to said black quickly i understand i just thought 
 
 are you insane said harry his voice easily as croaky as of course i want to leave the dursleys have you got a house when can i move in 
 
 black turned right around to look at him head was scraping the ceiling but black seem to care 
 
 you want to he said you mean it 
 
 yeah i mean it said harry 
 
 gaunt face broke into the first true smile harry had seen upon it the difference it made was startling as though a person ten years younger were shining through the starved mask for a moment he was recognizable as the man who had laughed at parents wedding 
 
 they did not speak again until they had reached the end of the tunnel crookshanks darted up first he had evidently pressed his paw to the knot on the trunk because lupin pettigrew and ron clambered upward without any sound of savaging branches 
 
 black saw snape up through the hole then stood back for harry and hermione to pass at last all of them were out 
 
 the grounds were very dark now the only light came from the distant windows of the castle without a word they set off pettigrew was still wheezing and occasionally whimpering mind was buzzing he was going to leave the dursleys he was going to live with sirius black his parents best friend he felt dazed what would happen when he told the dursleys he was going to live with the convict seen on television 
 
 one wrong move peter said lupin threateningly ahead his wand was still pointed sideways at chest 
 
 silently they tramped through the grounds the castle lights growing slowly larger snape was still drifting weirdly ahead of black his chin bumping on his chest and then 
 
 a cloud shifted there were suddenly dim shadows on the ground their party was bathed in moonlight 
 
 snape collided with lupin pettigrew and ron who had stopped abruptly black froze he flung out one arm to make harry and hermione stop 
 
 harry could see silhouette he had gone rigid then his limbs began to shake 
 
 oh my hermione gasped he take his potion tonight not safe 
 
 run black whispered run now 
 
 but harry run ron was chained to pettigrew and lupin he leapt forward but black caught him around the chest and threw him back 
 
 leave it to me run 
 
 there was a terrible snarling noise head was lengthening so was his body his shoulders were hunching hair was sprouting visibly on his face and hands which were curling into clawed paws hair was on end again he was backing away 
 
 as the werewolf reared snapping its long jaws sirius disappeared from side he had transformed the enormous bearlike dog bounded forward as the werewolf wrenched itself free of the manacle binding it the dog seized it about the neck and pulled it backward away from ron and pettigrew they were locked jaw to jaw claws ripping at each other 
 
 harry stood transfixed by the sight too intent upon the battle to notice anything else it was scream that alerted him 
 
 pettigrew had dived for dropped wand ron unsteady on his bandaged leg fell there was a bang a burst of light and ron lay motionless on the ground another bang crookshanks flew into the air and back to the earth in a heap 
 
 expelliarmus harry yelled pointing his own wand at pettigrew wand flew high into the air and out of sight stay where you are harry shouted running forward 
 
 too late pettigrew had transformed harry saw his bald tail whip through the manacle on outstretched arm and heard a scurrying through the grass 
 
 there was a howl and a rumbling growl harry turned to see the werewolf taking flight it was galloping into the forest 
 
 sirius gone pettigrew transformed harry yelled 
 
 black was bleeding there were gashes across his muzzle and back but at words he scrambled up again and in an instant the sound of his paws faded to silence as he pounded away across the grounds 
 
 harry and hermione dashed over to ron 
 
 what did he do to him hermione whispered eyes were only his mouth hung open he was definitely alive they could hear him breathing but he seem to recognize them 
 
 i know 
 
 harry looked desperately around black and lupin both gone they had no one but snape for company still hanging unconscious in midair 
 
 better get them up to the castle and tell someone said harry pushing his hair out of his eyes trying to think straight come 
 
 but then from beyond the range of their vision they heard a yelping a whining a dog in pain 
 
 sirius harry muttered staring into the darkness 
 
 he had a indecision but there was nothing they could do for ron at the moment and by the sound of it black was in trouble 
 
 harry set off at a run hermione right behind him the yelping seemed to be coming from the ground near the edge of the lake they pelted toward it and harry running flat out felt the cold without realizing what it must mean 
 
 the yelping stopped abruptly as they reached the lakeshore they saw why sirius had turned back into a man he was crouched on all fours his hands over his head 
 
 nooo he moaned nooo please 
 
 and then harry saw them dementors at least a hundred of them gliding in a black mass around the lake toward them he spun around the familiar icy cold penetrating his insides fog starting to obscure his vision more were appearing out of the darkness on every side they were encircling them 
 
 hermione think of something happy harry yelled raising his wand blinking furiously to try and clear his vision shaking his head to rid it of the faint screaming that had started inside it 
 
 going to live with my godfather leaving the dursleys 
 
 he forced himself to think of black and only black and began to chant expecto patronum expecto patronum 
 
 black gave a shudder rolled over and lay motionless on the ground pale as death 
 
 be all right going to go and live with him 
 
 expecto patronum hermione help me expecto patronum 
 
 expecto hermione whispered expecto expecto 
 
 but she do it the dementors were closing in barely ten feet from them they formed a solid wall around harry and hermione and were getting closer 
 
 expecto patronum harry yelled trying to blot the screaming from his ears expecto patronum 
 
 a thin wisp of silver escaped his wand and hovered like mist before him at the same moment harry felt hermione collapse next to him he was alone completely alone 
 
 expecto expecto patronum 
 
 harry felt his knees hit the cold grass fog was clouding his eyes with a huge effort he fought to remember sirius was innocent innocent be okay going to live with him 
 
 expecto patronum he gasped 
 
 by the feeble light of his formless patronus he saw a dementor halt very close to him it walk through the cloud of silver mist harry had conjured a dead slimy hand slid out from under the cloak it made a gesture as though to sweep the patronus aside 
 
 no no harry gasped innocent expecto expecto patronum 
 
 he could feet them watching him hear their rattling breath like an evil wind around him the nearest dementor seemed to be considering him then it raised both its rotting hands and lowered its hood 
 
 where there should have been eyes there was only thin gray scabbed skin stretched blankly over empty sockets but there was a mouth a gaping shapeless hole sucking the air with the sound of a death rattle 
 
 a paralyzing terror filled harry so that he move or speak his patronus flickered and died 
 
 white fog was blinding him he had to fight expecto patronum he see and in the distance he heard the familiar screaming expecto patronum he groped in the mist for sirius and found his arm they going to take him 
 
 but a pair of strong clammy hands suddenly attached themselves around neck they were forcing his face upward he could feel its breath it was going to get rid of him first he could feel its putrid breath his mother was screaming in his ears she was going to be the last thing he ever heard 
 
 and then through the fog that was drowning him he thought he saw a silvery light growing brighter and brighter he felt himself fall forward onto the grass facedown too weak to move sick and shaking harry opened his eyes the dementor must have released him the blinding light was illuminating the grass around himthe screaming had stopped the cold was ebbing away 
 
 something was driving the dementors back it was circling around him and black and hermione they were leaving 
 
 the air was warm again 
 
 with every ounce of strength he could muster harry raised his head a few inches and saw an animal amid the light galloping away across the lake eyes blurred with sweat harry tried to make out what it was it was as bright as a unicorn fighting to stay conscious harry watched it to a halt as it reached the opposite shore for a moment harry saw by its brightness somebody welcoming it back raising his hand to pat it someone who looked strangely familiar but it be 
 
 harry understand he think anymore he felt the last of his strength leave him and his head hit the ground as he fainted 
 
 rowling

lionfish nov chapter twenty the first taskcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 harry got up on sunday morning and dressed so inattentively that it was a while before he realized he was trying to pull his hat onto his foot instead of his sock when finally got all his clothes on the right parts of his body he hurried off to find hermione locating her at the gryffindor table in the great hall where she was eating breakfast with ginny feeling too queasy to eat harry waited until hermione had swallowed her last spoonful of porridge then dragged her out onto the grounds there he told her all about the dragons and about everything sirius had said while they took another long walk around the lake 
 
 alarmed as she was by warnings about karkaroff hermione still thought that the dragons were the more pressing problem 
 
 just try and keep you alive until tuesday evening she said desperately and then we can worry about karkaroff 
 
 they walked three times around the lake trying all the way to think of a simple spell that would subdue a dragon nothing whatsoever occurred to them so they retired to the library instead here harry pulled down every book he could find on dragons and both of them set to work searching through the large pile 
 
 by charmstreating this is no good this is for nutters like hagrid who want to keep them healthy 
 
 dragons are extremely difficult to slay owing to the ancient magic that imbues their thick hides which none but the most powerful spells can penetrate but sirius said a simple one would do it 
 
 try some simple spellbooks then said harry throwing aside men who love dragons too much 
 
 he returned to the table with a pile of spellbooks set them down and began to flick through each in turn hermione whispering nonstop at his elbow 
 
 well there are switching spellsbut the point of switching it unless you swapped its fangs for or something that would make it less trouble is like that book said not much is going to get through a say transfigure it but something that big you really got a hope i doubt even professor mcgonagallunless supposed to put the spell on yourself maybe to give yourself extra powers but not simple spells i mean we done any of those in class i only know about them because been doing practice papers 
 
 hermione harry said through gritted teeth will you shut up for a bit please i m trying to concentrate 
 
 but all that happened when hermione fell silent was that brain filled with a sort of blank buzzing which seem to allow room for concentration he stared hopelessly down the index of basic hexes for the busy and vexed instant scalpingbut dragons had no hairpepper breaththat would probably increase a firepowerhorn tonguejust what he needed to give it an extra weapon 
 
 oh no back again why he read on his stupid ship said hermione irritably as viktor krum slouched in cast a surly look over at the pair of them and settled himself in a distant corner with a pile of books come on harry go back to the common roomhis fan be here in a moment twittering away 
 
 and sure enough as they left the library a gang of girls tiptoed past them one of them wearing a bulgaria scarf tied around her waist 
 
 
 
 harry barely slept that night when he awoke on monday morning he seriously considered for the first time ever just running away from hogwarts but as he looked around the great hall at breakfast time and thought about what leaving the castle would mean he knew he do it it was the only place he had ever been happywell he supposed he must have been happy with his parents too but he remember that 
 
 somehow the knowledge that he would rather be here and facing a dragon than back on privet drive with dudley was good to know it made him feel slightly calmer he finished his bacon with difficulty his throat working too well and as he and hermione got up he saw cedric diggory leaving the hufflepuff table 
 
 cedric still know about the dragonsthe only champion who if harry was right in thinking that maxime and karkaroff would have told fleur and krum 
 
 hermione see you in the greenhouses harry said coming to his decision as he watched cedric leaving the hall go on catch you up 
 
 harry be late the about to ring 
 
 catch you up okay 
 
 by the time harry reached the bottom of the marble staircase cedric was at the top he was with a load of friends harry want to talk to cedric in front of them they were among those who had been quoting rita article at him every time he went near them he followed cedric at a distance and saw that he was heading toward the charms corridor this gave harry an idea pausing at a distance from them he pulled out his wand and took careful aim 
 
 diffindo 
 
 bag split parchment quills and books spilled out of it onto the floor several bottles of ink smashed 
 
 bother said cedric in an exasperated voice as his friends bent down to help him tell flitwick coming go on 
 
 this was exactly what harry had been hoping for he slipped his wand back into his robes waited until friends had disappeared into their classroom and hurried up the corridor which was now empty of everyone but himself and cedric 
 
 hi said cedric picking up a copy of a guide to advanced transfiguration that was now splattered with ink my bag just and all 
 
 cedric said harry the first task is dragons 
 
 what said cedric looking up 
 
 dragons said harry speaking quickly in case professor flitwick came out to see where cedric had got to got four one for each of us and got to get past them 
 
 cedric stared at him harry saw some of the panic been feeling since saturday night flickering in gray eyes 
 
 are you sure cedric said in a hushed voice 
 
 dead sure said harry seen them 
 
 but how did you find out not supposed to know 
 
 never mind said harry quickly he knew hagrid would be in trouble if he told the truth but not the only one who knows fleur and krum will know by now maxime and karkaroff both saw the dragons too 
 
 cedric straightened up his arms full of inky quills parchment and books his ripped bag dangling off one shoulder he stared at harry and there was a puzzled almost suspicious look in his eyes 
 
 why are you telling me he asked 
 
 harry looked at him in disbelief he was sure cedric have asked that if he had seen the dragons himself harry have let his worst enemy face those monsters unprepared well perhaps malfoy or snape 
 
 justfair it he said to cedric we all know on an even footing we 
 
 cedric was still hooking at him in a slightly suspicious way when harry heard a familiar clunking noise behind him he turned around and saw moody emerging from a nearby classroom 
 
 come with me potter he growled diggory off you go 
 
 harry stared apprehensively at moody had he overheard them 
 
 er professor supposed to be in herbology 
 
 never mind that potter in my office please 
 
 harry followed him wondering what was going to happen to him now what if moody wanted to know how found out about the dragons would moody go to dumbledore and tell on hagrid or just turn harry into a ferret well it might be easier to get past a dragon if he were a ferret harry thought dully be smaller much less easy to see from a height of fifty feet 
 
 he followed moody into his office moody closed the door behind them and turned to look at harry his magical eye fixed upon him as well as the normal one 
 
 that was a very decent thing you just did potter moody said quietly 
 
 harry know what to say this the reaction he had expected at all 
 
 sit down said moody and harry sat looking around 
 
 he had visited this office under two of its previous occupants in professor day the walls had been plastered with beaming winking pictures of professor lockhart himself when lupin had lived here you were more likely to come across a specimen of some fascinating new dark creature he had procured for them to study in class now however the office was full of a number of exceptionally odd objects that harry supposed moody had used in the days when he had been an auror 
 
 on his desk stood what looked hike a large cracked glass spinning top harry recognized it at once as a sneakoscope because he owned one himself though it was much smaller than in the corner on a small table stood an object that looked something like an golden television aerial it was humming slightly what appeared to be a mirror hung opposite harry on the wall but it was not reflecting the room shadowy figures were moving around inside it none of them clearly in focus 
 
 like my dark detectors do you said moody who was watching harry closely 
 
 that harry asked pointing at the squiggly golden aerial 
 
 secrecy sensor vibrates when it detects concealment and liesno use here of course too much interference students in every direction lying about why they done their homework been humming ever since i got here i had to disable my sneakoscope because it stop whistling picks up stuff about a mile around of course it could be picking up more than kid stuff he added in a growl 
 
 and the mirror for 
 
 oh my see them out there skulking around not really in trouble until i see the whites of their eyes when i open my trunk 
 
 he let out a short harsh laugh and pointed to the large trunk under the window it had seven keyholes in a row harry wondered what was in there until next question brought him sharply back to earth 
 
 sofound out about the dragons have you 
 
 harry hesitated been afraid of this but he told cedric and he certainly going to tell moody that hagrid had broken the rules 
 
 all right said moody sitting down and stretching out his wooden leg with a groan a traditional part of the triwizard tournament and always has been 
 
 i cheat said harry sharply it was a sort of accident that i found out 
 
 moody grinned i accusing you laddie been telling dumbledore from the start he can be as as he likes but you can bet old karkaroff and maxime be have told their champions everything they can they want to win they want to beat dumbledore like to prove only human 
 
 moody gave another harsh laugh and his magical eye swiveled around so fast it made harry feel queasy to watch it 
 
 sogot any ideas how going to get past your dragon yet said moody 
 
 no said harry 
 
 well not going to tell you said moody gruffly i show favoritism me just going to give you some good general advice and the first bit is play to your strengths 
 
 i got any said harry before he could stop himself 
 
 excuse me growled moody got strengths if i say got them think now what are you best at 
 
 harry tried to concentrate what was he best at well that was easy really 
 
 quidditch he said dully and a fat lot of help 
 
 right said moody staring at him very hard his magical eye barely moving at all a damn good flier from what heard 
 
 yeah but harry stared at him not allowed a broom only got my wand 
 
 my second piece of general advice said moody loudly interrupting him is to use a nice simple spell that will enable you to get what you need 
 
 harry looked at him blankly what did he need 
 
 come on boy whispered moody put them not that difficult 
 
 and it clicked he was best at flying he needed to pass the dragon in the air for that he needed his firebolt and for his he needed 
 
 
 
 hermione harry whispered when he had sped into greenhouse three minutes later uttering a hurried apology to professor sprout as he passed her hermione i need you to help me 
 
 what think been trying to do harry she whispered back her eyes round with anxiety over the top of the quivering flutterby bush she was pruning 
 
 hermione i need to learn how to do a summoning charm properly by tomorrow afternoon 
 
 and so they practiced they have lunch but headed for a free classroom where harry tried with all his might to make various objects fly across the room toward him he was still having problems the books and quills kept losing heart halfway across the room and dropping hike stones to the floor 
 
 concentrate harry concentrate 
 
 what think trying to do said harry angrily a great big dragon keeps popping up in my head for some reasonokay try again 
 
 he wanted to skip divination to keep practicing but hermione refused to skive off arithmancy and there was no point in staying without her he therefore had to endure over an hour of professor trelawney who spent half the lesson telling everyone that the position of mars with relation to saturn at that moment meant that people born in july were in great danger of sudden violent deaths 
 
 well good said harry loudly his temper getting the better of him just as long as not i want to suffer 
 
 ron looked for a moment as though he was going to laugh he certainly caught eye for the first time in days but harry was still feeling too resentful toward ron to care he spent the rest of the lesson trying to attract small objects toward him under the table with his wand he managed to make a fly zoom straight into his hand though he entirely sure that was his prowess at summoning charms perhaps the fly was just stupid 
 
 he forced down some dinner after divination then returned to the empty classroom with hermione using the invisibility cloak to avoid the teachers they kept practicing until past midnight they would have stayed longer but peeves turned up and pretending to think that harry wanted things thrown at him started chucking chairs across the room harry and hermione left in a hurry before the noise attracted filch and went back to the gryffindor common room which was now mercifully empty 
 
 at two in the morning harry stood near the fireplace surrounded by heaps of objects books quills several upturned chairs an old set of gobstones and toad trevor only in the last hour had harry really got the hang of the summoning charm 
 
 better harry loads better hermione said looking exhausted but very pleased 
 
 well now we know what to do next time i manage a spell harry said throwing a rune dictionary back to hermione so he could try again threaten me with a dragon right he raised his wand once more accio dictionary 
 
 the heavy book soared out of hand flew across the room and harry caught it 
 
 harry i really think got it said hermione delightedly 
 
 just as long as it works tomorrow harry said the going to be much farther away than the stuff in here going to be in the castle and going to be out there on the grounds 
 
 that matter said hermione firmly just as long as concentrating really really hard on it come harry better get some going to need it 
 
 
 
 harry had been focusing so hard on learning the summoning charm that evening that some of his blind panic had heft him it returned in full measure however on the following morning the atmosphere in the school was one of great tension and excitement lessons were to stop at midday giving all the students time to get down to the dragons enclosure though of course they yet know what they would find there 
 
 harry felt oddly separate from everyone around him whether they were wishing him good luck or hissing have a box of tissues ready potter as he passed it was a state of nervousness so advanced that he wondered whether he just lose his head when they tried to lead him out to his dragon and start trying to curse everyone in sight time was behaving in a more peculiar fashion than ever rushing past in great dollops so that one moment he seemed to be sitting down in his first lesson history of magic and the next walking into lunchand then where had the morning gone the last of the hours professor mcgonagall was hurrying over to him in the great hall lots of people were watching 
 
 potter the champions have to come down onto the grounds have to get ready for your first task 
 
 okay said harry standing up his fork falling onto his plate with a clatter 
 
 good luck harry hermione whispered be fine 
 
 yeah said harry in a voice that was most unlike his own 
 
 he heft the great hall with professor mcgonagall she seem herself either in fact she looked nearly as anxious as hermione as she walked him down the stone steps and out into the cold november afternoon she put her hand on his shoulder 
 
 now panic she said just keep a cool got wizards standing by to control the situation if it gets out of main thing is just to do your best and nobody will think any the worse of you all right 
 
 yes harry heard himself say yes fine 
 
 she was leading him toward the place where the dragons were around the edge of the forest but when they approached the clump of trees behind which the enclosure would be clearly visible harry saw that a tent had been erected its entrance facing them screening the dragons from view 
 
 to go in here with the other champions said professor mcgonagall in a rather shaky sort of voice and wait for your turn potter mr bagman is in be telling you the the procedure good luck 
 
 thanks said harry in a flat distant voice she left him at the entrance of the tent harry went inside 
 
 fleur delacour was sitting in a corner on a how wooden stool she look nearly as composed as usual but rather pale and clammy viktor krum looked even surlier than usual which harry supposed was his way of showing nerves cedric was pacing up and down when harry entered cedric gave him a small smile which harry returned feeling the muscles in his face working rather hard as though they had forgotten how to do it 
 
 harry said bagman happily looking around at him come in come in make yourself at home 
 
 bagman looked somehow like a slightly overblown cartoon figure standing amid all the champions he was wearing his old wasp robes again 
 
 well now all here time to fill you in said bagman brightly when the audience has assembled going to be offering each of you this bag he held up a small sack of purple silk and shook it at them from which you will each select a small model of the thing you are about to face there are different er varieties you see and i have to tell you something else tooah yesyour task is to collect the golden egg 
 
 harry glanced around cedric had nodded once to show that he understood words and then started pacing around the tent again he looked slightly green fleur delacour and krum reacted at all perhaps they thought they might be sick if they opened their mouths that was certainly how harry felt but they at least had volunteered for this 
 
 and in no time at all hundreds upon hundreds of pairs of feet could be heard passing the tent their owners talking excitedly laughing felt as separate from the crowd as though they were a different species and then it seemed like about a second later to harry bagman was opening the neck of the purple silk sack 
 
 ladies first he said offering it to fleur delacour 
 
 she put a shaking hand inside the bag and drew out a tiny perfect model of a dragon a welsh green it had the number two around its neck and harry knew by the fact that fleur showed no sign of surprise but rather a determined resignation that he had been right madame maxime had told her what was coming 
 
 the same held true for krum he pulled out the scarlet chinese fireball it had a number three around its neck he even blink just sat back down and stared at the ground 
 
 cedric put his hand into the bag and out came the swedish the number one tied around its neck knowing what was left harry put his hand into the silk bag and pulled out the hungarian horntail and the number four it stretched its wings as he looked down at it and bared its minuscule fangs 
 
 well there you are said bagman you have each pulled out the dragon you will face and the numbers refer to the order in which you are to take on the dragons do you see now going to have to leave you in a moment because commentating mr diggory first just go out into the enclosure when you hear a whistle all right nowharrycould i have a quick word outside 
 
 eryes said harry blankly and he got up and went out of the tent with bagman who walked him a short distance away into the trees and then turned to him with a fatherly expression on his face 
 
 feeling all right harry anything i can get you 
 
 what said harry i no nothing 
 
 got a plan said bagman lowering his voice conspiratorially because i mind sharing a few pointers if like them you know i mean bagman continued lowering his voice still further the underdog here i can do to help 
 
 no said harry so quickly he knew he had sounded rude no i i know what going to do thanks 
 
 nobody would know harry said bagman winking at him 
 
 no fine said harry wondering why he kept telling people this and wondering whether he had ever been less fine got a plan worked out i 
 
 a whistle had blown somewhere 
 
 good lord got to run said bagman in alarm and he hurried off 
 
 harry walked back to the tent and saw cedric emerging from it greener than ever harry tried to wish him luck as he walked past but all that came out of his mouth was a sort of hoarse grunt 
 
 harry went back inside to fleur and krum seconds hater they heard the roar of the crowd which meant cedric had entered the enclosure and was now with the living counterpart of his model 
 
 it was worse than harry could ever have imagined sitting there and listening the crowd screamedyelledgasped like a single entity as cedric did whatever he was doing to get past the swedish krum was still staring at the ground fleur had now taken to retracing steps around and around the tent and commentary made everything much much pictures formed in mind as he heard oooh narrow miss there very narrow taking risks this move pity it work 
 
 and then after about fifteen minutes harry heard the deafening roar that could mean only one thing cedric had gotten past his dragon and captured the golden egg 
 
 very good indeed bagman was shouting and now the marks from the judges 
 
 but he shout out the marks harry supposed the judges were holding them up and showing them to the crowd 
 
 one down three to go bagman yelled as the whistle blew again miss delacour if you please 
 
 fleur was trembling from head to foot harry felt more warmly toward her than he had done so far as she heft the tent with her head held high and her hand clutching her wand he and krum were left alone at opposite sides of the tent avoiding each gaze 
 
 the same process started not sure that was wise they could hear bagman shouting gleefully ohnearly careful nowgood lord i thought had it then 
 
 ten minutes later harry heard the crowd erupt into applause once must have been successful too a pause while marks were being shownmore clappingthen for the third time the whistle 
 
 and here comes mr krum cried bagman and krum slouched out leaving harry quite alone 
 
 he felt much more aware of his body than usual very aware of the way his heart was pumping fast and his fingers tingling with fearyet at the same time he seemed to be outside himself seeing the walls of the tent and hearing the crowd as though from far away 
 
 very daring bagman was yelling and harry heard the chinese fireball emit a horrible roaring shriek while the crowd drew its collective breath some nerve showing and yes got the egg 
 
 applause shattered the wintery air like breaking glass krum had finished it would be turn any moment 
 
 he stood up noticing dimly that his legs seemed to be made of marshmallow he waited and then he heard the whistle blow he walked out through the entrance of the tent the panic rising into a crescendo inside him and now he was walking past the trees through a gap in the enclosure fence 
 
 he saw everything in front of him as though it was a very highly colored dream there were hundreds and hundreds of faces staring down at him from stands that had been magicked there since last stood on this spot and there was the horntail at the other end of the enclosure crouched low over her clutch of eggs her wings her evil yellow eyes upon him a monstrous scaly black lizard thrashing her spiked tail heaving gouge marks in the hard ground the crowd was making a great deal of noise but whether friendly or not harry know or care it was time to do what he had to doto focus his mind entirely and absolutely upon the thing that was his only chance 
 
 he raised his wand 
 
 accio firebolt he shouted 
 
 harry waited every fiber of him hoping it workedif it cominghe seemed to be looking at everything around him through some sort of shimmering transparent barrier like a heat haze which made the enclosure and the hundreds of faces around him swim strangely 
 
 and then he heard it speeding through the air behind him he turned and saw his firebolt hurtling toward him around the edge of the woods soaring into the enclosure and stopping dead in midair beside him waiting for him to mount the crowd was making even more was shouting somethingbut ears were not working properly anymorelistening important 
 
 he swung his leg over the broom and kicked off from the ground and a second later something miraculous happened 
 
 as he soared upward as the wind rushed through his hair as the faces became mere pinpnicks below and the horntail shrank to the size of a dog he realized that he had left not only the ground behind but also his was back where he belonged 
 
 this was just another quidditch match that was alljust another quidditch match and that horntail was just another ugly opposing team 
 
 he looked down at the clutch of eggs and spotted the gold one gleaming against its fellows residing safely between the front legs okay harry told himself diversionary go 
 
 he dived the head followed him he knew what it was going to do and pulled out of the dive just in time a jet of fire had been released exactly where he would have been had he not swerved awaybut harry carethat was no more than dodging a bludger 
 
 great scott he can fly yelled bagman as the crowd shrieked and gasped are you watching this mr krum 
 
 harry soared higher in a circle the horntail was still following his progress its head revolving on its long neck if he kept this up it would be nicely dizzy but better not push it too long or it would be breathing fire again 
 
 harry plummeted just as the horntail opened its mouth but this time he was less lucky he missed the flames but the tail came whipping up to meet him instead and as he swerved to the left one of the long spikes grazed his shoulder ripping his robes 
 
 he could feel it stinging he could hear screaming and groans from the crowd but the cut seem to be he zoomed around the back of the horntail and a possibility occurred to him 
 
 the horntail seem to want to take off she was too protective of her eggs though she writhed and twisted furling and unfurling her wings and keeping those fearsome yellow eyes on harry she was afraid to move too far from thembut he had to persuade her to do it or never get near trick was to do it carefully gradually 
 
 he began to fly first this way then the other not near enough to make her breathe fire to stave him off but still posing a sufficient threat to ensure she kept her eyes on him her head swayed this way and that watching him out of those vertical pupils her fangs bared 
 
 he flew higher the head rose with him her neck now stretched to its fullest extent still swaying hike a snake before its charmer 
 
 harry rose a few more feet and she let out a roar of exasperation he was like a fly to her a fly she was longing to swat her tail thrashed again but he was too high to reach shot fire into the air which he jaws opened wide 
 
 come on harry hissed swerving tantalizingly above her come on come and get meup you get now 
 
 and then she reared spreading her great black leathery wings at last as wide as those of a small airplane and harry dived before the dragon knew what he had done or where he had disappeared to he was speeding toward the ground as fast as he could go toward the eggs now unprotected by her clawed front legs he had taken his hands off his firebolt he had seized the golden egg 
 
 and with a huge spurt of speed he was off he was soaring out over the stands the heavy egg safely under his uninjured arm and it was as though somebody had just turned the volume back up for the first time he became properly aware of the noise of the crowd which was screaming and applauding as loudly as the irish supporters at the world cup 
 
 look at that bagman was yelling will you look at that our youngest champion is quickest to get his egg well this is going to shorten the odds on mr potter 
 
 harry saw the dragon keepers rushing forward to subdue the horntail and over at the entrance to the enclosure professor mcgonagall professor moody and hagrid hurrying to meet him all of them waving him toward them their smiles evident even from this distance he flew back over the stands the noise of the crowd pounding his eardrums and came in smoothly to land his heart lighter than it had been in had got through the first task he had survived 
 
 that was excellent potter cried professor mcgonagall as he got off the firebolt which from her was extravagant praise he noticed that her hand shook as she pointed at his shoulder need to see madam pomfrey before the judges give out your there had to mop up diggory already 
 
 yeh did it harry said hagrid hoarsely yeh did it an agains the horntail an all an yeh know charlie said that was the wors 
 
 thanks hagrid said harry loudly so that hagrid blunder on and reveal that he had shown harry the dragons beforehand 
 
 professor moody looked very pleased too his magical eye was dancing in its socket 
 
 nice and easy does the trick potter he growled 
 
 right then potter the first aid tent please said professor mcgonagall 
 
 harry walked out of the enclosure still panting and saw madam pomfrey standing at the mouth of a second tent looking worried 
 
 dragons she said in a disgusted tone pulling harry inside the tent was divided into cubicles he could make out shadow through the canvas but cedric seem to be badly injured he was sitting up at least madam pomfrey examined shoulder talking furiously all the while last year dementors this year dragons what are they going to bring into this school next very luckythis is quite need cleaning before i heal it up though 
 
 she cleaned the cut with a dab of some purple liquid that smoked and stung but then poked his shoulder with her wand and he felt it heal instantly 
 
 now just sit quietly for a minute sit and then you can go and get your score 
 
 she bustled out of the tent and he heard her go next door and say how does it feel now diggory 
 
 harry want to sit still he was too full of adrenaline he got to his feet wanting to see what was going on outside but before reached the mouth of the tent two people had come darting inside hermione followed closely by ron 
 
 harry you were brilliant hermione said squeakily there were fingernail marks on her face where she had been clutching it in fear you were amazing you really were 
 
 but harry was looking at ron who was very white and staring at harry as though he were a ghost 
 
 harry he said very seriously whoever put your name in that goblet i i reckon trying to do you in 
 
 it was as though the last few weeks had never happened as though harry were meeting ron for the first time right after been made champion 
 
 caught on have you said harry coldly took you long enough 
 
 hermione stood nervously between them looking from one to the other ron opened his mouth uncertainly harry knew ron was about to apologize and suddenly he found he need to hear it 
 
 okay he said before ron could get the words out forget it 
 
 no said ron i 
 
 forget it harry said 
 
 ron grinned nervously at him and harry grinned back 
 
 hermione burst into tears 
 
 nothing to cry about harry told her bewildered 
 
 you two are so stupid she shouted stamping her foot on the ground tears splashing down her front then before either of them could stop her she had given both of them a hug and dashed away now positively howling 
 
 barking mad said ron shaking his head harry be putting up your scores 
 
 picking up the golden egg and his firebolt feeling more elated than he would have believed possible an hour ago harry ducked out of the tent ron by his side talking fast 
 
 you were the best you know no competition cedric did this weird thing where he transfigured a rock on the groundturned it into a doghe was trying to make the dragon go for the dog instead of him well it was a pretty cool bit of transfiguration and it sort of worked because he did get the egg but he got burned as well the dragon changed its mind halfway through and decided it would rather have him than the labrador he only just got away and that fleur girl tried this sort of charm i think she was trying to put it into a trance well that kind of worked too it went all sleepy but then it snored and this great jet of flame shot out and her skirt caught fire she put it out with a bit of water out of her wand and krum you believe this but he even think of flying he was probably the best after you though hit it with some sort of spell right in the eye only thing is it went trampling around in agony and squashed half the real eggs they took marks off for that he supposed to do any damage to them 
 
 ron drew breath as he and harry reached the edge of the enclosure now that the horntail had been taken away harry could see where the five judges were sitting right at the other end in raised seats draped in gold 
 
 marks out of ten from each one ron said and harry squinting up the field saw the first judge madame maxime raise her wand in the air what hooked like a long silver ribbon shot out of it which twisted itself into a large figure eight 
 
 not bad said ron as the crowd applauded i suppose she took marks off for your shoulder 
 
 mr crouch came next he shot a number nine into the air 
 
 looking good ron yelled thumping harry on the back 
 
 next dumbledore he too put up a nine the crowd was cheering harder than ever 
 
 ludo bagman ten 
 
 ten said harry in disbelief buti got he playing at 
 
 harry complain ron yelled excitedly 
 
 and now karkaroff raised his wand he paused for a moment and then a number shot out of his wand too four 
 
 what ron bellowed furiously four you lousy biased you gave krum ten 
 
 but harry care he have cared if karkaroff had given him zero indignation on his behalf was worth about a hundred points to him he tell ron this of course but his heart felt lighter than air as he turned to leave the enclosure and it just ronthose only gryffindors cheering in the crowd when it had come to it when they had seen what he was facing most of the school had been on his side as well as care about the slytherins he could stand whatever they threw at him now 
 
 tied in first place harry you and krum said charlie weasley hurrying to meet them as they set off back toward the school listen got to run got to go and send mum an owl i swore tell her what happened but that was unbelievable oh yeah and they told me to tell you got to hang around for a few more wants a word back in the champions tent 
 
 ron said he would wait so harry reentered the tent which somehow looked quite different now friendly and welcoming he thought back to how felt while dodging the horntail and compared it to the long wait before walked out to face was no comparison the wait had been immeasurably worse 
 
 fleur cedric and krum all came in together one side of face was covered in a thick orange paste which was presumably mending his burn he grinned at harry when he saw him 
 
 good one harry 
 
 and you said harry grinning back 
 
 well done all of you said ludo bagman bouncing into the tent and looking as pleased as though he personally had just got past a dragon now just a quick few words got a nice long break before the second task which will take place at half past nine on the morning of february the but giving you something to think about in the meantime if you look down at those golden eggs all holding you will see that they opensee the hinges there you need to solve the clue inside the egg because it will tell you what the second task is and enable you to prepare for it all clear sure well off you go then 
 
 harry left the tent rejoined ron and they started to walk back around the edge of the forest talking hard harry wanted to hear what the other champions had done in more detail then as they rounded the clump of trees behind which harry had first heard the dragons roar a witch leapt out from behind them 
 
 it was rita skeeter she was wearing robes today the quill in her hand blended perfectly against them 
 
 congratulations harry she said beaming at him i wonder if you could give me a quick word how you felt facing that dragon how you feel now about the fairness of the scoring 
 
 yeah you can have a word said harry savagely 
 
 and he set off back to the castle with ron 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the goblet of fire 
 

lionfish nov chapter twenty talecontents prev chapter next chapter 
 harry sprinted up to the boys dormitories to fetch the invisibility cloak and the map from his trunk he was so quick that he and ron were ready to leave at least five minutes before hermione hurried back down from the girls dormitories wearing scarf gloves and one of her own knobbly elf hats 
 
 well cold out there she said defensively as ron clicked his tongue impatiently 
 
 they crept through the portrait hole and covered themselves hastily in the cloakron had grown so much he now needed to crouch to prevent his feet showingthen moving slowly and cautiously they proceeded down the many staircases pausing at intervals to check on the map for signs of filch or mrs morris they were lucky they saw nobody but nearly headless nick who was gliding along humming something that sounded horribly like weasley is our king they crept across the entrance hall and out into the silent snowy grounds with a great leap of his heart harry saw little golden squares of light ahead and smoke coiling up from chimney he set off at a quick march the other two jostling and bumping along behind him they crunched excitedly through the thickening snow until at last they reached the wooden front door when harry raised his fist and knocked three times a dog started barking frantically inside 
 
 hagrid us harry called through the keyhole 
 
 shoulda known said a gruff voice 
 
 they beamed at each other under the cloak they could tell by voice that he was pleased bin home three seconds out the way fang out the way yeh dozy dog 
 
 the bolt was drawn back the door creaked open and head appeared in the gap 
 
 hermione screamed 
 
 beard keep it down said hagrid hastily staring wildly over their heads under that cloak are yeh well get in get in 
 
 sorry hermione gasped as the three of them squeezed past hagrid into the house and pulled the cloak off themselves so he could see them i justoh hagrid 
 
 nuthin nuthin said hagrid hastily shutting the door behind them and hurrying to close all the curtains but hermione continued to gaze up at him in horror 
 
 hair was matted with congealed blood and his left eye had been reduced to a puffy slit amid a mass of purple and black bruising there were many cuts on his face and hands some of them still bleeding and he was moving gingerly which made harry suspect broken ribs it was obvious that he had only just got home a thick black travelling cloak lay over the back of a chair and a haversack large enough to carry several small children leaned against the wall inside the door hagrid himself twice the size of a normal man was now limping over to the fire and placing a copper kettle over it 
 
 what happened to you harry demanded while fang danced around them all trying to lick their faces 
 
 told yeh nuthin said hagrid firmly want a cuppa 
 
 come off it said ron in a right state 
 
 tellin yeh fine said hagrid straightening up and turning to beam at them all but wincing blimey good ter see yeh three againhad good summers did yeh 
 
 hagrid been attacked said ron 
 
 fer the las time nuthin said hagrid firmly 
 
 would you say it was nothing if one of us turned up with a pound of mince instead of a face ron demanded 
 
 you ought to go and see madam pomfrey hagrid said hermione anxiously some of those cuts look nasty 
 
 dealin with it all righ said hagrid repressively 
 
 he walked across to the enormous wooden table that stood in the middle of his cabin and twitched aside a tea towel that had been lying on it underneath was a raw bloody steak slightly larger than the average car tyre 
 
 not going to eat that are you hagrid said ron leaning in for a closer look it looks poisonous 
 
 ter look like that dragon meat hagrid said an i didn get it ter eat 
 
 he picked up the steak and slapped it over the left side of his face greenish blood trickled down into his beard as he gave a soft moan of satisfaction 
 
 better it helps with the stingin yeh know 
 
 so are you going to tell us happened to you harry asked 
 
 harry top secret me worth ter tell yeh that 
 
 did the giants beat you up hagrid asked hermione quietly 
 
 fingers slipped on the dragon steak and it slid squelchily on to his chest 
 
 giants said hagrid catching the steak before it reached his belt and slapping it back over his face who said anythin abou giants who yeh bin talkin to told yeh what said bineh 
 
 we guessed said hermione apologetically 
 
 oh yeh did did yeh said hagrid surveying her sternly with the eye that was not hidden by the steak 
 
 it was kind of obvious said ron harry nodded 
 
 hagrid glared at them then snorted threw the steak back on to the table and strode over to the kettle which was now whistling 
 
 never known kids like you three fer knowin yeh oughta he muttered splashing boiling water into three of his mugs an not complimentin yeh neither nosy call it interferin 
 
 but his beard twitched 
 
 so you have been to look for giants said harry grinning as he sat down at the table 
 
 hagrid set tea in front of each of them sat down picked up his steak again and slapped it back over his face 
 
 yeah all righ he grunted i have 
 
 and you found them said hermione in a hushed voice 
 
 well not that difficult ter find ter be honest said hagrid pretty big see 
 
 where are they said ron 
 
 mountains said hagrid unhelpfully 
 
 so why muggles 
 
 they do said hagrid darkly their deaths are always put down ter mountaineerin accidents aren they 
 
 he adjusted the steak a little so that it covered the worst of the bruising 
 
 come on hagrid tell us what been up to said ron tell us about being attacked by the giants and harry can tell you about being attacked by the dementors 
 
 hagrid choked in his mug and dropped his steak at the same time a large quantity of spit tea and dragon blood was sprayed over the table as hagrid coughed and spluttered and the steak slid with a soft splat on to the floor 
 
 whadda yeh mean attacked by dementors growled hagrid 
 
 you know hermione asked him 
 
 i don know any thin bin happenin since i left i was on a secret mission wasn i didn wan owls followin me all over the placeruddy dementors not serious 
 
 yeah i am they turned up in little whinging and attacked my cousin and me and then the ministry of magic expelled me 
 
 what 
 
 and i had to go to a hearing and everything but tell us about the giants first 
 
 you were expelled 
 
 tell us about your summer and tell you about mine 
 
 hagrid glared at him through his one open eye harry looked right back an expression of innocent determination on his face 
 
 oh all righ hagrid said in a resigned voice 
 
 he bent down and tugged the dragon steak out of mouth 
 
 oh hagrid not hygien hermione began but hagrid had already slapped the meat back over his swollen eye 
 
 he took another fortifying gulp of tea then said well we set off righ after term ended 
 
 madame maxime went with you then hermione interjected 
 
 yeah righ said hagrid and a softened expression appeared on the few inches of face that were not obscured by beard or green steak yeah it was jus the pair of us an tell yeh this not afraid of roughin it olympe yeh know a fine woman an knowin where we was goin i wondered ow feel abou clamberin over boulders an sleepin in caves an tha bu she never complained once 
 
 you knew where you were going harry repeated you knew where the giants were 
 
 well durnbledore knew an he told us said hagrid 
 
 are they hidden asked ron is it a secret where they are 
 
 not really said hagrid shaking his shaggy head jus that mos wizards aren bothered where they are as a good long way away but where they very difficult ter get ter fer humans anyway so we needed instructions took us abou a month ter get there 
 
 a month said ron as though he had never heard of a journey lasting such a ridiculously long time butwhy you just grab a portkey or something 
 
 there was an odd expression in unobscured eye as he surveyed ron it was almost pitying 
 
 bein watched ron he said gruffly 
 
 what mean 
 
 yeh don understand said hagrid the keepin an eye on dumbledore an anyone they in league with im an 
 
 we know about that said harry quickly keen to hear the rest of story we know about the ministry watching dumbledore 
 
 so you use magic to get there asked ron looking thunderstruck you had to act like muggles all the way 
 
 well not exactly all the way said hagrid cagily we jus had ter be careful cause olympe an me we stick out a bit 
 
 ron made a stifled noise somewhere between a snort and a sniff and hastily took a gulp of tea 
 
 so not hard ter follow we was pretendin we was goin on holiday together so we got inter france an we made like we was headin fer where school is cause we knew we was bein tailed by someone from the ministry we had to go slow cause not really ter use magic an we knew the be lookin fer a reason ter run us in but we managed ter give the berk tailin us the slip round abou 
 
 ooooh dijon said hermione excitedly been there on holiday did you see 
 
 she fell silent at the look on face 
 
 we chanced a bit o magic after that an it wasn a bad journey ran inter a couple o mad trolls on the polish border an i had a sligh disagreement with a vampire in a pub in minsk bu apart from tha bin smoother 
 
 an then we reached the place an we started trekkin up through the mountains lookin fer signs of em 
 
 we had ter lay off the magic once we got near em partly cause they don like wizards an we didn want ter put their backs up too soon an partly cause dumbledore had warned us was bound ter be after the giants an all said it was odds on sent a messenger off ter them already told us ter be very careful of drawin attention ter ourselves as we got nearer in case there was death eaters around 
 
 hagrid paused for a long draught of tea 
 
 go on said harry urgently 
 
 found em said hagrid baldly went over a ridge one nigh an there they was spread ou underneath us little fires burnin below an huge shadows it was like watchin bits o the mountain movin 
 
 how big are they asked ron in a hushed voice 
 
 bout twenty feet said hagrid casually some o the bigger ones mighta bin 
 
 and how many were there asked harry 
 
 i reckon abou seventy or eighty said hagrid 
 
 is that all said hermione 
 
 yep said hagrid sadly eighty left an there was loads once musta bin a hundred tribes from all over the world bu bin dyin out fer ages wizards killed a few o course bu mostly they killed each other an now dyin out faster than ever not made ter live bunched up together like tha dumbledore says our fault it was the wizards who forced em to go an made em live a good long way from us an they had no choice bu ter stick together fer their own protection 
 
 so said harry you saw them and then what 
 
 well we waited till morning didn want ter go sneakin up on em in the dark fer our own safety said hagrid bout three in the mornin they fell asleep jus where they was sittin we didn dare sleep fer one thing we wanted ter make sure none of em woke up an came up where we were an fer another the snorin was unbelievable caused an avalanche near mornin 
 
 anyway once it was light we wen down ter see em 
 
 just like that said ron looking awestruck you just walked right into a giant camp 
 
 well told us how ter do it said hagrid give the gurg gifts show some respect yeh know 
 
 give the what gifts asked harry 
 
 oh the gurg means the chief 
 
 how could you tell which one was the gurg asked ron 
 
 hagrid grunted in amusement 
 
 no problem he said he was the biggest the ugliest and the laziest sittin there waitin ter be brought food by the others dead goats an such like name o karkus put him at feet an the weight o a couple o bull elephants skin like rhino hide an all 
 
 and you just walked up to him said hermione breathlessly 
 
 well down ter him where he was lyin in the valley they was in this dip between four pretty high mountains see beside a mountain lake an karkus was lyin by the lake roarin at the others ter feed him an his wife olympe an i went down the mountainside 
 
 but they try and kill you when they saw you asked ron incredulously 
 
 it was on some o their minds said hagrid shrugging but we did what dumbledore told us ter do which was ter hold our gift up high an keep our eyes on the gurg an ignore the others so what we did an the rest of em went quiet an watched us pass an we got right up ter karkuss leet an we bowed an put our present down in front o him 
 
 what do you give a giant asked ron eagerly food 
 
 nah he can get food all righ fer himself said hagrid we took him magic giants like magic jus don like us usin it against em anyway that firs day we gave im a branch o gubraithian fire 
 
 hermione said wow softly but harry and ron both frowned in puzzlement 
 
 a branch of 
 
 everlasting fire said hermione irritably you ought to know that by now professor mentioned it at least twice in class 
 
 well anyway said hagrid quickly intervening before ron could answer back bewitched this branch to burn fer evermore which isn somethin any wizard could do an so i lies it down in the snow by karkuss feet and says a gift to the gurg of the giants from albus dumbledore who sends his respectful greetings 
 
 and what did karkus say asked harry eagerly 
 
 nothin said hagrid didn speak english 
 
 kidding 
 
 didn matter said hagrid imperturbably dumbledore had warned us tha migh happen karkus knew enough to yell fer a couple o giants who knew our lingo an they translated fer us 
 
 and did he like the present asked ron 
 
 oh yeah it went down a storm once they understood what it was said hagrid turning his dragon steak over to press the cooler side to his swollen eye very pleased so then i said albus dumbledore asks the gurg to speak with his messenger when he returns tomorrow with another gift 
 
 why you speak to them that day asked hermione 
 
 dumbledore wanted us ter take it very slow said hagrid let em see we kept our promises come back tomorrow with another present an then we do come back with another presentgives a good impression see an gives them time ter test out the firs present an fnd out a good one an get em eager fer more in any case giants like karkusoverload em with information an kill yeh jus to simplify things so we bowed outta the way an went off an found ourselves a nice little cave ter spend that night in an the followin mornin we went back an this time we found karkus sittin up waitin fer us lookin all eager 
 
 and you talked to him 
 
 oh yeah firs we presented him with a nice battle an indestructible yeh knowan then we sat down an we talked 
 
 what did he say 
 
 not much said hagrid listened mostly bu there were good signs heard o dumbledore heard argued against the killin o the last giants in britain karkus seemed ter be quite in what dumbledore had ter say an a few o the others specially the ones who had some english they gathered round an listened too we were hopeful when we left that day promised ter come back next mornin with another present 
 
 bu that night it all wen wrong 
 
 what mean said ron quickly 
 
 well like i say not meant ter live together giants said hagrid sadly not in big groups like that they can help themselves they half kill each other every few weeks the men fight each other an the women fight each other the remnants of the old tribes fight each other an even without squabbles over food an the best fires an sleepin spots think seein as how their whole race is abou finished lay off each other bu 
 
 hagrid sighed deeply 
 
 that night a fight broke out we saw it from the mouth of our cave lookin down on the valley went on fer hours yeh wouldn believe the noise an when the sun came up the snow was scarlet an his head was lyin at the bottom o the lake 
 
 whose head gasped hermione 
 
 said hagrid heavily there was a new gurg golgomath he sighed deeply well we hadn bargained on a new gurg two days after made friendly contact with the firs one an we had a funny feelin golgomath wouldn be so keen ter listen to us bu we had ter try

 blimey hagrid said ron quietly 
 
 so how come taken you so long to get home if you were only there for three days asked hermione 
 
 we didn leave after three days said hagrid looking outraged dumbledore was relyin on us 
 
 but just said there was no way you could go back 
 
 not by daylight we couldn no we just had ter rethink a bit spent a couple o days lyin low up in the cave an watchin an wha we saw wasn good 
 
 did he rip off more heads asked hermione sounding squeamish 
 
 no said hagrid i wish he had 
 
 what mean 
 
 i mean we soon found out he didn object ter all us 
 
 death eaters said harry quickly 
 
 yep said hagrid darkly couple oi em were visitin him day bringin gifts ter the gurg an he wasn dangling them 
 
 how know they were death eaters said ron 
 
 because i recognised one of em hagrid growled macnair remember him bloke they sent ter kill buckbeak maniac he is likes killin as much as golgomath no wonder they were gettin on so well 
 
 so persuaded the giants to join said hermione desperately 
 
 hold yer hippogriffs i haven finished me story yet said hagrid indignantly who considering he had not wanted to tell them anything in the first place now seemed to be rather enjoying himself me an olympe talked it over an we agreed jus cause the gurg looked like favourin didn mean all of em would we had ter try an persuade some o the others the ones who hadn wanted golgomath as gurg 
 
 how could you tell which ones they were asked ron 
 
 well they were the ones bein beaten to a pulp weren they said hagrid patiently the ones with any sense were keepin outta way hidin out in caves roun the gully jus like we were so we decided go pokin round the caves by night an see if we couldn persuade a few o them 
 
 you went poking around dark caves looking for giants said ron with awed respect in his voice 
 
 well it wasn the giants who worried us most said hagrid we were more concerned abou the death eaters dumbledore had told us before we wen not ter tangle with em if we could avoid it an the trouble was they knew we was golgomath told em abou us at night when the giants were sleepin an we wanted ter be creepin inter the caves macnair an the other one were sneakin round the mountains lookin fer us i was hard put to stop olympe jumpin out at em said hagrid the corners of his mouth lifting his wild beard she was rarin ter attack em somethin when roused olympe fiery yeh know spect the french in her 
 
 hagrid gazed into the fire harry allowed him thirty seconds of reminiscence before clearing his throat loudly 
 
 so what happened did you ever get near any of the other giants 
 
 what oh oh yeah we did yeah on the third night after karkus was killed we crept outta the cave bin hidin in an headed back down inter the gully keepin our eyes skinned fer the death eaters got inside a few o the caves no go then in abou the sixth one we found three giants hidin 
 
 cave been cramped said ron 
 
 wasn room ter swing a kneazle said hagrid 
 
 they attack you when they saw you asked hermione 
 
 probably woulda done if bin in any condition said hagrid but they was badly hurt all three o them lot had beaten em unconscious woken up an crawled inter the nearest shelter they could find anyway one o them had a bit of english an e translated fer the others an what we had ter say didn seem ter go down too badly so we kep goin back visitin the wounded i reckon we had abou six or seven o them convinced at one poin 
 
 six or seven said ron eagerly well not badare they going to come over here and start fighting with us 
 
 but hermione said what do you mean at one point hagrid 
 
 hagrid looked at her sadly 
 
 lot raided the caves the ones tha survived didn wan no more ter to do with us after that 
 
 so so there any giants coming said ron looking disappointed 
 
 nope said hagrid heaving a deep sigh as he turned over his steak and applied the cooler side to his face but we did wha we meant ter do we gave em message an some o them heard it an i spect some o remember it jus maybe them that don want ter stay around move outta the mountains an gotta be a chance remember friendly to em could be come 
 
 snow was filling up the window now harry became aware that the knees of his robes were soaked through fang was drooling with his head in lap 
 
 hagrid said hermione quietly after a while 
 
 mmm 
 
 did you was there any sign of did you hear anything about your your mother while you were there 
 
 hagrids unobscured eye rested upon her and hermione looked rather scared 
 
 sorry i forget it 
 
 dead hagrid grunted died years ago they told me 
 
 oh really sorry said hermione in a very small voice hagrid shrugged his massive shoulders 
 
 no need he said shortly remember her much wasn a great mother 
 
 they were silent again hermione glanced nervously at harry and ron plainly wanting them to speak 
 
 but you still explained how you got in this state hagrid ron said gesturing towards bloodstained face 
 
 or why back so late said harry sirius says madame maxime got back ages ago 
 
 who attacked you said ron 
 
 i haven bin attacked said hagrid emphatically i 
 
 but the rest of his words were drowned in a sudden outbreak of rapping on the door hermione gasped her mug slipped through her fingers and smashed on the floor fang yelped all four of them stared at the window beside the doorway the shadow of somebody small and squat rippled across the thin curtain 
 
 her ron whispered 
 
 get under here harry said quickly seizing the invisibility cloak he whirled it over himself and hermione while ron tore around the table and dived under the cloak as well huddled together they backed away into a corner fang was barking madly at the door hagrid looked thoroughly confused 
 
 hagrid hide our mugs 
 
 hagrid seized harry and mugs and shoved them under the cushion in basket fang was now leaping up at the door hagrid pushed him out of the way with his foot and pulled it open 
 
 professor umbridge was standing in the doorway wearing her green tweed cloak and a matching hat with earflaps lips pursed she leaned back so as to see face she barely reached his navel 
 
 so she said slowly and loudly as though speaking to somebody deaf hagrid are you 
 
 without waiting for an answer she strolled into the room her bulging eyes rolling in every direction 
 
 get away she snapped waving her handbag at fang who had bounded up to her and was attempting to lick her face 
 
 eri don want ter be rude said hagrid staring at her but who the ruddy hell are you 
 
 my name is dolores umbridge 
 
 her eyes were sweeping the cabin twice they stared directly into the corner where harry stood sandwiched between ron and hermione 
 
 dolores umbridge hagrid said sounding thoroughly confused i thought you were one o them ministrydon you work with fudge 
 
 i was senior undersecretary to the minister yes said umbridge now pacing around the cabin taking in every tiny detail within from the haversack against the wall to the abandoned travelling cloak i am now the defence against the dark arts teacher 
 
 brave of yeh said hagrid not take tha job any more 
 
 and hogwarts high inquisitor said umbridge giving no sign that she had heard him 
 
 that said hagrid frowning 
 
 precisely what i was going to ask said umbridge pointing at the broken shards of china on the floor that had been mug 
 
 oh said hagrid with a most unhelpful glance towards the corner where harry ron and hermione stood hidden oh tha was was fang he broke a mug so i had ter use this one instead 
 
 hagrid pointed to the mug from which he had been drinking one hand still clamped over the dragon steak pressed to his eye umbridge stood facing him now taking in every detail of his appearance instead of the cabins 
 
 i heard voices she said quietly 
 
 i was talkin ter fang said hagrid stoutly 
 
 and was he talking back to you 
 
 well in a manner o speakin said hagrid looking uncomfortable i sometimes say near enough human 
 
 there are three sets of footprints in the snow leading from the castle doors to your cabin said umbridge sleekly 
 
 hermione gasped harry clapped a hand over her mouth luckily fang was sniffing loudly around the hem of professor robes and she did not appear to have heard 
 
 well i jus got back said hagrid waving an enormous hand at the haversack maybe someone came ter call earlier an i missed em 
 
 there are no footsteps leading away from your cabin door 
 
 well i i don know why be said hagrid tugging nervously at his beard and again glancing towards the corner where harry ron and hermione stood as though asking for help erm 
 
 umbridge wheeled round and strode the length of the cabin looking around carefully she bent and peered under the bed she opened cupboards she passed within two inches of where harry ron and hermione stood pressed against the wall harry actually pulled in his stomach as she walked by after looking carefully inside the enormous cauldron hagrid used for cooking she wheeled round again and said what has happened to you how did you sustain those injuries 
 
 hagrid hastily removed the dragon steak from his face which in opinion was a mistake because the black and purple bruising all around his eye was now clearly visible not to mention the large amount of fresh and congealed blood on his face oh i had a bit of an accident he said lamely 
 
 what sort of accident 
 
 ii tripped 
 
 you tripped she repeated coolly 
 
 yeah right over over a friends broomstick i don fly meself well look at the size o me i don reckon a broomstick hold me friend o mine breeds abraxan horses i dunno if you ve ever seen em big beasts winged yer know had a bit of a ride on one o them an it was 
 
 where have you been asked umbridge cutting coolly through babbling 
 
 i 
 
 been yes she said term started two months ago another teacher has had to cover your classes none of your colleagues has been able to give me any information as to your whereabouts you left no address where have you been 
 
 there was a pause in which hagrid stared at her with his newly uncovered eye harry could almost hear his brain working furiously 
 
 been away for me health he said 
 
 for your health repeated professor umbridge her eyes travelled over discoloured and swollen face dragon blood dripped gently and silently on to his waistcoat i see 
 
 yeah said hagrid bit fresh air yeh know 
 
 yes as gamekeeper fresh air must be so difficult to come by said umbridge sweetly the small patch of face that was not black or purple flushed 
 
 wellchange o scene yeh know 
 
 mountain scenery said umbridge swiftly 
 
 she knows harry thought desperately 
 
 mountains hagrid repeated clearly thinking fast nope south o france fer me bit o sun an an sea 
 
 really said umbridge you have much of a tan 
 
 yeah well sensitive skin said hagrid attempting an ingratiating smile harry noticed that two of his teeth had been knocked out umbridge looked at him coldly his smile faltered then she hoisted her handbag a little higher into the crook of her arm and said i shall of course be informing the minister of your late return 
 
 righ said hagrid nodding 
 
 you ought to know too that as high inquisitor it is my unfortunate but necessary duty to inspect my fellow teachers so i daresay we shall meet again soon enough 
 
 she turned sharply and marched back to the door 
 
 inspectin us hagrid repeated blankly looking after her 
 
 oh yes said umbridge softly looking back at him with her hand on the door handle the ministry is determined to weed out unsatisfactory teachers hagrid goodnight 
 
 she left closing the door behind her with a snap harry made to pull off the invisibility cloak but hermione seized his wrist 
 
 not yet she breathed in his ear she might not be gone yet 
 
 hagrid seemed to be thinking the same way he stumped across the room and pulled back the curtain an inch or so 
 
 goin back ter the castle he said in a low voice blimey inspectin people is she 
 
 yeah said harry pulling off the cloak on probation already 
 
 um what sort of thing are you planning to do with us in class hagrid asked hermione 
 
 oh don you worry abou that got a great load o lessons planned said hagrid enthusiastically scooping up his dragon steak from the table and slapping it over his eye again bin keepin a couple o creatures saved fer yer owl year you wait somethin really special 
 
 erm special in what way asked hermione tentatively 
 
 not sayin said hagrid happily i don want ter spoil the surprise 
 
 look hagrid said hermione urgently dropping all pretence professor umbridge be at all happy if you bring anything to class too dangerous 
 
 dangerous said hagrid looking genially bemused don be silly i wouldn give yeh anythin dangerous i mean all righ they can look after themselves 
 
 hagrid got to pass inspection and to do that it would really be better if she saw you teaching us how to look after porlocks how to tell the difference between knarls and hedgehogs stuff like that said hermione earnestly 
 
 but not very interestin hermione said hagrid the stuff much more impressive bin bringin em on fer years i reckon got the domestic herd in britain 
 
 hagrid please said hermione a note of real desperation in her voice umbridge is looking for any excuse to get rid of teachers she thinks are too close to dumbledore please hagrid teach us something dull bound to come up in our owl 
 
 but hagrid merely yawned widely and cast a look of longing towards the vast bed in the corner 
 
 bin a long day an late he said patting hermione gently on the shoulder so that her knees gave way and hit the floor with a thud ohsorry he pulled her back up by the neck of her robes look don you go worryin abou me i promise yeh got really good stuff planned fer yer lessons now back now you lot had better get back up to the castle an don forget ter wipe yer tootprints out behind yeh 
 
 i dunno if you got through to him said ron a short while later when having checked that the coast was clear they walked back up to the castle through the thickening snow leaving no trace behind them due to the obliteration charm hermione was performing as they went 
 
 then go back again tomorrow said hermione determinedly plan his lessons for him if i have to i care if she throws out trelawney but not getting rid of hagrid

lionfish nov chapter twenty lord requestcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 harry and ron left the hospital wing first thing on monday morning restored to full health by the ministrations of madam pomfrey and now able to enjoy the benefits of having been knocked out and poisoned the best of which was that hermione was friends with ron again hermione even escorted them down to breakfast bringing with her the news that ginny had argued with dean the drowsing creature in chest suddenly raised its head sniffing the air hopefully 
 
 what did they row about he asked trying to sound casual as they turned onto a corridor that was deserted but for a very small girl who had been examining a tapestry of trolls in tutus she looked terrified at the sight of the approaching sixth years and dropped the heavy brass scales she was carrying 
 
 all right said hermione kindly hurrying forward to help her here 
 
 she tapped the broken scales with her wand and said reparo the girl did not say thank you but remained rooted to the spot as they passed and watched them out of sight ron glanced back at her 
 
 i swear getting smaller he said 
 
 never mind her said harry a little impatiently what did ginny and dean row about hermione 
 
 oh dean was laughing about mclaggen hitting that bludger at you said hermione 
 
 it looked funny said ron reasonably 
 
 it look funny at all said hermione hotly it looked terrible and if coote and peakes caught harry he could have been very badly hurt 
 
 yeah well there was no need for ginny and dean to split up over it said harry still trying to sound casual or are they still together 
 
 yes they arebut why are you so interested asked hermione giving harry a sharp look 
 
 i just want my quidditch team messed up again he said hastily but hermione continued to look suspicious and he was most relieved when a voice behind them called harry giving him an excuse to turn his back on her 
 
 oh hi luna 
 
 i went to the hospital wing to find you said luna rummaging in her bag but they said left 
 
 she thrust what appeared to be a green onion a large spotted toadstool and a considerable amount of what looked like cat litter into hands finally pulling out a rather grubby scroll of parchment that she handed to harry 
 
 been told to give you this 
 
 it was a small roll of parchment which harry recognized at once as another invitation to a lesson with dumbledore 
 
 tonight he told ron and hermione once he had unrolled it 
 
 nice commentary last match said ron to luna as she took back the green onion the toadstool and the cat litter luna smiled vaguely 
 
 making fun of me you she said everyone says i was dreadful 
 
 no serious said ron earnestly i remember enjoying commentary more what is this by the way he added holding the onionlike object up to eye level 
 
 oh a gurdyroot she said stuffing the cat litter and the toadstool back into her bag you can keep it if you like got a few of them really excellent for warding off gulping plimpies 
 
 and she walked away leaving ron chortling still clutching the gurdyroot 
 
 you know grown on me luna he said as they set off again for the great hall i know insane but in a good 
 
 he stopped talking very suddenly lavender brown was standing at the foot of the marble staircase looking thunderous 
 
 hi said ron nervously 
 
 harry muttered to hermione and they sped past though not before they had heard lavender say why you tell me you were getting out today and why was she with you 
 
 ron looked both sulky and annoyed when he appeared at breakfast half an hour later and though he sat with lavender harry did not see them exchange a word all the time they were together hermione was acting as though she was quite oblivious to all of this but once or twice harry saw an inexplicable smirk cross her face all that day she seemed to be in a particularly good mood and that evening in the common room she even consented to look over in other words finish writing herbology essay something she had been resolutely refusing to do up to this point because she had known that harry would then let ron copy his work 
 
 thanks a lot hermione said harry giving her a hasty pat on the back as he checked his watch and saw that it was nearly eight listen got to hurry or be late for dumbledore 
 
 she did not answer but merely crossed out a few of his feebler sentences in a weary sort of way grinning harry hurried out through the portrait hole and off to the office the gargoyle leapt aside at the mention of toffee eclairs and harry took the spiral staircase two steps at a time knocking on the door just as a clock within chimed eight 
 
 enter called dumbledore but as harry put out a hand to push the door it was wrenched open from inside there stood professor trelawney 
 
 aha she cried pointing dramatically at harry as she blinked at him through her magnifying spectacles 
 
 so this is the reason i am to be thrown unceremoniously from your office dumbledore 
 
 my dear sybill said dumbledore in a slightly exasperated voice there is no question of throwing you unceremoniously from anywhere but harry does have an appointment and i really think there is any more to be said 
 
 very well said professor trelawney in a deeply wounded voice if you will not banish the usurping nag so be it perhaps i shall find a school where my talents are better appreciated 
 
 she pushed past harry and disappeared down the spiral staircase they heard her stumble halfway down and harry guessed that she had tripped over one of her trailing shawls 
 
 please close the door and sit down harry said dumbledore sounding rather tired 
 
 harry obeyed noticing as he took his usual seat in front of desk that the pensieve lay between them once more as did two more tiny crystal bottles full of swirling memory 
 
 professor trelawney still happy firenze is teaching then harry asked 
 
 no said dumbledore divination is turning out to be much more trouble than i could have foreseen never having studied the subject myself i cannot ask firenze to return to the forest where he is now an outcast nor can i ask sybill trelawney to leave between ourselves she has no idea of the danger she would be in outside the castle she does not knowand i think it would be unwise to enlighten herthat she made the prophecy about you and voldemort you see 
 
 dumbledore heaved a deep sigh then said but never mind my staffing problems we have much more important matters to discuss firstlyhave you managed the task i set you at the end of our previous lesson 
 
 ah said harry brought up short what with apparition lessons and quidditch and ron being poisoned and getting his skull cracked and his determination to find out what draco malfoy was up to harry had almost forgotten about the memory dumbledore had asked him to extract from professor slughorn well i asked professor slughorn about it at the end of potions sir but er he give it to me 
 
 there was a little silence 
 
 i see said dumbledore eventually peering at harry over the top of his spectacles and giving harry the usual sensation that he was being and you feel that you have exerted your very best efforts in this matter do you that you have exercised all of your considerable ingenuity that you have left no depth of cunning unplumbed in your quest to retrieve the memory 
 
 well harry stalled at a loss for what to say next his single attempt to get hold of the memory suddenly seemed embarrassingly feeble well the day ron swallowed love potion by mistake i took him to professor slughorn i thought maybe if i got professor slughorn in a good enough mood 
 
 and did that work asked dumbledore 
 
 well no sir because ron got poisoned 
 
 which naturally made you forget all about trying to retrieve the memory i would have expected nothing else while your best friend was in danger once it became clear that mr weasley was going to make a full recovery however i would have hoped that you returned to the task i set you i thought i made it clear to you how very important that memory is indeed i did my best to impress upon you that it is the most crucial memory of all and that we will be wasting our time without it 
 
 a hot prickly feeling of shame spread from the top of head all the way down his body dumbledore had not raised his voice he did not even sound angry but harry would have preferred him to yell this cold disappointment was worse than anything 
 
 sir he said a little desperately it that i bothered or anything just had otherother thing 
 
 other things on your mind dumbledore finished the sentence for him i see 
 
 silence fell between them again the most uncomfortable silence harry had ever experienced with dumbledore it seemed to go on and on punctuated only by the little grunting snores of the portrait of armando dippet over head harry felt strangely diminished as though he had shrunk a little since he had entered the room 
 
 when he could stand it no longer he said professor dumbledore really sorry i should have done more i should have realized you have asked me to do it if it really important 
 
 thank you for saying that harry said dumbledore quietly may i hope then that you will give this matter higher priority from now on there will be little point in our meeting after tonight unless we have that memory 
 
 do it sir get it from him he said earnestly 
 
 then we shall say no more about it just now said dumbledore more kindly but continue with our story where we left off you remember where that was 
 
 yes sir said harry quickly voldemort killed his father and his grandparents and made it look as though his uncle morfin did it then he went back to hogwarts and he asked he asked professor slughorn about horcruxes he mumbled shamefacedly 
 
 very good said dumbledore now you will remember i hope that i told you at the very outset of these meetings of ours that we would be entering the realms of guesswork and speculation 
 
 yes sir 
 
 thus far as i hope you agree i have shown you reasonably firm sources of fact for my deductions as to what voldemort did until the age of seventeen 
 
 harry nodded 
 
 but now harry said dumbledore now things become murkier and stranger if it was difficult to find evidence about the boy riddle it has been almost impossible to find anyone prepared to reminisce about the man voldemort in fact i doubt whether there is a soul alive apart from himself who could give us a full account of his life since he left hogwarts however i have two last memories that i would like to share with you dumbledore indicated the two little crystal bottles gleaming beside the pensieve i shall then be glad of your opinion as to whether the conclusions i have drawn from them seem likely 
 
 the idea that dumbledore valued his opinion this highly made harry feel even more deeply ashamed that he had failed in the task of retrieving the horcrux memory and he shifted guiltily in his seat as dumbledore raised the first of the two bottles to the light and examined it 
 
 i hope you are not tired of diving into other memories for they are curious recollections these two he said this first one came from a very old by the name of hokey before we see what hokey witnessed i must quickly recount how lord voldemort left hogwarts 
 
 he reached the seventh year of his schooling with as you might have expected top grades in every examination he had taken all around him his classmates were deciding which jobs they were to pursue once they had left hogwarts nearly everybody expected spectacular things from tom riddle prefect head boy winner of the award for special services to the school i know that several teachers professor slughorn amongst them suggested that he join the ministry of magic offered to set up appointments put him in touch with useful contacts he refused all offers the next thing the staff knew voldemort was working at borgin and burkes 
 
 at borgin and burkes harry repeated stunned 
 
 at borgin and burkes repeated dumbledore calmly i think you will see what attractions the place held for him when we have entered memory but this was not first choice of job hardly anyone knew of it at the time as one of the few in whom the then headmaster confidedbut voldemort first approached professor dippet and asked whether he could remain at hogwarts as a teacher 
 
 he wanted to stay here why asked harry more amazed still 
 
 i believe he had several reasons though he confided none of them to professor dippet said dumbledore firstly and very importantly voldemort was i believe more attached to this school than he has ever been to a person hogwarts was where he had been happiest the first and only place he had felt at home 
 
 harry felt slightly uncomfortable at these words for this was exactly how he felt about hogwarts too 
 
 secondly the castle is a stronghold of ancient magic undoubtedly voldemort had penetrated many more of its secrets than most of the students who pass through the place but he may have felt that there were still mysteries to unravel stores of magic to tap 
 
 and thirdly as a teacher he would have had great power and influence over young witches and wizards perhaps he had gained the idea from professor slughorn the teacher with whom he was on best terms who had demonstrated how influential a role a teacher can play i do not imagine for an instant that voldemort envisaged spending the rest of his life at hogwarts but i do think that he saw it as a useful recruiting ground and a place where he might begin to build himself an army 
 
 but he get the job sir 
 
 no he did not professor dippet told him that he was too young at eighteen but invited him to reapply in a few years if he still wished to teach 
 
 how did you feel about that sir asked harry hesitantly 
 
 deeply uneasy said dumbledore i had advised armando against the appointmenti did not give the reasons i have given you for professor dippet was very fond of voldemort and convinced of his honesty but i did not want lord voldemort back at this school and especially not in a position of power 
 
 which job did he want sir what subject did he want to teach 
 
 somehow harry knew the answer even before dumbledore gave it 
 
 defense against the dark arts it was being taught at the time by an old professor by the name of galatea merrythought who had been at hogwarts for nearly fifty years 
 
 so voldemort went off to borgin and burkes and all the staff who had admired him said what a waste it was a brilliant young wizard like that working in a shop however voldemort was no mere assistant polite and handsome and clever he was soon given particular jobs of the type that only exist in a place like borgin and burkes which specializes as you know harry in objects with unusual and powerful properties voldemort was sent to persuade people to part with their treasures for sale by the partners and he was by all accounts unusually gifted at doing this 
 
 bet he was said harry unable to contain himself 
 
 well quite said dumbledore with a faint smile and now it is time to hear from hokey the who worked for a very old very rich witch by the name of hepzibah smith 
 
 dumbledore tapped a bottle with his wand the cork flew out and he tipped the swirling memory into the pensieve saying as he did so after you harry 
 
 harry got to his feet and bent once more over the rippling silver contents of the stone basin until his face touched them he tumbled through dark nothingness and landed in a sitting room in front of an immensely fat old lady wearing an elaborate ginger wig and a brilliant pink set of robes that flowed all around her giving her the look of a melting iced cake she was looking into a small jeweled mirror and dabbing rouge onto her already scarlet cheeks with a large powder puff while the tiniest and oldest harry had ever seen laced her fleshy feet into tight satin slippers 
 
 hurry up hokey said hepzibah imperiously he said come at four only a couple of minutes to and never been late yet 
 
 she tucked away her powder puff as the straightened up the top of the head barely reached the seat of chair and her papery skin hung off her frame just like the crisp linen sheet she wore draped like a toga 
 
 how do i look said hepzibah turning her head to admire the various angles of her face in the mirror 
 
 lovely madam squeaked hokey 
 
 harry could only assume that it was down in contract that she must lie through her teeth when asked this question because hepzibah smith looked a long way from lovely in his opinion 
 
 a tinkling doorbell rang and both mistress and elf jumped 
 
 quick quick here hokey cried hepzibah and the elf scurried out of the room which was so crammed with objects that it was difficult to see how anybody could navigate their way across it without knocking over at least a dozen things there were cabinets full of little lacquered boxes cases full of books shelves of orbs and celestial globes and many flourishing potted plants in brass containers in fact the room looked like a cross between a magical antique shop and a conservatory 
 
 the returned within minutes followed by a tall young man harry had no difficulty whatsoever in recognizing as voldemort he was plainly dressed in a black suit his hair was a little longer than it had been at school and his cheeks were hollowed but all of this suited him he looked more handsome than ever he picked his way through the cramped room with an air that showed he had visited many times before and bowed low over fat little hand brushing it with his lips 
 
 i brought you flowers he said quietly producing a bunch of roses from nowhere 
 
 you naughty boy you have squealed old hepzibah though harry noticed that she had an empty vase standing ready on the nearest little table you do spoil this old lady tom sit down sit down hokey ah 
 
 the had come dashing back into the room carrying a tray of little cakes which she set at her elbow 
 
 help yourself tom said hepzibah i know how you love my cakes now how are you you look pale they overwork you at that shop said it a hundred times 
 
 voldemort smiled mechanically and hepzibah simpered 
 
 well your excuse for visiting this time she asked batting her lashes 
 
 mr burke would like to make an improved offer for the armor said voldemort five hundred galleons he feels it is a more than fair 
 
 now now not so fast or think only here for my trinkets pouted hepzibah 
 
 i am ordered here because of them said voldemort quietly i am only a poor assistant madam who must do as he is told mr burke wishes me to inquire 
 
 oh mr burke phooey said hepzibah waving a little hand something to show you that never shown mr burke can you keep a secret tom will you promise you tell mr burke got it never let me rest if he knew shown it to you and not selling not to burke not to anyone but you tom appreciate it for its history not how many galleons you can get for it 
 
 be glad to see anything miss hepzibah shows me said voldemort quietly and hepzibah gave another girlish giggle 
 
 i had hokey bring it out for me hokey where are you i want to show mr riddle our finest treasure in fact bring both while at it 
 
 here madam squeaked the and harry saw two leather boxes one on top of the other moving across the room as if of their own volition though he knew the tiny elf was holding them over her head as she wended her way between tables pouffes and footstools 
 
 now said hepzibah happily taking the boxes from the elf laying them in her lap and preparing to open the topmost one i think like this tom oh if my family knew i was showing you they wait to get their hands on this 
 
 she opened the lid harry edged forward a little to get a better view and saw what looked like a small golden cup with two finely wrought handles 
 
 i wonder whether you know what it is tom pick it up have a good look whispered hepzibah and voldemort stretched out a hand and lifted the cup by one handle out of its snug silken wrappings harry thought he saw a red gleam in his dark eyes his greedy expression was curiously mirrored on face except that her tiny eyes were fixed upon handsome features 
 
 a badger murmured voldemort examining the engraving upon the cup then this was 
 
 helga as you very well know you clever boy said hepzibah leaning forward with a loud creaking of corsets and actually pinching his hollow cheek i tell you i was distantly descended this has been handed down in the family for years and years lovely it and all sorts of powers supposed to possess too but i tested them thoroughly i just keep it nice and safe in here 
 
 she hooked the cup back off long forefinger and restored it gently to its box too intent upon settling it carefully back into position to notice the shadow that crossed face as the cup was taken away 
 
 now then said hepzibah happily hokey oh yes there you aretake that away now hokey 
 
 the elf obediently took the boxed cup and hepzibah turned her attention to the much flatter box in her lap 
 
 i think like this even more tom she whispered lean in a little dear boy so you can see of course burke knows got this one i bought it from him and i daresay love to get it back when gone 
 
 she slid back the fine filigree clasp and flipped open the box there upon the smooth crimson velvet lay a heavy golden locket 
 
 voldemort reached out his hand without invitation this time and held it up to the light staring at it 
 
 mark he said quietly as the light played upon an ornate serpentine s 
 
 right said hepzibah delighted apparently at the sight of voldemort gazing at her locket transfixed i had to pay an arm and a leg for it but i let it pass not a real treasure like that had to have it for my collection burke bought it apparently from a woman who seemed to have stolen it but had no idea of its true value 
 
 there was no mistaking it this time eyes flashed scarlet at the words and harry saw his knuckles whiten on the chain 
 
 i daresay burke paid her a pittance but there you are pretty it and again all kinds of powers attributed to it though i just keep it nice and safe 
 
 she reached out to take the locket back for a moment harry thought voldemort was not going to let go of it but then it had slid through his fingers and was back in its red velvet cushion 
 
 so there you are tom clear and i hope you enjoyed that 
 
 she looked him full in the face and for the first time harry saw her foolish smile falter 
 
 are you all right dear 
 
 oh yes said voldemort quietly yes very well 
 
 i thoughtbut a trick of the light i suppose said hepzibah looking unnerved and harry guessed that she too had seen the momentary red gleam in eyes here hokey take these away and lock them up again the usual enchantments 
 
 time to leave harry said dumbledore quietly and as the little elf bobbed away bearing the boxes dumbledore grasped harry once again above the elbow and together they rose up through oblivion and back to office 
 
 hepzibah smith died two days after that little scene said dumbledore resuming his seat and indicating that harry should do the same hokey the was convicted by the ministry of poisoning her evening cocoa by accident 
 
 no way said harry angrily 
 
 i see we are of one mind said dumbledore certainly then are many similarities between this death and that of the riddles in both cases somebody else took the blame someone who had a clear memory of having caused the death 
 
 hokey confessed 
 
 she remembered putting something in her cocoa that turned out not to be sugar but a lethal and poison said dumbledore it was concluded that she had not meant to do it but being old and confused 
 
 voldemort modified her memory just like he did with morfin 
 
 yes that is my conclusion too said dumbledore and just as with morfin the ministry was predisposed to suspect hokey 
 
 because she was a said harry he had rarely felt more in sympathy with the society hermione had set up 
 
 precisely said dumbledore she was old she admitted to having tampered with the drink and nobody at the ministry bothered to inquire further as in the case of morfin by the time i traced her and managed to extract this memory her life was almost over but her memory of course proves nothing except that voldemort knew of the existence of the cup and the locket 
 
 by the time hokey was convicted family had realized that two of her greatest treasures were missing it took them a while to be sure of this for she had many hiding places having always guarded her collection most jealously but before they were sure beyond doubt that the cup and the locket were both gone the assistant who had worked at borgin and burkes the young man who had visited hepzibah so regularly and charmed her so well had resigned his post and vanished his superiors had no idea where he had gone they were as surprised as anyone at his disappearance and that was the last that was seen or heard of tom riddle for a very long time 
 
 now said dumbledore if you mind harry i want to pause once more to draw your attention to certain points of our story voldemort had committed another murder whether it was his first since he killed the riddles i do not know but i think it was this time as you will have seen he killed not for revenge but for gain he wanted the two fabulous trophies that poor besotted old woman showed him just as he had once robbed the other children at his orphanage just as he had stolen his uncle ring so he ran off now with cup and locket 
 
 but said harry frowning it seems mad risking everything throwing away his job just for those 
 
 mad to you perhaps but not to voldemort said dumbledore i hope you will understand in due course exactly what those objects meant to him harry but you must admit that it is not difficult to imagine that he saw the locket at least as rightfully his 
 
 the locket maybe said harry but why take the cup as well 
 
 it had belonged to another of founders said dumbledore i think he still felt a great pull toward the school and that he could not resist an object so steeped in hogwarts history there were other reasons i think i hope to be able to demonstrate them to you in due course 
 
 and now for the very last recollection i have to show you at least until you manage to retrieve professor memory for us ten years separates memory and this one ten years during which we can only guess at what lord voldemort was doing 
 
 harry got to his feet once more as dumbledore emptied the last memory into the pensieve 
 
 whose memory is it he asked 
 
 mine said dumbledore 
 
 and harry dived after dumbledore through the shifting silver mass landing in the very office he had just left there was fawkes slumbering happily on his perch and there behind the desk was dumbledore who looked very similar to the dumbledore standing beside harry though both hands were whole and undamaged and his face was perhaps a little less lined the one difference between the office and this one was that it was snowing in the past bluish flecks were drifting past the window in the dark and building up on the outside ledge 
 
 the younger dumbledore seemed to be waiting for something and sure enough moments after their arrival there was a knock on the door and he said enter 
 
 harry let out a hastily stifled gasp voldemort had entered the room his features were not those harry had seen emerge from the great stone cauldron almost two years ago they were not as the eyes were not yet scarlet the face not yet masklike and yet he was no longer handsome tom riddle it was as though his features had been burned and blurred they were waxy and oddly distorted and the whites of the eyes now had a permanently bloody look though the pupils were not yet the slits that harry knew they would become he was wearing a long black cloak and his face was as pale as the snow glistening on his shoulders 
 
 the dumbledore behind the desk showed no sign of surprise evidently this visit had been made by appointment 
 
 good evening tom said dumbledore easily you sit down 
 
 thank you said voldemort and he took the seat to which dumbledore had gesturedthe very seat by the looks of it that harry had just vacated in the present i heard that you had become headmaster he said and his voice was slightly higher and colder than it had been a worthy choice 
 
 i am glad you approve said dumbledore smiling may i offer you a drink 
 
 that would be welcome said voldemort i have come a long way 
 
 dumbledore stood and swept over to the cabinet where he now kept the pensieve but which then was full of bottles having handed voldemort a goblet of wine and poured one for himself he returned to the seat behind his desk 
 
 so tom to what do i owe the pleasure 
 
 voldemort did not answer at once but merely sipped his wine 
 
 they do not call me tom anymore he said these days i am known as 
 
 i know what you are known as said dumbledore smiling pleasantly but to me afraid you will always be tom riddle it is one of the irritating things about old teachers i am afraid that they never quite forget their charges youthful beginnings 
 
 he raised his glass as though toasting voldemort whose face remained expressionless nevertheless harry felt the atmosphere in the room change subtly refusal to use chosen name was a refusal to allow voldemort to dictate the terms of the meeting and harry could tell that voldemort took it as such 
 
 i am surprised you have remained here so long said voldemort after a short pause i always wondered why a wizard such as yourself never wished to leave school 
 
 well said dumbledore still smiling to a wizard such as myself there can be nothing more important than passing on ancient skills helping hone young minds if i remember correctly you once saw the attraction of teaching too 
 
 i see it still said voldemort i merely wondered why youwho are so often asked for advice by the ministry and who have twice i think been offered the post of minister 
 
 three times at the last count actually said dumbledore but the ministry never attracted me as a career again something we have in common i think 
 
 voldemort inclined his head unsmiling and took another sip of wine dumbledore did not break the silence that stretched between them now but waited with a look of pleasant expectancy for voldemort to talk first 
 
 i have returned he said after a little while later perhaps than professor dippet expected but i have returned nevertheless to request again what he once told me i was too young to have i have come to you to ask that you permit me to return to this castle to teach i think you must know that i have seen and done much since i left this place i could show and tell your students things they can gain from no other wizard 
 
 dumbledore considered voldemort over the top of his own goblet for a while before speaking 
 
 yes i certainly do know that you have seen and done much since leaving us he said quietly rumors of your doings have reached your old school tom i should be sorry to believe half of them 
 
 expression remained impassive as he said greatness inspires envy envy engenders spite spite spawns lies you must know this dumbledore 
 
 you call it greatness what you have been doing do you asked dumbledore delicately 
 
 certainly said voldemort and his eyes seemed to burn red i have experimented i have pushed the boundaries of magic further perhaps than they have ever been pushed 
 
 of some kinds of magic dumbledore corrected him quietly of some of others you remain forgive me woefully ignorant 
 
 for the first time voldemort smiled it was a taut leer an evil thing more threatening than a look of rage 
 
 the old argument he said softly but nothing i have seen in the world has supported your famous pronouncements that love is more powerful than my kind of magic dumbledore 
 
 perhaps you have been looking in the wrong places suggested dumbledore 
 
 well then what better place to start my fresh researches than here at hogwarts said voldemort will you let me return will you let me share my knowledge with your students i place myself and my talents at your disposal i am yours to command 
 
 dumbledore raised his eyebrows and what will become of those whom you command what will happen to those who call themselvesor so rumor has itthe death eaters 
 
 harry could tell that voldemort had not expected dumbledore to know this name he saw eyes flash red again and the slitlike nostrils flare 
 
 my friends he said after a pause will carry on without me i am sure 
 
 i am glad to hear that you consider them friends said dumbledore i was under the impression that they are more in the order of servants 
 
 you are mistaken said voldemort 
 
 then if i were to go to the head tonight i would not find a group of themnott rosier muldber dolohovawaiting your return devoted friends indeed to travel this far with you on a snowy night merely to wish you luck as you attempted to secure a teaching post 
 
 there could be no doubt that detailed knowledge of those with whom he was traveling was even less welcome to voldemort however he rallied almost at once 
 
 you are omniscient as ever dumbledore 
 
 oh no merely friendly with the local barmen said dumbledore lightly now tom 
 
 dumbledore set down his empty glass and drew himself up in his seat the tips of his fingers together in a very characteristic gesture 
 
 let us speak openly why have you come here tonight surrounded by henchmen to request a job we both know you do not want 
 
 voldemort looked coldly surprised a job i do not want on the contrary dumbledore i want it very much 
 
 oh you want to come back to hogwarts but you do not want to teach any more than you wanted to when you were eighteen what is it after tom why not try an open request for once 
 
 voldemort sneered 
 
 if you do not want to give me a job 
 
 of course i said dumbledore and i think for a moment you expected me to nevertheless you came here you asked you must have had a purpose 
 
 voldemort stood up he looked less like tom riddle than ever his features thick with rage 
 
 this is your final word 
 
 it is said dumbledore also standing 
 
 then we have nothing more to say to each other 
 
 no nothing said dumbledore and a great sadness filled his face the time is long gone when i could frighten you with a burning wardrobe and force you to make repayment for your crimes but i wish i could tom i wish i could 
 
 for a second harry was on the verge of shouting a pointless warning he was sure that hand had twitched toward his pocket and his wand but then the moment had passed voldemort had turned away the door was closing and he was gone 
 
 harry felt hand close over his arm again and moments later they were standing together on almost the same spot but there was no snow building on the window ledge and hand was blackened and once more 
 
 why said harry at once looking up into face why did he come back did you ever find out 
 
 i have ideas said dumbledore but no more than that 
 
 what ideas sir 
 
 i shall tell you harry when you have retrieved that memory from professor slughorn said dumbledore 
 
 when you have that last piece of the jigsaw everything will i hope be clear to both of us 
 
 harry was still burning with curiosity and even though dumbledore had walked to the door and was holding it open for him he did not move at once 
 
 was he after the defense against the dark arts job again sir he say 
 
 oh he definitely wanted the defense against the dark arts job said dumbledore the aftermath of our little meeting proved that you see we have never been able to keep a defense against the dark arts teacher for longer than a year since i refused the post to lord voldemort

 the half blood prince 
 

lionfish nov chapter twenty xenophilius lovegoodcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 
 harry had not expected hermiones anger to abate over night and was therefore unsurprised that she communicated mainly by dirty looks and pointed silences the next morning ron responded by maintaining an unnaturally somber demeanor in her presence as an outward sign of continuing remorse in fact when all three of them were together harry felt like the only at a poorly attended funeral during those few moments he spent alone with harry however collecting water and searching the undergrowth for mushrooms ron became shamelessly cheery 
 
 someone helped us he kept saying someone sent that doe someones on our side one horcrux down mate 
 
 bolstered by the destruction of the locket they set to debating the possible locations of the other horcruxes and even though they had discussed the matter so often before harry felt optimistic certain that more breakthroughs would succeed the first hermiones sulkiness could not mar his buoyant spirits the sudden upswing in their fortunes the appearance of the mysterious due the recovery of gryffindors sword and above all rons return made harry so happy that it was quite difficult to maintain a straight face 
 
 late in the afternoon he and ron escaped hermiones baleful presence again and under the pretense of scouring the bare hedges for nonexistent blackberries they continued their ongoing exchange of news harry had finally managed to tell ron the whole story of his and hermiones various wanderings right up to the full story of what had happened at godrics hollow ron was now filling harry in on everything he had discovered about the wider wizarding world during his weeks away 
 
 and how did you find out about the taboo he asked harry after explaining the many desperate attempts of to evade the ministry 
 
 the what 
 
 you and hermione have stopped saying name 
 
 oh yeah well its just a bad habit weve slipped into said harry but i havent got a problem calling him v c 
 
 no roared ron causing harry to jump into the hedge and hermione nose buried in a book at the tent entrance to scowl over at them sorry said ron wrenching harry back out of the brambles but the names been jinxed harry thats how they track people using his name breaks protective enchantments it causes some kind of magical disturbance c its how they found us in tottenham court road 
 
 because we used his name 
 
 exactly youve got to give them credit it makes sense it was only people who were serious about standing up to him like dumbledore who even dared use it now theyve put a taboo on it anyone who says it is trackable c way to find order members they nearly got kingsley c 
 
 youre kidding 
 
 yeah a bunch of death eaters cornered him bill said but he fought his way out hes on the run now just like us ron scratched his chin thoughtfully with the end of his wand you dont reckon kingsley could have sent that doe 
 
 his patronus is a lynx we saw it at the wedding remember 
 
 oh yeah 
 
 they moved farther along the hedge away from the tent and hermione 
 
 harry you dont reckon it couldve been dumbledore 
 
 dumbledore what 
 
 ron looked a little embarrassed but said in a low voice dumbledore the doe i mean ron was watching harry out of the corners of his eyes he had the real sword last didnt he 
 
 harry did not laugh at ron because he understood too well the longing behind the question the idea that dumbledore had managed to come back to them that he was watching over them would have inexpressibly comforting he shook his head 
 
 dumbledores dead he said i saw it happen i saw the body hes definitely gone anyway his patronus was a phoenix not a doe 
 
 patronuses can change though cant they said ron tonkss changed didnt it 
 
 yeah but if dumbledore was alive why wouldnt he show himself why wouldnt he just hand us the sword 
 
 search me said ron same reason he didnt give it to you while he was alive same reason he left you an old snitch and hermione a book of kids stories 
 
 which is what asked harry turning to look ron full in the face desperate for the answer 
 
 i dunno said ron sometimes ive thought when ive been a bit hacked off he was having a laugh or c or he just wanted to make it more difficult but i dont think so not anymore he knew what he was doing when he gave me the deluminator didnt he he c well rons ears turned bright red and he became engrossed in a tuft of grass at his feet which he prodded with his toe he mustve known id run out on you 
 
 no harry corrected him he mustve known youd always want to come back 
 
 ron looked grateful but still awkward partly to change the subject harry said speaking of dumbledore have you heard what skeeter wrote about him 
 
 oh yeah said ron at once people are talking about it quite a lot course if things were different itd be huge news dumbledore being pals with grindelwald but now its just something to laugh about for people who didnt like dumbledore and a bit of a slap in the face for everyone who thought he was such a good bloke i dont know that its such a big deal though he was really young when they c 
 
 our age said harry just as he had retorted to hermione and something in his face seemed to decide ron against pursuing the subject 
 
 a large spider sat in the middle of a frosted web in the brambles harry took aim at it with the wand ron had given him the previous night which hermione had since condescended to examine and had decided was made of blackthorn 
 
 engorgio 
 
 the spider gave a little shiver bouncing slightly in the web harry tried again this time the spider grew slightly larger 
 
 stop that said ron sharply im sorry i said dumbledore was young okay 
 
 harry had forgotten rons hatred of spiders 
 
 sorry c reducio 
 
 the spider did not shrink harry looked down at the blackthorn wand every minor spell he had cast with it so far that day had seemed less powerful than those he had produced with his phoenix wand the new one felt intrusively unfamiliar like having somebody elses hand sewn to the end of his arm 
 
 you just need to practice said hermione who had approached them noiselessly from behind and had stood watching anxiously as harry tried to enlarge and reduce the spider its all a matter of confidence harry 
 
 he knew why she wanted it to be all right she still felt guilty about breaking his wand he bit back the retort that sprung to his lips that she could take the blackthorn wand if she thought it made no difference and he would have hers instead keen for them all to be friends again however he agreed but when ron gave hermione a tentative smile she stalked off and vanished behind her book once more 
 
 all three of them returned to the tent when darkness fell and harry took first watch sitting in the entrance he tried to make the blackthorn wand levitate small stones at his feet but his magic still seemed clumsier and less powerful than it had done before hermione was lying on her bunk reading while ron after many nervous glances up at her had taken a small wooden wireless out of his rucksack and started to try to tune it 
 
 theres this one program he told harry in a low voice that tells the news like it really is all the others are on side and are following the ministry line but this one you wait till you hear it its great only they cant do it every night they have to keep changing locations in case theyre raided and you need a password to tune in trouble is i missed the last one 
 
 he drummed lightly on the top of the radio with his wand muttering random words under his breath he threw hermione many covert glances plainly fearing an angry outburst but for all the notice she took of him he might not have been there for ten minutes or so ron tapped and muttered hermione turned the pages of her book and harry continued to practice with the blackthorn wand 
 
 finally hermione climbed down from her bunk ron ceased his tapping at once 
 
 if its annoying you ill stop he told hermione nervously 
 
 hermione did not deign to respond but approached harry 
 
 we need to talk she said 
 
 he looked at the book still clutched in her hand it was the life and lies of albus dumbledore 
 
 what he said apprehensively it flew through his mind that there was a chapter on him in there he was not sure he felt up to hearing ritas version of his relationship with dumbledore hermiones answer however was completely unexpected 
 
 i want to go and see xenophilius lovegood 
 
 he stared at her 
 
 sorry 
 
 xenophilius lovegood lunas father i want to go and talk to him 
 
 er c why 
 
 she took a deep breath as though bracing herself and said its that mark the mark in beedle the bard look at this 
 
 she thrust the life and lies of albus dumbledore under harrys unwilling eyes and saw a photograph of the original letter that dumbledore had written grindelwald with dumbledores familiar thin slanting handwriting he hated seeing absolute proof that dumbledore really had written those words that they had not been ritas invention 
 
 the signature said hermione look at the signature harry 
 
 he obeyed for a moment he had no idea what she was talking about but looking more closely with the aid of his lit wand he saw that dumbledore had replaced the a of albus with a tiny version of the same triangular mark inscribed upon the tales of beedle the bard 
 
 er c what are you c said ron tentatively but hermione quelled him with a look and turned back to harry 
 
 it keeps cropping up doesnt it she said i know viktor said it was grindelwalds mark but it was definitely on that old grave in godrics hollow and the dates on the headstone were long before grindelwald came along and now this well we cant ask dumbledore or grindelwald what it means c i dont even know whether grindelwalds still alive c but we can ask mr lovegood he was wearing the symbol at the wedding im sure this is important harry 
 
 harry did not answer immediately he looked into her intense eager face and then out into the surrounding darkness thinking after a long pause he said hermione we dont need another godrics hollow we talked ourselves into going there and c 
 
 but it keeps appearing harry dumbledore left me the tales of beedle the bard how do you know were not supposed to find out about the sign 
 
 here we go again harry felt slightly exasperated we keep trying to convince ourselves dumbledore left us secret signs and clues c 
 
 the deluminator turned out to be pretty useful piped up ron i think hermiones right i think we ought to go and see lovegood 
 
 harry threw him a dark look he was quite sure that rons support of hermione had little to do with a desire to know the meaning of the triangular rune 
 
 it wont be like godrics hollow ron added lovegoods on your side harry the quibblers been for you all along it keeps telling everyone theyve got to help you 
 
 im sure this is important said hermione earnestly 
 
 but dont you think if it was dumbledore would have told me about it before he died 
 
 maybe maybe its something you need to find out for yourself said hermione with a faint air of clutching at straws 
 
 yeah said ron sycophantically that makes sense 
 
 no it doesnt snapped hermione but i still think we ought to talk to mr lovegood a symbol that links dumbledore grindelwald and godrics hollow harry im sure we ought to know about this 
 
 i think we should vote on it said ron those in favor of going to see love good c 
 
 his hand flew into the air before hermiones her lips quivered suspiciously as she raised her own 
 
 outvoted harry sorry said ron clapping him on the back 
 
 fine said harry half amused half irritated only once weve seen lovegood lets try and look for some more horcruxes shall we where do the lovegoods live anyway do either of you know 
 
 yeah theyre not far from my place said ron i dunno exactly where but mum and dad always point toward the hills whenever they mention them shouldnt be hard to find 
 
 when hermione had returned to her bunk harry lowered his voice 
 
 you only agreed to try and get back in her good books 
 
 alls fair in love and war said ron brightly and this is a bit of both cheer up its the christmas holidays lunall be home 
 
 they had an excellent view of the village of ottery st catchopole from the breezy hillside to which they disapparated next morning from their high vantage point the village looked like a collection of toy houses in the great slanting shafts of sunlight stretching to earth in the breaks between clouds they stood for a minute or two looking toward the burrow their hands shadowing their eyes but all they could make out were the high hedges and trees of the orchard which afforded the crooked little house protection from muggle eyes 
 
 its weird being this near but not going to visit said ron 
 
 well its not like you havent just seen them you were there for christmas said hermione coldly 
 
 i wasnt at the burrow said ron with an incredulous laugh do you think i was going to go back there and tell them all id walked out on you yeah fred and george wouldve been great about it and ginny shed have been really understanding 
 
 but where have you been then asked hermione surprised 
 
 bill and fleurs new place shell cottage bills always been decent to me he c he wasnt impressed when he heard what id done but he didnt go on about it he knew i was really sorry none of the rest of the family know i was there bill told mum he and fleur werent going home for christmas because they wanted to spend it alone you know first holiday after they were married i dont think fleur minded you know how much she hates celestina warbeck 
 
 ron turned his back on the burrow 
 
 lets try up here he said leading the way over the top of the hill 
 
 they walked for a few hours harry at hermiones insistence hidden beneath the invisibility cloak the cluster of low hills appeared to be uninhabited apart from one small cottage which seemed deserted 
 
 do you think its theirs and theyve gone away for christmas said hermione peering through the window at a neat little kitchen with geraniums on the windowsill ron snorted 
 
 listen ive got a feeling youd be able to tell who lived there if you looked through the lovegoods window lets try the next lot of hills 
 
 so they disapparated a few miles farther north 
 
 aha shouted ron as the wind whipped their hair and clothes ron was pointing upward toward the top of the hill on which they had appeared where a most house rose vertically against the sky a great black cylinder with a ghostly moon hanging behind it in the afternoon sky thats got to be lunas house who else would live in a place like that it looks like a giant rook 
 
 its nothing like a bird said hermione frowning at the tower 
 
 i was talking about a chess rook said ron a castle to you 
 
 rons legs were the longest and he reached the top of the hill first when harry and hermione caught up with him panting and clutching stitches in their sides they found him grinning broadly 
 
 its theirs said ron look 
 
 three signs had been tacked to a gate the first read 
 
 the quibbler editor x lovegood 
 the second 
 
 pick your own mistletoe 
 the third 
 keep off the dirigible plums 
 the gate creaked as they opened it the zigzagging path leading to the front door was overgrown with a variety of odd plants including a bush covered in orange radishlike fruit luna sometimes wore as earrings harry thought he recognized a snargaluff and gave the wizened stump a wide berth two aged crab apple trees bent with the wind stripped of leaves but still heavy with red fruits and bushy crowns of white beaded mistletoe stood sentinel on either side of the front door a little owl with a slightly flattened hawklike head peered down at them from one of the branches 
 
 youd better take off the invisibility cloak harry said hermione its you mr lovegood wants to help not us 
 
 he did as she suggested handing her the cloak to stow in the beaded bag she then rapped three times on the thick black door which was studded with iron nails and bore a knocker shaped like an eagle 
 
 barely ten seconds passed then the door was flung open and there stood xenophilius lovegood barefoot and wearing what appeared to be a stained nightshirt his long white candyfloss hair was dirty and unkempt xenophilius had been positively dapper at bill and fleurs wedding by comparison 
 
 what what is it who are you what do you want he cried in a querulous voice looking first at hermione then at ron and finally at harry upon which his mouth fell open in a perfect comical o 
 
 hello mr lovegood said harry holding out his hand im harry harry potter 
 
 xenophilius did not take harrys hand although the eye that was not pointing inward at his nose slid straight to the scar on harrys forehead 
 
 would it be okay if we came in asked harry theres something wed like to ask you 
 
 i im not sure thats advisable whispered xenophilius he swallowed and cast a quick look around the garden rather a shock my word i im afraid i dont really think i ought to c 
 
 it wont take long said harry slightly disappointed by this welcome 
 
 i c oh all right then come in quickly quickly 
 
 they were barely over the threshold when xenophilius slammed the door shut behind them they were standing in the most peculiar kitchen harry had ever seen the room was perfectly circular so that he felt like being inside a giant pepper pot everything was curved to fit the walls c the stove the sink and the cupboards c and all of it had been painted with flowers insects and birds in bright primary colors harry thought he recognized lunas styles the effect in such and enclosed space was slightly overwhelming 
 
 in the middle of the floor a spiral staircase led to the upper levels there was a great deal of clattering and banging coming from overhead harry wondered what luna could be doing 
 
 youd better come up said xenophilius still looking extremely uncomfortable and he led the way 
 
 the room above seemed to be a combination of living room and workplace and as such was even more cluttered than the kitchen though much smaller and entirely round the room somewhat resembled the room of requirement on the unforgettable occasion that it had transformed itself into a gigantic labyrinth comprised of centuries of hidden objects there were piles upon piles of books and papers on every surface delicately made models of creatures harry did not recognize all flapping wings or snapping jaws hung from the ceiling 
 
 luna was not there the thing that was making such a racket was a wooden object covered in magically turning cogs and wheels it looked like the bizarre offspring of a workbench and a set of shelves but after a moment harry deduced that it was an printing press due to the fact that it was churning out quibblers 
 
 excuse me said xenophilius and he strode over to the machine seized grubbily tablecloth from beneath an immense number of books and papers which all tumbled onto the floor and threw it over the press somewhat muffling the loud bangs and clatters he then faced harry 
 
 why have you come here before harry could speak however hermione let out a small cry of shock 
 
 mr lovegood c whats that 
 
 see was pointing at an enormous gray spiral horn not unlike that of a unicorn which had been mounted on the wall protruding several feet into the room 
 
 it is the horn of a snorkack said xenophilius 
 
 no it isnt said hermione 
 
 hermione muttered harry embarrassed nows not the moment c 
 
 but harry its an erumpent horn its a class b tradeable material and its an extraordinary dangerous thing to have in a house 
 
 howd you know its an erumpent horn asked ron edging away from the horn as fast as he could given the extreme clutter of the room 
 
 theres a description in fantastic beasts and where to find them mr lovegood you need to get rid of it straightaway dont you know it can explode at the slightest touch 
 
 the crumple horned snorkack said xenophilius very clearly a mulish look upon his face is a shy and highly magical creature and its horn c 
 
 mr lovegood i recognize the grooved markings around the base thats an erumpent horn and its incredibly dangerous c i dont know where you got it 
 
 i bought it said xenophilius dogmatically two weeks ago from a delightful young wizard who knew my interest in the exquisite snorkack a christmas surprise for my luna now he said turning to harry why exactly have you come here mr potter 
 
 we need some help said harry before hermione could start again 
 
 ah said xenophilius help hmm 
 
 his good eye moved again to harrys scar he seemed simultaneously terrified and mesmerized 
 
 yes the thing is helping harry potter rather dangerous 
 
 arent you the one who keeps telling everyone its their first duty to help harry said ron in that magazine of yours 
 
 xenophilius glanced behind him at the concealed printing press still banging and clattering beneath the tablecloth 
 
 er c yes i have expressed that view however c 
 
 thats for everyone else to do not you personally said ron 
 
 xenophilius did not answer he kept swallowing his eyes darting between the three of them harry had the impression that he was undergoing some painful internal struggle 
 
 wheres luna asked hermione lets see what she thinks 
 
 xenophilius gulped he seemed to be steeling himself finally he said in a shaky voice difficult to hear over the noise of the printing press luna is down at the stream fishing for freshwater plimpies sheshe will like to see you ill go and call her and then c yes very well i shall try to help you 
 
 he disappeared down the spiral staircase and they heard the front open and close they looked at each other 
 
 cowardly old wart said ron lunas got ten times his guts 
 
 hes probably worried about whatll happen to them if the death eaters find out i was here said harry 
 
 well i agree with ron said hermione awful old hypocrite telling everyone else to help you and trying to worm our of it himself and for heavens sake keep away from that horn 
 
 harry crossed to the window on the far side of the room he could see a stream a thin glittering ribbon lying far below them at the base of the hill they were very high up a bird fluttered past the window as he stared in the direction of the burrow now invisible beyond another line of hills ginny was over there somewhere they were closer to each other today than they had been since bill and fleurs wedding but she could have no idea he was gazing toward her now thinking of her he suppose he ought to be glad of it anyone he came into contact with was in danger xenophiliuss attitude proved that he turned away from the windows and his gaze fell upon another peculiar object standing upon the cluttered curved slide board a stone but of a beautiful but witch wearing a most headdress two objects that resembled golden ear trumpets curved out from the sides a tiny pair of glittering blue wing was stuck to a leather strap that ran over the top of her head while one of the orange radishes had been stuck to a second strap around her forehead 
 
 look at this said harry 
 
 fetching said ron surprised he didnt wear that to the wedding 
 
 they heard the front door close and a moment later xenophilius climbed back up the spiral staircase into the room his thin legs now encase in wellington boots bearing a tray of teacups and a steaming teapot 
 
 ah you have spotted my pet invention he said shoving the tray into hermiones arms and joining harry at the statues side 
 
 modeled fittingly enough upon the head of the beautiful rowens ravenclaw wit beyond measure is a mans greatest treasure 
 
 he indicated the objects like ear trumpets 
 
 these are the wrackpurt siphons c to remove all sources of distraction from the thinkers immediate area here he pointed out the tiny wings a billywig propeller to induce an elevated frame of mind finally he pointed to the orange radish the dirigible plum so as to enhance the ability to accept the extraordinary 
 
 xenophilius strode back to the tea tray which hermione had managed to balance precariously on one of the cluttered side tables 
 
 may i offer you all an infusion of gurdyroots said xenophilius we make it ourselves as he started to pour out the drink which was as deeply purple as beetroot juice he added luna is down beyond bottom bridge she is most excited that you are here she ought not to be too long she has caught nearly enough plumpies to make soup for all of us do sit down and help yourselves to sugar 
 
 now he remove a tottering pile of papers from an armchair and sat down his wellingtoned legs crossed how may i help you mr potter 
 
 well said harry glancing at hermione who nodded encouragingly its about that symbol you were wearing around your neck at bill and fleurs wedding mr lovegood we wondered what it meant 
 
 xenophilius raised his eyebrows 
 
 are you referring to the sign of the deathly hallows

 fairy tales of hans christian andersen 
 little claus and big claus 
 by hans christian andersen 
 
 in a village there once lived two men who had the same name 
 they were both called claus one of them had four horses but the 
 other had only one so to distinguish them people called the owner of 
 the four horses great claus and he who had only one little 
 claus now we shall hear what happened to them for this is a true 
 story 
 
 through the whole week little claus was obliged to plough for 
 great claus and lend him his one horse and once a week on a sunday great claus lent him all his four horses then how little claus would smack his whip over all five horses they were as good as his own on that one day the sun shone brightly and the church bells were ringing merrily as the people passed by dressed in their best clothes with their under their arms they were going to hear the clergyman preach they looked at little claus ploughing with his five horses and he was so proud that he smacked his whip and said my five horses 
 
 you must not say that said big claus for only one of them 
 belongs to you but little claus soon forgot what he ought to say 
 and when any one passed he would call out my five horses 
 
 now i must beg you not to say that again said big claus for 
 if you do i shall hit your horse on the head so that he will drop 
 dead on the spot and there will be an end of him 
 
 i promise you i will not say it any more said the other but as 
 soon as people came by nodding to him and wishing him good day he became so pleased and thought how grand it looked to have five horses ploughing in his field that he cried out again all my horses 
 
 your horses for you said big claus and seizing a 
 hammer he struck the one horse of little claus on the head and he 
 fell dead instantly 
 
 oh now i have no horse at all said little claus weeping but 
 after a while he took off the dead skin and hung the hide 
 to dry in the wind then he put the dry skin into a bag and 
 placing it over his shoulder went out into the next town to sell 
 the skin he had a very long way to go and had to pass 
 through a dark gloomy forest presently a storm arose and he lost 
 his way and before he discovered the right path evening came on and it was still a long way to the town and too far to return home before night near the road stood a large farmhouse the shutters outside the windows were closed but lights shone through the crevices at the top 
 
 i might get permission to stay here for the night thought little 
 claus so he went up to the door and knocked the wife opened the door but when she heard what he wanted she told him to go away as her husband would not allow her to admit strangers 
 then i shall be obliged to lie out here said little claus to himself as the wife shut the door in his face near to the farmhouse 
 stood a large haystack and between it and the house was a small shed with a thatched roof i can lie up there said little claus as he 
 saw the roof it will make a famous bed but i hope the stork will 
 not fly down and bite my legs for on it stood a living stork 
 whose nest was in the roof so little claus climbed to the roof of the 
 shed and while he turned himself to get comfortable he discovered 
 that the wooden shutters which were closed did not reach to the tops of the windows of the farmhouse so that he could see into a room in which a large table was laid out with wine roast meat and a 
 splendid fish the wife and the sexton were sitting at the 
 table together and she filled his glass and helped him plenteously 
 to fish which appeared to be his favorite dish if i could only 
 get some too thought little claus and then as he stretched his 
 neck towards the window he spied a large beautiful pie indeed 
 they had a glorious feast before them 
 
 at this moment he heard some one riding down the road towards the 
 farmhouse it was the farmer returning home he was a good man but still he had a very strange prejudice he could not bear the sight of a sexton if one appeared before him he would put himself in a 
 terrible rage in consequence of this dislike the sexton had gone 
 to visit the wife during her absence from home and the good woman had placed before him the best she had in the house to eat when she heard the farmer coming she was frightened and begged the sexton to hide himself in a large empty chest that stood in the room he did so for he knew her husband could not endure the sight of a sexton the woman then quickly put away the wine and hid all the rest of the nice things in the oven for if her husband had seen them he would have asked what they were brought out for oh dear sighed little claus from the top of the shed as he saw all the good things disappear 
 
 is any one up there asked the farmer looking up and 
 discovering little claus why are you lying up there come down 
 and come into the house with me so little claus came down and told the farmer how he had lost his way and begged for a lodging 
 
 all right said the farmer but we must have something to eat 
 first 
 
 the woman received them both very kindly laid the cloth on a 
 large table and placed before them a dish of porridge the farmer was very hungry and ate his porridge with a good appetite but little 
 claus could not help thinking of the nice roast meat fish and pies 
 which he knew were in the oven under the table at his feet lay 
 the sack containing the skin which he intended to sell at the 
 next town now little claus did not relish the porridge at all so 
 he trod with his foot on the sack under the table and the dry skin 
 squeaked quite loud hush said little claus to his sack at the 
 same time treading upon it again till it squeaked louder than before 
 hallo what have you got in your sack asked the farmer 
 
 oh it is a conjuror said little claus and he says we need 
 not eat porridge for he has conjured the oven full of roast meat 
 fish and pie 
 
 wonderful cried the farmer starting up and opening the oven 
 door and there lay all the nice things hidden by the wife 
 but which he supposed had been conjured there by the wizard under 
 the table the woman dared not say anything so she placed the 
 things before them and they both ate of the fish the meat and the 
 pastry 
 
 then little claus trod again upon his sack and it squeaked as 
 before what does he say now asked the farmer 
 
 he says replied little claus that there are three bottles 
 of wine for us standing in the corner by the oven 
 
 so the woman was obliged to bring out the wine also which she had 
 hidden and the farmer drank it till he became quite merry he would 
 have liked such a conjuror as little claus carried in his sack could 
 he conjure up the evil one asked the farmer i should like to see 
 him now while i am so merry 
 
 oh yes replied little claus my conjuror can do anything i 
 ask him can you not he asked treading at the same time on the 
 sack till it squeaked do you hear he answers yes but he fears 
 that we shall not like to look at him 
 
 oh i am not afraid what will he be like 
 
 well he is very much like a sexton 
 
 ha said the farmer then he must be ugly do you know i cannot 
 endure the sight of a sexton however that matter i shall 
 know who it is so i shall not mind now then i have got up my 
 courage but let him come too near me 
 
 stop i must ask the conjuror said little claus so he trod 
 on the bag and stooped his ear down to listen 
 
 what does he say 
 
 he says that you must go and open that large chest which stands 
 in the corner and you will see the evil one crouching down inside 
 but you must hold the lid firmly that he may not slip out 
 
 will you come and help me hold it said the farmer going 
 towards the chest in which his wife had hidden the sexton who now lay inside very much frightened the farmer opened the lid a very 
 little way and peeped in 
 
 oh cried he springing backwards i saw him and he is exactly 
 like our sexton how dreadful it is so after that he was obliged 
 to drink again and they sat and drank till far into the night 
 
 you must sell your conjuror to me said the farmer ask as much 
 as you like i will pay it indeed i would give you directly a whole 
 bushel of gold 
 
 no indeed i cannot said little claus only think how much 
 profit i could make out of this conjuror 
 
 but i should like to have him said the fanner still continuing 
 his entreaties 
 
 well said little claus at length you have been so good as 
 to give me a lodging i will not refuse you you shall have 
 the conjuror for a bushel of money but i will have quite full 
 measure 
 
 so you shall said the farmer but you must take away the chest 
 as well i would not have it in the house another hour there is no 
 knowing if he may not be still there 
 
 so little claus gave the farmer the sack containing the dried 
 skin and received in exchange a bushel of money full 
 measure the farmer also gave him a wheelbarrow on which to carry away the chest and the gold 
 
 farewell said little claus as he went off with his money and 
 the great chest in which the sexton lay still concealed on one 
 side of the forest was a broad deep river the water flowed so 
 rapidly that very few were able to swim against the stream a new 
 bridge had lately been built across it and in the middle of this 
 bridge little claus stopped and said loud enough to be heard by 
 the sexton now what shall i do with this stupid chest it is as 
 heavy as if it were full of stones i shall be tired if i roll it 
 any farther so i may as well throw it in the river if it swims after 
 me to my house well and good and if not it will not much matter 
 so he seized the chest in his hand and lifted it up a little as 
 if he were going to throw it into the water 
 
 no leave it alone cried the sexton from within the chest let 
 me out first 
 
 oh exclaimed little claus pretending to be frightened he 
 is in there still is he i must throw him into the river that he may 
 be drowned 
 
 oh no oh no cried the sexton i will give you a whole 
 bushel full of money if you will let me go 
 
 why that is another matter said little claus opening the 
 chest the sexton crept out pushed the empty chest into the water 
 and went to his house then he measured out a whole bushel full of 
 gold for little claus who had already received one from the farmer 
 so that now he had a barrow full 
 
 i have been well paid for my horse said he to himself when he 
 reached home entered his own room and emptied all his money into a heap on the floor how vexed great claus will be when he finds out how rich i have become all through my one horse but i shall not 
 tell him exactly how it all happened then he sent a boy to great 
 claus to borrow a bushel measure 
 
 what can he want it for thought great claus so he smeared 
 the bottom of the measure with tar that some of whatever was put into it might stick there and remain and so it happened for when the 
 measure returned three new silver florins were sticking to it 
 
 what does this mean said great claus so he ran off directly to 
 little claus and asked where did you get so much money 
 
 oh for my skin i sold it yesterday 
 
 it was certainly well paid for then said great claus and he 
 ran home to his house seized a hatchet and knocked all his four 
 horses on the head flayed off their skins and took them to the 
 town to sell skins skins buy skins he cried as he went 
 through the streets all the shoemakers and tanners came running 
 and asked how much he wanted for them 
 
 a bushel of money for each replied great claus 
 
 are you mad they all cried do you think we have money to 
 spend by the bushel 
 
 skins skins he cried again buy skins but to all who 
 inquired the price his answer was a bushel of money 
 
 he is making fools of us said they all then the shoemakers 
 took their straps and the tanners their leather aprons and began 
 to beat great claus 
 
 skins skins they cried mocking him yes mark your 
 skin for you till it is black and blue 
 
 out of the town with him said they and great claus was obliged 
 to run as fast as he could he had never before been so thoroughly 
 beaten 
 
 ah said he as he came to his house little claus shall pay me 
 for this i will beat him to death 
 
 meanwhile the old grandmother of little claus died she had been 
 cross unkind and really spiteful to him but he was very sorry 
 and took the dead woman and laid her in his warm bed to see if he 
 could bring her to life again there he determined that she should lie 
 the whole night while he seated himself in a chair in a corner of the 
 room as he had often done before during the night as he sat there 
 the door opened and in came great claus with a hatchet he knew 
 well where little bed stood so he went right up to it and 
 struck the old grandmother on the head thinking it must be little 
 claus 
 
 there cried he now you cannot make a fool of me again and 
 then he went home 
 
 that is a very wicked man thought little claus he meant to 
 kill me it is a good thing for my old grandmother that she was 
 already dead or he would have taken her life then he dressed his 
 old grandmother in her best clothes borrowed a horse of his harnessed it to a cart then he placed the old woman on the back seat so that she might not fall out as he drove and rode away through the wood by sunrise they reached a large inn where little claus stopped and went to get something to eat the landlord was a rich man and a good man too but as passionate as if he had been made of pepper and snuff 
 
 good morning said he to little claus you are come betimes 
 
 
 yes said little claus i am going to the town with my old 
 grandmother she is sitting at the back of the wagon but i cannot 
 bring her into the room will you take her a glass of mead but you 
 must speak very loud for she cannot hear well 
 
 yes certainly i will replied the landlord and pouring out 
 a glass of mead he carried it out to the dead grandmother who sat 
 upright in the cart here is a glass of mead from your grandson 
 said the landlord the dead woman did not answer a word but sat quite still do you not hear cried the landlord as loud as he could 
 here is a glass of mead from your grandson 
 
 again and again he bawled it out but as she did not stir he 
 flew into a passion and threw the glass of mead in her face it 
 struck her on the nose and she fell backwards out of the cart for 
 she was only seated there not tied in 
 
 hallo cried little claus rushing out of the door and seizing 
 hold of the landlord by the throat you have killed my grandmother 
 see here is a great hole in her forehead 
 
 oh how unfortunate said the landlord wringing his hands 
 this all comes of my fiery temper dear little claus i will give you 
 a bushel of money i will bury your grandmother as if she were my own only keep silent or else they will cut off my head and that would be disagreeable 
 
 so it happened that little claus received another bushel of money 
 and the landlord buried his old grandmother as if she had been his 
 own when little claus reached home again he immediately sent a boy to great claus requesting him to lend him a bushel measure how is this thought great claus did i not kill him i must go and see for myself so he went to little claus and took the bushel measure with him how did you get all this money asked great claus staring with wide open eyes at his treasures 
 
 you killed my grandmother instead of me said little claus 
 
 so i have sold her for a bushel of money 
 
 that is a good price at all events said great claus so he went 
 home took a hatchet and killed his old grandmother with one blow 
 then he placed her on a cart and drove into the town to the 
 apothecary and asked him if he would buy a dead body 
 whose is it and where did you get it asked the apothecary 
 
 it is my grandmother he replied i killed her with a blow 
 that i might get a bushel of money for her 
 
 heaven preserve us cried the apothecary you are out of your 
 mind say such things or you will lose your head and then 
 he talked to him seriously about the wicked deed he had done and told him that such a wicked man would surely be punished great claus got so frightened that he rushed out of the surgery jumped into the cart whipped up his horses and drove home quickly the apothecary and all the people thought him mad and let him drive where he liked 
 
 you shall pay for this said great claus as soon as he got into 
 the highroad that you shall little claus so as soon as he reached 
 home he took the largest sack he could find and went over to little 
 claus you have played me another trick said he first i killed 
 all my horses and then my old grandmother and it is all your 
 fault but you shall not make a fool of me any more so he laid 
 hold of little claus round the body and pushed him into the sack 
 which he took on his shoulders saying now going to drown you in the river 
 
 he had a long way to go before he reached the river and little 
 claus was not a very light weight to carry the road led by the 
 church and as they passed he could hear the organ playing and the 
 people singing beautifully great claus put down the sack close to the 
 and thought he might as well go in and hear a psalm 
 before he went any farther little claus could not possibly get out of 
 the sack and all the people were in church so in he went 
 
 oh dear oh dear sighed little claus in the sack as he turned and twisted about but he found he could not loosen the string with which it was tied presently an old cattle driver with snowy hair passed by carrying a large staff in his hand with which he drove a large herd of cows and oxen before him they stumbled against the sack in which lay little claus and turned it over oh dear sighed little claus i am very young yet i am soon going to heaven 
 
 and i poor fellow said the drover i who am so old already 
 cannot get there 
 
 open the sack cried little claus creep into it instead of me 
 and you will soon be there 
 
 with all my heart replied the drover opening the sack from 
 which sprung little claus as quickly as possible will you take 
 care of my cattle said the old man as he crept into the bag 
 
 yes said little claus and he tied up the sack and then walked 
 off with all the cows and oxen 
 
 when great claus came out of church he took up the sack and 
 placed it on his shoulders it appeared to have become lighter for 
 the old drover was not half so heavy as little claus 
 
 how light he seems now said he ah it is because i have 
 been to a church so he walked on to the river which was deep and 
 broad and threw the sack containing the old drover into the water 
 believing it to be little claus there you may lie he exclaimed 
 
 you will play me no more tricks now then he turned to go home 
 but when he came to a place where two roads crossed there was 
 little claus driving the cattle how is this said great claus did 
 i not drown you just now 
 
 yes said little claus you threw me into the river about 
 half an hour ago 
 
 but wherever did you get all these fine beasts asked great 
 claus 
 
 these beasts are replied little claus tell 
 you the whole story and thank you for drowning me i am above you 
 now i am really very rich i was frightened to be sure while i 
 lay tied up in the sack and the wind whistled in my ears when you 
 threw me into the river from the bridge and i sank to the bottom 
 immediately but i did not hurt myself for i fell upon beautifully 
 soft grass which grows down there and in a moment the sack opened and the sweetest little maiden came towards me she had robes and a wreath of green leaves on her wet hair she took me by the hand and said so you are come little claus and here are some cattle for you to begin with about a mile farther on the road there is another herd for you then i saw that the river formed a great highway for the people who live in the sea they were walking 
 and driving here and there from the sea to the land at the spot where 
 the river terminates the bed of the river was covered with the 
 loveliest flowers and sweet fresh grass the fish swam past me as 
 rapidly as the birds do here in the air how handsome all the people 
 were and what fine cattle were grazing on the hills and in the 
 valleys 
 
 but why did you come up again said great claus if it was 
 all so beautiful down there i should not have done so 
 well said little claus it was good policy on my part you 
 heard me say just now that i was told by the to go a mile 
 farther on the road and i should find a whole herd of cattle by 
 the road she meant the river for she could not travel any other 
 way but i knew the winding of the river and how it bends 
 sometimes to the right and sometimes to the left and it seemed a long 
 way so i chose a shorter one and by coming up to the land and then driving across the fields back again to the river i shall save half a 
 mile and get all my cattle more quickly 
 
 what a lucky fellow you are exclaimed great claus do you 
 think i should get any if i went down to the bottom of 
 the river 
 
 yes i think so said little claus but i cannot carry you 
 there in a sack you are too heavy however if you will go there 
 first and then creep into a sack i will throw you in with the 
 greatest pleasure 
 
 thank you said great claus but remember if i do not get 
 any down there i shall come up again and give you a good 
 thrashing 
 
 no now be too fierce about it said little claus as 
 they walked on towards the river when they approached it the cattle 
 who were very thirsty saw the stream and ran down to drink 
 
 see what a hurry they are in said little claus they are 
 longing to get down again 
 
 come help me make haste said great claus or get 
 beaten so he crept into a large sack which had been lying across 
 the back of one of the oxen 
 
 put in a stone said great claus or i may not sink 
 
 oh not much fear of that he replied still he put a 
 large stone into the bag and then tied it tightly and gave it a 
 push 
 
 plump in went great claus and immediately sank to the bottom 
 of the river 
 
 afraid he will not find any cattle said little claus and 
 then he drove his own beasts homewards

 the ray of light in the hovel 
 the big girl approached and laid her hand in her 
 feel how cold i am said she 
 bah replied the father i am much colder than that 
 the mother exclaimed impetuously 
 you always have something better than any one else so you do even bad things 
 down with you said the man 
 the mother being eyed after a certain fashion held her tongue 
 silence reigned for a moment in the hovel 
 the elder girl was removing the mud from the bottom of her mantle with a careless air her younger sister continued to sob the mother had taken the head between her hands and was covering it with kisses whispering to her the while 
 my treasure i entreat you it is nothing of consequence cry you will anger your father 
 no exclaimed the father quite the contrary sob sob right 
 then turning to the elder 
 there now 
 he is not coming 
 what if he were not to come i shall have extinguished my fire wrecked my chair torn my shirt and broken my pane all for nothing 
 and wounded the child murmured the mother 
 do you know went on the father that beastly cold in this garret 
 what if that man should not come 
 oh 
 see there you 
 he makes us wait 
 he says to himself 
 well they will wait for me 
 what there for 
 oh how i hate them and with what joy jubilation enthusiasm and satisfaction i could strangle all those rich folks all those rich folks these men who pretend to be charitable who put on airs who go to mass who make presents to the priesthood preachy preachy in their skullcaps and who think themselves above us and who come for the purpose of humiliating us and to bring us clothes as they say old duds that are not worth four sous 
 and bread not what i want pack of rascals that they are money ah money 
 never 
 because they say that we would go off and drink it up and that we are drunkards and idlers 
 and they what are they then and what have they been in their time 
 thieves they never could have become rich otherwise 
 oh 
 society ought to be grasped by the four corners of the cloth and tossed into the air all of it 
 it would all be smashed very likely but at least no one would have anything and there would be that much gained but what is that blockhead of a benevolent gentleman doing will he come 
 perhaps the animal has forgotten the address bet that that old beast 
 at that moment there came a light tap at the door the man rushed to it and opened it exclaiming amid profound bows and smiles of adoration 
 enter sir 
 deign to enter most respected benefactor and your charming young lady also 
 a man of ripe age and a young girl made their appearance on the threshold of the attic 
 marius had not quitted his post 
 his feelings for the moment surpassed the powers of the human tongue 
 it was she 
 whoever has loved knows all the radiant meanings contained in those three letters of that word 
 she 
 it was certainly she 
 marius could hardly distinguish her through the luminous vapor which had suddenly spread before his eyes it was that sweet absent being that star which had beamed upon him for six months it was those eyes that brow that mouth that lovely vanished face which had created night by its departure the vision had been eclipsed now it reappeared 
 it reappeared in that gloom in that garret in that misshapen attic in all that horror 
 marius shuddered in dismay 
 what 
 it was she 
 the palpitations of his heart troubled his sight 
 he felt that he was on the brink of bursting into tears 
 what 
 he beheld her again at last after having sought her so long 
 it seemed to him that he had lost his soul and that he had just found it again 
 she was the same as ever only a little pale her delicate face was framed in a bonnet of violet velvet her figure was concealed beneath a pelisse of black satin 
 beneath her long dress a glimpse could be caught of her tiny foot shod in a silken boot 
 she was still accompanied by m leblanc 
 she had taken a few steps into the room and had deposited a tolerably bulky parcel on the table 
 the eldest jondrette girl had retired behind the door and was staring with sombre eyes at that velvet bonnet that silk mantle and that charming happy face

 book ten 
 chapter xx 
 
 on the morning of the pierre was leaving mozhaysk at the descent of the high steep hill down which a winding road led out of the town past the cathedral on the right where a service was being held and the bells were ringing pierre got out of his vehicle and proceeded on foot behind him a cavalry regiment was coming down the hill preceded by its singers coming up toward him was a train of carts carrying men who had been wounded in the engagement the day before the peasant drivers shouting and lashing their horses kept crossing from side to side the carts in each of which three or four wounded soldiers were lying or sitting jolted over the stones that had been thrown on the steep incline to make it something like a road the wounded bandaged with rags with pale cheeks compressed lips and knitted brows held on to the sides of the carts as they were jolted against one another almost all of them stared with naive childlike curiosity at white hat and green coat 
 coachman shouted angrily at the convoy of wounded to keep to one side of the road the cavalry regiment as it descended the hill with its singers surrounded carriage and blocked the road pierre stopped being pressed against the side of the cutting in which the road ran the sunshine from behind the hill did not penetrate into the cutting and there it was cold and damp but above head was the bright august sunshine and the bells sounded merrily one of the carts with wounded stopped by the side of the road close to pierre the driver in his bast shoes ran panting up to it placed a stone under one of its tireless hind wheels and began arranging the on his little horse 
 one of the wounded an old soldier with a bandaged arm who was following the cart on foot caught hold of it with his sound hand and turned to look at pierre 
 i say fellow countryman will they set us down here or take us on to moscow he asked 
 pierre was so deep in thought that he did not hear the question he was looking now at the cavalry regiment that had met the convoy of wounded now at the cart by which he was standing in which two wounded men were sitting and one was lying one of those sitting up in the cart had probably been wounded in the cheek his whole head was wrapped in rags and one cheek was swollen to the size of a head his nose and mouth were twisted to one side this soldier was looking at the cathedral and crossing himself another a young lad a recruit as white as though there was no blood in his thin face looked at pierre kindly with a fixed smile the third lay prone so that his face was not visible the cavalry singers were passing close by 
 ah lost quite lost is my head so keen 
 living in a foreign land they sang their soldiers dance song 
 as if responding to them but with a different sort of merriment the metallic sound of the bells reverberated high above and the hot rays of the sun bathed the top of the opposite slope with yet another sort of merriment but beneath the slope by the cart with the wounded near the panting little nag where pierre stood it was damp somber and sad 
 the soldier with the swollen cheek looked angrily at the cavalry singers 
 oh the coxcombs he muttered reproachfully 
 not the soldiers only but seen peasants today too the peasants even they have to go said the soldier behind the cart addressing pierre with a sad smile no distinctions made nowadays they want the whole nation to fall on them in a word moscow they want to make an end of it 
 in spite of the obscurity of the words pierre understood what he wanted to say and nodded approval 
 the road was clear again pierre descended the hill and drove on 
 he kept looking to either side of the road for familiar faces but only saw everywhere the unfamiliar faces of various military men of different branches of the service who all looked with astonishment at his white hat and green tail coat 
 having gone nearly three miles he at last met an acquaintance and eagerly addressed him this was one of the head army doctors he was driving toward pierre in a covered gig sitting beside a young surgeon and on recognizing pierre he told the cossack who occupied the seat to pull up 
 count your excellency how come you to be here asked the doctor 
 well you know i wanted to see 
 yes yes there will be something to see 
 pierre got out and talked to the doctor explaining his intention of taking part in a battle 
 the doctor advised him to apply direct to kutuzov 
 why should you be god knows where out of sight during the battle he said exchanging glances with his young companion anyhow his serene highness knows you and will receive you graciously what you must do 
 the doctor seemed tired and in a hurry 
 you think so ah i also wanted to ask you where our position is exactly said pierre 
 the position repeated the doctor well not my line drive past tatarinova a lot of digging is going on there go up the hillock and see 
 can one see from there if you would 
 but the doctor interrupted him and moved toward his gig 
 i would go with you but on my honor up to here and he pointed to his throat galloping to the commander of the corps how do matters stand you know count be a battle tomorrow out of an army of a hundred thousand we must expect at least twenty thousand wounded and we stretchers or bunks or dressers or doctors enough for six thousand we have ten thousand carts but we need other things as well we must manage as best we can 
 the strange thought that of the thousands of men young and old who had stared with merry surprise at his hat perhaps the very men he had noticed twenty thousand were inevitably doomed to wounds and death amazed pierre 
 they may die tomorrow why are they thinking of anything but death and by some latent sequence of thought the descent of the mozhaysk hill the carts with the wounded the ringing bells the slanting rays of the sun and the songs of the cavalrymen vividly recurred to his mind 
 the cavalry ride to battle and meet the wounded and do not for a moment think of what awaits them but pass by winking at the wounded yet from among these men twenty thousand are doomed to die and they wonder at my hat strange thought pierre continuing his way to tatarinova 
 in front of a house to the left of the road stood carriages wagons and crowds of orderlies and sentinels the commander in chief was putting up there but just when pierre arrived he was not in and hardly any of the staff were there they had gone to the church service pierre drove on toward gorki 
 when he had ascended the hill and reached the little village street he saw for the first time peasant militiamen in their white shirts and with crosses on their caps who talking and laughing loudly animated and perspiring were at work on a huge knoll overgrown with grass to the right of the road 
 some of them were digging others were wheeling barrowloads of earth along planks while others stood about doing nothing 
 two officers were standing on the knoll directing the men on seeing these peasants who were evidently still amused by the novelty of their position as soldiers pierre once more thought of the wounded men at mozhaysk and understood what the soldier had meant when he said they want the whole nation to fall on them the sight of these bearded peasants at work on the battlefield with their queer clumsy boots and perspiring necks and their shirts opening from the left toward the middle unfastened exposing their sunburned collarbones impressed pierre more strongly with the solemnity and importance of the moment than anything he had yet seen or heard

 chapter ix 
 
 jondrette comes near weeping 
 the hovel was so dark that people coming from without felt on entering it the effect produced on entering a cellar the two advanced therefore with a certain hesitation being hardly able to distinguish the vague forms surrounding them while they could be clearly seen and scrutinized by the eyes of the inhabitants of the garret who were accustomed to this twilight 
 m leblanc approached with his sad but kindly look and said to jondrette the father 
 monsieur in this package you will find some new clothes and some woollen stockings and blankets 
 our angelic benefactor overwhelms us said jondrette bowing to the very earth 
 then bending down to the ear of his eldest daughter while the two visitors were engaged in examining this lamentable interior he added in a low and rapid voice 
 hey 
 what did i say 
 duds 
 no money 
 they are all alike by the way how was the letter to that old blockhead signed 
 fabantou replied the girl 
 the dramatic artist good 
 it was lucky for jondrette that this had occurred to him for at the very moment m leblanc turned to him and said to him with the air of a person who is seeking to recall a name 
 i see that you are greatly to be pitied monsieur 
 fabantou replied jondrette quickly 
 monsieur fabantou yes that is it 
 i remember 
 dramatic artist sir and one who has had some success 
 here jondrette evidently judged the moment propitious for capturing the philanthropist 
 he exclaimed with an accent which smacked at the same time of the vainglory of the mountebank at fairs and the humility of the mendicant on the highway 
 a pupil of talma 
 sir 
 i am a pupil of talma 
 fortune formerly smiled on 
 now it is turn 
 you see my benefactor no bread no fire 
 my poor babes have no fire my only chair has no seat 
 a broken pane 
 and in such weather my spouse in bed 
 ill 
 poor woman said m leblanc 
 my child wounded added jondrette 
 the child diverted by the arrival of the strangers had fallen to contemplating the young lady and had ceased to sob 
 cry bawl said jondrette to her in a low voice 
 at the same time he pinched her sore hand 
 all this was done with the talent of a juggler 
 the little girl gave vent to loud shrieks 
 the adorable young girl whom marius in his heart called his ursule approached her hastily 
 poor dear child said she 
 you see my beautiful young lady pursued jondrette her bleeding wrist 
 it came through an accident while working at a machine to earn six sous a day 
 it may be necessary to cut off her arm 
 really said the old gentleman in alarm 
 the little girl taking this seriously fell to sobbing more violently than ever 
 alas yes my benefactor replied the father 
 for several minutes jondrette had been scrutinizing the benefactor in a singular fashion 
 as he spoke he seemed to be examining the other attentively as though seeking to summon up his recollections all at once profiting by a moment when the were questioning the child with interest as to her injured hand he passed near his wife who lay in her bed with a stupid and dejected air and said to her in a rapid but very low tone 
 take a look at that man 
 then turning to m leblanc and continuing his lamentations 
 you see sir 
 all the clothing that i have is my chemise and all torn at that 
 in the depths of winter 
 i go out for lack of a coat 
 if i had a coat of any sort i would go and see mademoiselle mars who knows me and is very fond of me 
 does she not still reside in the rue de la do you know sir we played together in the provinces 
 i shared her laurels celimene would come to my succor sir 
 elmire would bestow alms on belisaire 
 but no nothing 
 and not a sou in the house my wife ill and not a sou 
 my daughter dangerously injured not a sou 
 my wife suffers from fits of suffocation 
 it comes from her age and besides her nervous system is affected she ought to have assistance and my daughter also 
 but the doctor but the apothecary 
 how am i to pay them 
 i would kneel to a penny sir 
 such is the condition to which the arts are reduced and do you know my charming young lady and you my generous protector do you know you who breathe forth virtue and goodness and who perfume that church where my daughter sees you every day when she says her i have brought up my children religiously sir i did not want them to take to the theatre 
 ah the hussies if i catch them tripping 
 i do not jest that i i read them lessons on honor on morality on virtue 
 ask them 
 they have got to walk straight 
 they are none of your unhappy wretches who begin by having no family and end by espousing the public one is mamselle nobody and one becomes madame everybody deuce take it 
 none of that in the fabantou family 
 i mean to bring them up virtuously and they shall be honest and nice and believe in god by the sacred name 
 well sir my worthy sir do you know what is going to happen is the fourth day of february the fatal day the last day of grace allowed me by my landlord if by this evening i have not paid my rent my oldest daughter my spouse with her fever my child with her wound we shall all four be turned out of here and thrown into the street on the boulevard without shelter in the rain in the snow there sir 
 i owe for four whole year that is to say sixty francs 
 jondrette lied 
 four quarters would have amounted to only forty francs and he could not owe four because six months had not elapsed since marius had paid for two 
 m leblanc drew five francs from his pocket and threw them on the table 
 jondrette found time to mutter in the ear of his eldest daughter 
 the scoundrel 
 what does he think i can do with his five francs that pay me for my chair and pane of glass 
 what comes of incurring expenses 
 in the meanwhile m leblanc had removed the large brown which he wore over his blue coat and had thrown it over the back of the chair 
 monsieur fabantou he said these five francs are all that i have about me but i shall now take my daughter home and i will return this is this evening that you must pay is it not 
 face lighted up with a strange expression he replied vivaciously 
 yes respected sir 
 at eight i must be at my 
 i will be here at six and i will fetch you the sixty francs 
 my benefactor exclaimed jondrette overwhelmed 
 and he added in a low tone 
 take a good look at him wife 
 m leblanc had taken the arm of the young girl once more and had turned towards the door 
 farewell until this evening my friends said he 
 six said jondrette 
 six precisely 
 at that moment the overcoat lying on the chair caught the eye of the elder jondrette girl 
 you are forgetting your coat sir said she 
 jondrette darted an annihilating look at his daughter accompanied by a formidable shrug of the shoulders 
 m leblanc turned back and said with a smile 
 i have not forgotten it i am leaving it 
 o my protector said jondrette my august benefactor i melt into tears 
 permit me to accompany you to your carriage 
 if you come out answered m leblanc put on this coat it really is very cold 
 jondrette did not need to be told twice 
 he hastily donned the brown and all three went out jondrette preceding the two strangers

 chapter xxi 
 
 pierre stepped out of his carriage and passing the toiling militiamen ascended the knoll from which according to the doctor the battlefield could be seen 
 it was about eleven the sun shone somewhat to the left and behind him and brightly lit up the enormous panorama which rising like an amphitheater extended before him in the clear rarefied atmosphere 
 from above on the left bisecting that amphitheater wound the smolensk highroad passing through a village with a white church some five hundred paces in front of the knoll and below it this was borodino below the village the road crossed the river by a bridge and winding down and up rose higher and higher to the village of valuevo visible about four miles away where napoleon was then stationed beyond valuevo the road disappeared into a yellowing forest on the horizon far in the distance in that birch and fir forest to the right of the road the cross and belfry of the kolocha monastery gleamed in the sun here and there over the whole of that blue expanse to right and left of the forest and the road smoking campfires could be seen and indefinite masses of troops ours and the the ground to the right along the course of the kolocha and moskva rivers was broken and hilly between the hollows the villages of bezubova and zakharino showed in the distance on the left the ground was more level there were fields of grain and the smoking ruins of semenovsk which had been burned down could be seen 
 all that pierre saw was so indefinite that neither the left nor the right side of the field fully satisfied his expectations nowhere could he see the battlefield he had expected to find but only fields meadows troops woods the smoke of campfires villages mounds and streams and try as he would he could descry no military position in this place which teemed with life nor could he even distinguish our troops from the 
 i must ask someone who knows he thought and addressed an officer who was looking with curiosity at his huge unmilitary figure 
 may i ask you said pierre what village that is in front 
 burdino it said the officer turning to his companion 
 borodino the other corrected him 
 the officer evidently glad of an opportunity for a talk moved up to pierre 
 are those our men there pierre inquired 
 yes and there further on are the french said the officer there they are there you can see them 
 where where asked pierre 
 one can see them with the naked eye why there 
 the officer pointed with his hand to the smoke visible on the left beyond the river and the same stern and serious expression that pierre had noticed on many of the faces he had met came into his face 
 ah those are the french and over there pierre pointed to a knoll on the left near which some troops could be seen 
 those are ours 
 ah ours and there pierre pointed to another knoll in the distance with a big tree on it near a village that lay in a hollow where also some campfires were smoking and something black was visible 
 his again said the officer it was the shevardino redoubt it was ours yesterday but now it is his 
 then how about our position 
 our position replied the officer with a smile of satisfaction i can tell you quite clearly because i constructed nearly all our entrenchments there you see our center at borodino just there and he pointed to the village in front of them with the white church where one crosses the kolocha you see down there where the rows of hay are lying in the hollow the bridge our center our right flank is over there he pointed sharply to the right far away in the broken ground where the moskva river is and we have thrown up three redoubts there very strong ones the left flank here the officer paused well you see difficult to explain yesterday our left flank was there at shevardino you see where the oak is but now we have withdrawn our left wing now it is over there do you see that village and the smoke semenovsk yes there he pointed to knoll but the battle will hardly be there his having moved his troops there is only a ruse he will probably pass round to the right of the moskva but wherever it may be many a man will be missing tomorrow he remarked 
 an elderly sergeant who had approached the officer while he was giving these explanations had waited in silence for him to finish speaking but at this point evidently not liking the remark interrupted him 
 gabions must be sent for said he sternly 
 the officer appeared abashed as though he understood that one might think of how many men would be missing tomorrow but ought not to speak to speak of it 
 well send number three company again the officer replied hurriedly 
 and you are you one of the doctors 
 no come on my own answered pierre and he went down the hill again passing the militiamen 
 oh those damned fellows muttered the officer who followed him holding his nose as he ran past the men at work 
 there they are bringing her coming there they are be here in a minute voices were suddenly heard saying and officers soldiers and militiamen began running forward along the road 
 a church procession was coming up the hill from borodino first along the dusty road came the infantry in ranks bareheaded and with arms reversed from behind them came the sound of church singing 
 soldiers and militiamen ran bareheaded past pierre toward the procession 
 they are bringing her our protectress the iberian mother of god someone cried 
 the smolensk mother of god another corrected him 
 the militiamen both those who had been in the village and those who had been at work on the battery threw down their spades and ran to meet the church procession following the battalion that marched along the dusty road came priests in their vestments one little old man in a hood with attendants and singers behind them soldiers and officers bore a large icon with an embossed metal cover this was the icon that had been brought from and had since accompanied the army behind before and on both sides crowds of militiamen with bared heads walked ran and bowed to the ground 
 at the summit of the hill they stopped with the icon the men who had been holding it up by the linen bands attached to it were relieved by others the chanters relit their censers and service began the hot rays of the sun beat down vertically and a fresh soft wind played with the hair of the bared heads and with the ribbons decorating the icon the singing did not sound loud under the open sky an immense crowd of bareheaded officers soldiers and militiamen surrounded the icon behind the priest and a chanter stood the notabilities on a spot reserved for them a bald general with general with a st cross on his neck stood just behind the back and without crossing himself he was evidently a german patiently awaited the end of the service which he considered it necessary to hear to the end probably to arouse the patriotism of the russian people another general stood in a martial pose crossing himself by shaking his hand in front of his chest while looking about him standing among the crowd of peasants pierre recognized several acquaintances among these notables but did not look at them his whole attention was absorbed in watching the serious expression on the faces of the crowd of soldiers and militiamen who were all gazing eagerly at the icon as soon as the tired chanters who were singing the service for the twentieth time that day began lazily and mechanically to sing save from calamity thy servants o mother of god and the priest and deacon chimed in for to thee under god we all flee as to an inviolable bulwark and protection there again kindled in all those faces the same expression of consciousness of the solemnity of the impending moment that pierre had seen on the faces at the foot of the hill at mozhaysk and momentarily on many and many faces he had met that morning and heads were bowed more frequently and hair tossed back and sighs and the sound men made as they crossed themselves were heard 
 the crowd round the icon suddenly parted and pressed against pierre someone a very important personage judging by the haste with which way was made for him was approaching the icon 
 it was kutuzov who had been riding round the position and on his way back to tatarinova had stopped where the service was being held pierre recognized him at once by his peculiar figure which distinguished him from everybody else 
 with a long overcoat on his his exceedingly stout body with uncovered white head and puffy face showing the white ball of the eye he had lost kutuzov walked with plunging swaying gait into the crowd and stopped behind the priest he crossed himself with an accustomed movement bent till he touched the ground with his hand and bowed his white head with a deep sigh behind kutuzov was bennigsen and the suite despite the presence of the commander in chief who attracted the attention of all the superior officers the militiamen and soldiers continued their prayers without looking at him 
 when the service was over kutuzov stepped up to the icon sank heavily to his knees bowed to the ground and for a long time tried vainly to rise but could not do so on account of his weakness and weight his white head twitched with the effort at last he rose kissed the icon as a child does with naively pouting lips and again bowed till he touched the ground with his hand the other generals followed his example then the officers and after them with excited faces pressing on one another crowding panting and pushing scrambled the soldiers and militiamen

 tariff of licensed cabs 
 two francs an hour 
 marius had lost nothing of this entire scene and yet in reality had seen nothing 
 his eyes had remained fixed on the young girl his heart had so to speak seized her and wholly enveloped her from the moment of her very first step in that garret 
 during her entire stay there he had lived that life of ecstasy which suspends material perceptions and precipitates the whole soul on a single point he contemplated not that girl but that light which wore a satin pelisse and a velvet bonnet 
 the star sirius might have entered the room and he would not have been any more dazzled 
 while the young girl was engaged in opening the package unfolding the clothing and the blankets questioning the sick mother kindly and the little injured girl tenderly he watched her every movement he sought to catch her words 
 he knew her eyes her brow her beauty her form her walk he did not know the sound of her voice he had once fancied that he had caught a few words at the luxembourg but he was not absolutely sure of the fact 
 he would have given ten years of his life to hear it in order that he might bear away in his soul a little of that music 
 but everything was drowned in the lamentable exclamations and trumpet bursts of jondrette this added a touch of genuine wrath to marius ecstasy 
 he devoured her with his eyes 
 he could not believe that it really was that divine creature whom he saw in the midst of those vile creatures in that monstrous lair 
 it seemed to him that he beheld a in the midst of toads 
 when she took her departure he had but one thought to follow her to cling to her trace not to quit her until he learned where she lived not to lose her again at least after having so miraculously her 
 he leaped down from the commode and seized his hat 
 as he laid his hand on the lock of the door and was on the point of opening it a sudden reflection caused him to pause the corridor was long the staircase steep jondrette was talkative m leblanc had no doubt not yet regained his carriage if on turning round in the corridor or on the staircase he were to catch sight of him marius in that house he would evidently take the alarm and find means to escape from him again and this time it would be final 
 what was he to do 
 should he wait a little 
 but while he was waiting the carriage might drive off 
 marius was perplexed at last he accepted the risk and quitted his room 
 there was no one in the corridor 
 he hastened to the stairs there was no one on the staircase 
 he descended in all haste and reached the boulevard in time to see a fiacre turning the corner of the rue du on its way back to paris 
 marius rushed headlong in that direction 
 on arriving at the angle of the boulevard he caught sight of the fiacre again rapidly descending the rue mouffetard the carriage was already a long way off and there was no means of overtaking it what run after it impossible and besides the people in the carriage would assuredly notice an individual running at full speed in pursuit of a fiacre and the father would recognize him 
 at that moment wonderful and unprecedented good luck marius perceived an empty cab passing along the boulevard 
 there was but one thing to be done to jump into this cab and follow the fiacre 
 that was sure efficacious and free from danger 
 marius made the driver a sign to halt and called to him 
 by the hour 
 marius wore no cravat he had on his which was destitute of buttons his shirt was torn along one of the plaits on the bosom 
 the driver halted winked and held out his left hand to marius rubbing his forefinger gently with his thumb 
 what is it said marius 
 pay in advance said the coachman 
 marius recollected that he had but sixteen sous about him 
 how much he demanded 
 forty sous 
 i will pay on my return 
 the only reply was to whistle the air of la palisse and to whip up his horse 
 marius stared at the retreating cabriolet with a bewildered air for the lack of four and twenty sous he was losing his joy his happiness his love 
 he had seen and he was becoming blind again 
 he reflected bitterly and it must be confessed with profound regret on the five francs which he had bestowed that very morning on that miserable girl 
 if he had had those five francs he would have been saved he would have been born again he would have emerged from the limbo and darkness he would have made his escape from isolation and spleen from his widowed state he might have the black thread of his destiny to that beautiful golden thread which had just floated before his eyes and had broken at the same instant once more 
 he returned to his hovel in despair 
 he might have told himself that m leblanc had promised to return in the evening and that all he had to do was to set about the matter more skilfully so that he might follow him on that occasion but in his contemplation it is doubtful whether he had heard this 
 as he was on the point of mounting the staircase he perceived on the other side of the boulevard near the deserted wall skirting the rue de la jondrette wrapped in the engaged in conversation with one of those men of disquieting aspect who have been dubbed by common consent prowlers of the barriers people of equivocal face of suspicious monologues who present the air of having evil minds and who generally sleep in the daytime which suggests the supposition that they work by night 
 these two men standing there motionless and in conversation in the snow which was falling in whirlwinds formed a group that a policeman would surely have observed but which marius hardly noticed 
 still in spite of his mournful preoccupation he could not refrain from saying to himself that this prowler of the barriers with whom jondrette was talking resembled a certain panchaud alias printanier alias bigrenaille whom courfeyrac had once pointed out to him as a very dangerous nocturnal roamer this name the reader has learned in the preceding book this panchaud alias printanier alias bigrenaille figured later on in many criminal trials and became a notorious rascal he was at that time only a famous rascal 
 he exists in the state of tradition among ruffians and assassins 
 he was at the head of a school towards the end of the last reign 
 and in the evening at nightfall at the hour when groups form and talk in whispers he was discussed at la force in the one might even in that prison precisely at the spot where the sewer which served the unprecedented escape in broad daylight of thirty prisoners in passes under the culvert read his name panchaud audaciously carved by his own hand on the wall of the sewer during one of his attempts at flight 
 in the police already had their eye on him but he had not as yet made a serious beginning

 chapter xxii 
 
 staggering amid the crush pierre looked about him 
 count peter kirilovich how did you get here said a voice 
 pierre looked round boris drubetskoy brushing his knees with his hand he had probably soiled them when he too had knelt before the icon came up to him smiling boris was elegantly dressed with a slightly martial touch appropriate to a campaign he wore a long coat and like kutuzov had a whip slung across his shoulder 
 meanwhile kutuzov had reached the village and seated himself in the shade of the nearest house on a bench which one cossack had run to fetch and another had hastily covered with a rug an immense and brilliant suite surrounded him 
 the icon was carried further accompanied by the throng pierre stopped some thirty paces from kutuzov talking to boris 
 he explained his wish to be present at the battle and to see the position 
 this is what you must do said boris i will do the honors of the camp to you you will see everything best from where count bennigsen will be i am in attendance on him you know mention it to him but if you want to ride round the position come along with us we are just going to the left flank then when we get back do spend the night with me and arrange a game of cards of course you know dmitri sergeevich those are his quarters and he pointed to the third house in the village of gorki 
 but i should like to see the right flank they say very strong said pierre i should like to start from the moskva river and ride round the whole position 
 well you can do that later but the chief thing is the left flank 
 yes yes but where is prince regiment can you point it out to me 
 prince we shall pass it and take you to him 
 what about the left flank asked pierre 
 to tell you the truth between ourselves god only knows what state our left flank is in said boris confidentially lowering his voice it is not at all what count bennigsen intended he meant to fortify that knoll quite differently but boris shrugged his shoulders his serene highness would not have it or someone persuaded him you see but boris did not finish for at that moment kaysarov adjutant came up to pierre ah kaysarov said boris addressing him with an unembarrassed smile i was just trying to explain our position to the count it is amazing how his serene highness could so the intentions of the french 
 you mean the left flank asked kaysarov 
 yes exactly the left flank is now extremely strong 
 though kutuzov had dismissed all unnecessary men from the staff boris had contrived to remain at headquarters after the changes he had established himself with count bennigsen who like all on whom boris had been in attendance considered young prince drubetskoy an invaluable man 
 in the higher command there were two sharply defined parties party and that of bennigsen the chief of staff boris belonged to the latter and no one else while showing servile respect to kutuzov could so create an impression that the old fellow was not much good and that bennigsen managed everything now the decisive moment of battle had come when kutuzov would be destroyed and the power pass to bennigsen or even if kutuzov won the battle it would be felt that everything was done by bennigsen in any case many great rewards would have to be given for action and new men would come to the front so boris was full of nervous vivacity all day 
 after kaysarov others whom pierre knew came up to him and he had not time to reply to all the questions about moscow that were showered upon him or to listen to all that was told him the faces all expressed animation and apprehension but it seemed to pierre that the cause of the excitement shown in some of these faces lay chiefly in questions of personal success his mind however was occupied by the different expression he saw on other faces an expression that spoke not of personal matters but of the universal questions of life and death kutuzov noticed figure and the group gathered round him 
 call him to me said kutuzov 
 an adjutant told pierre of his serene highness wish and pierre went toward bench but a militiaman got there before him it was dolokhov 
 how did that fellow get here asked pierre 
 a creature that wriggles in anywhere was the answer he has been degraded you know now he wants to bob up again been proposing some scheme or other and has crawled into the picket line at night a brave fellow 
 pierre took off his hat and bowed respectfully to kutuzov 
 i concluded that if i reported to your serene highness you might send me away or say that you knew what i was reporting but then i lose anything dolokhov was saying 
 yes yes 
 but if i were right i should be rendering a service to my fatherland for which i am ready to die 
 yes yes 
 and should your serene highness require a man who will not spare his skin please think of me perhaps i may prove useful to your serene highness 
 yes yes kutuzov repeated his laughing eye narrowing more and more as he looked at pierre 
 just then boris with his courtierlike adroitness stepped up to side near kutuzov and in a most natural manner without raising his voice said to pierre as though continuing an interrupted conversation 
 the militia have put on clean white shirts to be ready to die what heroism count 
 boris evidently said this to pierre in order to be overheard by his serene highness he knew attention would be caught by those words and so it was 
 what are you saying about the militia he asked boris 
 preparing for tomorrow your serene highness for death they have put on clean shirts 
 ah a wonderful a matchless people said kutuzov and he closed his eyes and swayed his head a matchless people he repeated with a sigh 
 so you want to smell gunpowder he said to pierre yes a pleasant smell i have the honor to be one of your adorers is she well my quarters are at your service 
 and as often happens with old people kutuzov began looking about as if forgetting all he wanted to say or do 
 then evidently remembering what he wanted he beckoned to andrew kaysarov his brother 
 those verses those verses of how do they go eh those he wrote about gerakov lectures for the corps inditing recite them recite them said he evidently preparing to laugh 
 kaysarov recited kutuzov smilingly nodded his head to the rhythm of the verses 
 when pierre had left kutuzov dolokhov came up to him and took his hand 
 i am very glad to meet you here count he said aloud regardless of the presence of strangers and in a particularly resolute and solemn tone on the eve of a day when god alone knows who of us is fated to survive i am glad of this opportunity to tell you that i regret the misunderstandings that occurred between us and should wish you not to have any ill feeling for me i beg you to forgive me 
 pierre looked at dolokhov with a smile not knowing what to say to him with tears in his eyes dolokhov embraced pierre and kissed him 
 boris said a few words to his general and count bennigsen turned to pierre and proposed that he should ride with him along the line 
 it will interest you said he 
 yes very much replied pierre 
 half an hour later kutuzov left for tatarinova and bennigsen and his suite with pierre among them set out on their ride along the line

 offers of service from misery to wretchedness 
 marius ascended the stairs of the hovel with slow steps at the moment when he was about to his cell he caught sight of the elder jondrette girl following him through the corridor 
 the very sight of this girl was odious to him it was she who had his five francs it was too late to demand them back the cab was no longer there the fiacre was far away 
 moreover she would not have given them back as for questioning her about the residence of the persons who had just been there that was useless it was evident that she did not know since the letter signed fabantou had been addressed to the benevolent gentleman of the church of 
 marius entered his room and pushed the door to after him 
 it did not close he turned round and beheld a hand which held the door half open 
 what is it he asked who is there 
 it was the jondrette girl 
 is it you resumed marius almost harshly still you 
 what do you want with me 
 she appeared to be thoughtful and did not look at him 
 she no longer had the air of assurance which had characterized her that morning she did not enter but held back in the darkness of the corridor where marius could see her through the door 
 come now will you answer cried marius 
 what do you want with me 
 she raised her dull eyes in which a sort of gleam seemed to flicker vaguely and said 
 monsieur marius you look sad 
 what is the matter with you 
 with me said marius 
 yes you 
 there is nothing the matter with me 
 yes there is 
 no 
 i tell you there is 
 let me alone 
 marius gave the door another push but she retained her hold on it 
 stop said she you are in the wrong 
 although you are not rich you were kind this morning 
 be so again now you gave me something to eat now tell me what ails you you are grieved that is plain 
 i do not want you to be grieved what can be done for it 
 can i be of any service 
 employ me i do not ask for your secrets you need not tell them to me but i may be of use nevertheless 
 i may be able to help you since i help my father 
 when it is necessary to carry letters to go to houses to inquire from door to door to find out an address to follow any one i am of service 
 well you may assuredly tell me what is the matter with you and i will go and speak to the persons sometimes it is enough if some one speaks to the persons that suffices to let them understand matters and everything comes right make use of me 
 an idea flashed across marius mind 
 what branch does one disdain when one feels that one is falling 
 he drew near to the jondrette girl 
 listen he said to her 
 she interrupted him with a gleam of joy in her eyes 
 oh yes do call me thou 
 i like that better 
 well he resumed thou hast brought hither that old gentleman and his daughter 
 yes 
 dost thou know their address 
 no 
 find it for me 
 the dull eyes had grown joyous and they now became gloomy 
 is that what you want she demanded 
 yes 
 do you know them 
 no 
 that is to say she resumed quickly you do not know her but you wish to know her 
 this them which had turned into her had something indescribably significant and bitter about it 
 well can you do it said marius 
 you shall have the beautiful address 
 there was still a shade in the words the beautiful lady which troubled marius 
 he resumed 
 never mind after all the address of the father and daughter their address indeed 
 she gazed fixedly at him 
 what will you give me 
 anything you like 
 anything i like 
 yes 
 you shall have the address 
 she dropped her head then with a brusque movement she pulled to the door which closed behind her 
 marius found himself alone 
 he dropped into a chair with his head and both elbows on his bed absorbed in thoughts which he could not grasp and as though a prey to vertigo 
 all that had taken place since the morning the appearance of the angel her disappearance what that creature had just said to him a gleam of hope floating in an immense despair this was what filled his brain confusedly 
 all at once he was violently aroused from his revery 
 he heard the shrill hard voice of jondrette utter these words which were fraught with a strange interest for him 
 i tell you that i am sure of it and that i recognized him 
 of whom was jondrette speaking 
 whom had he recognized 
 m leblanc the father of his ursule what 
 did jondrette know him was marius about to obtain in this abrupt and unexpected fashion all the information without which his life was so dark to him was he about to learn at last who it was that he loved who that young girl was 
 who her father was 
 was the dense shadow which enwrapped them on the point of being dispelled 
 was the veil about to be rent 
 ah 
 heavens 
 he bounded rather than climbed upon his commode and resumed his post near the little in the partition wall 
 again he beheld the interior of hovel

 chapter xxiii 
 
 from gorki bennigsen descended the highroad to the bridge which when they had looked it from the hill the officer had pointed out as being the center of our position and where rows of fragrant hay lay by the riverside they rode across that bridge into the village of borodino and thence turned to the left passing an enormous number of troops and guns and came to a high knoll where militiamen were digging this was the redoubt as yet unnamed which afterwards became known as the raevski redoubt or the knoll battery but pierre paid no special attention to it he did not know that it would become more memorable to him than any other spot on the plain of borodino 
 they then crossed the hollow to semenovsk where the soldiers were dragging away the last logs from the huts and barns then they rode downhill and uphill across a ryefield trodden and beaten down as if by hail following a track freshly made by the artillery over the furrows of the plowed land and reached some fleches which were still being dug 
 a kind of entrenchment 
 at the fleches bennigsen stopped and began looking at the shevardino redoubt opposite which had been ours the day before and where several horsemen could be descried the officers said that either napoleon or murat was there and they all gazed eagerly at this little group of horsemen pierre also looked at them trying to guess which of the scarcely discernible figures was napoleon at last those mounted men rode away from the mound and disappeared 
 bennigsen spoke to a general who approached him and began explaining the whole position of our troops pierre listened to him straining each faculty to understand the essential points of the impending battle but was mortified to feel that his mental capacity was inadequate for the task he could make nothing of it bennigsen stopped speaking and noticing that pierre was listening suddenly said to him 
 i think this interests you 
 on the contrary very interesting replied pierre not quite truthfully 
 from the fleches they rode still farther to the left along a road winding through a thick birch wood in the middle of the wood a brown hare with white feet sprang out and scared by the tramp of the many horses grew so confused that it leaped along the road in front of them for some time arousing general attention and laughter and only when several voices shouted at it did it dart to one side and disappear in the thicket after going through the wood for about a mile and a half they came out on a glade where troops of corps were stationed to defend the left flank 
 here at the extreme left flank bennigsen talked a great deal and with much heat and as it seemed to pierre gave orders of great military importance in front of troops was some high ground not occupied by troops bennigsen loudly criticized this mistake saying that it was madness to leave a height which commanded the country around unoccupied and to place troops below it some of the generals expressed the same opinion one in particular declared with martial heat that they were put there to be slaughtered bennigsen on his own authority ordered the troops to occupy the high ground this disposition on the left flank increased doubt of his own capacity to understand military matters listening to bennigsen and the generals criticizing the position of the troops behind the hill he quite understood them and shared their opinion but for that very reason he could not understand how the man who put them there behind the hill could have made so gross and palpable a blunder 
 pierre did not know that these troops were not as bennigsen supposed put there to defend the position but were in a concealed position as an ambush that they should not be seen and might be able to strike an approaching enemy unexpectedly bennigsen did not know this and moved the troops forward according to his own ideas without mentioning the matter to the commander in chief

 the use made of m piece 
 nothing in the aspect of the family was altered except that the wife and daughters had levied on the package and put on woollen stockings and jackets 
 two new blankets were thrown across the two beds 
 jondrette had evidently just returned 
 he still had the breathlessness of out of doors 
 his daughters were seated on the floor near the fireplace the elder engaged in dressing the wounded hand 
 his wife had sunk back on the bed near the fireplace with a face indicative of astonishment 
 jondrette was pacing up and down the garret with long strides 
 his eyes were extraordinary 
 the woman who seemed timid and overwhelmed with stupor in the presence of her husband turned to say 
 what really 
 you are sure 
 sure 
 eight years have passed 
 but i recognize him 
 ah 
 i recognize him 
 i knew him at once 
 what 
 it force itself on you 
 no 
 but i told you 
 pay attention 
 why it is his figure it is his face only are people who do not grow old i know how they manage is the very sound of his voice he is better dressed that is all 
 ah you mysterious old devil got you that i have 
 he paused and said to his daughters 
 get out of here queer that it strike you 
 they arose to obey 
 the mother stammered 
 with her injured hand 
 the air will do it good said jondrette 
 be off 
 it was plain that this man was of the sort to whom no one offers to reply 
 the two girls departed 
 at the moment when they were about to pass through the door the father detained the elder by the arm and said to her with a peculiar accent 
 you will be here at five precisely 
 both of you i shall need you 
 marius redoubled his attention 
 on being left alone with his wife jondrette began to pace the room again and made the tour of it two or three times in silence then he spent several minutes in tucking the lower part of the chemise which he wore into his trousers 
 all at once he turned to the female jondrette folded his arms and exclaimed 
 and would you like to have me tell you something 
 the young lady 
 well what retorted his wife the young lady 
 marius could not doubt that it was really she of whom they were speaking he listened with ardent anxiety 
 his whole life was in his ears 
 but jondrette had bent over and spoke to his wife in a whisper then he straightened himself up and concluded aloud 
 it is she 
 that one said his wife 
 that very one said the husband 
 no expression can reproduce the significance of the words surprise rage hate wrath were mingled and combined in one monstrous intonation 
 the pronunciation of a few words the name no doubt which her husband had whispered in her ear had sufficed to rouse this huge somnolent woman and from being repulsive she became terrible 
 it is not possible she cried 
 when i think that my daughters are going barefoot and have not a gown to their backs 
 what a satin pelisse a velvet bonnet boots and everything more than two hundred francs worth of clothes so that one would think she was a lady 
 no you are mistaken 
 why in the first place the other was hideous and this one is not so she really is not it be she 
 i tell you that it is she 
 you will see 
 at this absolute assertion the jondrette woman raised her large red blonde face and stared at the ceiling with a horrible expression at that moment she seemed to marius even more to be feared than her husband 
 she was a sow with the look of a tigress 
 what she resumed that horrible beautiful young lady who gazed at my daughters with an air of is that beggar brat 
 oh 
 i should like to kick her stomach in for her 
 she sprang off of the bed and remained standing for a moment her hair in disorder her nostrils dilating her mouth half open her fists clenched and drawn back 
 then she fell back on the bed once more 
 the man paced to and fro and paid no attention to his female 
 after a silence lasting several minutes he approached the female jondrette and halted in front of her with folded arms as he had done a moment before 
 and shall i tell you another thing 
 what is it she asked 
 he answered in a low curt voice 
 my fortune is made 
 the woman stared at him with the look that signifies 
 is the person who is addressing me on the point of going mad 
 he went on 
 thunder 
 it was not so very long ago that i was a parishioner of the parish of i have had enough of misery my share and other share i am not joking any longer i find it comic any more had enough of puns good god no more farces eternal father i want to eat till i am full i want to drink my fill to gormandize to sleep to do nothing 
 i want to have my turn so i do come now before i die 
 i want to be a bit of a millionnaire 
 he took a turn round the hovel and added 
 like other people 
 what do you mean by that asked the woman 
 he shook his head winked screwed up one eye and raised his voice like a medical professor who is about to make a demonstration 
 what do i mean by that 
 listen 
 hush muttered the woman not so loud 
 these are matters which must not be overheard 
 bah 
 here 
 our neighbor 
 i saw him go out a little while ago 
 besides he listen the big booby and i tell you that i saw him go out 
 nevertheless by a sort of instinct jondrette lowered his voice although not sufficiently to prevent marius hearing his words one favorable circumstance which enabled marius not to lose a word of this conversation was the falling snow which deadened the sound of vehicles on the boulevard 
 this is what marius heard 
 listen carefully 
 the croesus is caught or as good as caught all settled already 
 everything is arranged 
 i have seen some people 
 he will come here this evening at six to bring sixty francs the rascal 
 did you notice how i played that game on him my sixty francs my landlord my fourth of february i even owe for one quarter 
 he a fool 
 so he will come at six the hour when our neighbor goes to his dinner mother bougon is off washing dishes in the city 
 not a soul in the house 
 the neighbor never comes home until eleven the children shall stand on watch 
 you shall help us 
 he will give in 
 and what if he does not give in demanded his wife 
 jondrette made a sinister gesture and said 
 fix him 
 and he burst out laughing 
 this was the first time marius had seen him laugh 
 the laugh was cold and sweet and provoked a shudder 
 jondrette opened a cupboard near the fireplace and drew from it an old cap which he placed on his head after brushing it with his sleeve 
 now said he going out 
 i have some more people that i must see 
 good ones 
 see how well the whole thing will work i shall be away as short a time as possible a fine stroke of business do you look after the house 
 and with both fists thrust into the pockets of his trousers he stood for a moment in thought then exclaimed 
 do you know mighty lucky by the way that he recognize me 
 if he had recognized me on his side he would not have come back again 
 he would have slipped through our fingers it was my beard that saved us my romantic beard my pretty little romantic beard 
 and again he broke into a laugh 
 he stepped to the window 
 the snow was still falling and streaking the gray of the sky 
 what beastly weather said he 
 then lapping his overcoat across his breast 
 this rind is too large for me 
 never mind he added he did a devilish good thing in leaving it for me the old scoundrel if it been for that i have gone out and everything would have gone wrong 
 what small points things hang on anyway 
 and pulling his cap down over his eyes he quitted the room 
 he had barely had time to take half a dozen steps from the door when the door opened again and his savage but intelligent face made its appearance once more in the opening 
 i came near forgetting said he 
 you are to have a brazier of charcoal ready 
 and he flung into his apron the piece which the philanthropist had left with him 
 a brazier of charcoal asked his wife 
 yes 
 how many bushels 
 two good ones 
 that will come to thirty sous 
 with the rest i will buy something for dinner 
 the devil no 
 why 
 go and spend the piece 
 why 
 because i shall have to buy something too 
 what 
 something 
 how much shall you need 
 whereabouts in the neighborhood is there an shop 
 rue mouffetard 
 ah yes at the corner of a street i can see the shop 
 but tell me how much you will need for what you have to purchase 
 fifty francs 
 there be much left for dinner 
 eating is not the point something better to be done 
 enough my jewel 
 at this word from his wife jondrette closed the door again and this time marius heard his step die away in the corridor of the hovel and descend the staircase rapidly 
 at that moment one struck from the church of

 chapter xxiv 
 
 on that bright evening of august prince andrew lay leaning on his elbow in a shed in the village of knyazkovo at the further end of his encampment through a gap in the broken wall he could see beside the wooden fence a row of thirty birches with their lower branches lopped off a field on which shocks of oats were standing and some bushes near which rose the smoke of campfires the soldiers kitchens 
 narrow and burdensome and useless to anyone as his life now seemed to him prince andrew on the eve of battle felt agitated and irritable as he had done seven years before at austerlitz 
 he had received and given the orders for next battle and had nothing more to do but his thoughts the simplest clearest and therefore most terrible thoughts would give him no peace he knew that battle would be the most terrible of all he had taken part in and for the first time in his life the possibility of death presented itself to him not in relation to any worldly matter or with reference to its effect on others but simply in relation to himself to his own soul vividly plainly terribly and almost as a certainty and from the height of this perception all that had previously tormented and preoccupied him suddenly became illumined by a cold white light without shadows without perspective without distinction of outline all life appeared to him like pictures at which he had long been gazing by artificial light through a glass now he suddenly saw those badly daubed pictures in clear daylight and without a glass yes yes there they are those false images that agitated enraptured and tormented me said he to himself passing in review the principal pictures of the magic lantern of life and regarding them now in the cold white daylight of his clear perception of death there they are those rudely painted figures that once seemed splendid and mysterious glory the good of society love of a woman the fatherland itself how important these pictures appeared to me with what profound meaning they seemed to be filled and it is all so simple pale and crude in the cold white light of this morning which i feel is dawning for me the three great sorrows of his life held his attention in particular his love for a woman his death and the french invasion which had overrun half russia love that little girl who seemed to me brimming over with mystic forces yes indeed i loved her i made romantic plans of love and happiness with her oh what a boy i was he said aloud bitterly ah me i believed in some ideal love which was to keep her faithful to me for the whole year of my absence like the gentle dove in the fable she was to pine apart from me but it was much simpler really it was all very simple and horrible 
 when my father built bald hills he thought the place was his his land his air his peasants but napoleon came and swept him aside unconscious of his existence as he might brush a chip from his path and his bald hills and his whole life fell to pieces princess mary says it is a trial sent from above what is the trial for when he is not here and will never return he is not here for whom then is the trial intended the fatherland the destruction of moscow and tomorrow i shall be killed perhaps not even by a frenchman but by one of our own men by a soldier discharging a musket close to my ear as one of them did yesterday and the french will come and take me by head and heels and fling me into a hole that i may not stink under their noses and new conditions of life will arise which will seem quite ordinary to others and about which i shall know nothing i shall not exist 
 he looked at the row of birches shining in the sunshine with their motionless green and yellow foliage and white bark to die to be killed tomorrow that i should not exist that all this should still be but no me 
 and the birches with their light and shade the curly clouds the smoke of the campfires and all that was around him changed and seemed terrible and menacing a cold shiver ran down his spine he rose quickly went out of the shed and began to walk about 
 after he had returned voices were heard outside the shed that he cried 
 the captain timokhin formerly squadron commander but now from lack of officers a battalion commander shyly entered the shed followed by an adjutant and the regimental paymaster 
 prince andrew rose hastily listened to the business they had come about gave them some further instructions and was about to dismiss them when he heard a familiar lisping voice behind the shed 
 devil take it said the voice of a man stumbling over something 
 prince andrew looked out of the shed and saw pierre who had tripped over a pole on the ground and had nearly fallen coming his way it was unpleasant to prince andrew to meet people of his own set in general and pierre especially for he reminded him of all the painful moments of his last visit to moscow 
 you what a surprise said he what brings you here this is unexpected 
 as he said this his eyes and face expressed more than coldness they expressed hostility which pierre noticed at once he had approached the shed full of animation but on seeing prince face he felt constrained and ill at ease 
 i have come simply you know come it interests me said pierre who had so often that day senselessly repeated that word interesting i wish to see the battle 
 oh yes and what do the masonic brothers say about war how would they stop it said prince andrew sarcastically well and moscow and my people have they reached moscow at last he asked seriously 
 yes they have julie drubetskaya told me so i went to see them but missed them they have gone to your estate near moscow

 solus cum solo in loco remoto non cogitabuntur orare pater noster 
 marius dreamer as he was was as we have said firm and energetic by nature 
 his habits of solitary meditation while they had developed in him sympathy and compassion had perhaps diminished the faculty for irritation but had left intact the power of waxing indignant he had the kindliness of a brahmin and the severity of a judge he took pity upon a toad but he crushed a viper 
 now it was into a hole of vipers that his glance had just been directed it was a nest of monsters that he had beneath his eyes 
 these wretches must be stamped upon said he 
 not one of the enigmas which he had hoped to see solved had been elucidated on the contrary all of them had been rendered more dense if anything he knew nothing more about the beautiful maiden of the luxembourg and the man whom he called m leblanc except that jondrette was acquainted with them 
 athwart the mysterious words which had been uttered the only thing of which he caught a distinct glimpse was the fact that an ambush was in course of preparation a dark but terrible trap that both of them were incurring great danger she probably her father certainly that they must be saved that the hideous plots of the jondrettes must be thwarted and the web of these spiders broken 
 he scanned the female jondrette for a moment 
 she had pulled an old stove from a corner and she was rummaging among the old heap of iron 
 he descended from the commode as softly as possible taking care not to make the least noise 
 amid his terror as to what was in preparation and in the horror with which the jondrettes had inspired him he experienced a sort of joy at the idea that it might be granted to him perhaps to render a service to the one whom he loved 
 but how was it to be done 
 how warn the persons threatened he did not know their address 
 they had reappeared for an instant before his eyes and had then plunged back again into the immense depths of paris 
 should he wait for m leblanc at the door that evening at six at the moment of his arrival and warn him of the trap 
 but jondrette and his men would see him on the watch the spot was lonely they were stronger than he they would devise means to seize him or to get him away and the man whom marius was anxious to save would be lost 
 one had just struck the trap was to be sprung at six 
 marius had five hours before him 
 there was but one thing to be done 
 he put on his decent coat knotted a silk handkerchief round his neck took his hat and went out without making any more noise than if he had been treading on moss with bare feet 
 moreover the jondrette woman continued to rummage among her old iron 
 once outside of the house he made for the rue du 
 he had almost reached the middle of this street near a very low wall which a man can easily step over at certain points and which abuts on a waste space and was walking slowly in consequence of his preoccupied condition and the snow deadened the sound of his steps all at once he heard voices talking very close by 
 he turned his head the street was deserted there was not a soul in it it was broad daylight and yet he distinctly heard voices 
 it occurred to him to glance over the wall which he was skirting 
 there in fact sat two men flat on the snow with their backs against the wall talking together in subdued tones 
 these two persons were strangers to him one was a bearded man in a blouse and the other a individual in rags the bearded man had on a fez the head was bare and the snow had lodged in his hair 
 by thrusting his head over the wall marius could hear their remarks 
 the hairy one jogged the other elbow and said 
 with the assistance of it fail 
 do you think so said the bearded man 
 and the one began again 
 as good as a warrant for each one of five hundred balls and the worst that can happen is five years six years ten years at the most 
 the other replied with some hesitation and shivering beneath his fez 
 a real thing 
 you go against such things 
 i tell you that the affair go wrong resumed the man father team will be already harnessed 
 then they began to discuss a melodrama that they had seen on the preceding evening at the gaite theatre 
 marius went his way 
 it seemed to him that the mysterious words of these men so strangely hidden behind that wall and crouching in the snow could not but bear some relation to abominable projects that must be the affair 
 he directed his course towards the faubourg and asked at the first shop he came to where he could find a commissary of police 
 he was directed to rue de pontoise no 
 thither marius betook himself 
 as he passed a shop he bought a roll and ate it foreseeing that he should not dine 
 on the way he rendered justice to providence 
 he reflected that had he not given his five francs to the jondrette girl in the morning he would have followed m fiacre and consequently have remained ignorant of everything and that there would have been no obstacle to the trap of the jondrettes and that m leblanc would have been lost and his daughter with him no doubt

 chapter xxv 
 
 the officers were about to take leave but prince andrew apparently reluctant to be left alone with his friend asked them to stay and have tea seats were brought in and so was the tea the officers gazed with surprise at huge stout figure and listened to his talk of moscow and the position of our army round which he had ridden prince andrew remained silent and his expression was so forbidding that pierre addressed his remarks chiefly to the battalion commander 
 so you understand the whole position of our troops prince andrew interrupted him 
 yes that is how do you mean said pierre not being a military man i say i have understood it fully but i understand the general position 
 well then you know more than anyone else be it who it may said prince andrew 
 oh said pierre looking over his spectacles in perplexity at prince andrew well and what do think of appointment he asked 
 i was very glad of his appointment all i know replied prince andrew 
 and tell me your opinion of barclay de tolly in moscow they are saying heaven knows what about him what do you think of him 
 ask them replied prince andrew indicating the officers 
 pierre looked at timokhin with the condescendingly interrogative smile with which everybody involuntarily addressed that officer 
 we see light again since his serenity has been appointed your excellency said timokhin timidly and continually turning to glance at his colonel 
 why so asked pierre 
 well to mention only firewood and fodder let me inform you why when we were retreating from sventsyani we dare not touch a stick or a wisp of hay or anything you see we were going away so he would get it all it so your excellency and again timokhin turned to the prince but we in our regiment two officers were for that kind of thing but when his serenity took command everything became straight forward now we see light 
 then why was it forbidden 
 timokhin looked about in confusion not knowing what or how to answer such a question pierre put the same question to prince andrew 
 why so as not to lay waste the country we were abandoning to the enemy said prince andrew with venomous irony it is very sound one permit the land to be pillaged and accustom the troops to marauding at smolensk too he judged correctly that the french might outflank us as they had larger forces but he could not understand this cried prince andrew in a shrill voice that seemed to escape him involuntarily he could not understand that there for the first time we were fighting for russian soil and that there was a spirit in the men such as i had never seen before that we had held the french for two days and that that success had increased our strength tenfold he ordered us to retreat and all our efforts and losses went for nothing he had no thought of betraying us he tried to do the best he could he thought out everything and that is why he is unsuitable he is unsuitable now just because he plans out everything very thoroughly and accurately as every german has to how can i explain well say your father has a german valet and he is a splendid valet and satisfies your requirements better than you could then all right to let him serve but if your father is mortally sick send the valet away and attend to your father with your own unpracticed awkward hands and will soothe him better than a skilled man who is a stranger could so it has been with barclay while russia was well a foreigner could serve her and be a splendid minister but as soon as she is in danger she needs one of her own kin but in your club they have been making him out a traitor they slander him as a traitor and the only result will be that afterwards ashamed of their false accusations they will make him out a hero or a genius instead of a traitor and that will be still more unjust he is an honest and very punctilious german 
 and they say a skillful commander rejoined pierre 
 i understand what is meant by a skillful commander replied prince andrew ironically 
 a skillful commander replied pierre why one who foresees all contingencies and foresees the intentions 
 but impossible said prince andrew as if it were a matter settled long ago 
 pierre looked at him in surprise 
 and yet they say that war is like a game of chess he remarked 
 yes replied prince andrew but with this little difference that in chess you may think over each move as long as you please and are not limited for time and with this difference too that a knight is always stronger than a pawn and two pawns are always stronger than one while in war a battalion is sometimes stronger than a division and sometimes weaker than a company the relative strength of bodies of troops can never be known to anyone believe me he went on if things depended on arrangements made by the staff i should be there making arrangements but instead of that i have the honor to serve here in the regiment with these gentlemen and i consider that on us battle will depend and not on those others success never depends and never will depend on position or equipment or even on numbers and least of all on position 
 but on what then 
 on the feeling that is in me and in him he pointed to timokhin and in each soldier 
 prince andrew glanced at timokhin who looked at his commander in alarm and bewilderment in contrast to his former reticent taciturnity prince andrew now seemed excited he could apparently not refrain from expressing the thoughts that had suddenly occurred to him 
 a battle is won by those who firmly resolve to win it why did we lose the battle at austerlitz the french losses were almost equal to ours but very early we said to ourselves that we were losing the battle and we did lose it and we said so because we had nothing to fight for there we wanted to get away from the battlefield as soon as we could lost so let us run and we ran if we had not said that till the evening heaven knows what might not have happened but tomorrow we say it you talk about our position the left flank weak and the right flank too extended he went on all nonsense nothing of the kind but what awaits us tomorrow a hundred million most diverse chances which will be decided on the instant by the fact that our men or theirs run or do not run and that this man or that man is killed but all that is being done at present is only play the fact is that those men with whom you have ridden round the position not only do not help matters but hinder they are only concerned with their own petty interests 
 at such a moment said pierre reproachfully 
 at such a moment prince andrew repeated to them it is only a moment affording opportunities to undermine a rival and obtain an extra cross or ribbon for me tomorrow means this a russian army of a hundred thousand and a french army of a hundred thousand have met to fight and the thing is that these two hundred thousand men will fight and the side that fights more fiercely and spares itself least will win and if you like i will tell you that whatever happens and whatever muddles those at the top may make we shall win battle tomorrow happen what may we shall win 
 there now your excellency the truth the real truth said timokhin who would spare himself now the soldiers in my battalion believe me drink their vodka not the day for that they say 
 all were silent the officers rose prince andrew went out of the shed with them giving final orders to the adjutant after they had gone pierre approached prince andrew and was about to start a conversation when they heard the clatter of three horses hoofs on the road not far from the shed and looking in that direction prince andrew recognized wolzogen and clausewitz accompanied by a cossack they rode close by continuing to converse and prince andrew involuntarily heard these words 
 der krieg muss in raum verlegt werden der ansicht kann ich nicht genug preis geben said one of them 
 the war must be extended widely i cannot sufficiently commend that view 
 oh ja said the other der zweck ist nur den feind zu schwachen so kann man gewiss nicht den verlust der in achtung nehmen 
 oh yes the only aim is to weaken the enemy so of course one cannot take into account the loss of private individuals 
 oh no agreed the other 
 extend widely said prince andrew with an angry snort when they had ridden past in that extend were my father son and sister at bald hills all the same to him what i was saying to you those german gentlemen win the battle tomorrow but will only make all the mess they can because they have nothing in their german heads but theories not worth an empty eggshell and in their hearts the one thing needed tomorrow that which timokhin has they have yielded up all europe to him and have now come to teach us fine teachers and again his voice grew shrill 
 so you think we shall win battle asked pierre 
 yes yes answered prince andrew absently one thing i would do if i had the power he began again i would not take prisoners why take prisoners chivalry the french have destroyed my home and are on their way to destroy moscow they have outraged and are outraging me every moment they are my enemies in my opinion they are all criminals and so thinks timokhin and the whole army they should be executed since they are my foes they cannot be my friends whatever may have been said at tilsit 
 yes yes muttered pierre looking with shining eyes at prince andrew i quite agree with you 
 the question that had perturbed pierre on the mozhaysk hill and all that day now seemed to him quite clear and completely solved he now understood the whole meaning and importance of this war and of the impending battle all he had seen that day all the significant and stern expressions on the faces he had seen in passing were lit up for him by a new light he understood that latent heat as they say in physics of patriotism which was present in all these men he had seen and this explained to him why they all prepared for death calmly and as it were lightheartedly 
 not take prisoners prince andrew continued that by itself would quite change the whole war and make it less cruel as it is we have played at war vile we play at magnanimity and all that stuff such magnanimity and sensibility are like the magnanimity and sensibility of a lady who faints when she sees a calf being killed she is so that she look at blood but enjoys eating the calf served up with sauce they talk to us of the rules of war of chivalry of flags of truce of mercy to the unfortunate and so on all rubbish i saw chivalry and flags of truce in they humbugged us and we humbugged them they plunder other houses issue false paper money and worst of all they kill my children and my father and then talk of rules of war and magnanimity to foes take no prisoners but kill and be killed he who has come to this as i have through the same sufferings 
 prince andrew who had thought it was all the same to him whether or not moscow was taken as smolensk had been was suddenly checked in his speech by an unexpected cramp in his throat he paced up and down a few times in silence but his eyes glittered feverishly and his lips quivered as he began speaking 
 if there was none of this magnanimity in war we should go to war only when it was worth while going to certain death as now then there would not be war because paul ivanovich had offended michael ivanovich and when there was a war like this one it would be war and then the determination of the troops would be quite different then all these westphalians and hessians whom napoleon is leading would not follow him into russia and we should not go to fight in austria and prussia without knowing why war is not courtesy but the most horrible thing in life and we ought to understand that and not play at war we ought to accept this terrible necessity sternly and seriously it all lies in that get rid of falsehood and let war be war and not a game as it is now war is the favorite pastime of the idle and frivolous the military calling is the most highly honored 
 but what is war what is needed for success in warfare what are the habits of the military the aim of war is murder the methods of war are spying treachery and their encouragement the ruin of a inhabitants robbing them or stealing to provision the army and fraud and falsehood termed military craft the habits of the military class are the absence of freedom that is discipline idleness ignorance cruelty debauchery and drunkenness and in spite of all this it is the highest class respected by everyone all the kings except the chinese wear military uniforms and he who kills most people receives the highest rewards 
 they meet as we shall meet tomorrow to murder one another they kill and maim tens of thousands and then have thanksgiving services for having killed so many people they even exaggerate the number and they announce a victory supposing that the more people they have killed the greater their achievement how does god above look at them and hear them exclaimed prince andrew in a shrill piercing voice ah my friend it has of late become hard for me to live i see that i have begun to understand too much and it do for man to taste of the tree of knowledge of good and evil ah well not for long he added 
 however sleepy and time for me to sleep go back to gorki said prince andrew suddenly 
 oh no pierre replied looking at prince andrew with frightened compassionate eyes 
 go go before a battle one must have sleep out repeated prince andrew 
 he came quickly up to pierre and embraced and kissed him be off he shouted whether we meet again or not and turning away hurriedly he entered the shed 
 it was already dark and pierre could not make out whether the expression of prince face was angry or tender 
 for some time he stood in silence considering whether he should follow him or go away no he does not want it pierre concluded and i know that this is our last meeting he sighed deeply and rode back to gorki 
 on the shed prince andrew lay down on a rug but he could not sleep 
 he closed his eyes one picture succeeded another in his imagination on one of them he dwelt long and joyfully he vividly recalled an evening in petersburg natasha with animated and excited face was telling him how she had gone to look for mushrooms the previous summer and had lost her way in the big forest she incoherently described the depths of the forest her feelings and a talk with a beekeeper she met and constantly interrupted her story to say no i not telling it right no you understand though he encouraged her by saying that he did understand and he really had understood all she wanted to say but natasha was not satisfied with her own words she felt that they did not convey the passionately poetic feeling she had experienced that day and wished to convey he was such a delightful old man and it was so dark in the forest and he had such kind no i describe it she had said flushed and excited prince andrew smiled now the same happy smile as then when he had looked into her eyes i understood her he thought i not only understood her but it was just that inner spiritual force that sincerity that frankness of soul that very soul of hers which seemed to be fettered by her body it was that soul i loved in her loved so strongly and happily and suddenly he remembered how his love had ended he did not need anything of that kind he neither saw nor understood anything of the sort he only saw in her a pretty and fresh young girl with whom he did not deign to unite his fate and i and he is still alive and gay 
 prince andrew jumped up as if someone had burned him and again began pacing up and down in front of the shed

 book wicked poor man 
 chapter xiv 
 
 in which a police agent bestows two fistfuls on a lawyer 
 on arriving at no rue de pontoise he ascended to the first floor and inquired for the commissary of police 
 the commissary of police is not here said a clerk but there is an inspector who takes his place 
 would you like to speak to him are you in haste 
 yes said marius 
 the clerk introduced him into the office 
 there stood a tall man behind a grating leaning against a stove and holding up with both hands the tails of a vast topcoat with three collars his face was square with a thin firmmouth thick gray and very ferocious whiskers and a look that was enough to turn your pockets inside out 
 of that glance it might have been well said not that it penetrated but that it searched 
 this air was not much less ferocious nor less terrible than the dog is at times no less terrible to meet than the wolf 
 what do you want he said to marius without adding monsieur 
 is this monsieur le commissaire de police 
 he is absent 
 i am here in his stead 
 the matter is very private 
 then speak 
 and great haste is required 
 then speak quick 
 this calm abrupt man was both terrifying and reassuring at one and the same time 
 he inspired fear and confidence marius related the adventure to him 
 that a person with whom he was not acquainted otherwise than by sight was to be inveigled into a trap that very evening that as he occupied the room adjoining the den he marius pontmercy a lawyer had heard the whole plot through the partition that the wretch who had planned the trap was a certain jondrette that there would be accomplices probably some prowlers of the barriers among others a certain panchaud alias printanier alias bigrenaille that daughters were to lie in wait that there was no way of warning the threatened man since he did not even know his name and that finally all this was to be carried out at six that evening at the most deserted point of the boulevard de in house no 
 at the sound of this number the inspector raised his head and said coldly 
 so it is in the room at the end of the corridor 
 precisely answered marius and he added 
 are you acquainted with that house 
 the inspector remained silent for a moment then replied as he warmed the heel of his boot at the door of the stove 
 apparently 
 he went on muttering between his teeth and not addressing marius so much as his cravat 
 must have had a hand in this 
 this word struck marius 
 said he i did hear that word pronounced in fact 
 and he repeated to the inspector the dialogue between the man and the bearded man in the snow behind the wall of the rue du 
 the inspector muttered 
 the man must be brujon and the bearded one alias 
 he had dropped his eyelids again and became absorbed in thought 
 as for father i think i recognize him here burned my coat 
 they always have too much fire in these cursed stoves 
 number former property of gorbeau 
 then he glanced at marius 
 you saw only that bearded and that man 
 and panchaud 
 you see a little imp of a dandy prowling about the premises 
 no 
 nor a big lump of matter resembling an elephant in the jardin des plantes 
 no 
 nor a scamp with the air of an old red tail 
 no 
 as for the fourth no one sees him not even his adjutants clerks and employees 
 it is not surprising that you did not see him 
 no who are all those persons asked marius 
 the inspector answered 
 besides this is not the time for them 
 he relapsed into silence then resumed 
 i know that barrack 
 impossible to conceal ourselves inside it without the artists seeing us and then they will get off simply by countermanding the vaudeville 
 they are so modest an audience embarrasses them 
 none of that none of that 
 i want to hear them sing and make them dance 
 this monologue concluded he turned to marius and demanded gazing at him intently the while 
 are you afraid 
 of what said marius 
 of these men 
 no more than yourself retorted marius rudely who had begun to notice that this police agent had not yet said monsieur to him 
 the inspector stared still more intently at marius and continued with sententious solemnity 
 there you speak like a brave man and like an honest man courage does not fear crime and honesty does not fear authority 
 marius interrupted him 
 that is well but what do you intend to do 
 the inspector contented himself with the remark 
 the lodgers have with which to get in at night you must have one 
 yes said marius 
 have you it about you 
 yes 
 give it to me said the inspector 
 marius took his key from his waistcoat pocket handed it to the inspector and added 
 if you will take my advice you will come in force 
 the inspector cast on marius such a glance as voltaire might have bestowed on a provincial academician who had suggested a rhyme to him with one movement he plunged his hands which were enormous into the two immense pockets of his and pulled out two small steel pistols of the sort called then he presented them to marius saying rapidly in a curt tone 
 take these 
 go home 
 hide in your chamber so that you may be supposed to have gone out 
 they are loaded 
 each one carries two balls 
 you will keep watch there is a hole in the wall as you have informed me 
 these men will come 
 leave them to their own devices for a time 
 when you think matters have reached a crisis and that it is time to put a stop to them fire a shot not too soon 
 the rest concerns me 
 a shot into the ceiling the air no matter where 
 above all things not too soon 
 wait until they begin to put their project into execution you are a lawyer you know the proper point 
 marius took the pistols and put them in the side pocket of his coat 
 that makes a lump that can be seen said the inspector put them in your trousers pocket 
 marius hid the pistols in his trousers pockets 
 now pursued the inspector there is not a minute more to be lost by any one 
 what time is it 
 two 
 seven is the hour 
 six answered marius 
 i have plenty of time said the inspector but no more than enough forget anything that i have said to you 
 bang 
 a pistol shot 
 rest easy said marius 
 and as marius laid his hand on the handle of the door on his way out the inspector called to him 
 by the way if you have occasion for my services between now and then come or send here 
 you will ask for inspector javert

 chapter xxvi 
 
 on august the eve of the battle of borodino m de beausset prefect of the french palace arrived at quarters at valuevo with colonel fabvier the former from paris and the latter from madrid 
 donning his court uniform m de beausset ordered a box he had brought for the emperor to be carried before him and entered the first compartment of tent where he began opening the box while conversing with who surrounded him 
 fabvier not entering the tent remained at the entrance talking to some generals of his acquaintance 
 the emperor napoleon had not yet left his bedroom and was finishing his toilet slightly snorting and grunting he presented now his back and now his plump hairy chest to the brush with which his valet was rubbing him down another valet with his finger over the mouth of a bottle was sprinkling eau de cologne on the pampered body with an expression which seemed to say that he alone knew where and how much eau de cologne should be sprinkled short hair was wet and matted on the forehead but his face though puffy and yellow expressed physical satisfaction go on harder go on he muttered to the valet who was rubbing him slightly twitching and grunting an who had entered the bedroom to report to the emperor the number of prisoners taken in action was standing by the door after delivering his message awaiting permission to withdraw napoleon frowning looked at him from under his brows 
 no prisoners said he repeating the words they are forcing us to exterminate them so much the worse for the russian army go on harder harder he muttered hunching his back and presenting his fat shoulders 
 all right let monsieur de beausset enter and fabvier too he said nodding to the 
 yes sire and the disappeared through the door of the tent 
 two valets rapidly dressed his majesty and wearing the blue uniform of the guards he went with firm quick steps to the reception room 
 de hands meanwhile were busily engaged arranging the present he had brought from the empress on two chairs directly in front of the entrance but napoleon had dressed and come out with such unexpected rapidity that he had not time to finish arranging the surprise 
 napoleon noticed at once what they were about and guessed that they were not ready he did not wish to deprive them of the pleasure of giving him a surprise so he pretended not to see de beausset and called fabvier to him listening silently and with a stern frown to what fabvier told him of the heroism and devotion of his troops fighting at salamanca at the other end of europe with but one thought to be worthy of their emperor and but one fear to fail to please him the result of that battle had been deplorable napoleon made ironic remarks during account as if he had not expected that matters could go otherwise in his absence 
 i must make up for that in moscow said napoleon see you later he added and summoned de beausset who by that time had prepared the surprise having placed something on the chairs and covered it with a cloth 
 de beausset bowed low with that courtly french bow which only the old retainers of the bourbons knew how to make and approached him presenting an envelope 
 napoleon turned to him gaily and pulled his ear 
 you have hurried here i am very glad well what is paris saying he asked suddenly changing his former stern expression for a most cordial tone 
 sire all paris regrets your absence replied de beausset as was proper 
 but though napoleon knew that de beausset had to say something of this kind and though in his lucid moments he knew it was untrue he was pleased to hear it from him again he honored him by touching his ear 
 i am very sorry to have made you travel so far said he 
 sire i expected nothing less than to find you at the gates of moscow replied de beausset 
 napoleon smiled and lifting his head absentmindedly glanced to the right an approached with gliding steps and offered him a gold snuffbox which he took 
 yes it has happened luckily for you he said raising the open snuffbox to his nose you are fond of travel and in three days you will see moscow you surely did not expect to see that asiatic capital you will have a pleasant journey 
 de beausset bowed gratefully at this regard for his taste for travel of which he had not till then been aware 
 ha this asked napoleon noticing that all the courtiers were looking at something concealed under a cloth 
 with courtly adroitness de beausset half turned and without turning his back to the emperor retired two steps twitching off the cloth at the same time and said 
 a present to your majesty from the empress 
 it was a portrait painted in bright colors by gerard of the son borne to napoleon by the daughter of the emperor of austria the boy whom for some reason everyone called the king of rome 
 a very pretty boy with a look of the christ in the sistine madonna was depicted playing at stick and ball the ball represented the terrestrial globe and the stick in his other hand a scepter 
 though it was not clear what the artist meant to express by depicting the king of rome spiking the earth with a stick the allegory apparently seemed to napoleon as it had done to all who had seen it in paris quite clear and very pleasing 
 the king of rome he said pointing to the portrait with a graceful gesture admirable 
 with the natural capacity of an italian for changing the expression of his face at will he drew nearer to the portrait and assumed a look of pensive tenderness he felt that what he now said and did would be historical and it seemed to him that it would now be best for him whose grandeur enabled his son to play stick and ball with the terrestrial globe to show in contrast to that grandeur the simplest paternal tenderness his eyes grew dim he moved forward glanced round at a chair which seemed to place itself under him and sat down on it before the portrait at a single gesture from him everyone went out on tiptoe leaving the great man to himself and his emotion 
 having sat still for a while he touched himself not knowing why the thick spot of paint representing the highest light in the portrait rose and recalled de beausset and the officer on duty he ordered the portrait to be carried outside his tent that the old guard stationed round it might not be deprived of the pleasure of seeing the king of rome the son and heir of their adored monarch 
 and while he was doing m de beausset the honor of breakfasting with him they heard as napoleon had anticipated the rapturous cries of the officers and men of the old guard who had run up to see the portrait 
 vive vive le roi de rome vive came those ecstatic cries 
 after breakfast napoleon in de presence dictated his order of the day to the army 
 short and energetic he remarked when he had read over the proclamation which he had dictated straight off without corrections it ran 
 soldiers this is the battle you have so longed for victory depends on you it is essential for us it will give us all we need comfortable quarters and a speedy return to our country behave as you did at austerlitz friedland vitebsk and smolensk let our remotest posterity recall your achievements this day with pride let it be said of each of you he was in the great battle before moscow 
 before moscow repeated napoleon and inviting m de beausset who was so fond of travel to accompany him on his ride he went out of the tent to where the horses stood saddled 
 your majesty is too kind replied de beausset to the invitation to accompany the emperor he wanted to sleep did not know how to ride and was afraid of doing so 
 but napoleon nodded to the traveler and de beausset had to mount when napoleon came out of the tent the shouting of the guards before his portrait grew still louder napoleon frowned 
 take him away he said pointing with a gracefully majestic gesture to the portrait it is too soon for him to see a field of battle 
 de beausset closed his eyes bowed his head and sighed deeply to indicate how profoundly he valued and comprehended the words

 jondrette makes his purchases 
 a few moments later about three courfeyrac chanced to be passing along the rue mouffetard in company with bossuet the snow had redoubled in violence and filled the air 
 bossuet was just saying to courfeyrac 
 one would say to see all these fall that there was a plague of white butterflies in heaven 
 all at once bossuet caught sight of marius coming up the street towards the barrier with a peculiar air 
 hold said bossuet 
 marius 
 i saw him said courfeyrac 
 speak to him 
 why 
 he is busy 
 with what 
 you see his air 
 what air 
 he has the air of a man who is following some one 
 true said bossuet 
 just see the eyes he is making said courfeyrac 
 but who the deuce is he following 
 some fine flowery bonneted wench 
 in love 
 but observed bossuet i see any wench nor any flowery bonnet in the street 
 not a woman round 
 courfeyrac took a survey and exclaimed 
 following a man 
 a man in fact wearing a gray cap and whose gray beard could be distinguished although they only saw his back was walking along about twenty paces in advance of marius 
 this man was dressed in a which was perfectly new and too large for him and in a frightful pair of trousers all hanging in rags and black with mud 
 bossuet burst out laughing 
 who is that man 
 he retorted courfeyrac a poet 
 poets are very fond of wearing the trousers of dealers in rabbit skins and the overcoats of peers of france 
 see where marius will go said bossuet see where the man is going follow them hey 
 bossuet exclaimed courfeyrac eagle of meaux 
 you are a prodigious brute 
 follow a man who is following another man indeed 
 they retraced their steps 
 marius had in fact seen jondrette passing along the rue mouffetard and was spying on his proceedings 
 jondrette walked straight ahead without a suspicion that he was already held by a glance 
 he quitted the rue mouffetard and marius saw him enter one of the most terrible hovels in the rue gracieuse he remained there about a quarter of an hour then returned to the rue mouffetard he halted at an shop which then stood at the corner of the rue and a few minutes later marius saw him emerge from the shop holding in his hand a huge cold chisel with a white wood handle which he concealed beneath his at the top of the rue he turned to the left and proceeded rapidly to the rue du the day was declining the snow which had ceased for a moment had just begun again marius posted himself on the watch at the very corner of the rue du which was deserted as usual and did not follow jondrette into it 
 it was lucky that he did so for on arriving in the vicinity of the wall where marius had heard the man and the bearded man conversing jondrette turned round made sure that no one was following him did not see him then sprang across the wall and disappeared 
 the waste land bordered by this wall communicated with the back yard of an of bad repute who had failed and who still kept a few old berlins under his sheds 
 marius thought that it would be wise to profit by absence to return home moreover it was growing late every evening bougon when she set out for her in town had a habit of locking the door which was always closed at dusk marius had given his key to the inspector of police it was important therefore that he should make haste 
 evening had arrived night had almost closed in on the horizon and in the immensity of space there remained but one spot illuminated by the sun and that was the moon 
 it was rising in a ruddy glow behind the low dome of salpetriere 
 marius returned to no with great strides 
 the door was still open when he arrived 
 he mounted the stairs on and glided along the wall of the corridor to his chamber 
 this corridor as the reader will remember was bordered on both sides by attics all of which were for the moment empty and to let 
 bougon was in the habit of leaving all the doors open 
 as he passed one of these attics marius thought he perceived in the uninhabited cell the motionless heads of four men vaguely lighted up by a remnant of daylight falling through a dormer window 
 marius made no attempt to see not wishing to be seen himself he succeeded in reaching his chamber without being seen and without making any noise 
 it was high time 
 a moment later he heard bougon take her departure locking the door of the house behind her

 book ten 
 chapter xxvii 
 
 on the of august so his historians tell us napoleon spent the whole day on horseback inspecting the locality considering plans submitted to him by his marshals and personally giving commands to his generals 
 the original line of the russian forces along the river kolocha had been dislocated by the capture of the shevardino redoubt on the and part of the line the left flank had been drawn back that part of the line was not entrenched and in front of it the ground was more open and level than elsewhere it was evident to anyone military or not that it was here the french should attack it would seem that not much consideration was needed to reach this conclusion nor any particular care or trouble on the part of the emperor and his marshals nor was there any need of that special and supreme quality called genius that people are so apt to ascribe to napoleon yet the historians who described the event later and the men who then surrounded napoleon and he himself thought otherwise 
 napoleon rode over the plain and surveyed the locality with a profound air and in silence nodded with approval or shook his head dubiously and without communicating to the generals around him the profound course of ideas which guided his decisions merely gave them his final conclusions in the form of commands having listened to a suggestion from davout who was now called prince to turn the russian left wing napoleon said it should not be done without explaining why not to a proposal made by general campan who was to attack the fleches to lead his division through the woods napoleon agreed though the duke of elchingen ney ventured to remark that a movement through the woods was dangerous and might disorder the division 
 having inspected the country opposite the shevardino redoubt napoleon pondered a little in silence and then indicated the spots where two batteries should be set up by the morrow to act against the russian entrenchments and the places where in line with them the field artillery should be placed 
 after giving these and other commands he returned to his tent and the dispositions for the battle were written down from his dictation 
 these dispositions of which the french historians write with enthusiasm and other historians with profound respect were as follows 
 at dawn the two new batteries established during the night on the plain occupied by the prince will open fire on the opposing batteries of the enemy 
 at the same time the commander of the artillery of the st corps general pernetti with thirty cannon of division and all the howitzers of and divisions will move forward open fire and overwhelm with shellfire the battery against which will operate 
 guns of the artillery of the guards 
 guns of division 
 and guns of and divisions 
 
 in all guns 
 the commander of the artillery of the rd corps general fouche will place the howitzers of the rd and th corps sixteen in all on the flanks of the battery that is to bombard the entrenchment on the left which will have forty guns in all directed against it 
 general sorbier must be ready at the first order to advance with all the howitzers of the artillery against either one or other of the entrenchments 
 during the cannonade prince poniatowski is to advance through the wood on the village and turn the position 
 general campan will move through the wood to seize the first fortification 
 after the advance has begun in this manner orders will be given in accordance with the movements 
 the cannonade on the left flank will begin as soon as the guns of the right wing are heard the sharpshooters of division and of the division will open a heavy fire on seeing the attack commence on the right wing 
 the will occupy the village and cross by its three bridges advancing to the same heights as and divisions which under his leadership will be directed against the redoubt and come into line with the rest of the forces 
 all this must be done in good order le tout se fera avec ordre et methode as far as possible retaining troops in reserve 
 the imperial camp near mozhaysk 
 september 
 these dispositions which are very obscure and confused if one allows oneself to regard the arrangements without religious awe of his genius related to orders to deal with four points four different orders not one of these was or could be carried out 
 in the disposition it is said first that the batteries placed on the spot chosen by napoleon with the guns of pernetti and fouche which were to come in line with them guns in all were to open fire and shower shells on the russian fleches and redoubts this could not be done as from the spots selected by napoleon the projectiles did not carry to the russian works and those guns shot into the air until the nearest commander contrary to instructions moved them forward 
 the second order was that poniatowski moving to the village through the wood should turn the russian left flank this could not be done and was not done because poniatowski advancing on the village through the wood met tuchkov there barring his way and could not and did not turn the russian position 
 the third order was general campan will move through the wood to seize the first fortification general division did not seize the first fortification but was driven back for on emerging from the wood it had to reform under grapeshot of which napoleon was unaware 
 the fourth order was the will occupy the village borodino and cross by its three bridges advancing to the same heights as and divisions for whose movements no directions are given which under his leadership will be directed against the redoubt and come into line with the rest of the forces 
 as far as one can make out not so much from this unintelligible sentence as from the attempts the made to execute the orders given him he was to advance from the left through borodino to the redoubt while the divisions of morand and gerard were to advance simultaneously from the front 
 all this like the other parts of the disposition was not and could not be executed after passing through borodino the was driven back to the kolocha and could get no farther while the divisions of morand and gerard did not take the redoubt but were driven back and the redoubt was only taken at the end of the battle by the cavalry a thing probably unforeseen and not heard of by napoleon so not one of the orders in the disposition was or could be executed but in the disposition it is said that after the fight has commenced in this manner orders will be given in accordance with the movements and so it might be supposed that all necessary arrangements would be made by napoleon during the battle but this was not and could not be done for during the whole battle napoleon was so far away that as appeared later he could not know the course of the battle and not one of his orders during the fight could be executed

 book wicked poor man 
 chapter xvi 
 
 in which will be found the words to an english air which was in fashion in 
 marius seated himself on his bed 
 it might have been five only half an hour separated him from what was about to happen he heard the beating of his arteries as one hears the ticking of a watch in the dark 
 he thought of the double march which was going on at that moment in the advancing on one side justice coming up on the other 
 he was not afraid but he could not think without a shudder of what was about to take place as is the case with all those who are suddenly assailed by an unforeseen adventure the entire day produced upon him the effect of a dream and in order to persuade himself that he was not the prey of a nightmare he had to feel the cold barrels of the steel pistols in his trousers pockets 
 it was no longer snowing the moon disengaged itself more and more clearly from the mist and its light mingled with the white reflection of the snow which had fallen communicated to the chamber a sort of twilight aspect 
 there was a light in the jondrette den 
 marius saw the hole in the wall shining with a reddish glow which seemed bloody to him 
 it was true that the light could not be produced by a candle however there was not a sound in the jondrette quarters not a soul was moving there not a soul speaking not a breath the silence was glacial and profound and had it not been for that light he might have thought himself next door to a sepulchre 
 marius softly removed his boots and pushed them under his bed 
 several minutes elapsed 
 marius heard the lower door turn on its hinges a heavy step mounted the staircase and hastened along the corridor the latch of the hovel was noisily lifted it was jondrette returning 
 instantly several voices arose 
 the whole family was in the garret 
 only it had been silent in the absence like wolf whelps in the absence of the wolf 
 i said he 
 good evening daddy yelped the girls 
 well said the mother 
 going responded jondrette but my feet are beastly cold 
 good 
 you have dressed up 
 you have done well you must inspire confidence 
 all ready to go out 
 forget what i told you 
 you will do everything sure 
 rest easy 
 because said jondrette 
 and he left the phrase unfinished 
 marius heard him lay something heavy on the table probably the chisel which he had purchased 
 by the way said jondrette have you been eating here 
 yes said the mother 
 i got three large potatoes and some salt i took advantage of the fire to cook them 
 good returned jondrette 
 i will take you out to dine with me 
 we will have a duck and fixings 
 you shall dine like charles the tenth all is going well 
 then he added 
 the is open 
 the cats are there 
 he lowered his voice still further and said 
 put this in the fire 
 marius heard a sound of charcoal being knocked with the tongs or some iron utensil and jondrette continued 
 have you greased the hinges of the door so that they will not squeak 
 yes replied the mother 
 what time is it 
 nearly six 
 the struck from a while ago 
 the devil ejaculated jondrette the children must go and watch come you do you listen here 
 a whispering ensued 
 voice became audible again 
 has old bougon left 
 yes said the mother 
 are you sure that there is no one in our room 
 he has not been in all day and you know very well that this is his dinner hour 
 you are sure 
 sure 
 all the same said jondrette no harm in going to see whether he is there 
 here my girl take the candle and go there 
 marius fell on his hands and knees and crawled silently under his bed 
 hardly had he concealed himself when he perceived a light through the crack of his door 
 cried a voice he is not in here 
 he recognized the voice of the eldest daughter 
 did you go in demanded her father 
 no replied the girl but as his key is in the door he must be out 
 the father exclaimed 
 go in nevertheless 
 the door opened and marius saw the tall jondrette come in with a candle in her hand 
 she was as she had been in the morning only still more repulsive in this light 
 she walked straight up to the bed 
 marius endured an indescribable moment of anxiety but near the bed there was a mirror nailed to the wall and it was thither that she was directing her steps she raised herself on tiptoe and looked at herself in it in the neighboring room the sound of iron articles being moved was audible 
 she smoothed her hair with the palm of her hand and smiled into the mirror humming with her cracked and sepulchral amours ont dure toute une semaine 
 mais que du bonheur les instants sont courts 
 huit jours c etait bien la peine 
 le temps des amours devait durer toujours 
 devrait durer toujours devrait durer toujours 
 our love has lasted a whole week but how short are the instants of happiness 
 to adore each other for eight days was hardly worth the while 
 the time of love should last forever 
 in the meantime marius trembled 
 it seemed impossible to him that she should not hear his breathing 
 she stepped to the window and looked out with the way she had 
 how ugly paris is when it has put on a white chemise said she 
 she returned to the mirror and began again to put on airs before it scrutinizing herself and face in turn 
 well cried her father what are you about there 
 i am looking under the bed and the furniture she replied continuing to arrange her hair no one here 
 booby yelled her father 
 come here this minute 
 and waste any time about it 
 coming 
 coming said she 
 one has no time for anything in this hovel 
 she me quittez pour aller a la gloire 
 mon triste coeur suivra partout 
 you leave me to go to glory my sad heart will follow you everywhere 
 she cast a parting glance in the mirror and went out shutting the door behind her 
 a moment more and marius heard the sound of the two young girls bare feet in the corridor and voice shouting to them 
 pay strict heed 
 one on the side of the barrier the other at the corner of the rue du lose sight for a moment of the door of this house and the moment you see anything rush here on the instant as hard as you can go 
 you have a key to get in 
 the eldest girl grumbled 
 the idea of standing watch in the snow barefoot 
 you shall have some dainty little green silk boots said the father 
 they ran down stairs and a few seconds later the shock of the outer door as it banged to announced that they were outside 
 there now remained in the house only marius the jondrettes and probably also the mysterious persons of whom marius had caught a glimpse in the twilight behind the door of the unused attic
