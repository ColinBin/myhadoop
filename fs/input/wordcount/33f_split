 harry remained kneeling at snapes side simply staring down at him until quite suddenly a high cold voice spoke so close to them that harry jumped on his feet the flask gripped tightly in his hands thinking that voldemort had reentered the room 
 
 voldemorts voice reverberated from the walls and floor and harry realized that he was talking to hogwarts and to all the surrounding area that the residents of hogsmeade and all those still fighting in the castle would hear him as clearly as if he stood beside them his breath on the back of their necks a deathblow away 
 
 you have fought said the high cold voice valiantly lord voldemort knows how to value bravery 
 
 yet you have sustained heavy losses if you continue to resist me you will all die one by one i do not wish this to happen every drop of magical blood spilled is a loss and a waste 
 
 lord voldemort is merciful i command my forces to retreat immediately 
 
 you have one hour dispose of your dead with dignity treat your injured 
 
 i speak now harry potter directly to you you have permitted your friends to die for you rather than face me yourself i shall wait for one hour in the forbidden forest if at the end of that hour you have not come to me have not given yourself up then battle recommences this time i shall enter the fray myself harry potter and i shall find you and i shall punish every last man woman and child who has tried to conceal you from me one hour 
 
 both ron and hermione shook their heads frantically looking at harry 
 
 dont listen to him said ron 
 
 itll be all right said hermione wildly lets c lets get back to the castle if hes gone to the forest well need to think of a new plan c 
 
 she glanced at snapes body then hurried back to the tunnel entrance ron followed her harry gathered up the invisibility cloak then looked down at snape he did not know what to feel except shock at the way snape had been killed and the reason for which it had been done 
 
 they crawled back through the tunnel none of them talking and harry wondered whether ron and hermione could still hear voldemort ringing in their heads as he could 
 
 you have permitted your friends to die for you rather than face me yourself i shall wait for one hour in the forbidden forestone hour 
 
 small bundles seemed to litter the lawn at the front of the castle it could only be an hour or so from dawn yet it was the three of them hurried toward the stone steps a lone dog the size of a small boat lay abandoned in front of them there was no other sign of grawp or of his attacker 
 
 the castle was unnaturally silent there were no flashes of light now no bangs or screams or shouts the flagstones of the deserted entrance hall were stained with blood emeralds were still scattered all over the floor along with pieces of marble and splintered wood part of the banisters had been blown away 
 
 where is everyone whispered hermione 
 
 ron led the way to the great hall harry stopped in the doorway 
 
 the house tables were gone and the room was crowded the survivors stood in groups their arms around each others necks the injured were being treated upon the raised platform by madam pomfrey and a group of helpers firenze was amongst the injured his flank poured blood and he shook where he lay unable to stand 
 
 the dead lay in a row in the middle of the hall harry could not see freds body because his family surrounded him george was kneeling at his head mrs weasley was lying across freds chest her body shaking mr weasley stroking her hair while tears cascaded down his cheeks 
 
 without a word to harry ron and hermione walked away harry saw hermione approach ginny whose face was swollen and blotchy and hug her ron joined bill fleur and percy who flung an arm around rons shoulders as ginny and hermione moved closer to the rest of the family harry had a clear view of the bodies lying next to fred remus and tonks pale and still and apparently asleep beneath the dark enchanted ceiling 
 
 the great hall seemed to fly away become smaller shrink as harry reeled backward from the doorway he could not draw breath he could not bear to look at any of the other bodies to see who else had died for him he could not bear to join the weasleys could not look into their eyes when if he had given himself up in the first place fred might never have died 
 
 he turned away and ran up the marble staircase lupin tonks he yearned not to feel he wished he could rip out his heart his innards everything that was screaming inside him 
 
 the castle was completely empty even the ghosts seemed to have joined the mass mourning in the great hall harry ran without stopping clutching the crystal flask of snapes last thoughts and he did not slow down until he reached the stone gargoyle guarding the headmasters office 
 
 password 
 
 dumbledore said harry without thinking because it was he whom he yearned to see and to his surprise the gargoyle slid aside revealing the spiral staircase behind 
 
 but when harry burst into the circular office he found a change the portraits that hung all around the walls were empty not a single headmaster or headmistress remained to see him all it seemed had flitted away charging through the paintings that lined the castle so that they could have a clear view of what was going on 
 
 harry glanced hopelessly at dumbledores deserted frame which hung directly behind the headmasters chair then turned his back on it the stone pensieve lay in the cabinet where it had always been harry heaved it onto the desk and poured snapes memories into the wide basin with its runic markings around the edge to escape into someone elses head would be a blessed relief nothing that even snape had left him could be worse than his own thoughts the memories swirled silver white and strange and without hesitating with a feeling of reckless abandonment as though this would assuage his torturing grief harry dived 
 
 he fell headlong into sunlight and his feet found warm ground when he straightened up he saw that he was in a nearly deserted playground a single huge chimney dominated the distant skyline two girls were swinging backward and forward and a skinny boy was watching them from behind a clump of bushes his black hair was overlong and his clothes were so mismatched that it looked deliberate too short jeans a shabby overlarge coat that might have belonged to a grown man an odd smocklike shirt 
 
 harry moved closer to the boy snape looked no more than nine or ten years old sallow small stringy there was undisguised greed in his thin face as he watched the younger of the two girls swinging higher and higher than her sister 
 
 lily dont do it shrieked the elder of the two 
 
 but the girl had let go of the swing at the very height of its arc and flown into the air quite literally flown launched herself skyward with a great shout of laughter and instead of crumpling on the playground asphalt she soared like a trapeze artist through the air staying up far too long landing far too lightly 
 
 mummy told you not to 
 
 petunia stopped her swing by dragging the heels of her sandals on the ground making a crunching grinding sound then leapt up hands on hips 
 
 mummy said you werent allowed lily 
 
 but im fine said lily still giggling tuney look at this watch what i can do 
 
 petunia glanced around the playground was deserted apart from themselves and though the girls did not know it snape lily had picked up a fallen flower from the bush behind which snape lurked petunia advanced evidently torn between curiosity and disapproval lily waited until petunia was near enough to have a clear view then held out her palm the flower sat there opening and closing its petals like some bizarre oyster 
 
 stop it shrieked petunia 
 
 its not hurting you said lily but she closed her hand on the blossom and threw it back to the ground 
 
 its not right said petunia but her eyes had followed the flowers flight to the ground and lingered upon it how do you do it she added and there was definite longing in her voice 
 
 its obvious isnt it snape could no longer contain himself but had jumped out from behind the bushes petunia shrieked and ran backward toward the swings but lily though clearly startled remained where she was snape seemed to regret his appearance a dull flush of color mounted the sallow cheeks as he looked at lily 
 
 whats obvious asked lily 
 
 snape had an air of nervous excitement with a glance at the distant petunia now hovering beside the swings he lowered his voice and said i know what you are 
 
 what do you mean 
 
 youreyoure a witch whispered snape 
 
 she looked affronted 
 
 thats not a very nice thing to say to somebody 
 
 she turned nose in the air and marched off toward her sister 
 
 no said snape he was highly colored now and harry wondered why he did not take off the ridiculously large coat unless it was because he did not want to reveal the smock beneath it he flapped after the girls looking ludicrously batlike like his older self 
 
 the sisters considered him united in disapproval both holding on to one of the swing poles as though it was the safe place in tag 
 
 you are said snape to lily you are a witch ive been watching you for a while but theres nothing wrong with that my mums one and im a wizard 
 
 petunias laugh was like cold water 
 
 wizard she shrieked her courage returned now that she had recovered from the shock of his unexpected appearance i know who you are youre that snape boy they live down spinners end by the river she told lily and it was evident from her tone that she considered the address a poor recommendation why have you been spying on us 
 
 havent been spying said snape hot and uncomfortable and in the bright sunlight wouldnt spy on you anyway he added spitefully youre a muggle 
 
 though petunia evidently did not understand the word she could hardly mistake the tone 
 
 lily come on were leaving she said shrilly lily obeyed her sister at once glaring at snape as she left he stood watching them as they marched through the playground gate and harry the only one left to observe him recognized snapes bitter disappointment and understood that snape had been planning this moment for a while and that it had all gone wrong 
 
 the scene dissolved and before harry knew it around him he was now in a small thicket of trees he could see a sunlit river glittering through their trunks the shadows cast by the trees made a basin of cool green shade two children sat facing each other on the ground snape had removed his coat now his odd smock looked less peculiar in the half light 
 
 and the ministry can punish you if you do magic outside school you get letters 
 
 but i have done magic outside school 
 
 were all right we havent got wands yet they let you off when youre a kid and you cant help it but once youre eleven he nodded importantly and they start training you then youve got to go careful 
 
 there was a little silence lily had picked up a fallen twig and twirled it in the air and harry knew that she was imagining sparks trailing from it then she dropped the twig leaned in toward the boy and said it is real isnt it its not a joke petunia says youre lying to me petunia says there isnt a hogwarts it is real isnt it 
 
 its real for us said snape not for her but well get the letter you and me 
 
 really whispered lily 
 
 definitely said snape and even with his poorly cut hair and his odd clothes he struck an oddly impressive figure sprawled in front of her brimful of confidence in his destiny 
 
 and will it really come by owl lily whispered 
 
 normally said snape but youre so someone from the school will have to come and explain to your parents 
 
 does it make a difference being 
 
 snape hesitated his black eyes eager in the greenish gloom moved over the pale face the dark red hair 
 
 no he said it doesnt make any difference 
 
 good said lily relaxing it was clear that she had been worrying 
 
 youve got loads of magic said snape i saw that all the time i was watching you 
 
 his voice trailed away she was not listening but had stretched out on the leafy ground and was looking up at the canopy of leaves overhead he watched her as greedily as he had watched her in the playground 
 
 how are things at your house lily asked 
 
 a little crease appeared between his eyes 
 
 fine he said 
 
 theyre not arguing anymore 
 
 oh yes theyre arguing said snape he picked up a fistful of leaves and began tearing them apart apparently unaware of what he was doing but it wont be that long and ill be gone 
 
 doesnt your dad like magic 
 
 he doesnt like anything much said snape 
 
 severus 
 
 a little smile twisted snapes mouth when she said his name 
 
 yeah 
 
 tell me about the dementors again 
 
 what dyou want to know about them for 
 
 if i use magic outside school c 
 
 they wouldnt give you to the dementors for that dementors are for people who do really bad stuff they guard the wizard prison azkaban youre not going to end up in azkaban youre too c 
 
 he turned red again and shredded more leaves then a small rustling noise behind harry made him turn petunia hiding behind a tree had lost her footing 
 
 tuney said lily surprise and welcome in her voice but snape had jumped to his feet 
 
 whos spying now he shouted what dyou want 
 
 petunia was breathless alarmed at being caught harry could see her struggling for something hurtful to say 
 
 what is that youre wearing anyway she said pointing at snapes chest your mums blouse 
 
 there was a crack a branch over petunias head had fallen lily screamed the branch caught petunia on the shoulder and she staggered backward and burst into tears 
 
 tuney 
 
 but petunia was running away lily rounded on snape 
 
 did you make that happen 
 
 no he looked both defiant and scared 
 
 you did she was backing away from him you did you hurt her 
 
 no c no i didnt 
 
 but the lie did not convince lily after one last burning look she ran from the little thicket off after her sister and snape looked miserable and confused 
 
 and the scene harry looked around he was on platform nine and three quarters and snape stood beside him slightly hunched next to a thin woman who greatly resembled him snape was staring at a family of four a short distance away the two girls stood a little apart from their parents lily seemed to be pleading with her sister harry moved closer to listen 
 
 im sorry tuney im sorry listen c she caught her sisters hand and held tight to it even though petunia tried to pull it away maybe once im there c no listen tuney maybe once im there ill be able to go to professor dumbledore and persuade him to change his mind 
 
 i dont c want c to c go said petunia and she dragged her hand back out of her sisters grasp you think i want to go to some stupid castle and learn to be a c a 
 
 her pale eyes roved over the platform over the cats mewling in their owners arms over the owls fluttering and hooting at each other in cages over the students some already in their long black robes loading trunks onto the scarlet steam engine or else greeting one another with glad cries after a summer apart 
 
 c you think i want to be a c a freak 
 
 lilys eyes filled with tears as petunia succeeded in tugging her hand away 
 
 im not a freak said lily thats a horrible thing to say 
 
 thats where youre going said petunia with relish a special school for freaks you and that snape boyweirdos thats what you two are its good youre being separated from normal people its for our safety 
 
 lily glanced toward her parents who were looking around the platform with an air of wholehearted enjoyment drinking in the scene then she looked back at her sister and her voice was low and fierce 
 
 you didnt think it was such a freaks school when you wrote to the headmaster and begged him to take you 
 
 petunia turned scarlet 
 
 beg i didnt beg 
 
 i saw his reply it was very kind 
 
 you shouldnt have read c whispered petunia that was my private c how could you c 
 
 lily gave herself away by toward where snape stood nearby petunia gasped 
 
 that boy found it you and that boy have been sneaking in my room 
 
 no c not sneaking c now lily was on the defensive severus saw the envelope and he couldnt believe a muggle could have contacted hogwarts thats all he says there must be wizards working undercover in the postal service who take care of c 
 
 apparently wizards poke their noses in everywhere said petunia now as pale as she had been flushed freak she spat at her sister and she flounced off to where her parents stood 
 
 the scene dissolved again snape was hurrying along the corridor of the hogwarts express as it clattered through the countryside he had already changed into his school robes had perhaps taken the first opportunity to take off his dreadful muggle clothes at last he stopped outside a compartment in which a group of rowdy boys were talking hunched in a corner seat beside the window was lily her face pressed against the windowpane 
 
 snape slid open the compartment door and sat down opposite lily she glanced at him and then looked back out of the window she had been crying 
 
 i dont want to talk to you she said in a constricted voice 
 
 why not 
 
 tuney me because we saw that letter from dumbledore 
 
 so what 
 
 she threw him a look of deep dislike 
 
 so shes my sister 
 
 shes only a c he caught himself quickly lily too busy trying to wipe her eyes without being noticed did not hear him 
 
 but were going he said unable to suppress the exhilaration in his voice this is it were off to hogwarts 
 
 she nodded mopping her eyes but in spite of herself she half smiled 
 
 youd better be in slytherin said snape encouraged that she had brightened a little 
 
 slytherin 
 
 one of the boys sharing the compartment who had shown no interest at all in lily or snape until that point looked around at the word and harry whose attention had been focused entirely on the two beside the window saw his father slight like snape but with that indefinable air of having been even adored that snape so conspicuously lacked 
 
 who wants to be in slytherin i think id leave wouldnt you james asked the boy lounging on the seats opposite him and with a jolt harry realized that it was sirius sirius did not smile 
 
 my whole family have been in slytherin he said 
 
 blimey said james and i thought you seemed all right 
 
 sirius grinned 
 
 maybe ill break the tradition where are you heading if youve got the choice 
 
 james lifted an invisible sword 
 
 gryffindor where dwell the brave at heart like my dad 
 
 snape made a small disparaging noise james turned on him 
 
 got a problem with that 
 
 no said snape though his slight sneer said otherwise if youd rather be brawny than brainy c 
 
 wherere you hoping to go seeing as youre neither interjected sirius 
 
 james roared with laughter lily sat up rather flushed and looked from james to sirius in dislike 
 
 come on severus lets find another compartment 
 
 oooooo 
 
 james and sirius imitated her lofty voice james tried to trip snape as he passed 
 
 see ya snivellus a voice called as the compartment door slammed 
 
 and the scene dissolved once more 
 
 harry was standing right behind snape as they faced the candlelit house tables lined with rapt faces then professor mcgonagall said evans lily 
 
 he watched his mother walk forward on trembling legs and sit down upon the rickety stool professor mcgonagall dropped the sorting hat onto her head and barely a second after it had touched the dark red hair the hat cried gryffindor 
 
 harry heard snape let out a tiny groan lily took off the hat handed it back to professor mcgonagall then hurried toward the cheering gryffindors but as she went she glanced back at snape and there was a sad little smile on her face harry saw sirius move up the bench to make room for her she took one look at him seemed to recognize him from the train folded her arms and firmly turned her back on him 
 
 the roll call continued harry watched lupin pettigrew and his father join lily and sirius at the gryffindor table at last when only a dozen students remained to be sorted professor mcgonagall called snape 
 
 harry walked with him to the stool watched him place the hat upon his head slytherin cried the sorting hat 
 
 and severus snape moved off to the other side of the hall away from lily to where the slytherins were cheering him to where lucius malfoy a prefect badge gleaming upon his chest patted snape on the back as he sat down beside him 
 
 and the scene changed 
 
 lily and snape were walking across the castle courtyard evidently arguing harry hurried to catch up with them to listen in as he reached them he realized how much taller they both were a few years seemed to have passed since their sorting 
 
 thought we were supposed to be friends snape was saying best friends 
 
 we are sev but i dont like some of the people youre hanging round with im sorry but i detest avery and mulciber mulciber what do you see in him sev hes creepy dyou know what he tried to do to mary macdonald the other day 
 
 lily had reached a pillar and leaned against it looking up into the thin sallow face 
 
 that was nothing said snape it was a laugh thats all c 
 
 it was dark magic and if you think thats funny c 
 
 what about the stuff potter and his mates get up to demanded snape his color rose again as he said it unable it seemed to hold in his resentment 
 
 whats potter got to do with anything said lily 
 
 they sneak out at night theres something weird about that lupin where does he keep going 
 
 hes ill said lily they say hes ill c 
 
 every month at the full moon said snape 
 
 i know your theory said lily and she sounded cold why are you so obsessed with them anyway why do you care what theyre doing at night 
 
 im just trying to show you theyre not as wonderful as everyone seems to think they are 
 
 the intensity of his gaze made her blush 
 
 they dont use dark magic though she dropped her voice and youre being really ungrateful i heard what happened the other night you went sneaking down that tunnel by the whomping willow and james potter saved you from whatevers down there c 
 
 snapes whole face contorted and he spluttered saved saved you think he was playing the hero he was saving his neck and his friends too youre not going to c i wont let you c 
 
 let me let me 
 
 lilys bright green eyes were slits snape backtracked at once 
 
 i didnt mean c i just dont want to see you made a fool of c he fancies you james potter fancies you the words seemed wrenched from him against his will and hes noteveryone thinksbig quidditch hero c snapes bitterness and dislike were rendering him incoherent and lilys eyebrows were traveling farther and farther up her forehead 
 
 i know james potters an arrogant toerag she said cutting across snape i dont need you to tell me that but mulcibers and averys idea of humor is just evil evil sev i dont understand how you can be friends with them 
 
 harry doubted that snape had even heard her strictures on mulciber and avery the moment she had insulted james potter his whole body had relaxed and as they walked away there was a new spring in snapes step 
 
 and the scene dissolved 
 
 harry watched again as snape left the great hall after sitting his in defense against the dark arts watched as he wandered away from the castle and strayed inadvertently close to the place beneath the beech tree where james sirius lupin and pettigrew sat together but harry kept his distance this time because he knew what happened after james had hoisted severus into the air and taunted him he knew what had been done and said and it gave him no pleasure to hear it again he watched as lily joined the group and went to snapes defense distantly he heard snape shout at her in his humiliation and his fury the unforgivable word mudblood 
 
 the scene changed 
 
 im sorry 
 
 im not interested 
 
 im sorry 
 
 save your breath 
 
 it was nighttime lily who was wearing a dressing gown stood with her arms folded in front of the portrait of the fat lady at the entrance to gryffindor tower 
 
 i only came out because mary told me you were threatening to sleep here 
 
 i was i would have done i never meant to call you mudblood it just c 
 
 slipped out there was no pity in lilys voice its too late ive made excuses for you for years none of my friends can understand why i even talk to you you and your precious little death eater friends c you see you dont even deny it you dont even deny thats what youre all aiming to be you cant wait to join can you 
 
 he opened his mouth but closed it without speaking 
 
 i cant pretend anymore youve chosen your way ive chosen mine 
 
 no c listen i didnt mean c 
 
 c to call me mudblood but you call everyone of my birth mudblood severus why should i be any different 
 
 he struggled on the verge of speech but with a contemptuous look she turned and climbed back through the portrait hole 
 
 the corridor dissolved and the scene took a little longer to reform harry seemed to fly through shifting shapes and colors until his surroundings solidified again and he stood on a hilltop forlorn and cold in the darkness the wind whistling through the branches of a few leafless trees the adult snape was panting turning on the spot his wand gripped tightly in his hand waiting for something or for someone his fear infected harry too even though he knew that he could not be harmed and he looked over his shoulder wondering what it was that snape was waiting for c then a blinding jagged jet of white light flew through the air harry thought of lightning but snape had dropped to his knees and his wand had flown out of his hand 
 
 dont kill me 
 
 that was not my intention 
 
 any sound of dumbledore apparating had been drowned by the sound of the wind in the branches he stood before snape with his robes whipping around him and his face was illuminated from below in the light cast by his wand 
 
 well severus what message does lord voldemort have for me 
 
 no c no message c im here on my own account 
 
 snape was wringing his hands he looked a little mad with his straggling black hair flying around him 
 
 i c i come with a warning c no a request c please c 
 
 dumbledore flicked his wand though leaves and branches still flew through the night air around them silence fell on the spot where he and snape faced each other 
 
 what request could a death eater make of me 
 
 the c the prophecythe predictiontrelawney 
 
 ah yes said dumbledore how much did you relay to lord voldemort 
 
 everything c everything i heard said snape that is why c it is for that reason c he thinks it means lily evans 
 
 the prophecy did not refer to a woman said dumbledore it spoke of a boy born at the end of july c 
 
 you know what i mean he thinks it means her son he is going to hunt her down c kill them all c 
 
 if she means so much to you said dumbledore surely lord voldemort will spare her could you not ask for mercy for the mother in exchange for the son 
 
 i have c i have asked him c 
 
 you disgust me said dumbledore and harry had never heard so much contempt in his voice snape seemed to shrink a little you do not care then about the deaths of her husband and child they can die as long as you have what you want 
 
 snape said nothing but merely looked up at dumbledore 
 
 hide them all then he croaked keep her c them c safe please 
 
 and what will you give me in return severus 
 
 in c in return snape gaped at dumbledore and harry expected him to protest but after a long moment he said anything 
 
 the hilltop faded and harry stood in dumbledores office and something was making a terrible sound like a wounded animal snape was slumped forward in a chair and dumbledore was standing over him looking grim after a moment or two snape raised his face and he looked like a man who had lived a hundred years of misery since leaving the wild hilltop 
 
 i thoughtyou were goingto keep hersafe 
 
 she and james put their faith in the wrong person said dumbledore rather like you severus werent you hoping that lord voldemort would spare her 
 
 snapes breathing was shallow 
 
 her boy survives said dumbledore 
 
 with a tiny jerk of the head snape seemed to flick off an irksome fly 
 
 her son lives he has her eyes precisely her eyes you remember the shape and color of lily evanss eyes i am sure 
 
 dont bellowed snape gonedead 
 
 is this remorse severus 
 
 i wishi wish i were dead 
 
 and what use would that be to anyone said dumbledore coldly if you loved lily evans if you truly loved her then your way forward is clear 
 
 snape seemed to peer through a haze of pain and dumbledores words appeared to take a long time to reach him 
 
 what c what do you mean 
 
 you know how and why she died make sure it was not in vain help me protect lilys son 
 
 he does not need protection the dark lord has gone c 
 
 the dark lord will return and harry potter will be in terrible danger when he does 
 
 there was a long pause and slowly snape regained control of himself mastered his own breathing at last he said very well very well but never c never tell dumbledore this must be between us swear it i cannot bearespecially potters soni want your word 
 
 my word severus that i shall never reveal the best of you dumbledore sighed looking down into snapes ferocious anguished face if you insist 
 
 the office dissolved but instantly snape was pacing up and down in front of dumbledore 
 
 c mediocre arrogant as his father a determined delighted to find himself famous and impertinent c 
 
 you see what you expect to see severus said dumbledore without raising his eyes from a copy of transfiguration today other teachers report that the boy is modest likable and reasonably talented personally i find him an engaging child 
 
 dumbledore turned a page and said without looking up keep an eye on quirrell wont you 
 
 a whirl of color and now everything darkened and snape and dumbledore stood a little apart in the entrance hall while the last stragglers from the yule ball passed them on their way to bed 
 
 well murmured dumbledore 
 
 karkaroffs mark is becoming darker too he is panicking he fears retribution you know how much help he gave the ministry after the dark lord fell snape looked sideways at dumbledores profile karkaroff intends to flee if the mark burns 
 
 does he said dumbledore softly as fleur delacour and roger davies came giggling in from the grounds and are you tempted to join him 
 
 no said snape his black eyes on fleurs and rogers retreating figures i am not such a coward 
 
 no agreed dumbledore you are a braver man by far than igor karkaroff you know i sometimes think we sort too soon 
 
 he walked away leaving snape looking stricken 
 
 and now harry stood in the headmasters office yet again it was nighttime and dumbledore sagged sideways in the thronelike chair behind the desk apparently semiconscious his right hand dangled over the side blackened and burned snape was muttering incantations pointing his wand at the wrist of the hand while with his left hand he tipped a goblet full of thick golden potion down dumbledores throat after a moment or two dumbledores eyelids fluttered and opened 
 
 why said snape without preamble why did you put on that ring it carries a curse surely you realized that why even touch it 
 
 marvolo gaunts ring lay on the desk before dumbledore it was cracked the sword of gryffindor lay beside it 
 
 dumbledore grimaced 
 
 iwas a fool sorely tempted 
 
 tempted by what 
 
 dumbledore did not answer 
 
 it is a miracle you managed to return here snape sounded furious that ring carried a curse of extraordinary power to contain it is all we can hope for i have trapped the curse in one hand for the time being c 
 
 dumbledore raised his blackened useless hand and examined it with the expression of one being shown an interesting curio 
 
 you have done very well severus how long do you think i have 
 
 dumbledores tone was conversational he might have been asking for a weather forecast snape hesitated and then said i cannot tell maybe a year there is no halting such a spell forever it will spread eventually it is the sort of curse that strengthens over time 
 
 dumbledore smiled the news that he had less than a year to live seemed a matter of little or no concern to him 
 
 i am fortunate extremely fortunate that i have you severus 
 
 if you had only summoned me a little earlier i might have been able to do more buy you more time said snape furiously he looked down at the broken ring and the sword did you think that breaking the ring would break the curse 
 
 something like thati was delirious no doubt said dumbledore with an effort he straightened himself in his chair well really this makes matters much more straightforward 
 
 snape looked utterly perplexed dumbledore smiled 
 
 i refer to the plan lord voldemort is revolving around me his plan to have the poor malfoy boy murder me 
 
 snape sat down in the chair harry had so often occupied across the desk from dumbledore harry could tell that he wanted to say more on the subject of dumbledores cursed hand but the other held it up in polite refusal to discuss the matter further scowling snape said the dark lord does not expect draco to succeed this is merely punishment for luciuss recent failures slow torture for dracos parents while they watch him fail and pay the price 
 
 in short the boy has had a death sentence pronounced upon him as surely as i have said dumbledore now i should have thought the natural successor to the job once draco fails is yourself 
 
 there was a short pause 
 
 that i think is the dark lords plan 
 
 lord voldemort foresees a moment in the near future when he will not need a spy at hogwarts 
 
 he believes the school will soon be in his grasp yes 
 
 and if it does fall into his grasp said dumbledore almost it seemed as an aside i have your word that you will do all in your power to protect the students at hogwarts 
 
 snape gave a stiff nod 
 
 good now then your first priority will be to discover what draco is up to a frightened teenage boy is a danger to others as well as to himself offer him help and guidance he ought to accept he likes you c 
 
 c much less since his father has lost favor draco blames me he thinks i have usurped luciuss position 
 
 all the same try i am concerned less for myself than for accidental victims of whatever schemes might occur to the boy ultimately of course there is only one thing to be done if we are to save him from lord voldemorts wrath 
 
 snape raised his eyebrows and his tone was sardonic as he asked are you intending to let him kill you 
 
 certainly not you must kill me 
 
 there was a long silence broken only by an odd clicking noise fawkes the phoenix was gnawing a bit of cuttlebone 
 
 would you like me to do it now asked snape his voice heavy with irony or would you like a few moments to compose an epitaph 
 
 oh not quite yet said dumbledore smiling i daresay the moment will present itself in due course given what has happened tonight he indicated his withered hand we can be sure that it will happen within a year 
 
 if you dont mind dying said snape roughly why not let draco do it 
 
 that boys soul is not yet so damaged said dumbledore i would not have it ripped apart on my account 
 
 and my soul dumbledore mine 
 
 you alone know whether it will harm your soul to help an old man avoid pain and humiliation said dumbledore i ask this one great favor of you severus because death is coming for me as surely as the chudley cannons will finish bottom of this years league i confess i should prefer a quick painless exit to the protracted and messy affair it will be if for instance greyback is involved c i hear voldemort has recruited him or dear bellatrix who likes to play with her food before she eats it 
 
 his tone was light but his blue eyes pierced snape as they had frequently pierced harry as though the soul they discussed was visible to him at last snape gave another curt nod 
 
 dumbledore seemed satisfied 
 
 thank you severus 
 
 the office disappeared and now snape and dumbledore were strolling together in the deserted castle grounds by twilight 
 
 what are you doing with potter all these evenings you are closeted together snape asked abruptly 
 
 dumbledore looked weary 
 
 why you arent trying to give him more detentions severus the boy will soon have spent more time in detention than out 
 
 he is his father over again c 
 
 in looks perhaps but his deepest nature is much more like his mothers i spend time with harry because i have things to discuss with him information i must give him before it is too late 
 
 information repeated snape you trust himyou do not trust me 
 
 it is not a question of trust i have as we both know limited time it is essential that i give the boy enough information for him to do what he needs to do 
 
 and why may i not have the same information 
 
 i prefer not to put all of my secrets in one basket particularly not a basket that spends so much time dangling on the arm of lord voldemort 
 
 which i do on your orders 
 
 and you do it extremely well do not think that i underestimate the constant danger in which you place yourself severus to give voldemort what appears to be valuable information while withholding the essentials is a job i would entrust to nobody but you 
 
 yet you confide much more in a boy who is incapable of occlumency whose magic is mediocre and who has a direct connection into the dark lords mind 
 
 voldemort fears that connection said dumbledore not so long ago he had one small taste of what truly sharing harrys mind means to him it was pain such as he has never experienced he will not try to possess harry again i am sure of it not in that way 
 
 i dont understand 
 
 lord voldemorts soul maimed as it is cannot bear close contact with a soul like harrys like a tongue on frozen steel like flesh in flame c 
 
 souls we were talking of minds 
 
 in the case of harry and lord voldemort to speak of one is to speak of the other 
 
 dumbledore glanced around to make sure that they were alone they were close by the forbidden forest now but there was no sign of anyone near them 
 
 after you have killed me severus c 
 
 you refuse to tell me everything yet you expect that small service of me snarled snape and real anger flared in the thin face now you take a great deal for granted dumbledore perhaps i have changed my mind 
 
 you gave me your word severus and while we are talking about services you owe me i thought you agreed to keep a close eye on our young slytherin friend 
 
 snape looked angry mutinous dumbledore sighed 
 
 come to my office tonight severus at eleven and you shall not complain that i have no confidence in you 
 
 they were back in dumbledores office the windows dark and fawkes sat silent as snape sat quite still as dumbledore walked around him talking 
 
 harry must not know not until the last moment not until it is necessary otherwise how could he have the strength to do what must be done 
 
 but what must he do 
 
 that is between harry and me now listen closely severus there will come a time c after my death c do not argue do not interrupt there will come a time when lord voldemort will seem to fear for the life of his snake 
 
 for nagini snape looked astonished 
 
 precisely if there comes a time when lord voldemort stops sending that snake forth to do his bidding but keeps it safe beside him under magical protection then i think it will be safe to tell harry 
 
 tell him what 
 
 dumbledore took a deep breath and closed his eyes 
 
 tell him that on the night lord voldemort tried to kill him when lily cast her own life between them as a shield the killing curse rebounded upon lord voldemort and a fragment of voldemorts soul was blasted apart from the whole and latched itself onto the only living soul left in that collapsed building part of lord voldemort lives inside harry and it is that which gives him the power of speech with snakes and a connection with lord voldemorts mind that he has never understood and while that fragment of soul unmissed by voldemort remains attached to and protected by harry lord voldemort cannot die 
 
 harry seemed to be watching the two men from one end of a long tunnel they were so far away from him their voices echoing strangely in his ears 
 
 so the boythe boy must die asked snape quite calmly 
 
 and voldemort himself must do it severus that is essential 
 
 another long silence then snape said i thoughtall those yearsthat we were protecting him for her for lily 
 
 we have protected him because it has been essential to teach him to raise him to let him try his strength said dumbledore his eyes still tight shut meanwhile the connection between them grows ever stronger a parasitic growth sometimes i have thought he suspects it himself if i know him he will have arranged matters so that when he does set out to meet his death it will truly mean the end of voldemort 
 
 dumbledore opened his eyes snape looked horrified 
 
 you have kept him alive so that he can die at the right moment 
 
 dont be shocked severus how many men and women have you watched die 
 
 lately only those whom i could not save said snape he stood up you have used me 
 
 meaning 
 
 i have spied for you and lied for you put myself in mortal danger for you everything was supposed to be to keep lily potters son safe now you tell me you have been raising him like a pig for slaughter c 
 
 but this is touching severus said dumbledore seriously have you grown to care for the boy after all 
 
 for him shouted snape expecto patronum 
 
 from the tip of his wand burst the silver doe she landed on the office floor bounded once across the office and soared out of the window dumbledore watched her fly away and as her silvery glow faded he turned back to snape and his eyes were full of tears 
 
 after all this time 
 
 always said snape 
 
 and the scene shifted now harry saw snape talking to the portrait of dumbledore behind his desk 
 
 you will have to give voldemort the correct date of harrys departure from his aunt and uncles said dumbledore not to do so will raise suspicion when voldemort believes you so well informed however you must plant the idea of decoys that i think ought to ensure harrys safety try confunding mundungus fletcher and severus if you are forced to take part in the chase be sure to act your part convincinglyi am counting upon you to remain in lord voldemorts good books as long as possible or hogwarts will be left to the mercy of the carrows 
 
 now snape was head to head with mundungus in an unfamiliar tavern mundunguss face looking curiously blank snape frowning in concentration 
 
 you will suggest to the order of the phoenix snape murmured that they use decoys polyjuice potion identical potters its the only thing that might work you will forget that i have suggested this you will present it as your own idea you understand 
 
 i understand murmured mundungus his eyes unfocused 
 
 now harry was flying alongside snape on a broomstick through a clear dark night he was accompanied by other hodded death eaters and ahead were lupin and a harry who was really george a death eater moved ahead of snape and raised his wand pointing it directly at lupins back 
 
 sectumsempra shouted snape 
 
 but the spell intended for the death eaters wand hand missed and hit george instead c 
 
 and next snape was kneeling in siriuss old bedroom tears were dripping from the end of his hooked nose as he read the old letter from lily the second page carried only a few words could ever have been friends with gellert grindelwald i think her minds going personally 
 
 lots of love lily 
 
 snape took the page bearing lilys signature and her love and tucked it inside his robes then he ripped in two the photograph he was also holding so that he kept the part from which lily laughed throwing the portion showing james and harry back onto the floor under the chest of drawers 
 
 and now snape stood again in the headmasters study as phineas nigellus came hurrying into his portrait 
 
 headmaster they are camping in the forest of dean the mudblood c 
 
 do not use that word 
 
 c the granger girl then mentioned the place as she opened her bag and i heard her 
 
 good very good cried the portrait of dumbledore behind the headmasters chair now severus the sword do not forget that it must be taken under conditions of need and valor c and he must not know that you give it if voldemort should read harrys mind and see you acting for him c 
 
 i know said snape curtly he approached the portrait of dumbledore and pulled at its side it swung forward revealing a hidden cavity behind it from which he took the sword of gryffindor 
 
 and you still arent going to tell me why its so important to give potter the sword said snape as he swung a traveling cloak over his robes 
 
 no i dont think so said dumbledores portrait he will know what to do with it and severus be very careful they may not take kindly to your appearance after george weasleys mishap c 
 
 snape turned at the door 
 
 dont worry dumbledore he said coolly i have a plan 
 
 and snape left the room harry rose up out of the pensieve and moments later he lay on the carpeted floor in exactly the same rooms snape might just have closed the door 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the deathly hallows
