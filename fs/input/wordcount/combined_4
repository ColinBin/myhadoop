 a leaf from heaven 
 by hans christian andersen 
 
 high up in the clear pure air flew an angel with a flower 
 plucked from the garden of heaven as he was kissing the flower a very little leaf fell from it and sunk down into the soft earth in the 
 middle of a wood it immediately took root sprouted and sent out 
 shoots among the other plants what a ridiculous little shoot said one no one will recognize it not even the thistle nor the it must be a kind of garden plant said another and so they 
 sneered and despised the plant as a thing from a garden where are you coming said the tall thistles whose leaves were all armed with thorns it is stupid nonsense to allow yourself to shoot out in this way we are not here to support you 
 
 winter came and the plant was covered with snow but the snow 
 glittered over it as if it had sunshine beneath as well as above 
 when spring came the plant appeared in full bloom a more 
 beautiful object than any other plant in the forest and now the 
 professor of botany presented himself one who could explain his 
 knowledge in black and white he examined and tested the plant but it did not belong to his system of botany nor could he possibly find out to what class it did belong it must be some degenerate species 
 said he i do not know it and it is not mentioned in any system 
 not known in any system repeated the thistles and the nettles 
 
 the large trees which grew round it saw the plant and heard the 
 remarks but they said not a word either good or bad which is the 
 wisest plan for those who are ignorant 
 
 there passed through the forest a poor innocent girl her heart 
 was pure and her understanding increased by her faith her chief 
 inheritance had been an old bible which she read and valued from its pages she heard the voice of god speaking to her and telling her to remember what was said of brethren when persons wished to injure her they imagined evil in their hearts but god turned it to good if we suffer wrongfully if we are misunderstood or despised we must think of him who was pure and holy and who prayed for those who nailed him to the cross father forgive them for they know not what they do 
 
 the girl stood still before the wonderful plant for the green 
 leaves exhaled a sweet and refreshing fragrance and the flowers 
 glittered and sparkled in the sunshine like colored flames and the 
 harmony of sweet sounds lingered round them as if each concealed 
 within itself a deep fount of melody which thousands of years could 
 not exhaust with pious gratitude the girl looked upon this glorious 
 work of god and bent down over one of the branches that she might examine the flower and inhale the sweet perfume then a light broke in on her mind and her heart expanded gladly would she have plucked a flower but she could not overcome her reluctance to break one off 
 
 she knew it would so soon fade so she took only a single green 
 leaf carried it home and laid it in her bible where it remained 
 ever green fresh and unfading between the pages of the bible it 
 still lay when a few weeks afterwards that bible was laid under 
 the young head in her coffin a holy calm rested on her face 
 as if the earthly remains bore the impress of the truth that she now 
 stood in the presence of god 
 
 in the forest the wonderful plant still continued to bloom till it 
 grew and became almost a tree and all the birds of passage bowed 
 themselves before it 
 
 that plant is a foreigner no doubt said the thistles and the 
 burdocks we can never conduct ourselves like that in this 
 country and the black forest snails actually spat at the flower 
 then came the swineherd he was collecting thistles and shrubs 
 to burn them for the ashes he pulled up the wonderful plant roots 
 and all and placed it in his bundle this will be as useful as any 
 he said so the plant was carried away 
 
 not long after the king of the country suffered from the 
 deepest melancholy he was diligent and industrious but employment 
 did him no good they read deep and learned books to him and then the lightest and most trifling that could be found but all to no purpose 
 
 then they applied for advice to one of the wise men of the world 
 and he sent them a message to say that there was one remedy which 
 would relieve and cure him and that it was a plant of heavenly origin 
 which grew in the forest in the own dominions the messenger 
 described the flower so that is appearance could not be mistaken 
 then said the swineherd i am afraid i carried this plant away 
 from the forest in my bundle and it has been burnt to ashes long ago 
 but i did not know any better 
 
 you did not know any better ignorance upon ignorance indeed 
 the poor swineherd took these words to heart for they were 
 addressed to him he knew not that there were others who were 
 equally ignorant not even a leaf of the plant could be found there 
 was one but it lay in the coffin of the dead no one knew anything 
 about it 
 
 then the king in his melancholy wandered out to the spot in 
 the wood here is where the plant stood he said it is a sacred 
 place then he ordered that the place should be surrounded with a 
 golden railing and a sentry stationed near it 
 
 the botanical professor wrote a long treatise about the heavenly 
 plant and for this he was loaded with gold which improved the 
 position of himself and his family 
 
 and this part is really the most pleasant part of the story for 
 the plant had disappeared and the king remained as melancholy and sad as ever but the sentry said he had always been so

 ion 
 by plato 
 translated by benjamin jowett 
 
 persons of the dialogue socrates ion 
 socrates welcome ion are you from your native city of ephesus 
 ion no socrates but from epidaurus where i attended the festival 
 of asclepius 
 soc and do the epidaurians have contests of rhapsodes at the 
 festival 
 ion o yes and of all sorts of musical performers 
 soc and were you one of the competitors and did you succeed 
 ion i obtained the first prize of all socrates 
 soc well done and i hope that you will do the same for us at the 
 panathenaea 
 ion and i will please heaven 
 soc i often envy the profession of a rhapsode 
 ion for you have always to wear fine clothes and to look as beautiful 
 as you can is a part of your art then again you are obliged to be 
 continually in the company of many good poets and especially of 
 homer who is the best and most divine of them and to understand 
 him and not merely learn his words by rote is a thing greatly to be 
 envied and no man can be a rhapsode who does not understand the 
 meaning of the poet for the rhapsode ought to interpret the mind of 
 the poet to his hearers but how can he interpret him well unless he 
 knows what he means all this is greatly to be envied 
 ion very true socrates interpretation has certainly been the most 
 laborious part of my art and i believe myself able to speak about 
 homer better than any man and that neither metrodorus of 
 lampsacus nor stesimbrotus of thasos nor glaucon nor any one 
 else who ever was had as good ideas about homer as i have or as 
 many 
 soc i am glad to hear you say so ion i see that you will not 
 refuse to acquaint me with them 
 ion certainly socrates and you really ought to hear how 
 exquisitely i render homer i think that the homeridae should give 
 me a golden crown 
 soc i shall take an opportunity of hearing your embellishments of 
 him at some other time but just now i should like to ask you a 
 question does your art extend to hesiod and archilochus or to 
 homer only 
 ion to homer only he is in himself quite enough 
 soc are there any things about which homer and hesiod agree 
 ion yes in my opinion there are a good many 
 soc and can you interpret better what homer says or what hesiod 
 says about these matters in which they agree 
 ion i can interpret them equally well socrates where they agree 
 soc but what about matters in which they do not agree for 
 example about divination of which both homer and hesiod have 
 something to say 
 ion very true 
 soc would you or a good prophet be a better interpreter of what 
 these two poets say about divination not only when they agree but 
 when they disagree 
 ion a prophet 
 soc and if you were a prophet would you be able to interpret 
 them when they disagree as well as when they agree 
 ion clearly 
 soc but how did you come to have this skill about homer only and 
 not about hesiod or the other poets does not homer speak of the 
 same themes which all other poets handle is not war his great 
 argument and does he not speak of human society and of 
 intercourse of men good and bad skilled and unskilled and of the 
 gods conversing with one another and with mankind and about what 
 happens in heaven and in the world below and the generations of 
 gods and heroes are not these the themes of which homer sings 
 ion very true socrates 
 soc and do not the other poets sing of the same 
 ion yes socrates but not in the same way as homer 
 soc what in a worse way 
 ion yes in a far worse 
 soc and homer in a better way 
 ion he is incomparably better 
 soc and yet surely my dear friend ion in a discussion about 
 arithmetic where many people are speaking and one speaks better 
 than the rest there is somebody who can judge which of them is the 
 good speaker 
 ion yes 
 soc and he who judges of the good will be the same as he who 
 judges of the bad speakers 
 ion the same 
 soc and he will be the arithmetician 
 ion yes 
 soc well and in discussions about the wholesomeness of food 
 when many persons are speaking and one speaks better than the rest 
 will he who recognizes the better speaker be a different person from 
 him who recognizes the worse or the same 
 ion clearly the same 
 soc and who is he and what is his name 
 ion the physician 
 soc and speaking generally in all discussions in which the subject 
 is the same and many men are speaking will not he who knows the 
 good know the bad speaker also for if he does not know the bad 
 neither will he know the good when the same topic is being 
 discussed 
 ion true 
 soc is not the same person skilful in both 
 ion yes 
 soc and you say that homer and the other poets such as hesiod 
 and archilochus speak of the same things although not in the same 
 way but the one speaks well and the other not so well 
 ion yes and i am right in saying so 
 soc and if you knew the good speaker you would also know the 
 inferior speakers to be inferior 
 ion that is true 
 soc then my dear friend can i be mistaken in saying that ion is 
 equally skilled in homer and in other poets since he himself 
 acknowledges that the same person will be a good judge of all those 
 who speak of the same things and that almost all poets do speak of 
 the same things 
 ion why then socrates do i lose attention and go to sleep and 
 have absolutely no ideas of the least value when any one speaks of 
 any other poet but when homer is mentioned i wake up at once and 
 am all attention and have plenty to say 
 soc the reason my friend is obvious no one can fail to see 
 that you speak of homer without any art or knowledge if you were 
 able to speak of him by rules of art you would have been able to 
 speak of all other poets for poetry is a whole 
 ion yes 
 soc and when any one acquires any other art as a whole the same 
 may be said of them would you like me to explain my meaning ion 
 ion yes indeed socrates i very much wish that you would for i 
 love to hear you wise men talk 
 soc o that we were wise ion and that you could truly call us 
 so but you rhapsodes and actors and the poets whose verses you 
 sing are wise whereas i am a common man who only speak the 
 truth for consider what a very commonplace and trivial thing is this 
 which i have said a thing which any man might say that when a man 
 has acquired a knowledge of a whole art the enquiry into good and 
 bad is one and the same let us consider this matter is not the art of 
 painting a whole 
 ion yes 
 soc and there are and have been many painters good and bad 
 ion yes 
 soc and did you ever know any one who was skilful in pointing out 
 the excellences and defects of polygnotus the son of aglaophon but 
 incapable of criticizing other painters and when the work of any 
 other painter was produced went to sleep and was at a loss and had 
 no ideas but when he had to give his opinion about polygnotus or 
 whoever the painter might be and about him only woke up and was 
 attentive and had plenty to say 
 ion no indeed i have never known such a person 
 soc or did you ever know of any one in sculpture who was skilful 
 in expounding the merits of daedalus the son of metion or of epeius 
 the son of panopeus or of theodorus the samian or of any 
 individual sculptor but when the works of sculptors in general were 
 produced was at a loss and went to sleep and had nothing to say 
 ion no indeed no more than the other 
 soc and if i am not mistaken you never met with any one among 
 or harp players or singers to the harp or rhapsodes who 
 was able to discourse of olympus or thamyras or orpheus or 
 phemius the rhapsode of ithaca but was at a loss when he came to 
 speak of ion of ephesus and had no notion of his merits or defects 
 ion i cannot deny what you say socrates nevertheless i am 
 conscious in my own self and the world agrees with me in thinking 
 that i do speak better and have more to say about homer than any 
 other man but i do not speak equally well about others tell me the 
 reason of this 
 soc i perceive ion and i will proceed to explain to you what i 
 imagine to be the reason of this the gift which you possess of 
 speaking excellently about homer is not an art but as i was just 
 saying an inspiration there is a divinity moving you like that 
 contained in the stone which euripides calls a magnet but which is 
 commonly known as the stone of heraclea this stone not only 
 attracts iron rings but also imparts to them a similar power of 
 attracting other rings and sometimes you may see a number of pieces 
 of iron and rings suspended from one another so as to form quite a 
 long chain and all of them derive their power of suspension from 
 the original stone in like manner the muse first of all inspires 
 men herself and from these inspired persons a chain of other 
 persons is suspended who take the inspiration for all good poets 
 epic as well as lyric compose their beautiful poems not by art but 
 because they are inspired and possessed and as the corybantian 
 revellers when they dance are not in their right mind so the lyric 
 poets are not in their right mind when they are composing their 
 beautiful strains but when falling under the power of music and metre 
 they are inspired and possessed like bacchic maidens who draw milk 
 and honey from the rivers when they are under the influence of 
 dionysus but not when they are in their right mind and the soul of 
 the lyric poet does the same as they themselves say for they tell us 
 that they bring songs from honeyed fountains culling them out of 
 the gardens and dells of the muses they like the bees winging their 
 way from flower to flower and this is true for the poet is a light 
 and winged and holy thing and there is no invention in him until he 
 has been inspired and is out of his senses and the mind is no 
 longer in him when he has not attained to this state he is powerless 
 and is unable to utter his oracles 
 many are the noble words in which poets speak concerning the 
 actions of men but like yourself when speaking about homer they 
 do not speak of them by any rules of art they are simply inspired to 
 utter that to which the muse impels them and that only and when 
 inspired one of them will make dithyrambs another hymns of praise 
 another choral strains another epic or iambic verses and he who is 
 good at one is not good any other kind of verse for not by art does 
 the poet by power divine had he learned by rules of art he 
 would have known how to speak not of one theme only but of all 
 and therefore god takes away the minds of poets and uses them as 
 his he also uses diviners and holy prophets in order that 
 we who hear them may know them to be speaking not of themselves 
 who utter these priceless words in a state of unconsciousness but 
 that god himself is the speaker and that through them he is 
 conversing with us and tynnichus the chalcidian affords a striking 
 instance of what i am saying he wrote nothing that any one would 
 care to remember but the famous paean which in every mouth 
 one of the finest poems ever written simply an invention of the 
 muses as he himself says for in this way the god would seem to 
 indicate to us and not allow us to doubt that these beautiful poems are 
 not human or the work of man but divine and the work of god and 
 that the poets are only the interpreters of the gods by whom they are 
 severally possessed was not this the lesson which the god intended 
 to teach when by the mouth of the worst of poets he sang the best of 
 songs 
 am i not right ion 
 ion yes indeed socrates i feel that you are for your words 
 touch my soul and i am persuaded that good poets by a divine 
 inspiration interpret the things of the gods to us 
 soc and you rhapsodists are the interpreters of the poets 
 ion there again you are right 
 soc then you are the interpreters of interpreters 
 ion precisely 
 soc i wish you would frankly tell me ion what i am going to ask 
 of you when you produce the greatest effect upon the audience in 
 the recitation of some striking passage such as the apparition of 
 odysseus leaping forth on the floor recognized by the suitors and 
 casting his arrows at his feet or the description of achilles rushing 
 at hector or the sorrows of andromache hecuba or priam are 
 you in your right mind are you not carried out of yourself and does 
 not your soul in an ecstasy seem to be among the persons or places 
 of which you are speaking whether they are in ithaca or in troy or 
 whatever may be the scene of the poem 
 ion that proof strikes home to me socrates for i must frankly 
 confess that at the tale of pity my eyes are filled with tears and 
 when i speak of horrors my hair stands on end and my heart throbs 
 soc well ion and what are we to say of a man who at a sacrifice 
 or festival when he is dressed in holiday attire and has golden 
 crowns upon his head of which nobody has robbed him appears 
 sweeping or in the presence of more than twenty 
 thousand friendly faces when there is no one despoiling or wronging 
 him is he in his right mind or is he not 
 ion no indeed socrates i must say that strictly speaking he 
 is not in his right mind 
 soc and are you aware that you produce similar effects on most 
 spectators 
 ion only too well for i look down upon them from the stage and 
 behold the various emotions of pity wonder sternness stamped 
 upon their countenances when i am speaking and i am obliged to 
 give my very best attention to them for if i make them cry i myself 
 shall laugh and if i make them laugh i myself shall cry when the time 
 of payment arrives 
 soc do you know that the spectator is the last of the rings 
 which as i am saying receive the power of the original magnet from 
 one another the rhapsode like yourself and the actor are 
 intermediate links and the poet himself is the first of them through 
 all these the god sways the souls of men in any direction which he 
 pleases and makes one man hang down from another thus there is a 
 vast chain of dancers and masters and undermasters of choruses 
 who are suspended as if from the stone at the side of the rings 
 which hang down from the muse and every poet has some muse 
 from whom he is suspended and by whom he is said to be 
 possessed which is nearly the same thing for he is taken hold of 
 and from these first rings which are the poets depend others some 
 deriving their inspiration from orpheus others from musaeus but the 
 greater number are possessed and held by homer of whom ion 
 you are one and are possessed by homer and when any one repeats 
 the words of another poet you go to sleep and know not what to say 
 but when any one recites a strain of homer you wake up in a moment 
 and your soul leaps within you have plenty to say for not by 
 art or knowledge about homer do you say what you say but by 
 divine inspiration and by possession 
 just as the corybantian revellers too have a quick perception of 
 that strain only which is appropriated to the god by whom they are 
 possessed and have plenty of dances and words for that but take no 
 heed of any other and you ion when the name of homer is 
 mentioned have plenty to say and have nothing to say of others you 
 ask why is this the answer is that you praise homer not by art 
 but by divine inspiration 
 ion that is good socrates and yet i doubt whether you will ever 
 have eloquence enough to persuade me that i praise homer only 
 when i am mad and possessed and if you could hear me speak of 
 him i am sure you would never think this to be the case 
 soc i should like very much to hear you but not until you have 
 answered a question which i have to ask on what part of homer do 
 you speak well not surely about every part 
 ion there is no part socrates about which i do not speak well 
 of that i can assure you 
 soc surely not about things in homer of which you have no 
 knowledge 
 ion and what is there in homer of which i have no knowledge 
 soc why does not homer speak in many passages about arts for 
 example about driving if i can only remember the lines i will repeat 
 them 
 ion i remember and will repeat them 
 soc tell me then what nestor says to antilochus his son where he 
 bids him be careful of the turn at the in honour of 
 patroclus 
 ion he says bend gently in the polished chariot to the left of them 
 and urge the horse on the right hand with whip and voice and slacken 
 the rein and when you are at the goal let the left horse draw near yet 
 so that the nave of the wheel may not even seem to 
 touch the extremity and avoid catching the stone 
 soc enough now ion will the charioteer or the physician be the 
 better judge of the propriety of these lines 
 ion the charioteer clearly 
 soc and will the reason be that this is his art or will there be 
 any other reason 
 ion no that will be the reason 
 soc and every art is appointed by god to have knowledge of a 
 certain work for that which we know by the art of the pilot we do not 
 know by the art of medicine 
 ion certainly not 
 soc nor do we know by the art of the carpenter that which we know 
 by the art of medicine 
 ion certainly not 
 soc and this is true of all the arts that which we know with 
 one art we do not know with the other but let me ask a prior 
 question you admit that there are differences of arts 
 ion yes 
 soc you would argue as i should that when one art is of one 
 kind of knowledge and another of another they are different 
 ion yes 
 soc yes surely for if the subject of knowledge were the same 
 there would be no meaning in saying that the arts were different 
 if they both gave the same knowledge for example i know that here 
 are five fingers and you know the same and if i were to ask 
 whether i and you became acquainted with this fact by the help of 
 the same art of arithmetic you would acknowledge that we did 
 ion yes 
 soc tell me then what i was intending to ask you whether this 
 holds universally must the same art have the same subject of 
 knowledge and different arts other subjects of knowledge 
 ion that is my opinion socrates 
 soc then he who has no knowledge of a particular art will have no 
 right judgment of the sayings and doings of that art 
 ion very true 
 soc then which will be a better judge of the lines which you were 
 reciting from homer you or the charioteer 
 ion the charioteer 
 soc why yes because you are a rhapsode and not a charioteer 
 ion yes 
 soc and the art of the rhapsode is different from that of the 
 charioteer 
 ion yes 
 soc and if a different knowledge then a knowledge of different 
 matters 
 ion true 
 soc you know the passage in which hecamede the concubine of 
 nestor is described as giving to the wounded machaon a posset as 
 he says made with pramnian wine and she grated cheese of 
 milk with a grater of bronze and at his side placed an onion which 
 gives a relish to drink 
 now would you say that the art of the rhapsode or the art of 
 medicine was better able to judge of the propriety of these lines 
 ion the art of medicine 
 soc and when homer says 
 and she descended into the deep like a leaden plummet which set in 
 the horn of ox that ranges in the fields rushes along carrying 
 death among the ravenous fishes 
 will the art of the fisherman or of the rhapsode be better able to 
 judge whether these lines are rightly expressed or not 
 ion clearly socrates the art of the fisherman 
 soc come now suppose that you were to say to me since you 
 socrates are able to assign different passages in homer to their 
 corresponding arts i wish that you would tell me what are the 
 passages of which the excellence ought to be judged by the prophet 
 and prophetic art and you will see how readily and truly i shall 
 answer you for there are many such passages particularly in the 
 odyssey as for example the passage in which theoclymenus the 
 prophet of the house of melampus says to the suitors 
 wretched men what is happening to you your heads and your faces 
 and your limbs underneath are shrouded in night and the voice of 
 lamentation bursts forth and your cheeks are wet with tears and 
 the vestibule is full and the court is full of ghosts descending 
 into the darkness of erebus and the sun has perished out of heaven 
 and an evil mist is spread abroad 
 and there are many such passages in the iliad also as for example 
 in the description of the battle near the rampart where he says 
 as they were eager to pass the ditch there came to them an omen 
 a soaring eagle holding back the people on the left bore a huge 
 bloody dragon in his talons still living and panting nor had he 
 yet resigned the strife for he bent back and smote the bird which 
 carried him on the breast by the neck and he in pain let him fall 
 from him to the ground into the midst of the multitude and the eagle 
 with a cry was borne afar on the wings of the wind 
 these are the sort of things which i should say that the prophet 
 ought to consider and determine 
 ion and you are quite right socrates in saying so 
 soc yes ion and you are right also and as i have selected from 
 the iliad and odyssey for you passages which describe the office of 
 the prophet and the physician and the fisherman do you who know 
 homer so much better than i do ion select for me passages which 
 relate to the rhapsode and the art and which the 
 rhapsode ought to examine and judge of better than other men 
 ion all passages i should say socrates 
 soc not all ion surely have you already forgotten what you 
 were saying a rhapsode ought to have a better memory 
 ion why what am i forgetting 
 soc do you not remember that you declared the art of the rhapsode 
 to be different from the art of the charioteer 
 ion yes i remember 
 soc and you admitted that being different they would have different 
 subjects of knowledge 
 ion yes 
 soc then upon your own showing the rhapsode and the art of the 
 rhapsode will not know everything 
 ion i should exclude certain things socrates 
 soc you mean to say that you would exclude pretty much the 
 subjects of the other arts as he does not know all of them which of 
 them will he know 
 ion he will know what a man and what a woman ought to say and 
 what a freeman and what a slave ought to say and what a ruler and 
 what a subject 
 soc do you mean that a rhapsode will know better than the pilot 
 what the ruler of a vessel ought to say 
 ion no the pilot will know best 
 soc or will the rhapsode know better than the physician what the 
 ruler of a sick man ought to say 
 ion he will not 
 soc but he will know what a slave ought to say 
 ion yes 
 soc suppose the slave to be a cowherd the rhapsode will know 
 better than the cowherd what he ought to say in order to soothe the 
 infuriated cows 
 ion no he will not 
 soc but he will know what a ought to say about the 
 working of wool 
 ion no 
 soc at any rate he will know what a general ought to say when 
 exhorting his soldiers 
 ion yes that is the sort of thing which the rhapsode will be 
 sure to know 
 soc well but is the art of the rhapsode the art of the general 
 ion i am sure that i should know what a general ought to say 
 soc why yes ion because you may possibly have a knowledge of 
 the art of the general as well as of the rhapsode and you may also 
 have a knowledge of horsemanship as well as of the lyre and then 
 you would know when horses were well or ill managed but suppose 
 i were to ask you by the help of which art ion do you know 
 whether horses are well managed by your skill as a horseman or as a 
 performer on the lyre what would you answer 
 ion i should reply by my skill as a horseman 
 soc and if you judged of performers on the lyre you would admit 
 that you judged of them as a performer on the lyre and not as a 
 horseman 
 ion yes 
 soc and in judging of the art do you judge of it as a 
 general or a rhapsode 
 ion to me there appears to be no difference between them 
 soc what do you mean do you mean to say that the art of the 
 rhapsode and of the general is the same 
 ion yes one and the same 
 soc then he who is a good rhapsode is also a good general 
 ion certainly socrates 
 soc and he who is a good general is also a good rhapsode 
 ion no i do not say that 
 soc but you do say that he who is a good rhapsode is also a good 
 general 
 ion certainly 
 soc and you are the best of hellenic rhapsodes 
 ion far the best socrates 
 soc and are you the best general ion 
 ion to be sure socrates and homer was my master 
 soc but then ion what in the name of goodness can be the reason 
 why you who are the best of generals as well as the best of 
 rhapsodes in all hellas go about as a rhapsode when you might be a 
 general 
 do you think that the hellenes want a rhapsode with his golden 
 crown and do not want a general 
 ion why socrates the reason is that my countrymen the 
 ephesians are the servants and soldiers of athens and do not need 
 a general and you and sparta are not likely to have me for you think 
 that you have enough generals of your own 
 soc my good ion did you never hear of apollodorus of cyzicus 
 ion who may he be 
 soc one who though a foreigner has often been chosen their 
 general by the athenians and there is phanosthenes of andros and 
 heraclides of clazomenae whom they have also appointed to the 
 command of their armies and to other offices although aliens after 
 they had shown their merit and will they not choose ion the 
 ephesian to be their general and honour him if he prove himself 
 worthy were not the ephesians originally athenians and ephesus is 
 no mean city 
 but indeed ion if you are correct in saying that by art and 
 knowledge you are able to praise homer you do not deal fairly with 
 me and after all your professions of knowing many glorious things 
 about homer and promises that you would exhibit them you are 
 only a deceiver and so far from exhibiting the art of which you are a 
 master will not even after my repeated entreaties explain to me the 
 nature of it you have literally as many forms as proteus and now 
 you go all manner of ways twisting and turning and like proteus 
 become all manner of people at once and at last slip away from me in 
 the disguise of a general in order that you may escape exhibiting your 
 homeric lore and if you have art then as i was saying in 
 falsifying your promise that you would exhibit homer you are not 
 dealing fairly with me but if as i believe you have no art but 
 speak all these beautiful words about homer unconsciously under his 
 inspiring influence then i acquit you of dishonesty and shall only 
 say that you are inspired which do you prefer to be thought 
 dishonest or inspired 
 ion there is a great difference socrates between the two 
 alternatives and inspiration is by far the nobler 
 soc then ion i shall assume the nobler alternative and attribute 
 to you in your praises of homer inspiration and not art 
 the end

 of revenge 
 revenge is a kind of wild justice which the more nature runs to the more ought law to weed it out for as for the first wrong it doth but offend the law but the revenge of that wrong putteth the law out of office certainly in taking revenge a man is but even with his enemy but in passing it over he is superior for it is a part to pardon and solomon i am sure saith it is the glory of a man to pass by an offence that which is past is gone and irrevocable and wise men have enough to do with things present and to come therefore they do but trifle with themselves that labour in past matters there is no man doth a wrong for the sake but thereby to purchase himself profit or pleasure or honour or the like therefore why should i be angry with a man for loving himself better than me 
 and if any man should do wrong merely out of ill nature why yet it is but like 
 the thorn or briar which prick and scratch because they can do no other the most tolerable sort of revenge is for those wrongs which there is no law to remedy but then let a man take heed the revenge be such as there is no law to punish else a enemy is still before hand and it is two for one some when they take revenge are desirous the party should know whence it cometh this is the more generous for the delight seemeth to be not so much in doing the hurt as in making the party repent but base and crafty cowards are like the arrow that flieth in the dark cosmus duke of florence had a desperate saying against perfidious or neglecting friends as if those wrongs were unpardonable you shall read saith he mat we are commanded to forgive our enemies but you never read that we are commanded to forgive our friends but yet the spirit of job was in a better tune shall we saith he take good at hands and not be content to take evil also and so of friends in a proportion this is certain that a man that studieth revenge keeps his own wounds green which otherwise would heal and do well public revenges are for the most part fortunate as that for the death of caesar for the death of pertinax for the death of henry the third of france and many more but in private revenges it is not so nay rather vindictive persons live the life of witches who as they are mischievous so end they unfortunate

 book just man 
 chapter iii 
 
 a hard bishopric for a good bishop 
 the bishop did not omit his pastoral visits because he had converted his carriage into alms 
 the diocese of d is a fatiguing one there are very few plains and a great many mountains hardly any roads as we have just seen curacies vicarships and two hundred and auxiliary chapels 
 to visit all these is quite a task 
 the bishop managed to do it 
 he went on foot when it was in the neighborhood in a tilted when it was on the plain and on a donkey in the mountains 
 the two old women accompanied him when the trip was too hard for them he went alone 
 one day he arrived at senez which is an ancient episcopal city he was mounted on an ass 
 his purse which was very dry at that moment did not permit him any other equipage 
 the mayor of the town came to receive him at the gate of the town and watched him dismount from his ass with scandalized eyes 
 some of the citizens were laughing around him 
 monsieur the mayor said the bishop and messieurs citizens i perceive that i shock you 
 you think it very arrogant in a poor priest to ride an animal which was used by jesus christ 
 i have done so from necessity i assure you and not from vanity 
 in the course of these trips he was kind and indulgent and talked rather than preached 
 he never went far in search of his arguments and his examples 
 he quoted to the inhabitants of one district the example of a neighboring district 
 in the cantons where they were harsh to the poor he said 
 look at the people of briancon they have conferred on the poor on widows and orphans the right to have their meadows mown three days in advance of every one else they rebuild their houses for them gratuitously when they are ruined therefore it is a country which is blessed by god 
 for a whole century there has not been a single murderer among them 
 in villages which were greedy for profit and harvest he said look at the people of embrun 
 if at the harvest season the father of a family has his son away on service in the army and his daughters at service in the town and if he is ill and incapacitated the cure recommends him to the prayers of the congregation and on sunday after the mass all the inhabitants of the women and to the poor field and do his harvesting for him and carry his straw and his grain to his granary to families divided by questions of money and inheritance he said look at the mountaineers of devolny a country so wild that the nightingale is not heard there once in fifty years 
 well when the father of a family dies the boys go off to seek their fortunes leaving the property to the girls so that they may find husbands to the cantons which had a taste for lawsuits and where the farmers ruined themselves in stamped paper he said 
 look at those good peasants in the valley of queyras 
 there are three thousand souls of them mon dieu it is like a little republic 
 neither judge nor bailiff is known there 
 the mayor does everything 
 he allots the imposts taxes each person conscientiously judges quarrels for nothing divides inheritances without charge pronounces sentences gratuitously and he is obeyed because he is a just man among simple men to villages where he found no schoolmaster he quoted once more the people of queyras 
 do you know how they manage he said 
 since a little country of a dozen or fifteen hearths cannot always support a teacher they have who are paid by the whole valley who make the round of the villages spending a week in this one ten days in that and instruct them 
 these teachers go to the fairs i have seen them there 
 they are to be recognized by the quill pens which they wear in the cord of their hat 
 those who teach reading only have one pen those who teach reading and reckoning have two pens those who teach reading reckoning and latin have three pens 
 but what a disgrace to be ignorant 
 do like the people of queyras 
 thus he discoursed gravely and paternally in default of examples he invented parables going directly to the point with few phrases and many images which characteristic formed the real eloquence of jesus christ 
 and being convinced himself he was persuasive

 she staggers up steps after him stopping by a door as joe goes to unlock his one a few steps up in her stupor she raises her hand and is about to knock on the door when joe sees her running over to catch her hand just in time he leads her to the door and unlocks it he goes in and turns on the light

 a new hope 
 iii 
 
 the burnished conference table was as soulless and unyielding as the mood of theeight imperial senators and officers ranged around it imperial troopers stood guardat the entrance to the chamber which was sparse and coldly lit from lights in the tableand walks one of the youngest of the eight was declaiming he exhibited theattitude of one who had climbed far and fast by methods best not examined tooclosely general tagge did possess a certain twisted genius but it was only partlythat ability which had lifted him to his present exalted position other noisometalents had proven equally efficacious 
 though his uniform was as neatly molded and his body as cleans as that ofanyone else in the room none of the remaining seven cared to touch him a certainsliminess clung cloyingly to him a sensation inferred rather than tactile despitethis many respected him or feared him 
 i tell you gone too far this time the general was insisting is sith lord inflicted on us at the urging of the emperor will be our the battle station is fully operational we remain vulnerable 
 some of you still seem to realize how well equipped and organized therebel alliance is their vessel are excellent their pilots better and they arepropelled by something more powerful than mere engines this perverse reactionaryfanaticism of theirs more dangerous than most of you realize 
 an older officer with facial scars so deeply engraved that even the best cosmeticsurgery could not fully repair them shifted nervously in his chair dangerous toyour starfleet general tagge but not to this battle station wizened eyes hoppedfrom man to man traveling around the table i happen to think lord vader knowswhat doing the rebellion will continue only as long as those cowards have asanctuary a place where their pilots can relax and their machines can be repaired 
 tagge objected i beg to differ with you romodi i think the construction ofthis station has more to do with governor bid for personal power andrecognition than with any justifiable military strategy within the senate the rebelswill continue to increase their support as long 
 the sound of the single doorway sliding aside and the guards snapping toattention cut him off his head turned as did everyone 
 two individuals as different in appearance as they were united in objective hadentered the chamber the nearest to tagge was a thin man with hairand form borrowed from an old broom and the expression of a quiescent grand moff tarkin governor of numerous outlying imperial territories wasdwarfed by broad armored bulk of lord darth vader 
 tagge unintimidated but subdued slowly resumed his seat as tarkin assumedhis place at the end of the conference table vader stood next to him a dominatingpresence behind the chair for a minute tarkin stared directly at glanced away as if he had seen nothing tagge fumed but remained silent 
 as gaze roved around the table a smile of satisfactionremained frozen in his features the imperial senate will no longer be of anyconcern to us gentlemen i have just receive word that the emperor haspermanently dissolved that misguided body 
 a ripple of astonishment ran through the assembly the last remnants tarkincontinued of the old republic have finally been swept away 
 this is impossible tagge interjected how will the emperor maintaincontrol of the imperial 
 senatorial representation has not been formally abolished you mustunderstand tarkin explained it has merely been superseded for the he smileda bit of the emergency regional governors will now have directcontrol and a free hand in administering their territories this means that theimperial presence can at last be brought to bear properly on the vacillating worlds ofthe empire from now on fear will keep potentially traitorous local government inline fear of the imperial fear of this battle station 
 and what of the existing rebellion tagge wanted to know 
 if the rebels somehow managed to gain access to a complete technical schemaof this battle station it is remotely possible that they might be able to locate aweakness susceptible to minor exploitation smile shifted to a smirk ofcourse we all know how well guarded how carefully protected such vital data is itcould not possibly fall into rebel hands 
 the technical data to which you are obliquely referring rumbled darth vaderangrily will soon be back in our hands if 
 tarkin shook the dark lord off something no one else at the table would havedared to do it is immaterial any attack made against this station by the rebelswould be a suicidal gesture suicidal and of any information theymanaged to obtain after many long years of secretive construction he declaredwith evident pleasure this station has become the decisive force in this part of theuniverse events in this region of the galaxy will no longer be determined by decree or by any other agency they will be decided by this station 
 a huge hand gestured slightly and one of the filled cups on the tabledrifted responsively into it with a slightly admonishing tone the dark lordcontinued become too proud of this technological terror the ability to destroy a city a world a whole system is still insignificantwhen set against the force 
 the force tagge sneered try to frighten us with your vader your sad devotion to that ancient mythology has not helped you toconjure up those stolen tapes or gifted you with clairvoyance sufficient to locate hidden fortress why enough to make one laugh fit to 
 eyes abruptly bulged and his hands went to his throat as he began to turna disconcerting shade of blue 
 i find vader ventured mildly this lack of faith disturbing 
 enough of this tarkin snapped distressed vader release him thisbickering among ourselves is pointless 
 vader shrugged as if it were of no consequence tagge slumped in his his throat his wary gaze never leaving the dark giant 
 lord vader will provide us with the location of the rebel fortress by the timethis station is certified operational tarkin declared that known we will proceedto it and destroy it utterly crushing this pathetic rebellion in one swift stoke 
 as the emperor wills it vader added not without sarcasm so shall it be 
 if any of the powerful men seated around the table found this disrespectful toneobjectionable a glance at tagge was sufficient to dissuade them from mentioning it 
 the dim prison reeked of rancid oil and stale lubricants a veritable metalliccharnel house threepio endured the discomfiting atmosphere as best he could itwas a constant battle to avoid being thrown by every unexpected bounce into thewalls or into a fellow machine 
 to conserve also to avoid the steady stream of complaints from histaller detoo had shut down all exterior functions he lay inertamong a pile of secondary parts sublimely unconcerned at the moment as to their fate 
 will this never end threepio was moaning as another violent jolt roughlyjostled the inhabitants of the prison he had already formulated and discarded half ahundred horrible ends he was certain only that their eventual disposition was sureto be worse than anything he could imagine 
 then quite without warning something more unsettling than even the mostbattering bump took place the whine died and the vehicle came to as if in response to query a nervous buzz rose from thosemechanicals who still retained a semblance of sentience as they speculated on theirpresent location and probable fate 
 at least threepio was no longer ignorant of his captors or of their likely captives had explained the nature of the mechanic migrants thejawas traveling in their enormous mobile they scoured the mostinhospitable regions of tatooine in search of valuable salvageablemachinery they had never been seen outside of their protective cloaks andsandmasks so no one knew exactly what they looked like but they were reputed tobe extraordinarily ugly threepio did not have to be convinced 
 leaning over his companion he began a steady shaking of torso epidermal sensors were activated on the artoo unit and the lightson the front side of the little robot began a sequential awakening 
 wake up wake up threepio urged stopped someplace likeseveral of the other more imaginative robots his eyes were warily scanning metalwalls expecting a hidden panel to slide aside at any moment and a giant mechanicalarm to come probing and fumbling for him 
 no doubt about it doomed he recited mournfully as artoo rightedhimself returning to full activation do you think melt us down hebecame silent for several minutes then added this waiting that gets to the far wall of the chamber slid aside and the blinding white glare of atatooine morning rushed in on them sensitive photoreceptors were hardpressed to adjust in time to prevent serious damage 
 several of the jawas scrambled agilely into the chamber stilldressed in the same swathing and filth threepio had observed on them hard weapons of an unknown design they prodded at the machines certainof them threepio noted with a mental swallow did not stir 
 ignoring the immobile ones the jawas herded those still capable of movementoutside artoo and threepio among them both robots found themselves part of anuneven mechanical line 
 shielding his eyes against the glare threepio saw that five of them werearranged alongside the huge sandcrawler thoughts of escape did not enter his a concept was utterly alien to a mechanical the more intelligent a robot more abhorrent and unthinkable the concept besides had he tried to sensors would have detected the critical logic malfunction and melted everycircuit in his brain 
 instead he studied the small domes and vaporators that indicated the presence ofa larger underground human homestead though he was unfamiliar with this type ofconstruction all signs pointed to a modest if isolated habitation thoughts of beingdismembered for parts or slaving in some mine slowly faded hisspirits rose correspondingly 
 maybe this be so bad after all he murmured hopefully if we canconvince these bipedal vermin to unload us here we may enter into sensible humanservice again instead of being melted into slag 
 sole reply was a noncommittal chirp both machines became silent asthe jawas commenced scurrying around them striving to straighten one poor machinewith a badly bent spine to disguise a dent or scrape with liquid and dust 
 as two of them bustled about working on his skin threepio foughtto stifle an expression of disgust one of his many functions was theability to react naturally to offensive odors apparently hygiene was unknownamong the jawas but he was certain no good would come of pointing this out tothem 
 small insects drifted in clouds about the faces of the jawas who ignored the tiny individualized plagues were regarded as just a different sort ofappendage like an extra arm or leg 
 so intent was threepio on his observation that he failed to notice the two figuresmoving toward them from the region of the largest dome artoo had to nudge himslightly before he looked up 
 the first man wore an air of grim exhaustion sandblasted intohis face by too many years of arguing with a hostile environment his graying hairwas frozen in tangled twists like gypsum helicites dust frosted his face and thoughts but the body if not the spirit was still powerful 
 proportionately dwarfed by his body luke strode in his shadow his present attitude one of dejection rather than had a great deal on his mind and it had very little to do with farming mostly itinvolved the rest of his life and the commitment made by his best friend who hadrecently departed beyond the blue sky above to enter a harsher yet more rewardingcareer 
 the bigger man stopped before the assembly and entered into a peculiar squeakydialogue with the jawa in charge when they wished it the jawas could beunderstood 
 luke stood nearby listening indifferently then he shuffled along behind hisuncle as the latter began inspecting the five machines pausing only to mutter anoccasional word or two to his nephew it was hard to pay attention even though heknew he ought to be learning 
 luke a voice called 
 turning away from the conversation which consisted of the lead jawa extollingthe unmatched virtues of all five machines and his uncle countering with walked over to the near edge of the subterranean courtyard and peered down 
 a stout woman with the expression of a misplaced sparrow was busy workingamong decorative plants she looked up at him be sure and tell owen that if hebuys a translator to make sure it speaks bocce luke 
 turning luke looked back over his shoulder and studied the motley collection oftired machines it looks like we have much of a choice he called back downto her but remind him anyway 
 she nodded up at him and he turned to rejoin his uncle 
 apparently owen lars had already come to a decision having settled on a robot this one was similar in shape to artoo detoo save that itsmultiple subsidiary arms were tipped with different functions at an order it hadstepped out of the line and was wobbling along behind owen and the temporarilysubdued jawa 
 proceeding to the end of the line the eyes narrowed as he concentratedon the but still flashy bronze finish of the tall humanoid threepio 
 i presume you function he grumbled at the robot do you know customsand protocol 
 do i know protocol threepio echoed as the farmer looked him up and was determined to embarrass the jawa when it came to selling his i know protocol why my primary function i am also well 
 need a protocol droid the farmer snapped dryly 
 i blame you sir threepio rapidly agreed i be more inagreement what could be more of a wasteful luxury in a climate like this forsomeone of your interests sir a protocol droid would be a useless waste of is my middle name see vee for service been programmed for over thirty secondary functions that requireonly 
 i need the farmer broke in demonstrating imperious disregard for yet unenumerated secondary functions a droid that knows something aboutbinary language of independently programmable moisture vaporators 
 vaporators we are both in luck threepio countered my first assignment was in programming binary load lifters very similar inconstruction and to your vaporators you could almost say 
 luke tapped his uncle on the shoulder and whispered something in his uncle nodded then looked back at the attentive threepio again 
 do you speak bocce 
 of course sir threepio replied confident for a change with a wholly honestanswer like a second language to me as fluent in bocce as 
 the farmer appeared determined never to allow him to conclude a up owen lars looked down at the jawa take this one too 
 shutting up sir responded threepio quickly hard put to conceal his glee atbeing selected 
 take them down to the garage luke his uncle instructed him i want you tohave both of them cleaned up by suppertime 
 luke looked askance at his uncle but i was going into tosche station to pickup some new power converters and 
 lie to me luke his uncle warned him sternly i mind youwasting time with your idle friends but only after finished your chores nowhop to before supper mind 
 downcast luke directed his words irritably to threepio and the smallagricultural robot he knew better than to argue with his uncle 
 follow me you two they started for the garage as owen entered into pricenegotiations with the jawa 
 other jawas were leading the three remaining machines back into thesandcrawler when something let out an almost pathetic beep luke turned to see aartoo unit breaking formation and starting toward him it was immediatelyrestrained by a jawa wielding a control device that activated the disk sealed on front plate 
 luke studied the rebellious droid curiously threepio started to say the circumstances and thought better of it instead he remained straight ahead 
 a minute later something pinged sharply nearby glancing down luke sawthat a head plate had popped off the top of the agricultural droid a grinding noisewas coming from within a second later the machine was throwing internalcomponents all over the sandy ground 
 leaning close luke peered inside the expectorating mechanical he called owen the on this cultivator unit is shot reached in tried to adjust the device and pulled away hurriedly when it began awild sparking the odor of crisped insulation and corroded circuitry filled the cleardesert air with a pungency redolent of mechanized death 
 owen lars glared down at the nervous jawa what kind of junk are you tryingto push on us 
 the jawa responded loudly indignantly while simultaneously taking a couple ofprecautionary steps away from the big human he was distressed that the man wasbetween him and the soothing safely of the sandcrawler 
 meanwhile artoo detoo had scuttled out of the group of machines being ledback toward the mobile fortress doing so turned out to be simple enough since allthe jawas had their attention focused on the argument between their leader and 
 lacking sufficient armature for wild gesticulation the artoo unit suddenly letout a high whistle then broke it off when it was apparent he had gained 
 tapping luke gently on the shoulder the tall droid whispered conspiratoriallyinto his ear if i might say so young sir that artoo unit is a real bargain in topcondition i believe these creatures have any idea what good shape reallyin let all the sand and dust deceive you 
 luke was in the habit of making instant good or owen he called 
 breaking off the argument without taking his attention from the jawa his uncleglanced quickly at him luke gestured toward artoo detoo we want anytrouble what about swapping this he indicated the that one 
 the older man studied the artoo unit professionally then considered the inherently cowards the tiny desert scavengers could be pushed too far thesandcrawler could flatten the the risk of inciting the humancommunity to lethal vengeance 
 faced with a situation for wither side if he pressed too hard owenresumed the argument for sake before gruffly assenting the head jawaconsented reluctantly to the trade and both sides breathed a mental sigh of relief thathostilities had been avoided while the jawa bowed and whined with impatientgreed owen paid him off 
 meanwhile luke had led the two robots toward an opening in the dry few seconds later they were striding down a ramp kept clear of drifting sand byelectrostatic repellers 
 you ever forget this threepio muttered to artoo leaning over thesmaller machine why i stick my neck out for you when all you ever bring me istrouble is beyond my capacity to comprehend 
 the passage widened into garage proper which was cluttered with tools andsections of farming machinery many looked heavily used some to the point ofcollapse but the lights were comforting to both droid and there was a hominess tothe chamber which hinted at a tranquillity not experienced by either machine for along time near the center of the garage was a large tub and the aroma drifting fromit made principal olfactory sensors twitch 
 luke grinned noting the reaction yes a lubrication bath heeyed the tall bronze robot appraisingly and from the looks of it you could useabout a submergence but we afford that so have to settle for anafternoon then luke turned his attention to artoo detoo walking up to him andflipping open a panel that shielded numerous gauges 
 as for you he continued with a whistle of surprise i know how running not surprising knowing the jawas reluctance to part with any they have to recharge time for you he gestured toward a largepower unit 
 artoo detoo followed gesture then beeped once and waddled over theboxy construction finding the proper cord he automatically flipped open a paneland plugged the triple prongs into his face 
 threepio had walked over to the large cistern which was filled almost full witharomatic cleansing oil with a remarkably humanlike sigh he lowered himselfslowly into the tank 
 you two behave yourselves luke cautioned them as he moved to a small sky hopper a powerful little suborbital spacecraft it rested in the hangarsection of the got work of my own to do 
 unfortunately energies were still focused on his farewell encounter withbiggs so that hours later he had finished few of his chores thinking about departure luke was running a caressing hand over the damaged port fin ofthe fin he had damaged while running down an imaginary tie fighter inthe wrenching twists and turns of a narrow canyon that was when the projectingledge had clipped him as effectively as an energy beam 
 abruptly something came to a boil within him with atypical violence he threwa power wrench across a worktable nearby it just fair he declared to no onein particular his voice dropped disconsolately biggs is right never get outof here planning rebellion against the empire and trapped on a blight of afarm 
 i beg your pardon sir 
 luke spun startled but it was only the tall droid threepio the contrast in therobot was striking compared with initial sight of him alloygleamed in the overhead lights of the garage cleaned of pits and dust by the powerfuloils 
 is there anything i might do to help the robot asked solicitously 
 luke studied the machine and as he did so some of his anger drained was no point in yelling cryptically at a robot 
 i doubt it he replied unless you can alter time and speed up the harvest orelse teleport me off this sandpile under uncle nose 
 sarcasm was difficult for even an extremely sophisticated robot to detect sothreepio considered the question objectively before finally replying i think only a droid and not very knowledgeable about such things astransatomic physics suddenly the events of the past couple of days seemed tocatch up with him all at once as a matter of fact young sir threepio went onwhile looking around him with fresh vision not even sure which planet on 
 luke chuckled sardonically and assumed a mocking pose if brightcenter to this universe on the world farthest from it 
 yes luke sir 
 the youth shook his head irritably never mind the just this world is called tatooine 
 threepio nodded slightly thank you luke i am see relations specialist he jerked a casual metal thumb back toward therecharge unit that is my companion artoo detoo 
 pleased to meet you threepio luke said easily you too across the garage he checked a gauge on the smaller front the charge cord he saw something which made him frown and lean close 
 something wrong luke threepio inquired 
 luke went to a nearby tool wall and selected a small device know yet threepio 
 returning to the recharger luke bent over artoo and began scraping at severalbumps in the small top with a chromed pick occasionally he jerked backsharply as bits of corrosion were flicked into the air by the tiny tool 
 threepio watched interested as luke worked a lot of strange carbonscoring here of a seen a lot of action out of the ordinary 
 indeed sir threepio admitted forgetting to drop the honorific this timeluke was too absorbed elsewhere to correct him sometimes amazed inas good shape as we are he added as an afterthought while still shying away fromthe thrust of question what with the rebellion and all 
 despite his caution it seemed to threepio that he must have given somethingaway for an almost blaze appeared in eyes you know about therebellion against the empire he demanded 
 in a way threepio confessed reluctantly the rebellion was responsible forour coming into your service we are refugees you se he did not add fromwhere 
 not that luke appeared to care refugees then i did see a space rambled on rapidly excited tell me where how manyencounters how is the rebellion going does the empire take it seriously haveyou seen many ships destroyed 
 a bit slower please sir threepio pleaded you misinterpret our were innocent bystanders our involvement with the rebellion was of the mostmarginal nature 
 as to battles we were in several i think it is difficult to tell when one is notdirectly in contact with the actual battle machinery he shrugged neatly beyondthat there is not much to say remember sir i am little more than a cosmeticizedinterpreter and not very good at telling stories or relating histories and even lessproficient at embellishing them i am a very literal machine 
 luke turned away disappointed and returned to his cleaning of artoo scraping turned up something puzzling enough to demand his full small metal fragment was tightly lodged between two bar conduits that wouldnormally form a linkage setting down the delicate pick luke switched to a largerinstrument 
 well my little friend he murmured got something jammed in herereal good as he pushed and pried luke directed half his attention to you on a star freighter or was it 
 metal gave way with a powerful crack and the recoil sent luke tumbling headover heels getting to his feet he started to froze motionless 
 the front of the artoo unit had begun to glow exuding a less than of a meter square but precisely defined the portraitformed within the box was so exquisite that in a couple of minutes luke discoveredhe was out of he had forgotten to breath 
 despite a superficial sharpness the image flickered and jiggled unsteadily as ifthe recording had been made and installed with haste luke stared at the foreigncolors being projected into the prosaic atmosphere of the garage and started to form aquestion but it was never finished the lips on the figure moved and the rather seemed to speak luke knew the aural accompaniment wasgenerated somewhere within artoo squat torso 
 kenobi the voice implored huskily help me my onlyremaining hope a burst of static dissolved the face momentarily then itcoalesced again and once more the voice repeated kenobi my onlyremaining hope 
 with a raspy hum the hologram continued luke sat perfectly still for a longmoment considering what he was seeing then he blinked and directed his words tothe artoo unit 
 this all about artoo detoo 
 the stubby droid shifted slightly the cubish portrait shifting with him andbeeped what sounded vaguely like a sheepish reply 
 threepio appeared as mystified as luke what is that he inquired at the speaking portrait and then at luke you were asked a and who is that and how are you originating why 
 the artoo unit generated a beep of surprise for all the world as if just noticingthe hologram this was followed by a whistling stream of information 
 threepio digested the data tried to frown and strove to convey his ownconfusion via the tone of his voice he insist nothing sir merely data a tape that should have been erased but was missed heinsists we pay it no mind 
 that was like telling luke to ignore a cache of durindfires he might stumbleover in the desert who is she he demanded staring enraptured at the beautiful 
 i really know who she is threepio confessed honestly i think shemight have been a passenger on our last voyage from what i recall she was apersonage of some importance this might have something to do with the fact thatour captain was attach to 
 luke cut him off savoring the way sensuous lips formed and reformed thesentence fragment is there any more to this recording it sounds like getting to his feet luke reached out for the artoo unit 
 the robot moved backward and produced whistles of such frantic concern thatluke hesitated and held off reaching for the internal controls 
 threepio was shocked behave yourself artoo he finally chastised hiscompanion going to get us into trouble he had vision of the both ofthem being packed up as uncooperative and shipped back to the jawas which wasenough to make him imitate a shudder 
 all our master now threepio indicated luke you cantrust him i feel that he has our best interests in mind 
 detoo appeared to hesitate uncertain then he whistled and beeped a longcomplexity at his friend 
 well luke prompted impatiently 
 threepio paused before replying he says that he is the property of one kenobi a resident of this world of this very region in fact the sentencefragment we are hearing is part of a private message intended for this person 
 threepio shook his head slowly quite frankly sir i know what about our last master was captain colton i never heard artoo mention aprior master certainly never heard of an kenobi but with all through he concluded apologetically afraid his logic circuits have gottena bit scrambled become decidedly eccentric at times and while lukeconsidered this turn of events threepio took the opportunity to throw artoo a furiouslook of warning 
 kenobi luke recited thoughtfully his expression suddenlybrightened sayi wonder if he could be referring to old ben kenobi 
 begging your pardon threepio gulped astonished beyond measure but youactually know of such a person 
 not exactly he admitted in a more subdued voice i know anyonenamed old ben lives somewhere out on the fringe of the western dunesea kind of a local hermit uncle owen and a few of the otherfarmers say a sorcerer 
 he comes around once in a while to trade things i hardly ever talk to my uncle usually runs him off he paused and glanced across at thesmall robot again but i never heard that old ben owned a droid of any kind atleast none that i ever heard tell of 
 gaze was drawn irresistibly back to the hologram i wonder who she must be if what you told me just now is true sounds and looks as if in some kind of trouble maybe the message isimportant we ought to hear the rest of it 
 he reached again for the internal controls and the robot scurriedbackward again squeaking a blue streak 
 he says a restraining separator bolt circuiting out his components threepio translated he suggests that if you move thebolt he might be able to repeat the entire message threepio finished luke continued to stare at the portrait threepio added more loudly sir 
 luke shook himself what oh yes he considered the he moved and peered into the open panel this time artoo retreat 
 i see it i think well i guess too small to run away from me if i takethis off i wonder what someone would be sending a message to old ben for 
 selecting the proper tool luke reached down into the exposed circuitry andpopped the restraining bolt free the first noticeable result of this action was thatthe portrait disappeared 
 luke stood back there now there was an uncomfortable pause duringwhich the hologram showed no sign of returning where did she go lukefinally prompted make her come back play the entire message artoo detoo 
 an beep came from the robot threepio appearedembarrassed and nervous as he translated he said what message 
 attention turned half angrily to his companion what know what message the one you just played a fragment of for us the hauling around inside tour recalcitrant innards you stubborn bunkof junk 
 artoo sat and hummed softly to himself 
 sorry sir threepio said slowly but he shows signs of having developedan alarming flutter in his module perhaps if we 
 a voice from down a corridor interrupted him lukeoh todinner 
 luke hesitated then rose and turned away from the puzzling little he called coming aunt beru he lowered his voice as he spoke tothreepio see what you can do with him be back soon tossing the restraining bolt on the workbench he hurried from the chamber 
 as soon as the human was gone threepio whirled on his shorter better consider playing that whole recording for him he growled withsuggestive nod toward a workbench laden with dismembered machine liable to take up that cleaning pick again and go digging for it hemight not be too careful what he cuts through if he believes deliberatelywithholding something from him 
 a plaintive beep came from artoo 
 no threepio responded i think he likes you at all 
 a second beep failed to alter the stern tone in the taller voice no like you either

 book one 
 chapter iv 
 
 just them another visitor entered the drawing room prince andrew bolkonski the little princess husband he was a very handsome young man of medium height with firm clearcut features everything about him from his weary bored expression to his quiet measured step offered a most striking contrast to his quiet little wife it was evident that he not only knew everyone in the drawing room but had found them to be so tiresome that it wearied him to look at or listen to them and among all these faces that he found so tedious none seemed to bore him so much as that of his pretty wife he turned away from her with a grimace that distorted his handsome face kissed anna hand and screwing up his eyes scanned the whole company 
 you are off to the war prince said anna pavlovna 
 general kutuzov said bolkonski speaking french and stressing the last syllable of the name like a frenchman has been pleased to take me as an 
 and lise your wife 
 she will go to the country 
 are you not ashamed to deprive us of your charming wife 
 andre said his wife addressing her husband in the same coquettish manner in which she spoke to other men the vicomte has been telling us such a tale about mademoiselle george and buonaparte 
 prince andrew screwed up his eyes and turned away pierre who from the moment prince andrew entered the room had watched him with glad affectionate eyes now came up and took his arm before he looked round prince andrew frowned again expressing his annoyance with whoever was touching his arm but when he saw beaming face he gave him an unexpectedly kind and pleasant smile 
 there now so you too are in the great world said he to pierre 
 i knew you would be here replied pierre i will come to supper with you may i he added in a low voice so as not to disturb the vicomte who was continuing his story 
 no impossible said prince andrew laughing and pressing hand to show that there was no need to ask the question he wished to say something more but at that moment prince vasili and his daughter got up to go and the two young men rose to let them pass 
 you must excuse me dear vicomte said prince vasili to the frenchman holding him down by the sleeve in a friendly way to prevent his rising this unfortunate fete at the deprives me of a pleasure and obliges me to interrupt you i am very sorry to leave your enchanting party said he turning to anna pavlovna 
 his daughter princess helene passed between the chairs lightly holding up the folds of her dress and the smile shone still more radiantly on her beautiful face pierre gazed at her with rapturous almost frightened eyes as she passed him 
 very lovely said prince andrew 
 very said pierre 
 in passing prince vasili seized hand and said to anna pavlovna educate this bear for me he has been staying with me a whole month and this is the first time i have seen him in society nothing is so necessary for a young man as the society of clever women 
 anna pavlovna smiled and promised to take pierre in hand she knew his father to be a connection of prince the elderly lady who had been sitting with the old aunt rose hurriedly and overtook prince vasili in the anteroom all the affectation of interest she had assumed had left her kindly and tearworn face and it now expressed only anxiety and fear 
 how about my son boris prince said she hurrying after him into the anteroom i remain any longer in petersburg tell me what news i may take back to my poor boy 
 although prince vasili listened reluctantly and not very politely to the elderly lady even betraying some impatience she gave him an ingratiating and appealing smile and took his hand that he might not go away 
 what would it cost you to say a word to the emperor and then he would be transferred to the guards at once said she 
 believe me princess i am ready to do all i can answered prince vasili but it is difficult for me to ask the emperor i should advise you to appeal to rumyantsev through prince golitsyn that would be the best way 
 the elderly lady was a princess drubetskaya belonging to one of the best families in russia but she was poor and having long been out of society had lost her former influential connections she had now come to petersburg to procure an appointment in the guards for her only son it was in fact solely to meet prince vasili that she had obtained an invitation to anna reception and had sat listening to the story prince words frightened her an embittered look clouded her once handsome face but only for a moment then she smiled again and dutched prince arm more tightly 
 listen to me prince said she i have never yet asked you for anything and i never will again nor have i ever reminded you of my friendship for you but now i entreat you for sake to do this for my son and i shall always regard you as a benefactor she added hurriedly no be angry but promise i have asked golitsyn and he has refused be the kindhearted man you always were she said trying to smile though tears were in her eyes 
 papa we shall be late said princess helene turning her beautiful head and looking over her classically molded shoulder as she stood waiting by the door 
 influence in society however is a capital which has to be economized if it is to last prince vasili knew this and having once realized that if he asked on behalf of all who begged of him he would soon be unable to ask for himself he became chary of using his influence but in princess case he felt after her second appeal something like qualms of conscience she had reminded him of what was quite true he had been indebted to her father for the first steps in his career moreover he could see by her manners that she was one of those women mostly mothers who having once made up their minds will not rest until they have gained their end and are prepared if necessary to go on insisting day after day and hour after hour and even to make scenes this last consideration moved him 
 my dear anna mikhaylovna said he with his usual familiarity and weariness of tone it is almost impossible for me to do what you ask but to prove my devotion to you and how i respect your memory i will do the impossible your son shall be transferred to the guards here is my hand on it are you satisfied 
 my dear benefactor this is what i expected from you i knew your kindness he turned to go 
 wait just a word when he has been transferred to the guards she faltered you are on good terms with michael ilarionovich kutuzov recommend boris to him as adjutant then i shall be at rest and then 
 prince vasili smiled 
 no i promise that you know how kutuzov is pestered since his appointment as commander in chief he told me himself that all the moscow ladies have conspired to give him all their sons as adjutants 
 no but do promise i let you go my dear benefactor 
 papa said his beautiful daughter in the same tone as before we shall be late 
 well au revoir you hear her 
 then tomorrow you will speak to the emperor 
 certainly but about kutuzov i promise 
 do promise do promise vasili cried anna mikhaylovna as he went with the smile of a coquettish girl which at one time probably came naturally to her but was now very to her careworn face 
 apparently she had forgotten her age and by force of habit employed all the old feminine arts but as soon as the prince had gone her face resumed its former cold artificial expression she returned to the group where the vicomte was still talking and again pretended to listen while waiting till it would be time to leave her task was accomplished

 chapter 
 
 what vain we are i who had determined to hold myself independent of all social intercourse and thanked my stars that at length i had lighted on a spot where it was next to weak wretch after maintaining till dusk a struggle with low spirits and solitude was finally compelled to strike my colours and under pretence of gaining information concerning the necessities of my establishment i desired mrs dean when she brought in supper to sit down while i ate it hoping sincerely she would prove a regular gossip and either rouse me to animation or lull me to sleep by her talk 
 you have lived here a considerable time i commenced did you not say sixteen years 
 eighteen sir i came when the mistress was married to wait on her after she died the master retained me for his housekeeper 
 indeed 
 there ensued a pause she was not a gossip i feared unless about her own affairs and those could hardly interest me however having studied for an interval with a fist on either knee and a cloud of meditation over her ruddy countenance she ejaculated 
 ah times are greatly changed since then 
 yes i remarked seen a good many alterations i suppose 
 i have and troubles too she said 
 oh turn the talk on my family i thought to myself a good subject to that pretty i should like to know her history whether she be a native of the country or as is more probable an exotic that the surly indigenae will not recognize for kin with this intention i asked mrs dean why heathcliff let thrushcross grange and preferred living in a situation and residence so much inferior is he not rich enough to keep the estate in good order i inquired 
 rich sir she returned he has nobody knows what money and every year it increases yes yes rich enough to live in a finer house than this but very and if he had meant to flit to thrushcross grange as soon as he heard of a good tenant he could not have borne to miss the chance of getting a few hundreds more it is strange people should be so greedy when they are alone in the world 
 he had a son it seems 
 yes he had is dead 
 and that young lady mrs heathcliff is his widow 
 yes 
 where did she come from originally 
 why sir she is my late daughter catherine linton was her maiden name i nursed her poor thing i did wish mr heathcliff would remove here and then we might have been together again 
 what catherine linton i exclaimed astonished but a reflection convinced me it was not my ghostly catherine 
 then i continued my name was linton 
 it was 
 and who is that earnshaw hareton earnshaw who lives with mr heathcliff are they relations 
 no he is the late mrs nephew 
 the young cousin then 
 yes and her husband was her cousin also one on the the other on the side heathcliff married mr sister 
 i see the house at wuthering heights has earnshaw carved over the front door are they an old family 
 very old sir and hareton is the last of them as our miss cathy is of mean of the lintons have you been to wuthering heights i beg pardon for asking but i should like to hear how she is 
 mrs heathcliff she looked very well and very handsome yet i think not very happy 
 oh dear i wonder and how did you like the master a rough fellow rather mrs dean is not that his character 
 rough as a saw edge and hard as whinstone the less you meddle with him the better 
 he must have had some ups and downs in life to make him such a churl do you know anything of his history 
 a know all about it except where he was born and who were his parents and how he got his money at first and hareton has been cast out like an unfledged dunnock the unfortunate lad is the only one in all this parish that does not guess how he has been cheated 
 well mrs dean it will be a charitable deed to tell me something of my neighbours i feel i shall not rest if i go to bed so be good enough to sit and chat an hour 
 oh certainly sir just fetch a little sewing and then sit as long as you please but caught cold i saw you shivering and you must have some gruel to drive it out 
 the worthy woman bustled off and i crouched nearer the fire my head felt hot and the rest of me chill moreover i was excited almost to a pitch of foolishness through my nerves and brain 
 this caused me to feel not uncomfortable but rather fearful as i am still of serious effects from the incidents of today and yesterday she returned presently bringing a smoking basin and a basket of work and having placed the former on the hob drew in her seat evidently pleased to find me so companionable 
 before i came to live here she no further invitation to her was almost always at wuthering heights because my mother had nursed mr hindley earnshaw that was father and i got used to playing with the children i ran errands too and helped to make hay and hung about the farm ready for anything that anybody would set me to one fine summer was the beginning of harvest i earnshaw the old master came downstairs dressed for a journey and after he had told joseph what was to be done during the day he turned to hindley and cathy and i sat eating my porridge with he said speaking to his son now my bonny man going to liverpool today what shall i bring you you may choose what you like only let it be little for i shall walk there and back sixty miles each way that is a long spell hindley named a fiddle and then he asked miss cathy she was hardly six years old but she could ride any horse in the stable and she chose a whip he did not forget me for he had a kind heart though he was rather severe sometimes he promised to bring me a pocketful of apples and pears and then he kissed his children goodbye and set off 
 it seemed a long while to us three days of his often did little cathy ask when he would be home mrs earnshaw expected him by supper time on the third evening and she put the meal off hour after hour there were no signs of his coming however and at last the children got tired of running down to the gate to look then it grew dark she would have had them to bed but they begged sadly to be allowed to stay up and just about eleven the door latch was raised quietly and in stepped the master he threw himself into a chair laughing and groaning and bid them all stand off for he was nearly would not have such another walk for the three kingdoms 
 and at the end of it to be flighted to death he said opening his greatcoat which he held bundled up in his arms see here wife i was never so beaten with anything in my life but you must take it as a gift of god though as dark almost as if it came from the devil 
 we crowded round and over miss head i had a peep at a dirty ragged child big enough both to walk and talk indeed its face looked older than yet when it was set on its feet it only stared round and repeated over and over again some gibberish that nobody could understand i was frightened and mrs earnshaw was ready to fling it out of doors she did fly up asking how he could fashion to bring that gipsy brat into the house when they had their own bairns to feed and fend for what he meant to do with it and whether he were mad the master tried to explain the matter but he was really half dead with fatigue and all that i could make out amongst her scolding was a tale of his seeing it starving and houseless and as good as dumb in the streets of liverpool where he picked it up and inquired for its owner not a soul knew to whom it belonged he said and his money and time being both limited he thought it better to take it home with him at once than run into vain expenses there because he was determined he would not leave it as he found it well the conclusion was that my mistress grumbled herself calm and mr earnshaw told me to wash it and give it clean things and let it sleep with the children 
 hindley and cathy contented themselves with looking and listening till peace was restored then both began searching their pockets for the presents he had promised them the former was a boy of fourteen but when he drew out what had been a fiddle crushed to morsels in the greatcoat he blubbered aloud and cathy when she learned the master had lost her whip in attending on the stranger showed her humour by grinning and spitting at the stupid little thing earning for her pains a sound blow from her father to teach her cleaner manners they entirely refused to have it in bed with them or even in their room and i had no more sense so i put it on the landing of the stairs hoping it might be gone on the morrow by chance or else attracted by hearing his voice it crept to mr door and there he found it on quitting his chamber inquiries were made as to how it got there i was obliged to confess and in recompense for my cowardice and inhumanity was sent out of the house 
 this was first introduction to the family on coming back a few days afterwards for i did not consider my banishment perpetual i found they had christened him heathcliff it was the name of a son who died in childhood and it has served him ever since both for christian and surname miss cathy and he were now very thick but hindley hated him and to say the truth i did the same and we plagued and went on with him shamefully for i reasonable enough to feel my injustice and the mistress never put in a word on his behalf when she saw him wronged 
 he seemed a sullen patient child hardened perhaps to he would stand blows without winking or shedding a tear and my pinches moved him only to draw in a breath and open his eyes as if he had hurt himself by accident and nobody was to blame this endurance made old earnshaw furious when he discovered his son persecuting the poor fatherless child as he called him he took to heathcliff strangely believing all he said for that matter he said precious little and generally the truth and petting him up far above cathy who was too mischievous and wayward for a favourite 
 so from the very beginning he bred bad feeling in the house and at mrs death which happened in less than two years after the young master had learned to regard his father as an oppressor rather than a friend and heathcliff as a usurper of his affections and his privileges and he grew bitter with brooding over these injuries i sympathized awhile but when the children fell ill of the measles and i had to tend them and take on me the cares of a woman at once i changed my ideas heathcliff was dangerously sick and while he lay at the worst he would have me constantly by his pillow i suppose he felt i did a good deal for him and he wit to guess that i was compelled to do it however i will say this he was the quietest child that ever nurse watched over the difference between him and the others forced me to be less partial cathy and her brother harassed me terribly he was as uncomplaining as a lamb though hardness not gentleness made him give little trouble 
 he got through and the doctor affirmed it was in a great measure owing to me and praised me for my care i was vain of his commendations and softened towards the being by whose means i earned them and thus hindley lost his last ally still i dote on heathcliff and i wondered often what my master saw to admire so much in the sullen boy who never to my recollection repaid his indulgence by any sign of gratitude he was not insolent to his benefactor he was simply insensible though knowing perfectly the hold he had on his heart and conscious he had only to speak and all the house would be obliged to bend to his wishes as an instance i remember mr earnshaw once bought a couple of colts at the parish fair and gave the lads each one heathcliff took the handsomest but it soon fell lame and when he discovered it he said to hindley 
 you must exchange horses with me i like mine and if you i shall tell your father of the three thrashings given me this week and show him my arm which is black to the shoulder hindley put out his tongue and cuffed him over the ears better do it at once he persisted escaping to the porch they were in the stable you will have to and if i speak of these blows get them again with interest off dog cried hindley threatening him with an iron weight used for weighing potatoes and hay throw it he replied standing still and then tell how you boasted that you would turn me out of doors as soon as he died and see whether he will not turn you out directly hindley threw it hitting him on the breast and down he fell but staggered up immediately breathless and white and had not i prevented it he would have gone just so to the master and got full revenge by letting his condition plead for him intimating who had caused it take my colt gipsy then said young earnshaw and i pray that he may break your neck take him and be damned you beggarly interloper and wheedle my father out of all he has only afterwards show him what you are imp of take that i hope kick out your brains 
 heathcliff had gone to loose the beast and shift it to his own stall he was passing behind it when hindley finished his speech by knocking him under its feet and without stopping to examine whether his hopes were fulfilled ran away as fast as he could i was surprised to witness how coolly the child gathered himself up and went on with his intention exchanging saddles and all and then sitting down on a bundle of hay to overcome the qualm which the violent blow occasioned before he entered the house i persuaded him easily to let me lay the blame of his bruises on the horse he minded little what tale was told since he had what he wanted he complained so seldom indeed of such stirs as these that i really thought him not vindictive i was deceived completely as you will hear

 chapter four 
 
 oh dear how hard it does seem to take up our packs and go on sighed meg the morning after the party for now the holidays were over the week of merrymaking did not fit her for going on easily with the task she never liked 
 i wish it was christmas or new all the time it be fun answered jo yawning dismally 
 we enjoy ourselves half so much as we do now but it does seem so nice to have little suppers and bouquets and go to parties and drive home and read and rest and not work like other people you know and i always envy girls who do such things so fond of luxury said meg trying to decide which of two shabby gowns was the least shabby 
 well we have it so let us grumble but shoulder our bundles and trudge along as cheerfully as marmee does sure aunt march is a regular old man of the sea to me but i suppose when learned to carry her without complaining she will tumble off or get so light that i mind her 
 this idea tickled fancy and put her in good spirits but meg brighten for her burden consisting of four spoiled children seemed heavier than ever she had not heart enough even to make herself pretty as usual by putting on a blue neck ribbon and dressing her hair in the most becoming way 
 the use of looking nice when no one sees me but those cross midgets and no one cares whether pretty or not she muttered shutting her drawer with a jerk i shall have to toil and moil all my days with only little bits of fun now and then and get old and ugly and sour because poor and enjoy my life as other girls do a shame 
 so meg went down wearing an injured look and at all agreeable at breakfast time everyone seemed rather out of sorts and inclined to croak 
 beth had a headache and lay on the sofa trying to comfort herself with the cat and three kittens amy was fretting because her lessons were not learned and she find her rubbers jo would whistle and make a great racket getting ready 
 mrs march was very busy trying to finish a letter which must go at once and hannah had the grumps for being up late suit her 
 there never was such a cross family cried jo losing her temper when she had upset an inkstand broken both boot lacings and sat down upon her hat 
 the crossest person in it returned amy washing out the sum that was all wrong with the tears that had fallen on her slate 
 beth if you keep these horrid cats down cellar have them drowned exclaimed meg angrily as she tried to get rid of the kitten which had scrambled up her back and stuck like a burr just out of reach 
 jo laughed meg scolded beth implored and amy wailed because she remember how much nine times twelve was 
 girls girls do be quiet one minute i must get this off by the early mail and you drive me distracted with your worry cried mrs march crossing out the third spoiled sentence in her letter 
 there was a momentary lull broken by hannah who stalked in laid two hot turnovers on the table and stalked out again these turnovers were an institution and the girls called them muffs for they had no others and found the hot pies very comforting to their hands on cold mornings 
 hannah never forgot to make them no matter how busy or grumpy she might be for the walk was long and bleak the poor things got no other lunch and were seldom home before two 
 cuddle your cats and get over your headache bethy goodbye marmee we are a set of rascals this morning but come home regular angels now then meg and jo tramped away feeling that the pilgrims were not setting out as they ought to do 
 they always looked back before turning the corner for their mother was always at the window to nod and smile and wave her hand to them somehow it seemed as if they have got through the day without that for whatever their mood might be the last glimpse of that motherly face was sure to affect them like sunshine 
 if marmee shook her fist instead of kissing her hand to us it would serve us right for more ungrateful wretches than we are were never seen cried jo taking a remorseful satisfaction in the snowy walk and bitter wind use such dreadful expressions replied meg from the depths of the veil in which she had shrouded herself like a nun sick of the world 
 i like good strong words that mean something replied jo catching her hat as it took a leap off her head preparatory to flying away altogether 
 call yourself any names you like but i am neither a rascal nor a wretch and i choose to be called so 
 a blighted being and decidedly cross today because you sit in the lap of luxury all the time poor dear just wait till i make my fortune and you shall revel in carriages and ice cream and slippers and posies and boys to dance with 
 how ridiculous you are jo but meg laughed at the nonsense and felt better in spite of herself 
 lucky for you i am for if i put on crushed airs and tried to be dismal as you do we should be in a nice state thank goodness i can always find something funny to keep me up croak any more but come home jolly a dear 
 jo gave her sister an encouraging pat on the shoulder as they parted for the day each going a different way each hugging her little warm turnover and each trying to be cheerful in spite of wintry weather hard work and the unsatisfied desires of youth 
 when mr march lost his property in trying to help an unfortunate friend the two oldest girls begged to be allowed to do something toward their own support at least believing that they could not begin too early to cultivate energy industry and independence their parents consented and both fell to work with the hearty good will which in spite of all obstacles is sure to succeed at last 
 margaret found a place as nursery governess and felt rich with her small salary as she said she was fond of luxury and her chief trouble was poverty she found it harder to bear than the others because she could remember a time when home was beautiful life full of ease and pleasure and want of any kind unknown she tried not to be envious or discontented but it was very natural that the young girl should long for pretty things gay friends accomplishments and a happy life at the kings she daily saw all she wanted for the older sisters were just out and meg caught frequent glimpses of dainty ball dresses and bouquets heard lively gossip about theaters concerts sleighing parties and merrymakings of all kinds and saw money lavished on trifles which would have been so precious to her poor meg seldom complained but a sense of injustice made her feel bitter toward everyone sometimes for she had not yet learned to know how rich she was in the blessings which alone can make life happy 
 jo happened to suit aunt march who was lame and needed an active person to wait upon her the childless old lady had offered to adopt one of the girls when the troubles came and was much offended because her offer was declined other friends told the marches that they had lost all chance of being remembered in the rich old will but the unworldly marches only said 
 we give up our girls for a dozen fortunes rich or poor we will keep together and be happy in one another 
 the old lady speak to them for a time but happening to meet jo at at a something in her comical face and blunt manners struck the old fancy and she proposed to take her for a companion this did not suit jo at all but she accepted the place since nothing better appeared and to every surprise got on remarkably well with her irascible relative there was an occasional tempest and once jo marched home declaring she bear it longer but aunt march always cleared up quickly and sent for her to come back again with such urgency that she could not refuse for in her heart she rather liked the peppery old lady 
 i suspect that the real attraction was a large library of fine books which was left to dust and spiders since uncle march died jo remembered the kind old gentleman who used to let her build railroads and bridges with his big dictionaries tell her stories about queer pictures in his latin books and buy her cards of gingerbread whenever he met her in the street the dim dusty room with the busts staring down from the tall bookcases the cozy chairs the globes and best of all the wilderness of books in which she could wander where she liked made the library a region of bliss to her 
 the moment aunt march took her nap or was busy with company jo hurried to this quiet place and curling herself up in the easy chair devoured poetry romance history travels and pictures like a regular bookworm but like all happiness it did not last long for as sure as she had just reached the heart of the story the sweetest verse of a song or the most perilous adventure of her traveler a shrill voice called and she had to leave her paradise to wind yarn wash the poodle or read essays by the hour together 
 ambition was to do something very splendid what it was she had no idea as yet but left it for time to tell her and meanwhile found her greatest affliction in the fact that she read run and ride as much as she liked a quick temper sharp tongue and restless spirit were always getting her into scrapes and her life was a series of ups and downs which were both comic and pathetic but the training she received at aunt was just what she needed and the thought that she was doing something to support herself made her happy in spite of the perpetual 
 beth was too bashful to go to had been tried but she suffered so much that it was given up and she did her lessons at home with her father even when he went away and her mother was called to devote her skill and energy to soldiers aid societies beth went faithfully on by herself and did the best she could she was a housewifely little creature and helped hannah keep home neat and comfortable for the workers never thinking of any reward but to be loved long quiet days she spent not lonely nor idle for her little world was peopled with imaginary friends and she was by nature a busy bee there were six dolls to be taken up and dressed every morning for beth was a child still and and loved her pets as well as ever not one whole or handsome one among them all were outcasts till beth took them in for when her sisters outgrew these idols they passed to her because amy would have nothing old or ugly beth cherished them all the more tenderly for that very reason and set up a hospital for infirm dolls no pins were ever stuck into their cotton vitals no harsh words or blows were ever given them no neglect ever saddened the heart or the most repulsive but all were fed and clothed nursed and caressed with an affection which never failed one forlorn fragment of dollanity had belonged to jo and having led a tempestuous life was left a wreck in the rag bag from which dreary poorhouse it was rescued by beth and taken to her refuge having no top to its head she tied on a neat little cap and as both arms and legs were gone she hid these deficiencies by folding it in a blanket and devoting her best bed to this chronic invalid if anyone had known the care lavished on that dolly i think it would have touched their hearts even while they laughed she brought it bits of bouquets she read to it took it out to breathe fresh air hidden under her coat she sang it lullabies and never went to be without kissing its dirty face and whispering tenderly i hope have a good night my poor dear 
 beth had her troubles as well as the others and not being an angel but a very human little girl she often wept a little weep as jo said because she take music lessons and have a fine piano she loved music so dearly tried so hard to learn and practiced away so patiently at the jingling old instrument that it did seem as if someone not to hint aunt march ought to help her nobody did however and nobody saw beth wipe the tears off the yellow keys that keep in tune when she was all alone she sang like a little lark about her work never was too tired for marmee and the girls and day after day said hopefully to herself i know get my music some time if good 
 
 
 there are many beths in the world shy and quiet sitting in corners till needed and living for others so cheerfully that no one sees the sacrifices till the little cricket on the hearth stops chirping and the sweet sunshiny presence vanishes leaving silence and shadow behind 
 if anybody had asked amy what the greatest trial of her life was she would have answered at once my nose when she was a baby jo had accidently dropped her into the coal hod and amy insisted that the fall had ruined her nose forever it was not big nor red like poor it was only rather flat and all the pinching in the world could not give it an aristocratic point no one minded it but herself and it was doing its best to grow but amy felt deeply the want of a grecian nose and drew whole sheets of handsome ones to console herself 
 little raphael as her sisters called her had a decided talent for drawing and was never so happy as when copying flowers designing fairies or illustrating stories with queer specimens of art her teachers complained that instead of doing her sums she covered her slate with animals the blankpages of her atlas were used to copy maps on and caricatures of the most ludicrous description came fluttering out of all her books at unlucky moments she got through her lessons as well as she could and managed to escape reprimands by being a model of deportment she was a great favorite with her mates being and possessing the happy art of pleasing without effort her little airs and graces were much admired so were her accomplishments for besides her drawing she could play twelve tunes crochet and read french without mispronouncing more than of the words she had a plaintive way of saying when papa was rich we did which was very touching and her long words were considered perfectly elegant by the girls 
 amy was in a fair way to be spoiled for everyone petted her and her small vanities and selfishnesses were growing nicely one thing however rather quenched the vanities she had to wear her clothes now mama a particle of taste and amy suffered deeply at having to wear a red instead of a blue bonnet unbecoming gowns and fussy aprons that did not fit everything was good well made and little worn but artistic eyes were much afflicted especially this winter when her school dress was a dull purple with yellow dots and no trimming 
 my only comfort she said to meg with tears in her eyes is that mother take tucks in my dresses whenever naughty as maria mother does my dear really dreadful for sometimes she is so bad her frock is up to her knees and she come to school when i think of this deggerredation i fell that i can bear even my flat nose and purple gown with yellow skyrockets on it 
 meg was confidante and monitor and by some strange attraction of opposites jo was gentle to jo alone did the shy child tell her thoughts and over her big sister beth unconsciously exercised more influence than anyone in the family the two older girls were a great deal to one another but each took one of the younger sisters into her keeping and watched over her in her own way playing mother they called it and put their sisters in the places of discarded dolls with the maternal instinct of litte women 
 has anybody got anything to tell been such a dismal day really dying for some amusement said meg as they sat sewing together that evening 
 i had a queer time with aunt today and as i got the best of it tell you about it began jo who dearly loved to tell stories i was reading that everlasting belsham and droning away as i always do for aunt soon drops off and then i take out some nice book and read like fury till she wakes up i actually made myself sleepy and before she began to nod i gave such a gape that she asked me what i meant by opening my mouth wide enough to take the whole book in at once 
 i wish i could and be done with it said i trying not to be saucy 
 then she gave me a long lecture on my sins and told me to sit and think them over while she just lost herself for a moment she never finds herself very soon so the minute her cap began to bob like a dahlia i whipped the vicar of wakefield out of my pocket and read away with one eye on him and one on aunt just got to where they all tumbled into the water when i forgot and laughed out loud aunt woke up and being more after her nap told me to read a bit and show what frivolous work i preferred to the worthy and instructive belsham i did my very best and she liked it though she only said 
 i understand what all about go back and begin it child 
 back i went and made the primroses as interesting as ever i could once i was wicked enough to stop in a thrilling place and say meekly afraid it tires you i stop now 
 she caught up her knitting which had dropped out of her hands gave me a sharp look through her specs and said in her short way finish the chapter and be impertinent miss 
 did she own she liked it asked meg 
 oh bless you no but she let old belsham rest and when i ran back after my gloves this afternoon there she was so hard at the vicar that she hear me laugh as i danced a jig in the hall because of the good time coming what a pleasant life she might have if only she chose i envy her much in spite of her money for after all rich people have about as many worries as poor ones i think added jo 
 that reminds me said meg that got something to tell it funny like story but i thought about it a good deal as i came home at the kings today i found everybody in a flurry and one of the children said that her oldest brother had done something dreadful and papa had sent him away i heard mrs king crying and mr king talking very loud and grace and ellen turned away their faces when they passed me so i see how red and swollen their eyes were i ask any questions of course but i felt so sorry for them and was rather glad i any wild brothers to do wicked things and disgrace the family 
 i think being disgraced in school is a great deal tryinger than anything bad boys can do said amy shaking her head as if her experience of life had been a deep one susie perkins came to school today with a lovely red carnelian ring i wanted it dreadfully and wished i was her with all my might well she drew a picture of mr davis with a monstrous nose and a hump and the words young ladies my eye is upon you coming out of his mouth in a balloon thing we were laughing over it when all of a sudden his eye was on us and he ordered susie to bring up her slate she was parrylized with fright but she went and oh what do you think he did he took her by the ear just fancy how led her to the recitation platform and made her stand there half and hour holding the slate so everyone could see 
 the girls laugh at the picture asked jo who relished the scrape 
 laugh not one they sat still as mice and susie cried quarts i know she did i envy her then for i felt that millions of carnelian rings have made me happy after that i never never should have got over such a agonizing mortification and amy went on with her work in the proud consciousness of virtue and the successful utterance of two long words in a breath 
 i saw something i liked this morning and i meant to tell it at dinner but i forgot said beth putting basket in order as she talked when i went to get some oysters for hannah mr laurence was in the fish shop but he see me for i kept behind the fish barrel and he was busy with mr cutter the fishman a poor woman came in with a pail a mop and asked mr cutter if he would let her do some scrubbing for a bit of fish because she any dinner for her children and had been disappointed of a work mr cutter was in a hurry and said no rather crossly so she was going away looking hungry and sorry when mr laurence hooked up a big fish with the crooked end of his cane and held it out to her she was so glad and surprised she took it right into her arms and thanked him over and over he told her to go along and cook it and she hurried off so happy it good of him oh she did look so funny hugging the big slippery fish and hoping mr bed in heaven would be aisy 
 when they had laughed at story they asked their mother for one and after a moments thought she said soberly as i sat cutting out blue flannel jackets today at the rooms i felt very anxious about father and thought how lonely and helpless we should be if anything happened to him it was not a wise thing to do but i kept on worrying till an old man came in with an order for some clothes he sat down near me and i began to talk to him for he looked poor and tired and anxious 
 have you sons in the army i asked for the note he brought was not to me 
 yes i had four but two were killed one is a prisoner and going to the other who is very sick in a washington hospital he answered quietly 
 you have done a great deal for your country sir i said feeling respect now instead of pity 
 not a mite more than i ought go myself if i was any use as i i give my boys and give em free 
 he spoke so cheerfully looked so sincere and seemed so glad to give his all that i was ashamed of myself given one man and thought it too much while he gave four without grudging them i had all my girls to comfort me at home and his last son was waiting miles away to say to him perhaps i felt so rich so happy thinking of my blessings that i made him a nice bundle gave him some money and thanked him heartily for the lesson he had taught me 
 tell another story mother one with a moral to it like this i like to think about them afterward if they are real and not too preachy said jo after a silence 
 mrs march smiled and began at once for she had told stories to this little audience for many years and knew how to please them 
 once upon a time there were four girls who had enough to eat and drink and wear a good many comforts and pleasures kind friends and parents who loved them dearly and yet they were not contented 
 here the listeners stole sly looks at one another and began to sew diligently 
 these girls were anxious to be good and made many excellent resolutions but they did not keep them very well and were constantly saying if only we had this or if we could only do that quite forgetting how much they already had and how many things they actually could do so they asked an old woman what spell they could use to make them happy and she said when you feel discontented think over your blessings and be grateful here jo looked up quickly as if about to speak but changed her mind seeing that the story was not done yet 
 being sensible girls they decided to try her advice and soon were surprised to see how well off they were one discovered that money keep shame and sorrow out of rich houses another that though she was poor she was a great deal happier with her youth health and good spirits than a certain fretful feeble old lady who enjoy her comforts a third that disagreeable as it was to help get dinner it was harder still to go begging for it and the fourth that even carnelian rings were not so valuable as good behavior so they agreed to stop complaining to enjoy the blessings already possessed and try to deserve them lest they should be taken away entirely instead of increased and i believe they were never disappointed or sorry that they took the old advice 
 now marmee that is very cunning of you to turn our own stories against us and give us a sermon instead of a romance cried meg 
 i like that kind of sermon the sort father used to tell us said beth thoughtfully putting the needles straight on cushion 
 i complain near as much as the others do and i shall be more careful than ever now for had warning from downfall said amy morally 
 we needed that lesson and we forget it if we do so you just say to us as old chloe did in uncle tom tink ob yer marcies chillen tink ob yer marcies added jo who could not for the life of her help getting a morsel of fun out of the little sermon though she took it to heart as much as any of them

 the middle of the frying pan the endless sunbaked sahara

 green teeth flies buzz around his head he sucks at his 
 gums then spits out some gristle watches him 
 
 yeah disgusting 
 evelyn is having the time of her life on top of her camel 
 evelyn 
 well i think cute 
 we do several time dissolves showing the majesty of the 
 desert and our heroes getting deeper and deeper into it 
 frying pan night 
 the moon shines down an four lone camel trekking 
 across the vast wasteland 
 jonathan is sound asleep his head bobbing comically to 
 the rhythm of his camel on the camel next to him the 
 warden snores loudly up in front of them evelyn slowly 
 starts to slide off her saddle reaches over and 
 stops her then gently pushes her back up onto her saddle 
 never waking her for a long moment his eyes watch evelyn 
 and then he looks up at a distant ridge 
 where ardeth bay and a group of mumia riders are pacing them 
 ext giant sand dune endless horizon day 
 the dawning sun yet crested the distant horizon as 
 jonathan and the warden ride alongside a giant sand dune 
 jonathan 
 and you snore 
 warden 
 i do not snore 
 jonathan 
 all night you snored 
 warden 
 i have never snored 
 up in front of them looks at evelyn 
 
 almost there 
 evelyn 
 are you sure 
 looks down at the ground 
 
 pretty sure 
 the others look down and see dozens of skeletons sticking out 
 of the ground bleached and eaten away some of the skeletons 
 look like trying to crawl up out of the desert floor 
 jonathan 
 what in bloody hell is this 
 the warden shivers in fear 
 warden 
 other seekers of hamunaptra 
 the american expedition rides out from behind the far end of 
 the dune the americans are accompanied by two dozen native 
 diggers and an arab egyptologist beni rides lead on a camel 
 the rest ride horses 
 beni 
 good morning my friend 
 just nods the two parties come to a stop a hundred 
 feet apart turns and stares out across the endless 
 horizon beni does likewise the americans look puzzled 
 daniels 
 well what the hell we doin 
 beni 
 patience my good sahib patience 
 henderson looks over at 
 henderson 
 first one to the city 
 five hundred cash bucks 
 and beni just stare out at the flat nothingness 
 evelyn and jonathan share a look and then the sun starts to 
 rise in the distance breaking the flat horizon 
 
 get ready 
 evelyn can feel the suspense and the majesty of the moment 
 evelyn 
 for what 
 
 about to be shown the way 
 far off to the right a huge shape begins to rise with the 
 sun a volcano and beni watch it expressionless 
 daniels henderson and burns share a look and then 
 
 heya 
 the americans take off racing towards the rising volcano 
 daniels 
 see ya there 
 evelyn and jonathan give anxious sarcastic looks 
 jonathan 
 ah begging your pardon but 
 we be going 
 evelyn 
 after all you rode us night 
 and day to win that bet 
 say a word staring hard 
 beni watches the americans and spits into the sand 
 beni 
 fools 
 
 and then suddenly the volcano shifts across the horizon 
 passing across the sun as it goes a mirage 
 the americans crash their horses to a stop and race the other 
 way after the volcano evelyn and jonathan smile amazed 
 the volcano shifts again floating across the watery horizon 
 the americans crash to a stop again and chase after the 
 volcano all three of them confused and cursing 
 and beni just stare waiting the volcano shifts again and 
 the americans crash to a stop again burns is thrown from his 
 horse henderson angrily rips his hat off and chucks it to 
 the ground daniels just curses as they give up the chase 
 the volcano comes to a stop on the far left of the horizon 
 the americans are on the far right nothing moves a beat 
 and then grins so does beni they share a look 
 and then swat their camels and race away everybody else 
 after them and beni are 
 and then evelyn comes galloping up hair flying in the wind 
 beni takes out his camel whip and starts whipping 
 trying to knock him off his camel once crack twice crack 
 but on the third try grabs the whip and jerks beni 
 off his camel beni slams to the ground and tumbles 
 evelyn and race across the desert evelyn has never 
 felt so alive she laughs grins he likes this 
 girl beni stumbles to his feet then quickly dances out of 
 the way as jonathan and all the other riders stampede past 
 him evelyn beats to the stone ramp racing hard 
 
 evelyn slow down 
 evelyn ignores him as she races up the ramp towards the gate 
 
 slow down evelyn slow down 
 a really big 
 int hamunaptra day 
 evelyn goes through the air and crash lands 
 in a sand dune she sits up stunned sandy hair in her eyes 
 stops at the edge of the ramp next to her camel 
 
 never mind 
 the americans ride up and look in wonder at the ruins inside 
 the volcano gives them a big grin 
 
 you boys owe me five hundred dollars 
 ext hamunaptra day 
 under the guidance of the egyptologist the diggers are busy 
 hauling rock and dirt out of the temple doorway the three 
 americans are playing poker beni smokes a hookah and swats 
 flies dozens of stray camels roam the decrepit city dusty 
 backpacks and old saddlebags still slung over their humps 
 daniels 
 all these camels come from 
 beni 
 they belong to the dead they 
 will wait years for their 
 masters to return before leaving 
 ext our heroes dig day 
 evelyn jonathan and the warden are working next 
 to a narrow crevice which weaves way through the ruins 
 ties a rope around a pillar and throws the rest of 
 the coils into the crevice about to rappel down jonathan 
 bends over to have a look his ass hits something he yelps 
 and backs away the decrepit face of anubis 
 jonathan 
 that thing gives me the creeps 
 
 be nice that thing saved my life 
 evelyn is positioning ancient mirrors along the crevice 
 evelyn 
 that thing gets me excited 
 
 sarcastic 
 the things that get you excited 
 evelyn 
 according to bembridge scholars 
 inside the statue of anubis was 
 a secret compartment perhaps 
 containing the book of the living 
 
 what are those mirrors for 
 evelyn 
 ancient egyptian trick see 
 shrugs then rappels down into the crevice 
 int chamber day 
 waves a torch as jonathan evelyn and the warden 
 drop down next to him evelyn peers into the spooky darkness 
 evelyn 
 do you realize we are standing 
 inside a room that no one has 
 entered in over four thousand years 
 warden 
 who cares i see no treasure 
 
 welcome to my share of 
 the spider webs 
 jonathan 
 and it stinks to high heaven in here 
 evelyn just rolls her eyes 
 evelyn 
 cretins 
 jonathan sniffs the foul air then he looks at the warden and 
 realizes where the smell is coming from he stops sniffing 
 evelyn brushes cobwebs away from a metal disk on the wall 
 then repositions it on pedestal aiming it at a ray of 
 light shining in from the outer mirrors the ray of light 
 hits the disk and quickly shoots around the room from one 
 disk to another until the whole chamber is lit up light rays 
 shoot off down the passageways the chamber 
 
 that is a neat trick 
 evelyn 
 oh my god a preparation room 
 
 preparation for what 
 evelyn 
 for entering the afterlife 
 quickly draws his gun jonathan gently nudges him 
 jonathan 
 mummies my good son this is 
 where they made the mummies 
 evelyn heads down a narrow passageway the others follow 
 int labyrinth day 
 evelyn and jonathan crouch as they make their way 
 through a narrow cobweb infested labyrinth the short squat 
 warden can stand straight up then they hear something and 
 freeze it sounds like somebody is clawing inside the walls 
 they share looks then slowly move forward getting darker 
 and darker as they go the strange sound getting louder and 
 louder and then it stops evelyn holds her breath jonathan 
 licks his lips cocks his pistol the warden farts 
 jonathan and evelyn glare at him 
 anubis chamber day 
 they slowly creep out of the labyrinth and up to the foot of 
 an enormous statue the lower half of anubis 
 then they hear the sound again coming closer now from the 
 other side of the statue and closer pulls evelyn 
 behind him and closer raises his gun and closer 
 leaps out three horrible sweaty faces lunge at 
 him reacts but pull the trigger because 
 just the americans their guns are up cocked and aimed 
 henderson 
 ya scared the bejeezus out of 
 us 
 
 likewise 
 but nobody lowers their guns daniels grins the tough one 
 daniels 
 this here is our 
 
 see your name on 
 and when beni five diggers and the egyptologist step 
 out of the shadows all holding guns aimed at 
 beni 
 ten to one your 
 odds are 
 
 had worse 
 jonathan clenches a tiny derringer 
 jonathan 
 yes me too 
 gives him a sideways glance beni cocks his gun 
 grinning he wants it to happen the tension thickens then 
 evelyn gently takes gun hand and pulls it down 
 evelyn 
 be nice children if 
 going to play together 
 we must learn to share 
 evelyn pulls away jonathan and the warden follow 
 beni and the americans slowly lower their guns laughing the 
 egyptologist excitedly begins translating the hieroglyphs 
 int imhotepis chamber day 
 and jonathan are using against the 
 ceiling evelyn is gently chipping away with a tiny chisel 
 evelyn 
 according to my calculations 
 we should be right under the 
 statue come up right 
 between his legs 
 she blushes and laughs 
 oh my 
 jonathan 
 and when those dirty yanks go 
 to sleep 
 looks at 
 no offense 
 
 none taken

 book right out from under them

 some italian reassuring him as he opens the cab door and drags ann out 
 
 joe walks up the steps followed by ann head down barely able to keep awake he arrives at the front door as he stops leaning forward to open it ann rests her head on his shoulder before going through he straightens causing her to stand up balancing herself and then goes through ann follows he shuts the door behind her taking her by the hand up the steps without thinking she walks around the outside of the small spiral stairwell instead of following him up so joe turns her around with his hand leaning over the railing from above ann blissfully unaware as he leads her around so happy and leads her back around to the bottom of the steps ann so happy and up the right way 
 she staggers up steps after him stopping by a door as joe goes to unlock his one a few steps up in her stupor she raises her hand and is about to knock on the door when joe sees her running over to catch her hand just in time he leads her to the door and unlocks it he goes in and turns on the light 
 
 joe 
 muttering as ann follows him in 
 out of my head 
 
 he shuts the door behind her 
 
 ann

 joe 
 offended 
 my room 
 
 he turns on a lamp at the other end of the room by the bathroom door

 ann

 she stands ready head raised expectantly 
 
 joe 
 pauses unsure then goes to her 
 
 
 he undoes her necktie sliding it away fom her neck presenting it to her 
 er there you are you can handle the rest 
 
 she looks at it blankly then takes it 
 joe walks over to the table by the front door pouring a drink into a glass from a bottle and swallowing it 
 
 ann 
 just putting down her last glove

 joe 
 firmly 
 no 
 
 puts his glass down going over to her

 who has won to mastership 
 
 eh what i say i speak true when i say dat buck two devils 
 this was speech next morning when he discovered spitz missing and buck covered with wounds he drew him to the fire and by its light pointed them out 
 dat spitz fight like hell said perrault as he surveyed the gaping rips and cuts 
 an dat buck fight like two hells was answer and now we make good time no more spitz no more trouble sure 
 while perrault packed the camp outfit and loaded the sled the proceeded to harness the dogs buck trotted up to the place spitz would have occupied as leader but francois not noticing him brought to the coveted position in his judgment was the best left buck sprang upon in a fury driving him back and standing in his place 
 eh eh francois cried slapping his thighs gleefully look at dat buck him kill dat spitz him think to take de job 
 go way hook he cried but buck refused to budge 
 he took buck by the scruff of the neck and though the dog growled threateningly dragged him to one side and replaced the old dog did not like it and showed plainly that he was afraid of buck francois was obdurate but when he turned his back buck again displaced who was not at all unwilling to go 
 francois was angry now by gar i fix you he cried coming back with a heavy club in his hand 
 buck remembered the man in the red sweater and retreated slowly nor did he attempt to charge in when was once more brought forward but he circled just beyond the range of the club snarling with bitterness and rage and while he circled he watched the club so as to dodge it if thrown by francois for he was become wise in the way of clubs 
 the driver went about his work and he called to buck when he was ready to put him in his old place in front of dave buck retreated two or three steps francois followed him up whereupon he again retreated after some time of this francois threw down the club thinking that buck feared a thrashing but buck was in open revolt he wanted not to escape a clubbing but to have the leadership it was his by right he had earned it and he would not be content with less 
 perrault took a hand between them they ran him about for the better part of an hour they threw clubs at him he dodged they cursed him and his fathers and mothers before him and all his seed to come after him down to the remotest generation and every hair on his body and drop of blood in his veins and he answered curse with snarl and kept out of their reach he did not try to run away but retreated around and around the camp advertising plainly that when his desire was met he would come in and be good 
 francois sat down and scratched his head perrault looked at his watch and swore time was flying and they should have been on the trail an hour gone francois scratched his head again he shook it and grinned sheepishly at the courier who shrugged his shoulders in sign that they were beaten then francois went up to where stood and called to buck buck laughed as dogs laugh yet kept his distance francois unfastened traces and put him back in his old place the team stood harnessed to the sled in an unbroken line ready for the trail there was no place for buck save at the front once more francois called and once more buck laughed and kept away 
 throw down de club perrault commanded 
 francois complied whereupon buck trotted in laughing triumphantly and swung around into position at the head of the team his traces were fastened the sled broken out and with both men running they dashed out on to the river trail 
 highly as the had forevalued buck with his two devils he found while the day was yet young that he had undervalued at a bound buck took up the duties of leadership and where judgment was required and quick thinking and quick acting he showed himself the superior even of spitz of whom francois had never seen an equal 
 but it was in giving the law and making his mates live up to it that buck excelled dave and did not mind the change in leadership it was none of their business their business was to toil and toil mightily in the traces so long as that was not interfered with they did not care what happened billee the could lead for all they cared so long as he kept order the rest of the team however had grown unruly during the last days of spitz and their surprise was great now that buck proceeded to lick them into shape 
 pike who pulled at heels and who never put an ounce more of his weight against the breastband than he was compelled to do was swiftly and repeatedly shaken for loafing and ere the first day was done he was pulling more than ever before in his life the first night in camp joe the sour one was punished thing that spitz had never succeeded in doing buck simply smothered him by virtue of superior weight and cut him up till he ceased snapping and began to whine for mercy 
 the general tone of the team picked up immediately it recovered its solidarity and once more the dogs leaped as one dog in the traces at the rink rapids two native huskies teek and koona were added and the celerity with which buck broke them in took away breath 
 never such a dog as dat buck he cried no never him worth one thousand dollair by gar eh what you say perrault 
 and perrault nodded he was ahead of the record then and gaining day by day the trail was in excellent condition well packed and hard and there was no snow with which to contend it was not too cold the temperature dropped to fifty below zero and remained there the whole trip the men rode and ran by turn and the dogs were kept on the jump with but infrequent 
 the thirty mile river was comparatively coated with ice and they covered in one day going out what had taken them ten days coming in in one run they made a dash from the foot of lake lebarge to the white horse rapids across marsh tagish and bennett seventy miles of lakes they flew so fast that the man whose turn it was to run towed behind the sled at the end of a rope and on the last night of the second week they topped white pass and dropped down the sea slope with the lights of skaguay and of the shipping at their feet 
 it was a record run each day for fourteen days they had averaged forty miles for three days perrault and francois threw chests up and down the main street of skaguay and were deluged with invitations to drink while the team was the constant center of a worshipful crowd of dogbusters and mushers then three or four western bad men aspired to clean out the town were riddled like pepperboxes for their pains and public interest turned to other idols next came official orders francois called buck to him threw his arms around him wept over him and that was the last of francois and perrault like other men they passed out of life for good 
 a scotch took charge of him and his mates and in company with a dozen other he started back over the weary trail to dawson it was no light running now nor record time but heavy toil each day with a heavy load behind for this was the mail train carrying word from the world to the men who sought gold under the shadow of the pole 
 buck did not like it but he bore up well to the work taking pride in it after the manner of dave and and seeing that his mates whether they prided in it or not did their fair share it was a monotonous life operating with regularity one day was very like another at a certain time each morning the cooks turned out fires were built and breakfast was eaten then while some broke camp others harnessed the dogs and they were under way an hour or so before the darkness fell which gave warning of dawn at night camp was made some pitched the tents others cut firewood and pine boughs for the beds and still others carried water or ice for the cooks also the dogs were fed to them this was the one feature of the day though it was good to loaf around after the fish was eaten for an hour or so with the other dogs of which there were fivescore and odd there were fierce fighters among them but three battles with the fiercest brought buck to mastery so that when he bristled and showed his teeth they got out of his way 
 best of all perhaps he loved to lie near the fire hind legs crouched under him fore legs stretched out in front head raised and eyes blinking drearily at the flames sometimes he thought of judge big house in the santa clara valley and of the cement swimming tank and ysabel the mexican hairless and toots the japanese pug but oftener he remembered the man in the red sweater the death of curly the great fight with spitz and the good things he had eaten or would like to eat he was not homesick the sunland was very dim and distant and such memories had no power over him far more potent were the memories of his heredity that gave things he had never seen before a seeming familiarity the instincts which were but the memories of his ancestors become habits which had lapsed in later days and still later in him quickened and became alive again 
 sometimes as he crouched there blinking dreamily at the flames it seemed that the flames were of another fire and that as he crouched by this other fire he saw another and different man from the cook before him this other man was shorter of leg and longer of arm with muscles that were stringy and knotty rather than rounded and swelling the hair of this man was long and matted and his head slanted back under it from the eyes he uttered strange sounds and seemed very much afraid of the darkness into which he peered continually clutching in his hand which hung midway between knee and foot a stick with a heavy stone made fast to the end he was all but naked a ragged and skin hanging part way down his back but on his body there was much hair in some places across the chest and shoulders and down the outside of the arms and thighs it was matted into almost a thick fur he did not stand erect but with trunk inclined forward from the hips on legs that bent at the knees about his body there was a peculiar springiness or resiliency almost catlike and a quick alertness as of one who lived in perpetual fear of things seen and unseen 
 at other times this hairy man squatted by the fire with head between his legs and slept on such occasions his elbows were on his knees his hands clasped above his head as though to shed rain by the hairy arms and beyond that fire in the circling darkness buck could see many gleaming coals two by two always two by two which he knew to be the eyes of great beasts of prey and he could hear the crashing of their bodies through the undergrowth and the noises they made in the night and dreaming there by the yukon bank with lazy eyes blinking at the fire these sounds and sights of another world would make the hair to rise along his back and stand on end across his shoulders and up his neck till he whimpered low and suppressedly or growled softly and the cook shouted at him hey you buck wake up whereupon the other world would vanish and the real world come into his eyes and he would get up and yawn and stretch as though he had been asleep 
 it was a hard trip with the mail behind them and the heavy work wore them down they were short of weight and in poor condition when they made dawson and should have had a ten days or a rest at least but in two days time they dropped down the yukon bank from the barracks loaded with letters for the outside the dogs were tired the drivers grumbling and to make matters worse it snowed every day this meant a soft trail greater friction on the runners and heavier pulling for the dogs yet the drivers were fair through it all and did their best for the animals 
 each night the dogs were attended to first they ate before the drivers ate and no man sought his till he had seen to the feet of the dogs he drove still their strength went down since the beginning of the winter they had traveled eighteen hundred miles dragging sleds the whole weary distance and eighteen hundred miles will tell upon life of the toughest buck stood it keeping his mates up to their work and maintaining discipline though he too was very tired billee cried and whimpered regularly in his sleep each night joe was sourer than ever and was unapproachable blind side or other side 
 but it was dave who suffered most of all something had gone wrong with him he became more morose and irritable and when camp was pitched at once made his nest where his driver fed him once out of the harness and down he did not get on his feet again till time in the morning sometimes in the traces when jerked by a sudden stoppage of the sled or by straining to start it he would cry out with pain the driver examined him but could find nothing all the drivers became interested in his case they talked it over at and over their last pipes before going to bed and one night they held a consultation he was brought from his nest to the fire and was pressed and prodded till he cried out many times something was wrong inside but they could locate no broken bones could not make it out 
 by the time cassiar bar was reached he was so weak that he was falling repeatedly in the traces the scotch called a halt and took him out of the team making the next dog fast to the sled his intention was to rest dave letting him run free behind the sled sick as he was dave resented being taken out grunting and growling while the traces were unfastened and whimpering when he saw in the position he had held and served so long for the pride of trace and trail was his and sick unto death he could not bear that another dog should do his work 
 when the sled started he floundered in the soft snow alongside the beaten trail attacking with his teeth rushing against him and trying to thrust him off into the soft snow on the other side striving to leap inside his traces and get between him and the sled and all the while whining and yelping and crying with grief and pain the tried to drive him away with the whip but he paid no heed to the stinging lash and the man had not the heart to strike harder dave refused to run quietly on the trail behind the sled where the going was easy but continued to flounder alongside in the soft snow where the going was most difficult till exhausted then he fell and lay where he fell howling lugubriously as the long train of sleds churned by 
 with the last remnant of his strength he managed to stagger along behind till the train made another stop when he floundered past the sleds to his own where he stood alongside his driver lingered a moment to get a light for his pipe from the man behind then he returned and started his dogs they swung out on the trail with remarkable lack of exertion turned their heads uneasily and stopped in surprise the driver was surprised too the sled had not moved he called his comrades to witness the sight dave had bitten through both of traces and was standing directly in front of the sled in his proper place 
 he pleaded with his eyes to remain there the driver was perplexed his comrades talked of how a dog could break its heart through being denied the work that killed it and recalled instances they had known where dogs too old for the toil or injured had died because they were cut out of the traces also they held it a mercy since dave was to die anyway that he should die in the traces and content so he was harnessed in again and proudly he pulled as of old though more than once he cried out involuntarily from the bite of his inward hurt several times fell down and was dragged in the traces and once the sled ran upon him so that he limped thereafter on one of his hind legs 
 but he held out till camp was reached when his driver made a place for him by the fire morning found him too weak to travel at time he tried to crawl to his driver by convulsive efforts he got on his feet staggered and fell then he wormed his way forward slowly toward where the harnesses were being put on his mates he would advance his fore legs and drag up his body with a sort of hitching movement when he would advance his fore legs and hitch ahead again for a few more inches his strength left him and the last his mates saw of him he lay gasping in the snow and yearning toward them but they could hear him mournfully howling till they passed out of sight behind a belt of river timber 
 here the train was halted the scotch slowly retraced his steps to the camp they had left the men ceased talking a rang out the man came back hurriedly the whips snapped the bells tinkled merrily the sleds churned along the trail but buck knew and every dog knew what had taken place behind the belt of river trees

lionfish nov chapter four at flourish and blottscontents prev chapter next chapter 
 life at the burrow was as different as possible from life on privet drive the dursleys liked everything neat and ordered the burst with the strange and unexpected harry got a shock the first time he looked in the mirror over the kitchen mantelpiece and it shouted tuck your shirt in scruffy the ghoul in the attic howled and dropped pipes whenever he felt things were getting too quiet and small explosions from fred and bedroom were considered perfectly normal what harry found most unusual about life at however the talking mirror or the clanking ghoul it was the fact that everybody there seemed to like him 
 
 mrs weasley fussed over the state of his socks and tried to force him to eat fourth helpings at every meal mr weasley liked harry to sit next to him at the dinner table so that he could bombard him with questions about life with muggles asking him to explain how things like plugs and the postal service worked 
 
 fascinating he would say as harry talked him through using a telephone ingenious really how many ways muggles have found of getting along without magic 
 
 harry heard from hogwarts one sunny morning about a week after he had arrived at the burrow he and ron went down to breakfast to find mr and mrs weasley and ginny already sitting at the kitchen table the moment she saw harry ginny accidentally knocked her porridge bowl to the floor with a loud clatter ginny seemed very prone to knocking things over whenever harry entered a room she dived under the table to retrieve the bowl and emerged with her face glowing like the setting sun pretending he noticed this harry sat down and took the toast mrs weasley offered him 
 
 letters from school said mr weasley passing harry and ron identical envelopes of yellowish parchment addressed in green ink dumbledore already knows here harry miss a trick that man you got them too he added as fred and george ambled in still in their pajamas 
 
 for a few minutes there was silence as they all read their letters told him to catch the hogwarts express as usual from cross station on september first there was also a list of the new books need for the coming year 
 
 students will require 
 
 the standard book of spells grade by miranda goshawk 
 
 break with a banshee by gilderoy lockhart 
 
 gadding with ghouls by gilderoy lockhart 
 
 holidays with hags by gilderoy lockhart 
 
 travels with trolls by gilderoy lockhart 
 
 voyages with vampires by gilderoy lockhart 
 
 wanderings with werewolves by gilderoy lockhart 
 
 year with the yeti by gilderoy lockhart 
 
 fred who had finished his own list peered over at 
 
 been told to get all books too he said the new defense against the dark arts teacher must be a fan bet a witch 
 
 at this point fred caught his eye and quickly busied himself with the marmalade 
 
 that lot come cheap said george with a quick look at his parents books are really expensive 
 
 well manage said mrs weasley but she looked worried i expect be able to pick up a lot of things secondhand 
 
 oh are you starting at hogwarts this year harry asked ginny 
 
 she nodded blushing to the roots of her flaming hair and put her elbow in the butter dish fortunately no one saw this except harry because just then elder brother percy walked in he was already dressed his hogwarts prefect badge pinned to his sweater vest 
 
 morning all said percy briskly lovely day 
 
 he sat down in the only remaining chair but leapt up again almost immediately pulling from underneath him a molting gray feather duster at least that was what harry thought it was until he saw that it was breathing 
 
 errol said ron taking the limp owl from percy and extracting a letter from under its wing finally got answer i wrote to her saying we were going to try and rescue you from the dursleys 
 
 he carried errol to a perch just inside the back door and tried to stand him on it but errol flopped straight off again so ron lay him on the draining board instead muttering pathetic then he ripped open letter and read it out loud 
 
 dear ron and harry if there 
 
 i hope everything went all right and that harry is okay and that you do anything illegal to get him out ron because that would get harry into trouble too been really worried and if harry is all right will you please let me know at once but perhaps it would be better if you used a different owl because i think another delivery might finish your one off 
 
 very busy with schoolwork of course how can she be said ron in horror on vacation and going to london next wednesday to buy my new books why we meet in diagon alley 
 
 let me know happening as soon as you can love from hermione 
 
 well that fits in nicely we can go and get all your things then too said mrs weasley starting to clear the table you all up to today 
 
 harry ron fred and george were planning to go up the hill to a small paddock the weasleys owned it was surrounded by trees that blocked it from view of the village below meaning that they could practice quidditch there as long as they fly too high 
 
 they use real quidditch balls which would have been hard to explain if they had escaped and flown away over the village instead they threw apples for one another to catch they took turns riding nimbus two thousand which was easily the best broom old shooting star was often outstripped by passing butterflies 
 
 five minutes later they were marching up the hill broomsticks over their shoulders they had asked percy if he wanted to join them but he had said he was busy harry had only seen percy at mealtimes so far he stayed shut in his room the rest of the time 
 
 wish i knew what he was up to said fred frowning not himself his exam results came the day before you did twelve and he hardly gloated at all 
 
 ordinary wizarding levels george explained seeing puzzled look bill got twelve too if not careful have another head boy in the family i think i could stand the shame 
 
 bill was the oldest weasley brother he and the next brother charlie had already left hogwarts harry had never met either of them but knew that charlie was in romania studying dragons and bill in egypt working for the bank gringotts 
 
 dunno how mum and dad are going to afford all our school stuff this year said george after a while five sets of lockhart books and ginny needs robes and a wand and everything 
 
 harry said nothing he felt a bit awkward stored in an underground vault at gringotts in london was a small fortune that his parents had left him of course it was only in the wizarding world that he had money you use galleons sickles and knuts in muggle shops he had never mentioned his gringotts bank account to the dursleys he think their horror of anything connected with magic would stretch to a large pile of gold 
 
 mrs weasley woke them all early the following wednesday after a quick half a dozen bacon sandwiches each they pulled on their coats and mrs weasley took a flowerpot off the kitchen mantelpiece and peered inside 
 
 running low arthur she sighed have to buy some more today ah well guests first after you harry dear 
 
 and she offered him the flowerpot 
 
 harry stared at them all watching him 
 
 am i supposed to do he stammered 
 
 never traveled by floo powder said ron suddenly sorry harry i forgot 
 
 never said mr weasley but how did you get to diagon alley to buy your school things last year 
 
 i went on the underground 
 
 really said mr weasley eagerly were there escapators how exactly 
 
 not now arthur said mrs weasley floo a lot quicker dear but goodness me if never used it before 
 
 be all right mum said fred harry watch us first 
 
 he took a pinch of glittering powder out of the flowerpot stepped up to the fire and threw the powder into the flames 
 
 with a roar the fire turned emerald green and rose higher than fred who stepped right into it shouted diagon alley and vanished 
 
 you must speak clearly dear mrs weasley told harry as george dipped his hand into the flowerpot and be sure to get out at the right grate 
 
 the right what said harry nervously as the fire roared and whipped george out of sight too 
 
 well there are an awful lot of wizard fires to choose from you know but as long as spoken clearly 
 
 be fine molly fuss said mr weasley helping himself to floo powder too 
 
 but dear if he got lost how would we ever explain to his aunt and uncle 
 
 they mind harry reassured her dudley would think it was a brilliant joke if i got lost up a chimney worry about that 
 
 well all right you go after arthur said mrs weasley now when you get into the fire say where going 
 
 and keep your elbows tucked in ron advised 
 
 and your eyes shut said mrs weasley the soot 
 
 fidget said ron or you might well fall out of the wrong fireplace 
 
 but panic and get out too early wait until you see fred and george 
 
 trying hard to bear all this in mind harry took a pinch of floo powder and walked to the edge of the fire he took a deep breath scattered the powder into the flames and stepped forward the fire felt like a warm breeze he opened his mouth and immediately swallowed a lot of hot ash 
 
 alley he coughed 
 
 it felt as though he was being sucked down a giant drain he seemed to be spinning very fast the roaring in his ears was deafening he tried to keep his eyes open but the whirl of green flames made him feel sick something hard knocked his elbow and he tucked it in tightly still spinning and spinning now it felt as though cold hands were slapping his face squinting through his glasses he saw a blurred stream of fireplaces and snatched glimpses of the rooms beyond his bacon sandwiches were churning inside him he closed his eyes again wishing it would stop and then 
 
 he fell face forward onto cold stone and felt the bridge of his glasses snap 
 
 dizzy and bruised covered in soot he got gingerly to his feet holding his broken glasses up to his eyes he was quite alone but where he was he had no idea all he could tell was that he was standing in the stone fireplace of what looked like a large dimly lit shop but nothing in here was ever likely to be on a hogwarts school list 
 
 a glass case nearby held a withered hand on a cushion a bloodstained pack of cards and a staring glass eye masks stared down from the walls an assortment of human bones lay upon the counter and rusty spiked instruments hung from the ceiling even worse the dark narrow street harry could see through the dusty shop window was definitely not diagon alley 
 
 the sooner he got out of here the better nose still stinging where it had hit the hearth harry made his way swiftly and silently toward the door but before got halfway toward it two people appeared on the other side of the glass and one of them was the very last person harry wanted to meet when he was lost covered in soot and wearing broken glasses draco malfoy 
 
 harry looked quickly around and spotted a large black cabinet to his left he shot inside it and pulled the doors closed leaving a small crack to peer through seconds later a bell clanged and malfoy stepped into the shop 
 
 the man who followed could only be father he had the same pale pointed face and identical cold gray eyes mr malfoy crossed the shop looking lazily at the items on display and rang a bell on the counter before turning to his son and saying touch nothing draco 
 
 malfoy who had reached for the glass eye said i thought you were going to buy me a present 
 
 i said i would buy you a racing broom said his father drumming his fingers on the counter 
 
 the good of that if not on the house team said malfoy looking sulky and harry potter got a nimbus two thousand last year special permission from dumbledore so he could play for gryffindor not even that good just because famous famous for having a stupid scar on his forehead 
 
 malfoy bent down to examine a shelf full of skulls 
 
 everyone thinks so smart wonderful potter with his scar and his broomstick 
 
 you have told me this at least a dozen times already said mr malfoy with a quelling look at his son and i would remind you that it is not prudent to appear less than fond of harry potter not when most of our kind regard him as the hero who made the dark lord disappear ah mr borgin 
 
 a stooping man had appeared behind the counter smoothing his greasy hair back from his face 
 
 mr malfoy what a pleasure to see you again said mr borgin in a voice as oily as his hair delighted and young master malfoy too charmed how may i be of assistance i must show you just in today and very reasonably priced 
 
 not buying today mr borgin but selling said mr malfoy 
 
 selling the smile faded slightly from mr face 
 
 you have heard of course that the ministry is conducting more raids said mr malfoy taking a roll of parchment from his inside pocket and unraveling it for mr borgin to read i have a few ah items at home that might embarrass me if the ministry were to call 
 
 mr borgin fixed a pair of to his nose and looked down the list 
 
 the ministry presume to trouble you sir surely 
 
 mr lip curled 
 
 i have not been visited yet the name malfoy still commands a certain respect yet the ministry grows ever more meddlesome there are rumors about a new muggle protection act no doubt that fool arthur weasley is behind it 
 
 harry felt a hot surge of anger 
 
 and as you see certain of these poisons might make it appear 
 
 i understand sir of course said mr borgin let me see 
 
 can i have that interrupted draco pointing at the withered hand on its cushion 
 
 ah the hand of glory said mr borgin abandoning mr list and scurrying over to draco insert a candle and it gives light only to the holder best friend of thieves and plunderers your son has fine taste sir 
 
 i hope my son will amount to more than a thief or a plunderer borgin said mr malfoy coldly and mr borgin said quickly no offense sir no offense meant 
 
 though if his grades pick up said mr malfoy more coldly still that may indeed be all he is fit for 
 
 not my fault retorted draco the teachers all have favorites that hermione granger 
 
 i would have thought be ashamed that a girl of no wizard family beat you in every exam snapped mr malfoy 
 
 ha said harry under his breath pleased to see draco looking both abashed and angry 
 
 the same all over said mr borgin in his oily voice wizard blood is counting for less everywhere 
 
 not with me said mr malfoy his long nostrils flaring 
 
 no sir nor with me sir said mr borgin with a deep bow 
 
 in that case perhaps we can return to my list said mr malfoy shortly i am in something of a hurry borgin i have important business elsewhere today 
 
 they started to haggle harry watched nervously as draco drew nearer and nearer to his hiding place examining the objects for sale draco paused to examine a long coil of rope and to read smirking the card propped on a magnificent necklace of opals caution do not touch cursed has claimed the lives of nineteen muggle owners to date 
 
 draco turned away and saw the cabinet right in front of him he walked forward he stretched out his hand for the handle done said mr malfoy at the counter come draco 
 
 harry wiped his forehead on his sleeve as draco turned away 
 
 good day to you mr borgin expect you at the manor tomorrow to pick up the goods 
 
 the moment the door had closed mr borgin dropped his oily manner 
 
 good day yourself mister malfoy and if the stories are true you sold me half of hidden in your manor 
 
 muttering darkly mr borgin disappeared into a back room harry waited for a minute in case he came back then quietly as he could slipped out of the cabinet past the glass cases and out of the shop door 
 
 clutching his broken glasses to his face harry stared around he had emerged into a dingy alleyway that seemed to be made up entirely of shops devoted to the dark arts the one just left borgin and burkes looked like the largest but opposite was a nasty window display of shrunken heads and two doors down a large cage was alive with gigantic black spiders two wizards were watching him from the shadow of a doorway muttering to each other feeling jumpy harry set off trying to hold his glasses on straight and hoping against hope be able to find a way out of here 
 
 an old wooden street sign hanging over a shop selling poisonous candles told him he was in knockturn alley this help as harry had never heard of such a place he supposed he spoken clearly enough through his mouthful of ashes back in the trying to stay calm he wondered what to do 
 
 not lost are you my dear said a voice in his ear making him jump 
 
 an aged witch stood in front of him holding a tray of what looked horribly like whole human fingernails she leered at him showing mossy teeth harry backed away 
 
 fine thanks he said just 
 
 harry what think yer there 
 
 heart leapt so did the witch a load of fingernails cascaded down over her feet and she cursed as the massive form of hagrid the came striding toward them eyes flashing over his great bristling beard 
 
 hagrid harry croaked in relief i was lost floo powder 
 
 hagrid seized harry by the scruff of the neck and pulled him away from the witch knocking the tray right out of her hands her shrieks followed them all the way along the twisting alleyway out into bright sunlight harry saw a familiar marble building in the distance gringotts bank hagrid had steered him right into diagon alley 
 
 yer a mess said hagrid gruffly brushing soot off harry so forcefully he nearly knocked him into a barrel of dragon dung outside an apothecary knockturn alley i dunno dodgy place harry no one ter see yeh down there 
 
 i realized that said harry ducking as hagrid made to brush him off again i told you i was lost what were you doing down there anyway 
 
 i was a repellent growled hagrid school cabbages yer not on yer own 
 
 staying with the weasleys but we got separated harry explained got to go and find them 
 
 they set off together down the street 
 
 how come yeh never wrote back ter me said hagrid as harry jogged alongside him he had to take three steps to every stride of enormous boots harry explained all about dobby and the dursleys 
 
 lousy muggles growled hagrid if known 
 
 harry harry over here 
 
 harry looked up and saw hermione granger standing at the top of the white flight of steps to gringotts she ran down to meet them her bushy brown hair flying behind her 
 
 what happened to your glasses hello hagrid oh wonderful to see you two again are you coming into gringotts harry 
 
 as soon as found the weasleys said harry 
 
 yeh have long ter wait hagrid said with a grin 
 
 harry and hermione looked around sprinting up the crowded street were ron fred george percy and mr weasley 
 
 harry mr weasley panted we hoped only gone one grate too far he mopped his glistening bald patch frantic coming now 
 
 where did you come out ron asked 
 
 knockturn alley said hagrid grimly 
 
 excellent said fred and george together 
 
 never been allowed in said ron enviously 
 
 i should ruddy well think not growled hagrid mrs weasley now came galloping into view her handbag swinging wildly in one hand ginny just clinging onto the other 
 
 oh harry oh my dear you could have been anywhere 
 
 gasping for breath she pulled a large clothes brush out of her bag and began sweeping off the soot hagrid managed to beat away mr weasley took glasses gave them a tap of his wand and returned them good as new 
 
 well gotta be off said hagrid who was having his hand wrung by mrs weasley knockturn alley if you found him hagrid see yer at hogwarts and he strode away head and shoulders taller than anyone else in the packed street 
 
 guess who i saw in borgin and burkes harry asked ron and hermione as they climbed the gringotts steps malfoy and his father 
 
 did lucius malfoy buy anything said mr weasley sharply behind them 
 
 no he was selling 
 
 so worried said mr weasley with grim satisfaction oh love to get lucius malfoy for something 
 
 you be careful arthur said mrs weasley sharply as they were bowed into the bank by a goblin at the door that trouble go biting off more than you can chew 
 
 so you think a match for lucius malfoy said mr weasley indignantly but he was distracted almost at once by the sight of parents who were standing nervously at the counter that ran all along the great marble hall waiting for hermione to introduce them 
 
 but muggles said mr weasley delightedly we must have a drink that got there oh changing muggle money molly look he pointed excitedly at the notes in mr hand 
 
 meet you back here ron said to hermione as the weasleys and harry were led off to their underground vaults by another gringotts goblin 
 
 the vaults were reached by means of small carts that sped along miniature train tracks through the underground tunnels harry enjoyed the breakneck journey down to the but felt dreadful far worse than he had in knockturn alley when it was opened there was a very small pile of silver sickles inside and just one gold galleon mrs weasley felt right into the corners before sweeping the whole lot into her bag harry felt even worse when they reached his vault he tried to block the contents from view as he hastily shoved handfuls of coins into a leather bag 
 
 back outside on the marble steps they all separated percy muttered vaguely about needing a new quill fred and george had spotted their friend from hogwarts lee jordan mrs weasley and ginny were going to a secondhand robe shop mr weasley was insisting on taking the grangers off to the leaky cauldron for a drink 
 
 all meet at flourish and blotts in an hour to buy your schoolbooks said mrs weasley setting off with ginny and not one step down knockturn alley she shouted at the backs 
 
 harry ron and hermione strolled off along the winding cobbled street the bag of gold silver and bronze jangling cheerfully in pocket was clamoring to be spent so he bought three large ice creams which they slurped happily as they wandered up the alley examining the fascinating shop windows ron gazed longingly at a full set of chudley cannon robes in the windows of quality quidditch supplies until hermione dragged them off to buy ink and parchment next door in gambol and japes wizarding joke shop they met fred george and lee jordan who were stocking up on dr fabulous fireworks and in a tiny junk shop full of broken wands lopsided brass scales and old cloaks covered in potion stains they found percy deeply immersed in a small and deeply boring book called prefects who gained power 
 
 a study of hogwarts prefects and their later careers ron read aloud off the back cover that sounds fascinating 
 
 go away percy snapped 
 
 course very ambitious percy got it all planned out he wants to be minister of magic ron told harry and hermione in an undertone as they left percy to it 
 
 an hour later they headed for flourish and blotts they were by no means the only ones making their way to the bookshop as they approached it they saw to their surprise a large crowd jostling outside the doors trying to get in the reason for this was proclaimed by a large banner stretched across the upper windows 
 
 gilderoy lockhart 
 
 will be signing copies of his autobiography 
 
 magical me 
 
 today to 
 
 we can actually meet him hermione squealed i mean written almost the whole booklist 
 
 the crowd seemed to be made up mostly of witches around mrs age a wizard stood at the door saying calmly please ladies push there mind the books now 
 
 harry ron and hermione squeezed inside a long line wound right to the back of the shop where gilderoy lockhart was signing his books they each grabbed a copy of the standard book of spells grade and sneaked up the line to where the rest of the weasleys were standing with mr and mrs granger 
 
 oh there you are good said mrs weasley she sounded breathless and kept patting her hair be able to see him in a minute 
 
 gilderoy lockhart came slowly into view seated at a table surrounded by large pictures of his own face all winking and flashing dazzlingly white teeth at the crowd the real lockhart was wearing robes of blue that exactly matched his eyes his pointed hat was set at a jaunty angle on his wavy hair 
 
 a short man was dancing around taking photographs with a large black camera that emitted puffs of purple smoke with every blinding flash 
 
 out of the way there he snarled at ron moving back to get a better shot this is for the daily prophet 
 
 big deal said ron rubbing his foot where the photographer had stepped on it 
 
 gilderoy lockhart heard him he looked up he saw ron and then he saw harry he stared then he leapt to his feet and positively shouted it be harry potter 
 
 the crowd parted whispering excitedly lockhart dived forward seized arm and pulled him to the front the crowd burst into applause face burned as lockhart shook his hand for the photographer who was clicking away madly wafting thick smoke over the weasleys 
 
 nice big smile harry said lockhart through his own gleaming teeth together you and i are worth the front page 
 
 when he finally let go of hand harry could hardly feel his fingers he tried to sidle back over to the weasleys but lockhart threw an arm around his shoulders and clamped him tightly to his side 
 
 ladies and gentlemen he said loudly waving for quiet what an extraordinary moment this is the perfect moment for me to make a little announcement been sitting on for some time 
 
 when young harry here stepped into flourish and blotts today he only wanted to buy my autobiography which i shall be happy to present him now free of charge the crowd applauded again he had no idea lockhart continued giving harry a little shake that made his glasses slip to the end of his nose that he would shortly be getting much much more than my book magical me he and his schoolmates will in fact be getting the real magical me yes ladies and gentlemen i have great pleasure and pride in announcing that this september i will be taking up the post of defense against the dark arts teacher at hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry 
 
 the crowd cheered and clapped and harry found himself being presented with the entire works of gilderoy lockhart staggering slightly under their weight he managed to make his way out of the limelight to the edge of the room where ginny was standing next to her new cauldron 
 
 you have these harry mumbled to her tipping the books into the cauldron buy my own 
 
 bet you loved that you potter said a voice harry had no trouble recognizing he straightened up and found himself with draco malfoy who was wearing his usual sneer 
 
 famous harry potter said malfoy even go into a bookshop without making the front page 
 
 leave him alone he want all that said ginny it was the first time she had spoken in front of harry she was glaring at malfoy 
 
 potter got yourself a girlfriend drawled malfoy ginny went scarlet as ron and hermione fought their way over both clutching stacks of books 
 
 oh you said ron looking at malfoy as if he were something unpleasant on the sole of his shoe bet surprised to see harry here eh 
 
 not as surprised as i am to see you in a shop weasley retorted malfoy i suppose your parents will go hungry for a month to pay for all those 
 
 ron went as red as ginny he dropped his books into the cauldron too and started toward malfoy but harry and hermione grabbed the back of his jacket 
 
 ron said mr weasley struggling over with fred and george what are you doing too crowded in here go outside 
 
 well well well arthur weasley 
 
 it was mr malfoy he stood with his hand on shoulder sneering in just the same way 
 
 lucius said mr weasley nodding coldly 
 
 busy time at the ministry i hear said mr malfoy all those raids i hope paying you overtime 
 
 he reached into cauldron and extracted from amid the glossy lockhart books a very old very battered copy of a guide to transfiguration 
 
 obviously not mr malfoy said dear me the use of being a disgrace to the name of wizard if they even pay you well for it 
 
 mr weasley flushed darker than either ron or ginny 
 
 we have a very different idea of what disgraces the name of wizard malfoy he said 
 
 clearly said mr malfoy his pale eyes straying to mr and mrs granger who were watching apprehensively the company you keep weasley and i thought your family could sink no lower 
 
 there was a thud of metal as cauldron went flying mr weasley had thrown himself at mr malfoy knocking him backward into a bookshelf dozens of heavy spellbooks came thundering down on all their heads there was a yell of get him dad from fred or george mrs weasley was shrieking no arthur no the crowd stampeded backward knocking more shelves over gentlemen please please cried the assistant and then louder than all 
 
 break it up there gents break it up 
 
 hagrid was wading toward them through the sea of books in an instant he had pulled mr weasley and mr malfoy apart mr weasley had a cut lip and mr malfoy had been hit in the eye by an encyclopedia of toadstools he was still holding old transfiguration book he thrust it at her his eyes glittering with malice 
 
 here girl take your book the best your father can give you pulling himself out of grip he beckoned to draco and swept from the shop 
 
 yeh ignored him arthur said hagrid almost lifting mr weasley off his feet as he straightened his robes rotten ter the core the whole family everyone knows that no worth bad blood what it is come on now get outta here 
 
 the assistant looked as though he wanted to stop them leaving but he barely came up to waist and seemed to think better of it they hurried up the street the grangers shaking with fright and mrs weasley beside herself with fury 
 
 a fine example to set for your children brawling in public what gilderoy lockhart thought 
 
 he was pleased said fred you hear him as we were leaving he was asking that bloke from the daily prophet if be able to work the fight into his report said it was all publicity 
 
 but it was a subdued group that headed back to the fireside in the leaky cauldron where harry the weasleys and all their shopping would be traveling back to the burrow using floo powder they said to the grangers who were leaving the pub for the muggle street on the other side mr weasley started to ask them how bus stops worked but stopped quickly at the look on mrs face 
 
 harry took off his glasses and put them safely in his pocket before helping himself to floo powder it definitely his favorite way to travel 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the chamber of secrets 
 

lionfish nov chapter four the leaky cauldroncontents prev chapter next chapter 
 it took harry several days to get used to his strange new freedom never before had he been able to get up whenever he wanted or eat whatever he fancied he could even go wherever he pleased as long as it was in diagon alley and as this long cobbled street was packed with the most fascinating wizarding shops in the world harry felt no desire to break his word to fudge and stray back into the muggle world 
 
 harry ate breakfast each morning in the leaky cauldron where he liked watching the other guests funny little witches from the country up for a shopping wizards arguing over the latest article in transfiguration today warlocks raucous dwarfs and once what looked suspiciously like a hag who ordered a plate of raw liver from behind a thick woolen balaclava 
 
 after breakfast harry would go out into the backyard take out his wand tap the third brick from the left above the trash bin and stand back as the archway into diagon alley opened in the wall 
 
 harry spent the long sunny days exploring the shops and eating under the brightly colored umbrellas outside cafes where his fellow diners were showing one another their purchases a lunascope old boy no more messing around with moon charts see or else discussing the case of sirius black personally i let any of the children out alone until back in azkaban harry have to do his homework under the blankets by flashlight anymore now he could sit in the bright sunshine outside florean ice cream parlor finishing all his essays with occasional help from florean fortescue himself who apart from knowing a great deal about medieval witch burnings gave harry free sundaes every half an hour 
 
 once harry had refilled his money bag with gold galleons silver sickles and bronze knuts from his vault at gringotts he had to exercise a lot of not to spend the whole lot at once he had to keep reminding himself that he had five years to go at hogwarts and how it would feel to ask the dursleys for money for spellbooks to stop himself from buying a handsome set of solid gold gobstones a wizarding game rather like marbles in which the stones squirt a liquid into the other face when they lose a point he was sorely tempted too by the perfect moving model of the galaxy in a large glass ball which would have meant he never had to take another astronomy lesson but the thing that tested resolution most appeared in his favorite shop quality quidditch supplies a week after arrived at the leaky cauldron 
 
 curious to know what the crowd in the shop was staring at harry edged his way inside and squeezed in among the excited witches and wizards until he glimpsed a newly erected podium on which was mounted the most magnificent broom he had ever seen in his life 
 
 just come out prototype a wizard was telling his companion 
 
 the fastest broom in the world it dad squeaked a boy younger than harry who was swinging off his arm 
 
 irish international just put in an order for seven of these beauties the proprietor of the shop told the crowd and favorites for the world cup 
 
 a large witch in front of harry moved and he was able to read the sign next to the broom 
 
 the firebolt 
 this racing broom sports a superfine handle of ash treated with a polish and with its own registration number each individually selected birch twig in the broomtail has been honed to aerodynamic perfection giving the firebolt unsurpassable balance and pinpoint precision the firebolt has an acceleration of miles an hour in ten seconds and incorporates an unbreakable braking charm price on request 
 price on requestharry like to think how much gold the firebolt would cost he had never wanted anything as much in his whole life but he had never lost a quidditch match on his nimbus two thousand and what was the point in emptying his gringotts vault for the firebolt when he had a very good broom already harry ask for the price but he returned almost every day after that just to look at the firebolt 
 
 there were however things that harry needed to buy he went to the apothecary to replenish his store of potions ingredients and as his school robes were now several inches too short in the arm and leg he visited madam robes for all occasions and bought new ones most important of all he had to buy his new schoolbooks which would include those for his two new subjects care of magical creatures and divination 
 
 harry got a surprise as he looked in at the bookshop window instead of the usual display of spellbooks the size of paving slabs there was a large iron cage behind the glass that held about a hundred copies of the monster book of monsters torn pages were flying everywhere as the books grappled with each other locked together in furious wrestling matches and snapping aggressively 
 
 harry pulled his booklist out of his pocket and consulted it for the first time the monster book of monsters was listed as the required book for care of magical creatures now harry understood why hagrid had said it would come in useful he felt relieved he had been wondering whether hagrid wanted help with some terrifying new pet 
 
 as harry entered flourish and blotts the manager came hurrying toward him 
 
 hogwarts he said abruptly come to get your new books 
 
 yes said harry i need 
 
 get out of the way said the manager impatiently brushing harry aside he drew on a pair of very thick gloves picked up a large knobbly walking stick and proceeded toward the door of the monster books cage 
 
 hang on said harry quickly already got one of those 
 
 have you a look of enormous relief spread over the face thank heavens for that been bitten five times already this morning 
 
 a loud ripping noise rent the air two of the monster books had seized a third and were pulling it apart 
 
 stop it stop it cried the manager poking the walking stick through the bars and knocking the books apart never stocking them again never been bedlam i thought seen the worst when we bought two hundred copies of the invisible book of invisibility cost a fortune and we never found themwellis there anything else i can help you with 
 
 yes said harry looking down his booklist i need unfogging the future by cassandra vablatsky 
 
 ah starting divination are you said the manager stripping off his gloves and leading harry into the back of the shop where there was a corner devoted to a small table was stacked with volumes such as predicting the unpredictable insulate yourself against shocks and broken balls when fortunes turn foul 
 
 here you are said the manager who had climbed a set of steps to take down a thick book unfogging the future very good guide to all your basic methods palmistry crystal balls bird entrails 
 
 but harry listening his eyes had fallen on another book which was among a display on a small table death omens what to do when you know the worst is coming 
 
 oh i read that if i were you said the manager lightly looking to see what harry was staring at start seeing death omens everywhere enough to frighten anyone to death 
 
 but harry continued to stare at the front cover of the book it showed a black dog large as a bear with gleaming eyes it looked oddly familiar 
 
 the manager pressed unfogging the future into hands 
 
 anything else he said 
 
 yes said harry tearing his eyes away from the and dazedly consulting his booklist er i need intermediate transfiguration and the standard book of spells grade three 
 
 harry emerged from flourish and blotts ten minutes later with his new books under his arms and made his way back to the leaky cauldron hardly noticing where he was going and bumping into several people 
 
 he tramped up the stairs to his room went inside and tipped his books onto his bed somebody had been in to tidy the windows were open and sun was pouring inside harry could hear the buses rolling by in the unseen muggle street behind him and the sound of the invisible crowd below in diagon alley he caught sight of himself in the mirror over the basin 
 
 it have been a death omen he told his reflection defiantly i was panicking when i saw that thing in magnolia crescentit was probably just a stray dog 
 
 he raised his hand automatically and tried to make his hair lie flat 
 
 fighting a losing battle there dear said his mirror in a wheezy voice 
 
 as the days slipped by harry started looking wherever he went for a sign of ron or hermione plenty of hogwarts students were arriving in diagon alley now with the start of term so near harry met seamus finnigan and dean thomas his fellow gryffindors in quality quidditch supplies where they too were ogling the firebolt he also ran into the real neville longbottom a forgetful boy outside flourish and blotts harry stop to chat neville appeared to have mislaid his booklist and was being told off by his very grandmother harry hoped she never found out that pretended to be neville while on the run from the ministry of magic 
 
 harry woke on the last day of the holidays thinking that he would at least meet ron and hermione tomorrow on the hogwarts express he got up dressed went for a last look at the firebolt and was just wondering where have lunch when someone yelled his name and he turned 
 
 harry harry 
 
 they were there both of them sitting outside florean ice cream parlor ron looking incredibly freckly hermione very brown both waving frantically at him 
 
 finally said ron grinning at harry as he sat down we went to the leaky cauldron but they said left and we went to flourish and blotts and madam and 
 
 i got all my school stuff last week harry explained and how come you knew staying at the leaky cauldron 
 
 dad said ron simply 
 
 mr weasley who worked at the ministry of magic would of course have heard the whole story of what had happened to aunt marge 
 
 did you really blow up your aunt harry said hermione in a very serious voice 
 
 i mean to said harry while ron roared with laughter i just lost control 
 
 not funny ron said hermione sharply honestly amazed harry expelled 
 
 so am i admitted harry forget expelled i thought i was going to be arrested he looked at ron your dad know why fudge let me off does he 
 
 probably cause you it shrugged ron still chuckling famous harry potter and all that hate to see what the do to me if i blew up an aunt mind you have to dig me up first because mum killed me anyway you can ask dad yourself this evening staying at the leaky cauldron tonight too so you can come to cross with us tomorrow there as well 
 
 hermione nodded beaming mum and dad dropped me off this morning with all my hogwarts things 
 
 excellent said harry happily so have you got all your new books and stuff 
 
 look at this said ron pulling a long thin box out of a bag and opening it wand fourteen inches willow containing one unicorn and got all our books he pointed at a large bag under his chair what about those monster books eh the assistant nearly cried when we said we wanted two 
 
 all that hermione harry asked pointing at not one but three bulging bags in the chair next to her 
 
 well taking more new subjects than you i said hermione those are my books for arithmancy care of magical creatures divination the study of ancient runes muggle studies 
 
 what are you doing muggle studies for said ron rolling his eyes at harry your mum and dad are muggles you already know all about muggles 
 
 but be fascinating to study them from the wizarding point of view said hermione earnestly 
 
 are you planning to eat or sleep at all this year hermione asked harry while ron sniggered hermione ignored them 
 
 still got ten galleons she said checking her purse my birthday in september and mum and dad gave me some money to get myself an early birthday present 
 
 how about a nice book said ron innocently 
 
 no i think so said hermione composedly i really want an owl i mean got hedwig and got errol 
 
 i said ron a family owl all got is scabbers he pulled his pet rat out of his pocket and i want to get him checked over he added placing scabbers on the table in front of them i think egypt agreed with him 
 
 scabbers was looking thinner than usual and there was a definite droop to his whiskers 
 
 a magical creature shop just over there said harry who knew diagon alley very well by now you could see if got anything for scabbers and hermione can get her owl 
 
 so they paid for their ice cream and crossed the street to the magical menagerie 
 
 there much room inside every inch of wall was hidden by cages it was smelly and very noisy because the occupants of these cages were all squeaking squawking jabbering or hissing the witch behind the counter was already advising a wizard on the care of newts so harry ron and hermione waited examining the cages 
 
 a pair of enormous purple toads sat gulping wetly and feasting on dead blowflies a gigantic tortoise with a shell was glittering near the window poisonous orange snails were oozing slowly up the side of their glass tank and a fat white rabbit kept changing into a silk top hat and back again with a loud popping noise then there were cats of every color a noisy cage of ravens a basket of funny furballs that were humming loudly and on the counter a vast cage of sleek black rats that were playing some sort of skipping game using their long bald tails 
 
 the newt wizard left and ron approached the counter 
 
 my rat he told the witch been a bit ever since i brought him back from egypt 
 
 bang him on the counter said the witch pulling a pair of heavy black spectacles out of her pocket 
 
 ron lifted scabbers out of his inside pocket and placed him next to the cage of his fellow rats who stopped their skipping tricks and scuffled to the wire for a better took 
 
 like nearly everything ron owned scabbers the rat was secondhand he had once belonged to brother percy and a bit battered next to the glossy rats in the cage he looked especially woebegone 
 
 hm said the witch picking up scabbers how old is this rat 
 
 dunno said ron quite old he used to belong to my brother 
 
 what powers does he have said the witch examining scabbers closely 
 
 er the truth was that scabbers had never shown the faintest trace of interesting powers the eyes moved from tattered left ear to his front paw which had a toe missing and tutted loudly 
 
 been through the mill this one she said 
 
 he was like that when percy gave him to me said ron defensively 
 
 an ordinary common or garden rat like this be expected to live longer than three years or so said the witch now if you were looking for something a bit more you might like one of these 
 
 she indicated the black rats who promptly started skipping again ron muttered 
 
 well if you want a replacement you can try this rat tonic said the witch reaching under the counter and bringing out a small red bottle 
 
 okay said ron how much ouch 
 
 ron buckled as something huge and orange came soaring from the top of the highest cage landed on his head and then propelled itself spitting madly at scabbers 
 
 no crookshanks no cried the witch but scabbers shot from between her hands like a bar of soap landed on the floor and then scampered for the door 
 
 scabbers ron shouted racing out of the shop after him harry followed 
 
 it took them nearly ten minutes to catch scabbers who had taken refuge under a wastepaper bin outside quality quidditch supplies ron stuffed the trembling rat back into his pocket and straightened up massaging his head 
 
 what was that 
 
 it was either a very big cat or quite a small tiger said harry 
 
 hermione 
 
 probably getting her owl 
 
 they made their way back up the crowded street to the magical menagerie as they reached it hermione came out but she carrying an owl her arms were clamped tightly around the enormous ginger cat 
 
 you bought that monster said ron his mouth hanging open 
 
 gorgeous he said hermione glowing 
 
 that was a matter of opinion thought harry the ginger fur was thick and fluffy but it was definitely a bit bowlegged and its face looked grumpy and oddly squashed as though it had run headlong into a brick wall now that scabbers was out of sight however the cat was purring contentedly in arms 
 
 hermione that thing nearly scalped me said ron 
 
 he mean to did you crookshanks said hermione 
 
 and what about scabbers said ron pointing at the lump in his chest pocket he needs rest and relaxation he going to get it with that thing around 
 
 that reminds me you forgot your rat tonic said hermione slapping the small red bottle into hand and stop worrying crookshanks will be sleeping in my dormitory and scabbers in yours the problem poor crookshanks that witch said been in there for ages no one wanted him 
 
 wonder why said ron sarcastically as they set off toward the leaky cauldron 
 
 they found mr weasley sitting in the bar reading the daily prophet 
 
 harry he said smiling as he looked up how are you 
 
 fine thanks said harry as he ron and hermione joined mr weasley with their shopping 
 
 mr weasley put down his paper and harry saw the now familiar picture of sirius black staring up at him 
 
 they still caught him then he asked 
 
 no said mr weasley looking extremely grave pulled us all off our regular jobs at the ministry to try and find him but no luck so far 
 
 would we get a reward if we caught him asked ron be good to get some more money 
 
 be ridiculous ron said mr weasley who on closer inspection looked very strained not going to be caught by a wizard the azkaban guards get him back you mark my words 
 
 at that moment mrs weasley entered the bar laden with shopping bags and followed by the twins fred and george who were about to start their fifth year at hogwarts the newly elected head boy percy and the weasleys youngest child and only girl ginny 
 
 ginny who had always been very taken with harry seemed even more heartily embarrassed than usual when she saw him perhaps because he had saved her life during their previous year at hogwarts she went very red and muttered hello without looking at him percy however held out his hand solemnly as though he and harry had never met and said harry how nice to see you 
 
 hello percy said harry trying not to laugh 
 
 i hope well said percy pompously shaking hands it was rather like being introduced to the mayor 
 
 very well thanks 
 
 harry said fred elbowing percy out of the way and bowing deeply simply splendid to see you old boy 
 
 marvelous said george pushing fred aside and seizing hand in turn absolutely spiffing 
 
 percy scowled 
 
 enough now said mrs weasley 
 
 mum said fred as though only just spotted her and seizing her hand too how really corking to see you 
 
 i said enough said mrs weasley depositing her shopping in an empty chair hello harry dear i suppose heard our exciting news she pointed to the silver badge on chest second head boy in the family she said swelling with pride 
 
 and last fred muttered under his breath 
 
 i doubt that said mrs weasley frowning suddenly i notice they made you two prefects 
 
 what do we want to be prefects for said george looking revolted at the very idea take all the fun out of life 
 
 ginny giggled 
 
 you want to set a better example for your sister snapped mrs weasley 
 
 got other brothers to set her an example mother said percy loftily going up to change for dinner 
 
 he disappeared and george heaved a sigh 
 
 we tried to shut him in a pyramid he told harry but mum spotted us 
 
 
 
 dinner that night was a very enjoyable affair tom the innkeeper put three tables together in the parlor and the seven weasleys harry and hermione ate their way through five delicious courses 
 
 we getting to cross tomorrow dad asked fred as they dug into a sumptuous chocolate pudding 
 
 the providing a couple of cars said mr weasley 
 
 everyone looked up at him 
 
 why said percy curiously 
 
 because of you perce said george seriously and be little flags on the hoods with hb on them 
 
 for humongous bighead said fred 
 
 everyone except percy and mrs weasley snorted into their pudding 
 
 why are the ministry providing cars father percy asked again in a dignified voice 
 
 well as we got one anymore said mr weasley and as i work there doing me a favor 
 
 his voice was casual but harry help noticing that mr ears had gone red just like did when he was under pressure 
 
 good thing too said mrs weasley briskly do you realize how much luggage all got between you a nice sight be on the muggle undergroundyou are all packed you 
 
 ron put all his new things in his trunk yet said percy in a voice dumped them on my bed 
 
 better go and pack properly ron because we have much time in the morning mrs weasley called down the table ron scowled at percy 
 
 after dinner everyone felt very full and sleepy one by one they made their way upstairs to their rooms to check their things for the next day ron and percy were next door to harry he had just closed and locked his own trunk when he heard angry voices through the wall and went to see what was going on 
 
 the door of number twelve was ajar and percy was shouting 
 
 it was here on the bedside table i took it off for polishing 
 
 i touched it all right ron roared back 
 
 up said harry 
 
 my head boy badge is gone said percy rounding on harry 
 
 rat tonic said ron throwing things out of his trunk to look i think i left it in the bar 
 
 not going anywhere till found my badge yelled percy 
 
 get stuff packed harry said to ron and he went downstairs 
 
 harry was halfway along the passage to the bar which was now very dark when he heard another pair of angry voices coming from the parlor a second later he recognized them as mr and mrs weasleys he hesitated not wanting them to know heard them arguing when the sound of his own name made him stop then move closer to the parlor door 
 
 makes no sense not to tell him mr weasley was saying heatedly got a right to know tried to tell fudge but he insists on treating harry like a child thirteen years old and 
 
 arthur the truth would terrify him said mrs weasley shrilly do you really want to send harry back to school with that hanging over him for sake happy not knowing 
 
 i want to make him miserable i want to put him on his guard retorted mr weasley you know what harry and ron are like wandering off by themselves ended up in the forbidden forest twice but harry do that this year when i think what could have happened to him that night he ran away from home if the knight bus picked him up prepared to bet he would have been dead before the ministry found him 
 
 but not dead fine so the point 
 
 molly they say sirius mad and maybe he is but he was clever enough to escape from azkaban and supposed to be impossible been three weeks and no seen hide nor hair of him and i care what fudge keeps telling the daily prophet no nearer catching black than inventing wands the only thing we know for sure is what after 
 
 but harry will be perfectly safe at hogwarts 
 
 we thought azkaban was perfectly safe if black can break out of azkaban he can break into hogwarts 
 
 but no really sure that after harry 
 
 there was a thud on wood and harry was sure mr weasley had banged his fist on the table 
 
 molly how many times do i have to tell you they report it in the press because fudge wanted it kept quiet but fudge went out to azkaban the night black escaped the guards told fudge that blacks been talking in his sleep for a while now always the same words at at hogwarts black is deranged molly and he wants harry dead if you ask me he thinks murdering harry will bring back to power black lost everything the night harry stopped and had twelve years alone in azkaban to brood on that 
 
 there was a silence harry leaned still closer to the door desperate to hear more 
 
 well arthur you must do what you think is right but forgetting albus dumbledore i think anything could hurt harry at hogwarts while headmaster i suppose he knows about all this 
 
 of course he knows we had to ask him if he minds the azkaban guards stationing themselves around the entrances to the school grounds he happy about it but he agreed 
 
 not happy why he be happy if there to catch black 
 
 dumbledore fond of the azkaban guards said mr weasley heavily nor am i if it comes to thatbut when dealing with a wizard like black you sometimes have to join forces with those rather avoid 
 
 if they save harry 
 
 c then i will never say another word against them said mr weasley wearily late molly better go up 
 
 harry heard chairs move as quietly as he could he hurried down the passage to the bar and out of sight the parlor door opened and a few seconds later footsteps told him that mr and mrs weasley were climbing the stairs 
 
 the bottle of rat tonic was lying under the table they had sat at earlier harry waited until he heard mr and mrs bedroom door close then headed back upstairs with the bottle 
 
 fred and george were crouching in the shadows on the landing heaving with laughter as they listened to percy dismantling his and room in search of his badge 
 
 got it fred whispered to harry been improving it 
 
 the badge now read bighead boy 
 
 harry forced a laugh went to give ron the rat tonic then shut himself in his room and lay down on his bed 
 
 so sirius black was after him this explained everything fudge had been lenient with him because he was so relieved to find him alive made harry promise to stay in diagon alley where there were plenty of wizards to keep an eye on him and he was sending two ministry cars to take them all to the station tomorrow so that the weasleys could look after harry until he was on the train 
 
 harry lay listening to the muffled shouting next door and wondered why he feel more scared sirius black had murdered thirteen people with one curse mr and mrs weasley obviously thought harry would be if he knew the truth but harry happened to agree wholeheartedly with mrs weasley that the safest place on earth was wherever albus dumbledore happened to be people always say that dumbledore was the only person lord voldemort had ever been afraid of surely black as man would be just as frightened of him 
 
 and then there were these azkaban guards everyone kept talking about they seemed to scare most people senseless and if they were stationed all around the school chances of getting inside seemed very remote 
 
 no all in all the thing that bothered harry most was the fact that his chances of visiting hogsmeade now looked like zero nobody would want harry to leave the safety of the castle until black was caught in fact harry suspected his every move would be carefully watched until the danger had passed 
 
 he scowled at the dark ceiling did they think he look after himself escaped lord voldemort three times he completely useless 
 
 unbidden the image of the beast in the shadows of magnolia crescent crossed his mind what to do when you know the worst is coming 
 
 not going to be murdered harry said out loud 
 
 the spirit dear said his mirror sleepily 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the prisoner of azkaban 
 

lionfish nov chapter four back to the burrowcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 by twelve the next day school trunk was packed with his school things and all his most prized possessions the invisibility cloak he had inherited from his father the broomstick he had gotten from sirius the enchanted map of hogwarts he had been given by fred and george weasley last year he had emptied his hiding place under the loose floorboard of all food every nook and cranny of his bedroom for forgotten spellbooks or quills and taken down the chart on the wall counting down the days to september the first on which he liked to cross off the days remaining until his return to hogwarts 
 
 the atmosphere inside number four privet drive was extremely tense the imminent arrival at their house of an assortment of wizards was making the dursleys uptight and irritable uncle vernon had looked downright alarmed when harry informed him that the weasleys would be arriving at five the very next day 
 
 i hope you told them to dress properly these people he snarled at once seen the sort of stuff your lot wear better have the decency to put on normal clothes all 
 
 harry felt a slight sense of foreboding he had rarely seen mr or mrs weasley wearing anything that the dursleys would call normal their children might don muggle clothing during the holidays but mr and mrs weasley usually wore long robes in varying states of shabbiness harry bothered about what the neighbors would think but he was anxious about how rude the dursleys might be to the weasleys if they turned up looking like their worst idea of wizards 
 
 uncle vernon had put on his best suit to some people this might have looked like a gesture of welcome but harry knew it was because uncle vernon wanted to look impressive and intimidating dudley on the other hand looked somehow diminished this was not because the diet was at last taking effect but due to fright dudley had emerged from his last encounter with a fully grown wizard with a curly tail poking out of the seat of his trousers and aunt petunia and uncle vernon had had to pay for its removal at a private hospital in london it altogether surprising therefore that dudley kept running his hand nervously over his backside and walking sideways from room to room so as not to present the same target to the enemy 
 
 lunch was an almost silent meal dudley even protest at the food cottage cheese and grated celery aunt petunia eating anything at all her arms were folded her lips were pursed and she seemed to be chewing her tongue as though biting back the furious diatribe she longed to throw at harry 
 
 be driving of course uncle vernon barked across the table 
 
 er said harry 
 
 he thought of that how were the weasleys going to pick him up they have a car anymore the old ford anglia they had once owned was currently running wild in the forbidden forest at hogwarts but mr weasley had borrowed a ministry of magic car last year possibly he would do the same today 
 
 i think so said harry 
 
 uncle vernon snorted into his mustache normally uncle vernon would have asked what car mr weasley drove he tended to judge other men by how big and expensive their cars were but harry doubted whether uncle vernon would have taken to mr weasley even if he drove a ferrari 
 
 harry spent most of the afternoon in his bedroom he stand watching aunt petunia peer out through the net curtains every few seconds as though there had been a warning about an escaped rhinoceros finally at a quarter to five harry went back downstairs and into the living room 
 
 aunt petunia was compulsively straightening cushions uncle vernon was pretending to read the paper but his tiny eyes were not moving and harry was sure he was really listening with all his might for the sound of an approaching car dudley was crammed into an armchair his porky hands beneath him clamped firmly around his bottom harry take the tension he left the room and went and sat on the stairs in the hall his eyes on his watch and his heart pumping fast from excitement and nerves 
 
 but five came and then went uncle vernon perspiring slightly in his suit opened the front door peered up and down the street then withdrew his head quickly 
 
 late he snarled at harry 
 
 i know said harry maybe er the bad or something 
 
 ten past fivethen a quarter past fiveharry was starting to feel anxious himself now at half past he heard uncle vernon and aunt petunia conversing in terse mutters in the living room 
 
 no consideration at all 
 
 we had an engagement 
 
 maybe they think get invited to dinner if late 
 
 well they most certainly be said uncle vernon and harry heard him stand up and start pacing the living room take the boy and go be no hanging around if coming at all probably mistaken the day i daresay their kind set much store by punctuality either that or they drive some car broken d aaaaaaaarrrrrgh 
 
 harry jumped up from the other side of the living room door came the sounds of the three dursleys scrambling across the room next moment dudley came flying into the hall looking terrified 
 
 what happened said harry the matter 
 
 but dudley seem able to speak hands still clamped over his buttocks he waddled as fast as he could into the kitchen harry hurried into the living room 
 
 loud bangings and scrapings were coming from behind the dursleys fireplace which had a fake coal fire plugged in front of it 
 
 what is it gasped aunt petunia who had backed into the wall and was staring terrified toward the fire what is it vernon 
 
 but they were left in doubt barely a second longer voices could be heard from inside the blocked fireplace 
 
 ouch fred no go back go back been some kind of mistake tell george not to ouch george no no room go back quickly and tell ron 
 
 maybe harry can hear us dad maybe be able to let us out 
 
 there was a loud hammering of fists on the boards behind the electric fire 
 
 harry harry can you hear us 
 
 the dursleys rounded on harry like a pair of angry wolverines 
 
 what is this growled uncle vernon going on 
 
 they tried to get here by floo powder said harry fighting a mad desire to laugh they can travel by fire only blocked the fireplace hang on 
 
 he approached the fireplace and called through the boards 
 
 mr weasley can you hear me 
 
 the hammering stopped somebody inside the chimney piece said shh 
 
 mr weasley harrythe fireplace has been blocked up you be able to get through there 
 
 damn said mr voice what on earth did they want to block up the fireplace for 
 
 got an electric fire harry explained 
 
 really said mr voice excitedly eclectic you say with a plug gracious i must see thinkouch ron 
 
 voice now joined the others 
 
 what are we doing here has something gone wrong 
 
 oh no ron came voice very sarcastically no this is exactly where we wanted to end up 
 
 yeah having the time of our lives here said george whose voice sounded muffled as though he was squashed against the wall 
 
 boys boys said mr weasley vaguely trying to think what to waystand back harry 
 
 harry retreated to the sofa uncle vernon however moved forward 
 
 wait a moment he bellowed at the fire what exactly are you going to 
 
 bang 
 
 the electric fire shot across the room as the fireplace burst outward expelling mr weasley fred george and ron in a cloud of rubble and loose chippings aunt petunia shrieked and fell backward over the coffee table uncle vernon caught her before she hit the floor and gaped speechless at the weasleys all of whom had bright red hair including fred and george who were identical to the last freckle 
 
 better panted mr weasley brushing dust from his long green robes and straightening his glasses ah you must be aunt and uncle 
 
 tall thin and balding he moved toward uncle vernon his hand outstretched but uncle vernon backed away several paces dragging aunt petunia words utterly failed uncle vernon his best suit was covered in white dust which had settled in his hair and mustache and made him look as though he had just aged thirty years 
 
 er yes sorry about that said mr weasley lowering his hand and looking over his shoulder at the blasted fireplace all my fault it just occur to me that we be able to get out at the other end i had your fireplace connected to the floo network you see just for an afternoon you know so we could get harry muggle fireplaces supposed to be connected strictly speaking but got a useful contact at the floo regulation panel and he fixed it for me i can put it right in a jiffy though worry light a fire to send the boys back and then i can repair your fireplace before i disapparate 
 
 harry was ready to bet that the dursleys understood a single word of this they were still gaping at mr weasley thunderstruck aunt petunia staggered upright again and hid behind uncle vernon 
 
 hello harry said mr weasley brightly got your trunk ready 
 
 upstairs said harry grinning back 
 
 get it said fred at once winking at harry he and george left the room they knew where bedroom was having once rescued him from it in the dead of night harry suspected that fred and george were hoping for a glimpse of dudley they had heard a lot about him from harry 
 
 well said mr weasley swinging his arms slightly while he tried to find words to break the very nasty silence very erm very nice place got here 
 
 as the usually spotless living room was now covered in dust and bits of brick this remark go down too well with the dursleys uncle face purpled once more and aunt petunia started chewing her tongue again however they seemed too scared to actually say anything 
 
 mr weasley was looking around he loved everything to do with muggles harry could see him itching to go and examine the television and the video recorder 
 
 they run off eckeltricity do they he said knowledgeably ah yes i can see the plugs i collect plugs he added to uncle vernon and batteries got a very large collection of batteries my wife thinks mad but there you are 
 
 uncle vernon clearly thought mr weasley was mad too he moved ever so slightly to the right screening aunt petunia from view as though he thought mr weasley might suddenly run at them and attack 
 
 dudley suddenly reappeared in the room harry could hear the clunk of his trunk on the stairs and knew that the sounds had scared dudley out of the kitchen dudley edged along the wall gazing at mr weasley with terrified eyes and attempted to conceal himself behind his mother and father unfortunately uncle bulk while sufficient to hide bony aunt petunia was nowhere near enough to conceal dudley 
 
 ah this is your cousin is it harry said mr weasley taking another brave stab at making conversation 
 
 yep said harry dudley 
 
 he and ron exchanged glances and then quickly looked away from each other the temptation to burst out laughing was almost overwhelming dudley was still clutching his bottom as though afraid it might fall off mr weasley however seemed genuinely concerned at peculiar behavior indeed from the tone of his voice when he next spoke harry was quite sure that mr weasley thought dudley was quite as mad as the dursleys thought he was except that mr weasley felt sympathy rather than fear 
 
 having a good holiday dudley he said kindly 
 
 dudley whimpered harry saw his hands tighten still harder over his massive backside 
 
 fred and george came back into the room carrying school trunk they glanced around as they entered and spotted dudley their faces cracked into identical evil grins 
 
 ah right said mr weasley better get cracking then 
 
 he pushed up the sleeves of his robes and took out his wand harry saw the dursleys draw back against the wall as one 
 
 incendio said mr weasley pointing his wand at the hole in the wall behind him 
 
 flames rose at once in the fireplace crackling merrily as though they had been burning for hours mr weasley took a small drawstring bag from his pocket untied it took a pinch of the powder inside and threw it onto the flames which turned emerald green and roared higher than ever 
 
 off you go then fred said mr weasley 
 
 coming said fred oh no hang on 
 
 a bag of sweets had spilled out of pocket and the contents were now rolling in every direction big fat toffees in brightly colored wrappers 
 
 fred scrambled around cramming them back into his pocket then gave the dursleys a cheery wave stepped forward and walked right into the fire saying the burrow aunt petunia gave a little shuddering gasp there was a whooshing sound and fred vanished 
 
 right then george said mr weasley you and the trunk 
 
 harry helped george carry the trunk forward into the flames and turn it onto its end so that he could hold it better then with a second whoosh george had cried the burrow and vanished too 
 
 ron you next said mr weasley 
 
 see you said ron brightly to the dursleys he grinned broadly at harry then stepped into the fire shouted the burrow and disappeared 
 
 now harry and mr weasley alone remained 
 
 then harry said to the dursleys 
 
 they say anything at all harry moved toward the fire but just as he reached the edge of the hearth mr weasley put out a hand and held him back he was looking at the dursleys in amazement 
 
 harry said to you he said you hear him 
 
 it matter harry muttered to mr weasley honestly i care 
 
 mr weasley did not remove his hand from shoulder 
 
 you going to see your nephew till next summer he said to uncle vernon in mild indignation surely going to say 
 
 uncle face worked furiously the idea of being taught consideration by a man who had just blasted away half his living room wall seemed to be causing him intense suffering but mr wand was still in his hand and uncle tiny eyes darted to it once before he said very resentfully then 
 
 see you said harry putting one foot forward into the green flames which felt pleasantly like warm breath at that moment however a horrible gagging sound erupted behind him and aunt petunia started to scream 
 
 harry wheeled around dudley was no longer standing behind his parents he was kneeling beside the coffee table and he was gagging and sputtering on a purple slimy thing that was protruding from his mouth one bewildered second later harry realized that the thing was tongue and that a brightly colored toffee wrapper lay on the floor before him 
 
 aunt petunia hurled herself onto the ground beside dudley seized the end of his swollen tongue and attempted to wrench it out of his mouth unsurprisingly dudley yelled and sputtered worse than ever trying to fight her off uncle vernon was bellowing and waving his arms around and mr weasley had to shout to make himself heard 
 
 not to worry i can sort him out he yelled advancing on dudley with his wand outstretched but aunt petunia screamed worse than ever and threw herself on top of dudley shielding him from mr weasley 
 
 no really said mr weasley desperately a simple process it was the toffee my son fred real practical joker but only an engorgement charm at least i think it is please i can correct it 
 
 but far from being reassured the dursleys became more panic stricken aunt petunia was sobbing hysterically tugging tongue as though determined to rip it out dudley appeared to be suffocating under the combined pressure of his mother and his tongue and uncle vernon who had lost control completely seized a china figure from on top of the sideboard and threw it very hard at mr weasley who ducked causing the ornament to shatter in the blasted fireplace 
 
 now really said mr weasley angrily brandishing his wand trying to help 
 
 bellowing like a wounded hippo uncle vernon snatched up another ornament 
 
 harry go just go mr weasley shouted his wand on uncle vernon sort this out 
 
 harry want to miss the fun but uncle second ornament narrowly missed his left ear and on balance he thought it best to leave the situation to mr weasley he stepped into the fire looking over his shoulder as he said the burrow his last fleeting glimpse of the living room was of mr weasley blasting a third ornament out of uncle hand with his wand aunt petunia screaming and lying on top of dudley and tongue lolling around like a great slimy python but next moment harry had begun to spin very fast and the dursleys living room was whipped out of sight in a rush of flames 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the goblet of fire 
 

lionfish nov chapter four number twelve grimmauld placecontents prev chapter next chapter 
 the order of the harry began 
 
 not here boy snarled moody wait till inside 
 
 he pulled the piece of parchment out of hand and set fire to it with his as the message curled into flames and floated to the ground harry looked around at the houses again they were standing outside number eleven he looked to the left and saw number ten to the right however was number thirteen 
 
 but 
 
 think about what just memorised said lupin quietly 
 
 harry thought and no sooner had he reached the part about number twelve grimmauld place than a battered door emerged out of nowhere between numbers eleven and thirteen followed swiftly by dirty walls and grimy windows it was as though an extra house had inflated pushing those on either side out of its way harry gaped at it the stereo in number eleven thudded on apparently the muggles inside felt anything 
 
 come on hurry growled moody prodding harry in the back 
 
 harry walked up the worn stone steps staring at the newly materialised door its black paint was shabby and scratched the silver doorknocker was in the form of a twisted serpent there was no keyhole or letterbox 
 
 lupin pulled out his wand and tapped the door once harry heard many loud metallic clicks and what sounded like the clatter of a chain the door creaked open 
 
 get in quick harry lupin whispered but go far inside and touch anything 
 
 harry stepped over the threshold into the almost total darkness of the hall he could smell damp dust and a sweetish rotting smell the place had the feeling of a derelict building he looked over his shoulder and saw the others filing in behind him lupin and tonks carrying his trunk and cage moody was standing on the top step releasing the balls of light the had stolen from the streetlamps they flew back to their bulbs and the square glowed momentarily with orange light before moody limped inside and closed the front door so that the darkness in the hall became complete 
 
 here 
 
 he rapped harry hard over the head with his wand harry felt as though something hot was trickling down his back this time and knew that the disillusionment charm must have lifted 
 
 now stay still everyone while i give us a bit of light in here moody whispered 
 
 the others hushed voices were giving harry an odd feeling of foreboding it was as though they had just entered the house of a dying person he heard a soft hissing noise and then gas lamps sputtered into life all along the walls casting a flickering insubstantial light over the peeling wallpaper and threadbare carpet of a long gloomy hallway where a cobwebby chandelier glimmered overhead and portraits hung crooked on the walls harry heard something scuttling behind the skirting board both the chandelier and the candelabra on a rickety table nearby were shaped like serpents 
 
 there were hurried footsteps and mother mrs weasley emerged from a door at the far end of the hall she was beaming in welcome as she hurried towards them though harry noticed that she was rather thinner and paler than she had been last time he had seen her 
 
 oh harry lovely to see you she whispered pulling him into a hug before holding him at length and examining him critically looking peaky you need feeding up but have to wait a bit for dinner afraid 
 
 she turned to the gang of wizards behind him and whispered urgently just arrived the started 
 
 the wizards behind harry all made noises of interest and excitement and began filing past him towards the door through which mrs weasley had just come harry made to follow lupin but mrs weasley held him back 
 
 no harry the only for members of the order ron and hermione are upstairs you can wait with them until the meetings over then have dinner and keep your voice down in the hall she added in an urgent whisper 
 
 why 
 
 i want anything to wake up 
 
 what 
 
 explain later got to hurry supposed to be at the meeting just show you where sleeping 
 
 pressing her finger to her lips she led him on tiptoe past a pair of long curtains behind which harry supposed there must be another door and after skirting a large umbrella stand that looked as though it had been made from a severed leg they started up the dark staircase passing a row of shrunken heads mounted on plaques on the wall a closer look showed harry that the heads belonged to all of them had the same rather nose 
 
 bewilderment deepened with every step he took what on earth were they doing in a house that looked as though it belonged to the darkest of wizards 
 
 mrs weasley why 
 
 ron and hermione will explain everything dear really got to dash mrs weasley whispered distractedly had reached the second the door on the right call you when over 
 
 and she hurried off downstairs again 
 
 harry crossed the dingy landing turned the bedroom doorknob which was shaped like a head and opened the door 
 
 he caught a brief glimpse of a gloomy room then there was a loud twittering noise followed by an even louder shriek and his vision was completely obscured by a large quantity of very bushy hair hermione had thrown herself on to him in a hug that nearly knocked him flat while tiny owl pigwidgeon zoomed excitedly round and round their heads 
 
 harry ron here here we hear you arrive oh how are you are you all right have you been furious with us i bet you have i know our letters were uselessbut we tell you anything dumbledore made us swear we oh got so much to tell you and got things to tell usthe dementors when we heardand that ministry just outrageous looked it all up they expel you they just provision in the decree for the reasonable restriction of underage sorcery for the use of magic in situations 
 
 let him breathe hermione said ron grinning as he closed the door behind harry he seemed to have grown several more inches during their month apart making him taller and more gangly looking than ever though the long nose bright red hair and freckles were the same 
 
 still beaming hermione let go of harry but before she could say another word there was a soft whooshing sound and something white soared from the top of a dark wardrobe and landed gently on shoulder 
 
 hedwig 
 
 the snowy owl clicked her beak and nibbled his ear affectionately as harry stroked her feathers 
 
 been in a right state said ron pecked us half to death when she brought your last letters look at this 
 
 he showed harry the index finger of his right hand which sported a but clearly deep cut 
 
 oh yeah harry said sorry about that but i wanted answers you know 
 
 we wanted to give them to you mate said ron hermione was going spare she kept saying do something stupid if you were stuck all on your own without news but dumbledore made us 
 
 swear not to tell me said harry yeah already said 
 
 the warm glow that had flared inside him at the sight of his two best friends was extinguished as something icy flooded the pit of his stomach all of a suddenafter yearning to see them for a solid monthhe felt he would rather ron and hermione left him alone 
 
 there was a strained silence in which harry stroked hedwig automatically not looking at either of the others 
 
 he seemed to think it was best said hermione rather breathlessly dumbledore i mean 
 
 right said harry he noticed that her hands too bore the marks of beak and found that he was not at all sorry 
 
 i think he thought you were safest with the muggles ron began 
 
 yeah said harry raising his eyebrows have either of you been attacked by dementors this summer 
 
 well nobut why had people from the order of the phoenix tailing you all the time 
 
 harry felt a great jolt in his guts as though he had just missed a step going downstairs so everyone had known he was being followed except him 
 
 work that well though did it said harry doing his utmost to keep his voice even had to look after myself after all i 
 
 he was so angry said hermione in an almost awestruck voice dumbledore we saw him when he found out mundungus had left before his shift had ended he was scary 
 
 well glad he left harry said coldly if he i have done magic and dumbledore would probably have left me at privet drive all summer 
 
 you you worried about the ministry of magic hearing said hermione quietly 
 
 no harry lied defiantly he walked away from them looking around with hedwig nestled contentedly on his shoulder but this room was not likely to raise his spirits it was dank and dark a blank stretch of canvas in an ornate picture frame was all that relieved the bareness of the peeling walls and as harry passed it he thought he heard someone who was lurking out of sight snigger 
 
 so dumbledore been so keen to keep me in the dark harry asked still trying hard to keep his voice casual did youerbother to ask him at all 
 
 he glanced up just in time to see them exchanging a look that told him he was behaving just as they had feared he would it did nothing to improve his temper 
 
 we told dumbledore we wanted to tell you what was going on said ron we did mate but really busy now only seen him twice since we came here and he have much time he just made us swear not to tell you important stuff when we wrote he said the owls might be intercepted 
 
 he could kept me informed if wanted to harry said shortly not telling me he know ways to send messages without owls 
 
 hermione glanced at ron and then said i thought that too but he want you to know anything 
 
 maybe he thinks i be trusted said harry watching their expressions 
 
 be thick said ron looking highly disconcerted 
 
 or that i take care of myself 
 
 of course he think that said hermione anxiously 
 
 so how come i have to stay at the dursleys while you two get to join in everything going on here said harry the words tumbling over one another in a rush his voice growing louder with every word how come you two are allowed to know everything going on 
 
 not ron interrupted mum let us near the meetings she says too young 
 
 but before he knew it harry was shouting 
 
 so you been in the meetings big deal still been here you still been together me been stuck at the dursleys for a month and handled more than you ever managed and dumbledore knows it who saved the stone who got rid of riddle who saved both your skins from the dementors 
 
 every bitter and resentful thought harry had had in the past month was pouring out of him his frustration at the lack of news the hurt that they had all been together without him his fury at being followed and not told about it all the feelings he was of finally burst their boundaries hedwig took fright at the noise and soared off to the top of the wardrobe again pigwidgeon twittered in alarm and zoomed even faster around their heads 
 
 who had to get past dragons and sphinxes and every other foul thing last year who saw him come back who had to escape from him me 
 
 ron was standing there with his mouth clearly stunned and at a loss for anything to say whilst hermione looked on the verge of tears 
 
 but why should i know going on why should anyone bother to tell me been happening 
 
 harry we wanted to tell you we really did hermione began 
 
 wanted to that much can you or have sent me an owl but dumbledore made you swear 
 
 well he did 
 
 four weeks been stuck in privet drive nicking papers out of bins to try and find out been going on 
 
 we wanted to 
 
 i suppose been having a real laugh you all holed up here together 
 
 no honest 
 
 harry really sorry said hermione desperately her eyes now sparkling with tears absolutely right harry be furious if it was me 
 
 harry glared at her still breathing deeply then turned away from them again pacing up and down hedwig hooted glumly from the top of the wardrobe there was a long pause broken only by the mournful creak of the floorboards below feet 
 
 what is this place anyway he shot at ron and hermione 
 
 headquarters of the order of the phoenix said ron at once 
 
 is anyone going to bother telling me what the order of the phoenix 
 
 a secret society said hermione quickly in charge he founded it the people who fought against last time 
 
 in it said harry coming to a halt with his hands in his pockets 
 
 quite a few people 
 
 met about twenty of them said ron but we think there are more 
 
 harry glared at them 
 
 well he demanded looking from one to the other 
 
 er said ron well what 
 
 voldemort said harry furiously and both ron and hermione winced happening he up to where is he what are we doing to stop him 
 
 told you the order let us in on their meetings said hermione nervously so we know the detailsbut got a general idea she added hastily seeing the look on face 
 
 fred and george have invented extendable ears see said ron really useful 
 
 extendable 
 
 ears yeah only had to stop using them lately because mum found out and went berserk fred and george had to hide them all to stop mum binning them but we got a good bit of use out of them before mum realised what was going on we know some of the order are following known death eaters keeping tabs on them you know 
 
 some of them are working on recruiting more people to the order said hermione 
 
 and some of them are standing guard over something said ron always talking about guard duty 
 
 have been me could it said harry sarcastically 
 
 oh yeah said ron with a look of dawning comprehension 
 
 harry snorted he walked around the room again looking anywhere but at ron and hermione so what have you two been doing if not allowed in meetings he demanded you said been busy 
 
 we have said hermione quickly been decontaminating this house been empty for ages and been breeding in here managed to clean out the kitchen most of the bedrooms and i think doing the drawing room tomoaargh 
 
 with two loud cracks fred and george elder twin brothers had materialised out of thin air in the middle of the room pigwidgeon twittered more wildly than ever and zoomed off to join hedwig on top of the wardrobe 
 
 stop doing that hermione said weakly to the twins who were as vividly as ron though stockier and slightly shorter 
 
 hello harry said george beaming at him we thought we heard your dulcet tones 
 
 you want to bottle up your anger like that harry let it all out said fred also beaming there might be a couple of people fifty miles away who hear you 
 
 you two passed your apparation tests then asked harry grumpily 
 
 with distinction said fred who was holding what looked like a piece of very long string 
 
 it would have taken you about thirty seconds longer to walk down the stairs said ron 
 
 time is galleons little brother said fred anyway harry interfering with reception extendable ears he added in response to raised eyebrows and held up the string which harry now saw was trailing out on to the landing trying to hear going on downstairs 
 
 you want to be careful said ron staring at the ear if mum sees one of them again 
 
 worth the risk a major meeting having said fred 
 
 the door opened and a long mane of red hair appeared 
 
 oh hello harry said younger sister ginny brightly i thought i heard your voice 
 
 turning to fred and george she said with the extendable ears gone and put an imperturbable charm on the kitchen door 
 
 how know said george looking crestfallen 
 
 tonks told me how to find out said ginny you just chuck stuff at the door and if it make contact the been imperturbed been flicking dungbombs at it from the top of the stairs and they just soar away from it so no way the extendable ears will be able to get under the gap 
 
 fred heaved a deep sigh 
 
 shame i really fancied finding out what old been up to 
 
 snape said harry quickly is he here 
 
 yeah said george carefully closing the door and sitting down on one of the beds fred and ginny followed giving a report top secret 
 
 git said fred idly 
 
 on our side now said hermione reprovingly 
 
 ron snorted stop him being a git the way he looks at us when he sees us 
 
 bill like him either said ginny as though that settled the matter 
 
 harry was not sure his anger had abated yet but his thirst for information was now overcoming his urge to keep shouting he sank on to the bed opposite the others 
 
 is bill here he asked i thought he was working in egypt 
 
 he applied for a desk job so he could come home and work for the order said fred he says he misses the tombs but he smirked there are compensations 
 
 what mean 
 
 remember old fleur delacour said george got a job at gringotts to eemprove er eeenglish 
 
 and been giving her a lot of private lessons sniggered fred 
 
 in the order too said george but still in romania dumbledore wants as many foreign wizards brought in as possible so trying to make contacts on his days off 
 
 percy do that harry asked the last he had heard the third weasley brother was working in the department of international magical at the ministry of magic 
 
 at words all the weasleys and hermione exchanged darkly significant looks 
 
 whatever you do mention percy in front of mum and dad ron told harry in a tense voice 
 
 why not 
 
 because every time mentioned dad breaks whatever holding and mum starts crying fred said 
 
 been awful said ginny sadly 
 
 i think well shot of him said george with an uncharacteristically ugly look on his face 
 
 happened harry said 
 
 percy and dad had a row said fred never seen dad row with anyone like that normally mum who shouts 
 
 it was the first week back after term ended said ron we were about to come and join the order percy came home and told us been promoted 
 
 kidding said harry 
 
 though he knew perfectly well that percy was highly ambitious impression was that percy had not made a great success of his first job at the ministry of magic percy had committed the fairly large oversight of failing to notice that his boss was being controlled by lord voldemort not that the ministry had believed itthey all thought mr crouch had gone mad 
 
 yeah we were all surprised said george because percy got into a load of trouble about crouch there was an inquiry and everything they said percy ought to have realised crouch was off his rocker and informed a superior but you know percy crouch left him in charge he going to complain 
 
 so how come they promoted him 
 
 exactly what we wondered said ron who seemed very keen to keep normal conversation going now that harry had stopped yelling he came home really pleased with himselfeven more pleased than usual if you can imagine thatand told dad been offered a position in own office a really good one for someone only a year out of hogwartsjunior assistant to the minister he expected dad to be all impressed i think 
 
 only dad said fred grimly 
 
 why not said harry 
 
 well apparently fudge has been storming round the ministry checking that having any contact with dumbledore said george 
 
 name is mud with the ministry these days see said fred they all think just making trouble saying back 
 
 dad says fudge has made it clear that anyone in league with dumbledore can clear out their desks said george 
 
 trouble is fudge suspects dad he knows friendly with dumbledore and always thought a bit of a weirdo because of his muggle obsession 
 
 but that got to do with percy asked harry confused 
 
 coming to that dad reckons fudge only wants percy in his office because he wants to use him to spy on the familyand dumbledore 
 
 harry let out a low whistle 
 
 bet percy loved that 
 
 ron laughed in a hollow sort of way 
 
 he went completely berserk he saidwell he said loads of terrible stuff he said been having to struggle against lousy reputation ever since he joined the ministry and that got no ambition and why always beenyou knownot had a lot of money i mean 
 
 what said harry in disbelief as ginny made a noise like an angry cat 
 
 i know said ron in a low voice and it got worse he said dad was an idiot to run around with dumbledore that dumbledore was heading for big trouble and dad was going to go down with him and that hepercyknew where his loyalty lay and it was with the ministry and if mum and dad were going to become traitors to the ministry he was going to make sure everyone knew he belong to our family any more and he packed his bags the same night and left living here in london now 
 
 harry swore under his breath he had always liked percy least of brothers but he had never imagined he would say such things to mr weasley 
 
 been in a right state said ron dully you knowcrying and stuff she came up to london to try and talk to percy but he slammed the door in her face i dunno what he does if he meets dad at workignores him i 
 
 but percy must know back said harry slowly not stupid he must know your mum and dad risk everything without proof 
 
 yeah well your name got dragged into the row said ron shooting harry a furtive look percy said the only evidence was your word and i dunno he think it was good enough 
 
 percy takes the daily prophet seriously said hermione tartly and the others all nodded 
 
 what are you talking about harry asked looking around at them all they were all regarding him warily 
 
 you been getting the daily prophet hermione asked nervously 
 
 yeah i have said harry 
 
 have youer been reading it thoroughly hermione asked still more anxiously 
 
 not cover to cover said harry defensively if they were going to report anything about voldemort it would be headline news it 
 
 the others flinched at the sound of the name hermione hurried on well need to read it cover to cover to pick it up but theyumthey mention you a couple of times a week 
 
 but have seen 
 
 not if only been reading the front page you said hermione shaking her head not talking about big articles they just slip you in like a standing joke 
 
 what 
 
 quite nasty actually said hermione in a voice of forced calm just building on stuff 
 
 but not writing for them any more is she 
 
 oh no kept her promisenot that got any choice hermione added with satisfaction but she laid the foundation for what trying to do now 
 
 which is what said harry impatiently 
 
 ok you know she wrote that you were collapsing all over the place and saying your scar was hurting and all that 
 
 yeah said harry who was not likely to forget rita stories about him in a hurry 
 
 well writing about you as though this deluded person who thinks a great tragic hero or something said hermione very fast as though it would be less unpleasant for harry to hear these facts quickly they keep slipping in snide comments about you if some story appears they say something like a tale worthy of harry potter and if anyone has a funny accident or anything hope he got a scar on his forehead or be asked to worship him next 
 
 i want anyone to worship harry began hotly 
 
 i know you said hermione quickly looking frightened i know harry but you see what doing they want to turn you into someone nobody will believe fudge is behind it bet anything they want wizards on the street to think just some stupid boy a bit of a joke who tells ridiculous tall stories because he loves being famous and wants to keep it going 
 
 i ask i want voldemort killed my parents harry spluttered i got famous because he murdered my family but kill me who wants to be famous for that they think rather never 
 
 we know harry said ginny earnestly 
 
 and of course they report a word about the dementors attacking you said hermione told them to keep that quiet that been a really big story dementors they even reported that you broke the international statute of secrecy we thought they would it would be in so well with this image of you as some stupid we think biding their time until expelled then really going to go to town i mean if expelled obviously she went on hastily you really be not if they abide by their own laws no case against you 
 
 they were back on the hearing and harry did not want to think about that he cast around for another change of subject but was saved the necessity of finding one by the sound of footsteps coming up the stairs 
 
 uh oh 
 
 fred gave the extendable ear a hearty tug there was another loud crack and he and george vanished seconds later mrs weasley appeared in the bedroom doorway 
 
 the over you can come down and have dinner now dying to see you harry and left all those dungbombs outside the kitchen door 
 
 crookshanks said ginny unblushingly he loves playing with them 
 
 oh said mrs weasley i thought it might have been kreacher he keeps doing odd things like that now forget to keep your voices down in the hall ginny your hands are filthy what have you been doing go and wash them before dinner please 
 
 ginny grimaced at the others and followed her mother out of the room leaving harry alone with ron and hermione both of them were watching him apprehensively as though they feared he would start shouting again now that everyone else had gone the sight of them looking so nervous made him feel slightly ashamed 
 
 look he muttered but ron shook his head and hermione said quietly we knew be angry harry we really blame you but got to understand we did try to persuade dumbledore 
 
 yeah i know said harry grudgingly 
 
 he cast around for a topic that involve his headmaster because the very thought of dumbledore made insides burn with anger again 
 
 kreacher he asked 
 
 the who lives here said ron nutter never met one like him 
 
 hermione frowned at ron 
 
 not a nutter ron 
 
 his ambition is to have his head cut off and stuck up on plaque just like his mother said ron irritably is that normal hermione 
 
 wellwell if he is a bit strange not his fault 
 
 ron rolled his eyes at harry 
 
 hermione still given up on spew 
 
 not spew said hermione heatedly the society for the promotion of elfish welfare and not just me dumbledore says we should be kind to kreacher too 
 
 yeah yeah said ron starving 
 
 he led the way out of the door and on to the landing but before they could descend the stairs hold it ron breathed flinging out an arm to stop harry and hermione walking any further still in the hall we might be able to hear something 
 
 the three of them looked cautiously over the banisters the gloomy hallway below was packed with witches and wizards including all of guard they were whispering excitedly together in the very centre of the group harry saw the dark head and prominent nose of his least favourite teacher at hogwarts professor snape harry leant further over the banisters he was very interested in what snape was doing for the order of the phoenix 
 
 a thin piece of string descended in front of eyes looking up he saw fred and george on the landing above cautiously lowering the extendable ear towards the dark knot of people below a moment later however they all began to move towards the front door and out of sight 
 
 dammit harry heard fred whisper as he hoisted the extendable ear back up again 
 
 they heard the front door open then close 
 
 snape never eats here ron told harry quietly thank god 
 
 and forget to keep your voice down in the hall harry hermione whispered 
 
 as they passed the row of heads on the wall they saw lupin mrs weasley and tonks at the front door magically sealing its many locks and bolts behind those who had just left 
 
 eating down in the kitchen mrs weasley whispered meeting them at the bottom of the stairs harry dear if just tiptoe across the hall through this door here 
 
 crash 
 
 tonks cried mrs weasley in exasperation turning to look behind her 
 
 sorry wailed tonks who was lying flat on the floor that stupid umbrella stand the second time tripped over 
 
 but the rest of her words were drowned by a horrible screech 
 
 the velvet curtains harry had passed earlier had flown apart but there was no door behind them for a split second harry thought he was looking through a window a window behind which an old woman in a black cap was screaming and screaming as though she were being torturedthen he realised it was simply a portrait but the most realistic and the most unpleasant he had ever seen in his life 
 
 the old woman was drooling her eyes were rolling the yellowing skin of her face stretched taut as she screamed and all along the hall behind them the other portraits awoke and began to yell too so that harry actually screwed up his eyes at the noise and clapped his hands over his ears 
 
 lupin and mrs weasley darted forward and tried to tug the curtains shut over the old woman but they would not close and she screeched louder than ever brandishing clawed hands as though trying to tear at their faces 
 
 filth scum of dirt and vileness mutants freaks begone from this place how dare you befoul the house of my fathers 
 
 tonks apologised over and over again dragging the huge heavy leg back off the floor mrs weasley abandoned the attempt to close the curtains and hurried up and down the hall stunning all the other portraits with her wand and a man with long black hair came charging out of a door facing harry 
 
 shut up you horrible old hag shut up he roared seizing the curtain mrs weasley had abandoned 
 
 the old face blanched 
 
 yoooou she howled her eyes popping at the sight of the man blood traitor abomination shame of my flesh 
 
 i saidshutup roared the man and with a stupendous effort he and lupin managed to force the curtains closed again 
 
 the old screeches died and an echoing silence tell panting slightly and sweeping his long dark hair out of his eyes godfather sirius turned to face him 
 
 hello harry he said grimly i see met my mother 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the order of the phoenix 
 

lionfish nov chapter four horace slughorncontents prev chapter next chapter 
 despite the fact that he had spent every waking moment of the past few days hoping desperately that dumbledore would indeed come to fetch him harry felt distinctly awkward as they set off down privet drive together he had never had a proper conversation with the headmaster outside of hogwarts before there was usually a desk between them the memory of their last encounter kept intruding too and it rather heightened sense of embarrassment he had shouted a lot on that occasion not to mention done his best to smash several of most prized possessions 
 
 dumbledore however seemed completely relaxed 
 
 keep your wand at the ready harry he said brightly 
 
 but i thought not allowed to use magic outside school sir 
 
 if there is an attack said dumbledore i give you permission to use any or curse that might occur to you however i do not think you need worry about being attacked tonight 
 
 why not sir 
 
 you are with me said dumbledore simply this will do harry 
 
 he came to an abrupt halt at the end of privet drive 
 
 you have not of course passed your apparition test he said 
 
 no said harry i thought you had to be seventeen 
 
 you do said dumbledore so you will need to hold on to my arm very tightly my left if you mindas you have noticed my wand arm is a little fragile at the moment 
 
 harry gripped proffered forearm 
 
 very good said dumbledore well here we go 
 
 harry felt arm twist away from him and redoubled his grip the next thing he knew everything went black he was being pressed very hard from all directions he could not breathe there were iron bands tightening around his chest his eyeballs were being forced back into his head his eardrums were being pushed deeper into his skull and then 
 
 he gulped great lungfulls of cold night air and opened his streaming eyes he felt as though he had just been forced through a very tight rubber tube it was a few seconds before he realized that privet drive had vanished he and dumbledore were now standing in what appeared to be a deserted village square in the center of which stood an old war memorial and a few benches his comprehension catching up with his senses harry realized that he had just apparated for the first time in his life 
 
 are you all right asked dumbledore looking down at him solicitously the sensation does take some getting used to 
 
 fine said harry rubbing his ears which felt as though they had left privet drive rather reluctantly but i think i might prefer brooms 
 
 dumbledore smiled drew his traveling cloak a little more lightly around his neck and said this way 
 
 he set off at a brisk pace past an empty inn and a few houses according to a clock on a nearby church it was almost midnight 
 
 so tell me harry said dumbledore your scar has it been hurting at all 
 
 harry raised a hand unconsciously to his forehead and rubbed the mark 
 
 no he said and been wondering about that i thought it would be burning all the time now getting so powerful again 
 
 he glanced up at dumbledore and saw that he was wearing a satisfied expression 
 
 i on the other hand thought otherwise said dumbledore lord voldemort has finally realized the dangerous access to his thoughts and feelings you have been enjoying it appears that he is now employing occlumency against you 
 
 well not complaining said harry who missed neither the disturbing dreams nor the startling flashes of insight into mind 
 
 they turned a corner passing a telephone box and a bus shelter harry looked sideways at dumbledore again professor 
 
 harry 
 
 erwhere exactly are we 
 
 this harry is the charming village of budleigh babberton 
 
 and what are we doing here 
 
 ah yes of course i told you said dumbledore well i have lost count of the number of times i have said this in recent years but we are once again one member of staff short we are here to persuade an old colleague of mine to come out of retirement and return to hogwarts 
 
 how can i help with that sir 
 
 oh i think find a use for you said dumbledore vaguely left here harry 
 
 they proceeded up a steep narrow street lined with houses all the windows were dark the odd chill that had lain over privet drive for two weeks persisted here too thinking of dementors harry cast a look over his shoulder and grasped his wand reassuringly in his pocket 
 
 professor why we just apparate directly into your old house 
 
 because it would be quite as rude as kicking down the front door said dumbledore courtesy dictates that we offer fellow wizards the opportunity of denying us entry in any case most wizarding dwellings are magically protected from unwanted apparators at hogwarts for instance 
 
 you apparate anywhere inside the buildings or grounds said harry quickly hermione granger told me 
 
 and she is quite right we turn left again 
 
 the church clock chimed midnight behind them harry wondered why dumbledore did not consider it rude to call on his old colleague so late but now that conversation had been established he had more pressing questions to ask 
 
 sir i saw in the daily prophet that fudge has been sacked 
 
 correct said dumbledore now turning up a steep side street he has been replaced as i am sure you also saw by rufus scrimgeour who used to be head of the auror office 
 
 is he do you think good asked harry 
 
 an interesting question said dumbledore he is able certainly a more decisive and forceful personality than cornelius 
 
 yes but i meant 
 
 i know what you meant rufus is a man of action and having fought dark wizards for most of his working life does not underestimate lord voldemort 
 
 harry waited but dumbledore did not say anything about the disagreement with scrimgeour that the daily prophet had reported and he did not have the nerve to pursue the subject so he changed it 
 
 and sir i saw about madam bones 
 
 yes said dumbledore quietly a terrible loss she was a great witch just up here i think ouch 
 
 he had pointed with his injured hand 
 
 professor what happened to your 
 
 i have no time to explain now said dumbledore it is a thrilling tale i wish to do it justice 
 
 he smiled at harry who understood that he was not being snubbed and that he had permission to keep asking questions 
 
 sir i got a ministry of magic leaflet by owl about security measures we should all take against the death eaters 
 
 yes i received one myself said dumbledore still smiling did you find it useful 
 
 not really 
 
 no i thought not you have not asked me for instance what is my favorite flavor of jam to check that i am indeed professor dumbledore and not an impostor 
 
 i harry began not entirely sure whether he was being reprimanded or not 
 
 for future reference harry it is raspberry although of course if i were a death eater i would have been sure to research my own jam preferences before impersonating myself 
 
 er right said harry well on that leaflet it said something about inferi what exactly are they the leaflet very clear 
 
 they are corpses said dumbledore calmly dead bodies that have been bewitched to do a dark bidding inferi have not been seen for a long time however not since voldemort was last powerful he killed enough people to make an army of them of course this is the place harry just here 
 
 they were nearing a small neat stone house set in its own garden harry was too busy digesting the horrible idea of inferi to have much attention left for anything else but as they reached the front gate dumbledore stopped dead and harry walked into him 
 
 oh dear oh dear dear dear 
 
 harry followed his gaze up the carefully tended front path and felt his heart sink the front door was hanging off its hinges 
 
 dumbledore glanced up and down the street it seemed quite deserted 
 
 wand out and follow me harry he said quietly 
 
 he opened the gate and walked swiftly and silently up the garden path harry at his heels then pushed the front door very slowly his wand raised and at the ready 
 
 lumos 
 
 wand tip ignited casting its light up a narrow hallway to the left another door stood open holding his illuminated wand aloft dumbledore walked into the sitting room with harry right behind him 
 
 a scene of total devastation met their eyes a grandfather clock lay splintered at their feet its face cracked its pendulum lying a little farther away like a dropped sword a piano was on its side its keys strewn across the floor the wreckage of a fallen chandelier flittered nearby cushions lay deflated feathers oozing from slashes in their sides fragments of glass and china lay like powder over everything dumbledore raised his wand even higher so that its light was thrown upon the walls where something darkly red and glutinous was spattered over the wallpaper small intake of breath made dumbledore look around 
 
 not pretty is it he said heavily yes something horrible has happened here 
 
 dumbledore moved carefully into the middle of the room scrutinizing the wreckage at his feet harry followed gazing around of what he might see hidden behind the wreck of the piano or the overturned sofa but there was no sign of a body 
 
 maybe there was a fight and and they dragged him off professor harry suggested trying not to imagine how badly wounded a man would have to be to leave those stains spattered halfway up the walls 
 
 i think so said dumbledore quietly peering behind an overstuffed armchair lying on its side 
 
 you mean 
 
 still here somewhere yes 
 
 and without warning dumbledore swooped plunging the tip of his wand into the seat of the overstuffed armchair which yelled ouch 
 
 good evening horace said dumbledore straightening up again 
 
 jaw dropped where a split second before there had been an armchair there now crouched an enormously fat bald old man who was massaging his lower belly and squinting up at dumbledore with an aggrieved and watery eye 
 
 there was no need to stick the wand in that hard he said gruffly clambering to his feet it hurt 
 
 the wandlight sparkled on his shiny pate his prominent eyes his enormous silver walruslike mustache and the highly polished buttons on the maroon velvet jacket he was wearing over a pair of lilac silk pajamas the top of his head barely reached chin 
 
 what gave it away he grunted as he staggered to his feet still rubbing his lower belly he seemed remarkably unabashed for a man who had just been discovered pretending to be an armchair 
 
 my dear horace said dumbledore looking amused if the death eaters really had come to call the dark mark would have been set over the house 
 
 the wizard clapped a pudgy hand to his vast forehead 
 
 the dark mark he muttered knew there was something ah well have had time anyway only just put the finishing touches to my upholstery when you entered the room 
 
 he heaved a great sigh that made the ends of his mustache flutter 
 
 would you like my assistance clearing up asked dumbledore politely 
 
 please said the other 
 
 they stood back to back the tall thin wizard and the short round one and waved their wands in one identical sweeping motion 
 
 the furniture flew back to its original places ornaments in midair feathers zoomed into their cushions torn books repaired themselves as they landed upon their shelves oil lanterns soared onto side tables and reignited avast collection of splintered silver picture frames flew glittering across the room and alighted whole and untarnished upon a desk rips cracks and holes healed everywhere and the walls wiped themselves clean 
 
 what kind of blood was that incidentally asked dumbledore loudly over the chiming of the newly unsmashed grandfather flock 
 
 on the walls dragon shouted the wizard called horace as with a deafening grinding and tinkling the chandelier screwed itself back into the ceiling 
 
 there was a final plunk from the piano and silence 
 
 yes dragon repeated the wizard conversationally my last bottle and prices are at the moment still it might be reusable 
 
 he stumped over to a small crystal bottle standing on top of a sideboard and held it up to the light examining the thick liquid within 
 
 hmm bit dusty 
 
 he set the bottle back on the sideboard and sighed it was then that his gaze fell upon harry 
 
 oho he said his large round eyes flying to forehead and the scar it bore oho 
 
 this said dumbledore moving forward to make the introduction is harry potter harry this is an old friend and colleague of mine horace slughorn 
 
 slughorn turned on dumbledore his expression shrewd 
 
 so how you thought persuade me is it well the no albus 
 
 he pushed past harry his face turned resolutely away with the air of a man trying to resist temptation 
 
 i suppose we can have a drink at least asked dumbledore for old sake 
 
 slughorn hesitated 
 
 all right then one drink he said ungraciously 
 
 dumbledore smiled at harry and directed him toward a chair not unlike the one that slughorn had so recently impersonated which stood right beside the newly burning fire and a brightly glowing oil lamp harry took the seat with the distinct impression that dumbledore for some reason wanted to keep him as visible as possible certainly when slughorn who had been busy with decanters and glasses turned to face the room again his eyes fell immediately upon harry 
 
 hmpf he said looking away quickly as though frightened of hurting his eyes here he gave a drink to dumbledore who had sat down without invitation thrust the tray at harry and then sank into the cushions of the repaired sofa and a disgruntled silence his legs were so short they did not touch the floor 
 
 well how have you been keeping horace dumbledore asked 
 
 not so well said slughorn at once weak chest wheezy rheumatism too move like i used to well to be expected old age fatigue 
 
 and yet you must have moved fairly quickly to prepare such a welcome for us at such short notice said dumbledore you have had more than three minutes warning 
 
 slughorn said half irritably half proudly two hear my intruder charm go off i was taking a bath still he added sternly seeming to pull himself back together again the fact remains that an old man albus a tired old man earned the right to a quiet life and a few creature comforts 
 
 he certainly had those thought harry looking around the room it was stuffy and cluttered yet nobody could say it was uncomfortable there were soft chairs and footstools drinks and books boxes of chocolates and plump cushions if harry had not known who lived there he would have guessed at a rich fussy old lady 
 
 not yet as old as i am horace said dumbledore 
 
 well maybe you ought to think about retirement yourself said slughorn bluntly his pale gooseberry eyes had found injured hand reactions not what they were i see 
 
 quite right said dumbledore serenely shaking back his sleeve to reveal the tips of those burned and blackened fingers the sight of them made the back of neck prickle unpleasantly i am undoubtedly slower than i was but on the other hand 
 
 he shrugged and spread his hands wide as though to say that age had its compensations and harry noticed a ring on his uninjured hand that he had never seen dumbledore wear before it was large rather clumsily made of what looked like gold and was set with a heavy black stone that had cracked down the middle eyes lingered for a moment on the ring too and harry saw a tiny frown momentarily crease his wide forehead 
 
 so all these precautions against intruders horace are they for the death eaters benefit or mine asked dumbledore 
 
 what would the death eaters want with a poor old buffer like me demanded slughorn 
 
 i imagine that they would want you to turn your considerable talents to coercion torture and murder said dumbledore are you really telling me that they come recruiting yet 
 
 slughorn eyed dumbledore balefully for a moment then muttered i given them the chance been on the move for a year never stay in one place more than a week move from muggle house to muggle housethe owners of this place are on holiday in the canary been very pleasant be sorry to leave quite easy once you know how one simple freezing charm on these absurd burglar alarms they use instead of sneakoscopes and make sure the neighbors spot you bringing in the piano 
 
 ingenious said dumbledore but it sounds a rather tiring existence for a old buffer in search of a quiet life now if you were to return to hogwarts 
 
 if going to tell me my life would be more peaceful at that pestilential school you can save your breath albus i might have been in hiding but some funny rumors have reached me since dolores umbridge left if how you treat teachers these days 
 
 professor umbridge ran afoul of our centaur herd said dumbledore i think you horace would have known better than to stride into the forest and call a horde of angry centaurs filthy 
 
 what she did did she said slughorn idiotic woman never liked her 
 
 harry chuckled and both dumbledore and slughorn looked round at him 
 
 sorry harry said hastily justi like her either 
 
 dumbledore stood up rather suddenly 
 
 are you leaving asked slughorn at once looking hopeful 
 
 no i was wondering whether i might use your bathroom said dumbledore 
 
 oh said slughorn clearly disappointed second on the left down the hall 
 
 dumbledore strode from the room once the door had closed behind him there was silence after a few moments slughorn got to his feet but seemed uncertain what to do with himself he shot a furtive look at harry then crossed to the fire and turned his back on it warming his wide behind 
 
 think i know why brought you he said abruptly 
 
 harry merely looked at slughorn watery eyes slid over scar this time taking in the rest of his face 
 
 you look very like your father 
 
 yeah been told said harry 
 
 except for your eyes got 
 
 my eyes yeah harry had heard it so often he found it a bit wearing 
 
 hmpf yes well you have favorites as a teacher of course but she was one of mine your mother slughorn added in answer to questioning look lily evans one of the brightest i ever taught vivacious you know charming girl i used to tell her she ought to have been in my house very cheeky answers i used to get back too 
 
 which was your house 
 
 i was head of slytherin said slughorn oh now he went on quickly seeing the expression on face and wagging a stubby ringer at him go holding that against me be gryffindor like her i suppose yes it usually goes in families not always though ever heard of sirius black you must have donebeen in the papers for the last couple of yearsdied a few weeks ago 
 
 it was as though an invisible hand had twisted intestines and held them tight 
 
 well anyway he was a big pal of your at school the whole black family had been in my house but sirius ended up in gryffindor shamehe was a talented boy i got his brother regulus when he came along but have liked the set 
 
 he sounded like an enthusiastic collector who had been outbid at auction apparently lost in memories he gazed at the opposite wall turning idly on the spot to ensure an even heat on his backside 
 
 your mother was of course believe it when i found out thought she must have been she was so good 
 
 one of my best friends is said harry and the best in our year 
 
 funny how that sometimes happens it said slughorn 
 
 not really said harry coldly 
 
 slughorn looked down at him in surprise 
 
 you think prejudiced he said no no no i just said your mother was one of my favorite students and there was dirk cresswell in the year after her toonow head of the goblin liaison office of courseanother a very gifted student and still gives me excellent inside information on the at gringotts 
 
 he bounced up and down a little smiling in a way and pointed at the many glittering photograph frames on the dresser each peopled with tiny moving occupants 
 
 all all signed notice barnabas cuffe editor of the daily prophet always interested to hear my take on the news and ambrosius flume of honeydukesa hamper every birthday and all because i was able to give him an introduction to ciceron harkisss who gave him his first job and at the back see her if you just crane your gwenog jones who of course captains the holyhead harpies people are always astonished to hear on terms with the harpies and free tickets whenever i want them 
 
 this thought seemed to cheer him up enormously 
 
 and all these people know where to find you to send you stuff asked harry who could not help wondering why the death eaters had not yet tracked down slughorn if hampers of sweets quidditch tickets and visitors craving his advice and opinions could find him 
 
 the smile slid from face as quickly as the blood from his walls 
 
 of course not he said looking down at harry i have been out of touch with everybody for a year 
 
 harry had the impression that the words shocked slughorn himself he looked quite unsettled for a moment then he shrugged 
 
 still the prudent wizard keeps his head down in such times all very well for dumbledore to talk but taking up a post at hogwarts just now would be tantamount to declaring my public allegiance to the order of the phoenix and while sure very admirable and brave and all the rest of it i personally fancy the mortality rate 
 
 you have to join the order to teach at hogwarts said harry who could not quite keep a note of derision out of his voice it was hard to sympathize with cosseted existence when he remembered sirius crouching in a cave and living on rats most of the teachers in it and none of them has ever been killedwell unless you count quirrell and he got what he deserved seeing as he was working with voldemort 
 
 harry had been sure slughorn would be one of those wizards who could not bear to hear name spoken aloud and was not disappointed slughorn gave a shudder and a squawk of protest which harry ignored 
 
 i reckon the staff are safer than most people while headmaster supposed to be the only one voldemort ever feared he harry went on 
 
 slughorn gazed into space for a moment or two he seemed to be thinking over words 
 
 well yes it is true that has never sought a fight with dumbledore he muttered grudgingly and i suppose one could argue that as i have not joined the death eaters can hardly count me a friend in which case i might well be safer a little closer to albus i cannot pretend that amelia death did not shake me if she with all her ministry contacts and protection 
 
 dumbledore the room and slughorn jumped as though he had forgotten he was in the house 
 
 oh there you are albus he said been a very long time upset stomach 
 
 no i was merely reading the muggle magazines said dumbledore i do love knitting patterns well harry we have trespassed upon hospitality quite long enough i think it is time for us to leave 
 
 not at all reluctant to obey harry jumped to his feet slughorn seemed taken aback 
 
 leaving 
 
 yes indeed i think i know a lost cause when i see one 
 
 lost 
 
 slughorn seemed agitated he twiddled his fat thumbs and fidgeted as he watched dumbledore fasten his traveling cloak and harry zip up his jacket 
 
 well sorry you want the job horace said dumbledore raising his uninjured hand in a farewell salute hogwarts would have been glad to see you back again our greatly increased security notwithstanding you will always be welcome to visit should you wish to 
 
 yes well very gracious as i say 
 
 goodbye then 
 
 bye said harry 
 
 they were at the front door when there was a shout from behind them 
 
 all right all right do it 
 
 dumbledore turned to see slughorn standing breathless in the doorway to the sitting room 
 
 you will come out of retirement 
 
 yes yes said slughorn impatiently i must be mad but yes 
 
 wonderful said dumbledore beaming then horace we shall see you on the first of september 
 
 yes i daresay you will grunted slughorn 
 
 as they set off down the garden path voice floated after them want a pay rise dumbledore 
 
 dumbledore chuckled the garden gate swung shut behind them and they set off back down the hill through the dark and the swirling mist 
 
 well done harry said dumbledore 
 
 i do anything said harry in surprise 
 
 oh yes you did you showed horace exactly how much he stands to gain by returning to hogwarts did you like him 
 
 er 
 
 harry sure whether he liked slughorn or not he supposed he had been pleasant in his way but he had also seemed vain and whatever he said to the contrary much too surprised that a should make a good witch 
 
 horace said dumbledore relieving harry of the responsibility to say any of this likes his comfort he also likes the company of the famous the successful and the powerful he enjoys the feeling that he influences these people he has never wanted to occupy the throne himself he prefers the backseatmore room to spread out you see he used to handpick favorites at hogwarts sometimes for their ambition or their brains sometimes for their charm or their talent and he had an uncanny knack for choosing those who would go on to become outstanding in their various fields horace formed a kind of club of his favorites with himself at the center making introductions forging useful contacts between members and always reaping some kind of benefit in return whether a free box of his favorite crystallized pineapple or the chance to recommend the next junior member of the goblin liaison office 
 
 harry had a sudden and vivid mental image of a great swollen spider spinning a web around it twitching a thread here and there to bring its large and juicy flies a little closer 
 
 i tell you all this dumbledore continued not to turn you against horaceor as we must now call him professor slughornbut to put you on your guard he will undoubtedly try to collect you harry you would be the jewel of his collection the boy who lived or as they call you these days the chosen one 
 
 at these words a chill that had nothing to do with the surrounding mist stole over harry he was reminded of words he had heard a few weeks ago words that had a horrible and particular meaning to him 
 
 neither can live while the other survives 
 
 dumbledore had stopped walking level with the church they had passed earlier 
 
 this will do harry if you will grasp my arm 
 
 braced this time harry was ready for the apparition but still found it unpleasant when the pressure disappeared and he found himself able to breathe again he was standing in a country lane beside dumbledore and looking ahead to the crooked silhouette of his second favorite building in the world the burrow in spite of the feeling of dread that had just swept through him his spirits could not help but lift at the sight of it ron was in there and so was mrs weasley who could cook better than anyone he knew 
 
 if you mind harry said dumbledore as they passed through the gate like a few words with you before we part in private perhaps in here 
 
 dumbledore pointed toward a stone outhouse where the weasleys kept their broomsticks a little puzzled harry followed dumbledore through the creaking door into a space a little smaller than the average cupboard dumbledore illuminated the tip of his wand so that it glowed like a torch and smiled down at harry 
 
 i hope you will forgive me for mentioning it harry but i am pleased and a little proud at how well you seem to be coping after everything that happened at the ministry permit me to say that i think sirius would have been proud of you 
 
 harry swallowed his voice seemed to have deserted him he did not think he could stand to discuss sirius it had been painful enough to hear uncle vernon say his dead and even worse to hear name thrown out casually by slughorn 
 
 it was cruel said dumbledore softly that you and sirius had such a short time together a brutal ending to what should have been a long and happy relationship 
 
 harry nodded his eyes fixed resolutely on the spider now climbing hat he could tell that dumbledore understood that he might even suspect that until his letter arrived harry had spent nearly all his time at the dursleys lying on his bed refusing meals and staring at the misted window full of the chill emptiness that he had come to associate with dementors 
 
 just hard harry said finally in a low voice to realize he write to me again 
 
 his eyes burned suddenly and he blinked he felt stupid for admitting it but the fact that he had had someone outside hogwarts who cared what happened to him almost like a parent had been one of the best things about discovering his godfather and now the post owls would never bring him that comfort again 
 
 sirius represented much to you that you had never known before said dumbledore gently naturally the loss is devastating 
 
 but while i was at the dursleys interrupted harry his voice growing stronger i realized i shut myself away oror crack up sirius have wanted that would he and anyway too short look at madam bones look at emmeline vance it could be me next it but if it is he said fiercely now looking straight into blue eyes gleaming in the wandlight make sure i take as many death eaters with me as i can and voldemort too if i can manage it 
 
 spoken both like your mother and son and true godson said dumbledore with an approving pat on back i take my hat off to youor i would if i were not afraid of showering you in spiders 
 
 and now harry on a closely related subject i gather that you have been taking the daily prophet over the last two weeks 
 
 yes said harry and his heart beat a little faster 
 
 then you will have seen that there have been not so much leaks as floods concerning your adventure in the hall of prophecy 
 
 yes said harry again and now everyone knows that the one 
 
 no they do not interrupted dumbledore there are only two people in the whole world who know the full contents of the prophecy made about you and lord voldemort and they are both standing in this smelly spidery broom shed it is true however that many have guessed correctly that voldemort sent his death eaters to steal a prophecy and that the prophecy concerned you 
 
 now i think i am correct in saying that you have not told anybody that you know what the prophecy said 
 
 no said harry 
 
 a wise decision on the whole said dumbledore although i think you ought to relax it in favor of your friends mr ronald weasley and miss hermione granger yes he continued when harry looked startled i think they ought to know you do them a disservice by not confiding something this important to them 
 
 i want 
 
 to worry or frighten them said dumbledore surveying harry over the top of his spectacles or perhaps to confess that you yourself are worried and frightened you need your friends harry as you so rightly said sirius would not have wanted you to shut yourself away 
 
 harry said nothing but dumbledore did not seem to require an answer he continued on a different though related subject it is my wish that you take private lessons with me this year 
 
 privatewith you said harry surprised out of his preoccupied silence 
 
 yes i think it is time that i took a greater hand in your education 
 
 what will you be teaching me sir 
 
 oh a little of this a little of that said dumbledore airily 
 
 harry waited hopefully but dumbledore did not elaborate so he asked something else that had been bothering him slightly 
 
 if having lessons with you i have to do occlumency lessons with snape will i 
 
 professor snape harryand no you will not 
 
 good said harry in relief because they were a 
 
 he stopped careful not to say what he really thought 
 
 i think the word fiasco would be a good one here said dumbledore nodding 
 
 harry laughed 
 
 well that means i see much of professor snape from now on he said because he let me carry on potions unless i get outstanding in my which i know i 
 
 count your owls before they are delivered said dumbledore gravely which now i think of it ought to be some time later today now two more things harry before we part 
 
 firstly i wish you to keep your invisibility cloak with you at all times from this moment onward even within hogwarts itself just in case you understand me 
 
 harry nodded 
 
 and lastly while you stay here the burrow has been given the highest security the ministry of magic can provide these measures have caused a certain amount of inconvenience to arthur and mollyall their post for instance is being searched at the ministry before being sent on they do not mind in the slightest for their only concern is your safety however it would be poor repayment if you risked your neck while staying with them 
 
 i understand said harry quickly 
 
 very well then said dumbledore pushing open the broom shed door and stepping out into the yard i see a light in the kitchen let us not deprive molly any longer of the chance to deplore how thin you are 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the half blood prince 
 

lionfish nov chapter four the seven potterscontents prev chapter next chapter 
 harry ran back upstairs to his bedroom arriving at the window just in time to see the dursleys car swinging out of the drive and off up the road dedaluss top hat was visible between aunt petunia and dudley in the backseat the car turned right at the end of privet drive its windows burned scarlet for a moment in the now setting sun and then it was gone 
 
 harry picked up hedwigs cage his firebolt and his rucksack gave his unnaturally tidy bedroom one last sweeping look and then made his ungainly way back downstairs to the hall where he deposited cage broomstick and bag near the foot of the stairs the light was fading rapidly the hall full of shadows in the evening light it felt most strange to stand here in the silence and know that he was about to leave the house for the last time long ago when he had been left alone while the dursleys went out to enjoy themselves the hours of solitude had been a rare treat pausing only to sneak something tasty from the fridge he had rushed upstairs to play on dudleys computer or put on the television and flicked through the channels to his hearts content it gave him an odd empty feeling remembering those times it was like remembering a younger brother whom he had lost 
 
 dont you want to take a last look at the place he asked hedwig who was still sulking with her head under her wing well never be here again dont you want to remember all the good times i mean look at this doormat what memories dudley sobbed on it after i saved him from the dementors turns out he was grateful after all can you believe it and last summer dumbledore walked through that front door 
 
 harry lost the thread of his thoughts for a moment and hedwig did nothing to help him retrieve it but continued to sit with her head under her wing harry turned his back on the front door 
 
 and under here hedwig c harry pulled open a door under the stairs c is where i used to sleep you never knew me then c blimey its small id forgotten 
 
 harry looked around at the stacked shoes and umbrellas remembering how he used to wake every morning looking up at the underside of the staircase which was more often than not adorned with a spider or two those had been the days before he had known anything about his true identity before he had found out how his parents had died or why such strange things often happened around him but harry could still remember the dreams that had dogged him even in those days confused dreams involving flashes of green light and once c uncle vernon had nearly crashed the car when harry had recounted it c a flying motorbike 
 
 there was a sudden deafening roar from somewhere nearby harry straightened up with a jerk and smacked the top of his head on the low door frame pausing only to employ a few of uncle vernons choicest swear words he staggered back into the kitchen clutching his head and staring out of the window into the back garden 
 
 the darkness seemed to be rippling the air itself quivering then one by one figures began to pop into sight as their disillusionment charms lifted dominating the scene was hagrid wearing a helmet and goggles and sitting astride an enormous motorbike with a black sidecar attached all around him other people were dismounting from brooms and in two cases skeletal black winged horses 
 
 wrenching open the back door harry hurtled into their midst there was a general cry of greeting as hermione flung her arms around him ron clapped him on the back and hagrid said all righ harry ready fer the off 
 
 definitely said harry beaming around at them all but i wasnt expecting this many of you 
 
 change of plan growled who was holding two enormous bulging sacks and whose magical eye was spinning from darkening sky to house to garden with dizzying rapidity lets get undercover before we talk you through it 
 
 harry led them all back into the kitchen where laughing and chattering they settled on chairs sat themselves upon aunt petunias gleaming work surfaces or leaned up against her spotless appliances ron long and lanky hermione her bushy hair tied back in a long plait fred and george grinning identically bill badly scarred and longhaired mr weasley balding his spectacles a little awry his bright blue magical eye whizzing in its socket tonks whose short hair was her favorite shade of bright pink lupin grayer more lined fleur slender and beautiful with her long silvery blonde hair kingsley bald and hagrid with his wild hair and beard standing hunchbacked to avoid hitting his head on the ceiling and mundungus fletcher small dirty and hangdog with his droopy beady hounds eyes and matted hair harrys heart seemed to expand and glow at the sight he felt incredibly fond of all of them even mundungus whom he had tried to strangle the last time they had met 
 
 kingsley i thought you were looking after the muggle prime minister he called across the room 
 
 he can get along without me for one night said kingsley youre more important 
 
 harry guess what said tonks from her perch on top of the washing machine and she wiggled her left hand at him a ring glistened there 
 
 you got married harry yelped looking from her to lupin 
 
 im sorry you couldnt be there harry it was very quiet 
 
 thats brilliant congrat c 
 
 all right all right well have time for a cozy later roared moody over the hubbub and silence fell in the kitchen moody dropped his sacks at his feet and turned to harry as dedalus probably told you we had to abandon plan a pius thicknesse has gone over which gives us a big problem hes made it an imprisonable offense to connect this house to the floo network place a portkey here or apparate in or out all done in the name of your protection to prevent getting in at you absolutely pointless seeing as your mothers charm does that already what hes really done is to stop you getting out of here safely 
 
 second problem youre underage which means youve still got the trace on you 
 
 i dont c 
 
 the trace the trace said impatiently the charm that detects magical activity around the way the ministry finds out about underage magic if you or anyone around you casts a spell to get you out of here thicknesse is going to know about it and so will the death eaters 
 
 we cant wait for the trace to break because the moment you turn seventeen youll lose all the protection your mother gave you in short pius thicknesse thinks hes got you cornered good and proper 
 
 harry could not help but agree with the unknown thicknesse 
 
 so what are we going to do 
 
 were going to use the only means of transport left to us the only ones the trace cant detect because we dont need to cast spells to use them brooms thestrals and hagrids motorbike 
 
 harry could see flaws in this plan however he held his tongue to give the chance to address them 
 
 now your mothers charm will only break under two conditions when you come of age or c moody gestured around the pristine kitchen c you no longer call this place home you and your aunt and uncle are going your separate ways tonight in the full understanding that youre never going to live together again correct 
 
 harry nodded 
 
 so this time when you leave therell be no going back and the charm will break the moment you get outside its range were choosing to break it early because the alternative is waiting for to come and seize you the moment you turn seventeen 
 
 the one thing weve got on our side is that doesnt know were moving you tonight weve leaked a fake trail to the ministry they think youre not leaving until the thirtieth however this is were dealing with so we cant rely on him getting the date wrong hes bound to have a couple of death eaters patrolling the skies in this general area just in case so weve given a dozen different houses every protection we can throw at them they all look like they could be the place were going to hide you theyve all got some connection with the order my house kingsleys place mollys auntie muriels c you get the idea 
 
 yeah said harry not entirely truthfully because he could still spot a gaping hole in the plan 
 
 youll be going to tonkss parents once youre within the boundaries of the protective enchantments weve put on their house youll be able to use a portkey to the burrow any questions 
 
 er c yes said harry maybe they wont know which of the twelve secure houses im heading for at first but wont it be sort of obvious once c he performed a quick headcount c fourteen of us fly off toward tonkss parents 
 
 ah said moody i forgot to mention the key point fourteen of us wont be flying to tonkss parents there will be seven harry potters moving through the skies tonight each of them with a companion each pair heading for a different safe house 
 
 from inside his cloak moody now withdrew a flask of what looked like mud there was no need for him to say another word harry understood the rest of the plan immediately 
 
 no he said loudly his voice ringing through the kitchen no way 
 
 i told them youd take it like this said hermione with a hint of complacency 
 
 if you think im going to let six people risk their lives c 
 
 c because its the first time for all of us said ron 
 
 this is different pretending to be me c 
 
 well none of us really fancy it harry said fred earnestly imagine if something went wrong and we were stuck as specky scrawny gits forever 
 
 harry did not smile 
 
 you cant do it if i dont cooperate you need me to give you some hair 
 
 well thats the plan scuppered said george obviously theres no chance at all of us getting a bit of your hair unless you cooperate 
 
 yeah thirteen of us against one bloke whos not allowed to use magic weve got no chance said fred 
 
 funny said harry really amusing 
 
 if it has to come to force then it will growled moody his magical eye now quivering a little in its socket as he glared at harry everyone heres overage potter and theyre all prepared to take the risk 
 
 mundungus shrugged and grimaced the magical eye swerved sideways to glance at him out of the side of moodys head 
 
 lets have no more arguments times wearing on i want a few of your hairs boy now 
 
 but this is mad theres no need c 
 
 no need snarled moody with out there and half the ministry on his side potter if were lucky hell have swallowed the fake bait and hell be planning to ambush you on the thirtieth but hed be mad not to have a death eater or two keeping an eye out its what id do they might not be able to get at you or this house while your mothers charm holds but its about to break and they know the rough position of the place our only chance is to use decoys even cant split himself into seven 
 
 harry caught hermiones eye and looked away at once 
 
 so potter c some of your hair if you please 
 
 harry glanced at ron who grimaced at him in a sort of way 
 
 now barked moody 
 
 with all of their eyes upon him harry reached up to the top of his head grabbed a hank of hair and pulled 
 
 good said moody limping forward as he pulled the stopper out of the flask of potion straight in here if you please 
 
 harry dropped the hair into the mudlike liquid the moment it made contact with its surface the potion began to froth and smoke then all at once it turned a clear bright gold 
 
 ooh you look much tastier than crabbe and goyle harry said hermione before catching sight of rons raised eyebrows blushing slightly and saying oh you know what i mean c goyles potion tasted like bogies 
 
 right then fake potters line up over here please said moody 
 
 ron hermione fred george and fleur lined up in front of aunt petunias gleaming sink 
 
 were one short said lupin 
 
 here said hagrid gruffly and he lifted mundungus by the scruff of the neck and dropped him down beside fleur who wrinkled her nose pointedly and moved along to stand between fred and george instead 
 
 im a soldier id sooner be a protector said mundungus 
 
 shut it growled moody as ive already told you you spineless worm any death eaters we run into will be aiming to capture potter not kill him dumbledore always said would want to finish potter in person itll be the protectors who have got the most to worry about the death eatersll want to kill them 
 
 mundungus did not look particularly reassured but moody was already pulling half a dozen glasses from inside his cloak which he handed out before pouring a little polyjuice potion into each one 
 
 altogether then 
 
 ron hermione fred george fleur and mundungus drank all of them gasped and grimaced as the potion hit their throats at once their features began to bubble and distort like hot wax hermione and mundungus were shooting upward ron fred and george were shrinking their hair was darkening hermiones and fleurs appearing to shoot backward into their skulls 
 
 moody quite unconcerned was now loosening the ties of the large sacks he had brought with him when he straightened up again there were six harry potters gasping and panting in front of him 
 
 fred and george turned to each other and said together wow c were identical 
 
 i dunno though i think im still said fred examining his reflection in the kettle 
 
 bah said fleur checking herself in the microwave door bill dont look at me c im ideous 
 
 those whose clothes are a bit roomy ive got smaller here said moody indicating the first sack and vice versa dont forget the glasses theres six pairs in the side pocket and when youre dressed theres luggage in the other sack 
 
 the real harry thought that this might just be the most bizarre thing he had ever seen and he had seen some extremely odd things he watched as his six doppelgangers rummaged in the sacks pulling out sets of clothes putting on glasses stuffing their own things away he felt like asking them to show a little more respect for privacy as they all began stripping off with impunity clearly more at ease with displaying his body than they would have been with their own 
 
 i knew ginny was lying about that tattoo said ron looking down at his bare chest 
 
 harry your eyesight really is awful said hermione as she put on glasses 
 
 once dressed the fake harrys took rucksacks and owl cages each containing a stuffed snowy owl from the second sack 
 
 good said moody as at last seven dressed bespectacled and harrys faced him the pairs will be as follows mundungus will be traveling with me by broom c 
 
 whym i with you grunted the harry nearest the back door 
 
 because youre the one that needs watching growled moody and sure enough his magical eye did not waver from mundungus as he continued arthur and fred c 
 
 im george said the twin at whom moody was pointing cant you even tell us apart when were harry 
 
 sorry george c 
 
 im only yanking your wand im fred really c 
 
 enough messing around snarled moody the other one c george or fred or whoever you are c youre with remus miss delacour c 
 
 im taking fleur on a thestral said bill shes not that fond of brooms 
 
 fleur walked over to stand beside him giving him a soppy slavish look that harry hoped with all his heart would never appear on his face again 
 
 miss granger with kingsley again by thestral c 
 
 hermione looked reassured as she answered kingsleys smile harry knew that hermione too lacked confidence on a broomstick 
 
 which leaves you and me ron said tonks brightly knocking over a mug tree as she waved at him 
 
 ron did not look quite as pleased as hermione 
 
 an youre with me harry that all righ said hagrid looking a little anxious well be on the bike brooms an thestrals cant take me weight see not a lot o room on the seat with me on it though so youll be in the sidecar 
 
 thats great said harry not altogether truthfully 
 
 we think the death eaters will expect you to be on a broom said moody who seemed to guess how harry was feeling snapes had plenty of time to tell them everything about you hes never mentioned before so if we do run into any death eaters were betting theyll choose one of the potters who looks at home on a broomstick all right then he went on tying up the sack with the fake potters clothes in it and leading the way back to the door i make it three minutes until were supposed to leave no point locking the back door it wont keep the death eaters out when they come looking come on 
 
 harry hurried to gather his rucksack firebolt and hedwigs cage and followed the group to the dark back garden 
 
 on every side broomsticks were leaping into hands hermione had already been helped up onto a great black thestral by kingsley fleur onto the other by bill hagrid was standing ready beside the motorbike goggles on 
 
 is this it is this siriuss bike 
 
 the very same said hagrid beaming down at harry an the last time yeh was on it harry i could fit yeh in one hand 
 
 harry could not help but feel a little humiliated as he got into the sidecar it placed him several feet below everybody else ron smirked at the sight of him sitting there like a child in a bumper car harry stuffed his rucksack and broomstick down by his feet and rammed hedwigs cage between his knees he was extremely uncomfortable 
 
 arthurs done a bit o tinkerin said hagrid quite oblivious to harrys discomfort he settled himself astride the motorcycle which creaked slightly and sank inches into the ground its got a few tricks up its sleeves now tha one was my idea he pointed a thick finger at a purple button near the speedometer 
 
 please be careful hagrid said mr weasley who was standing beside them holding his broomstick im still not sure that was advisable and its certainly only to be used in emergencies 
 
 all right then said moody everyone ready please i want us all to leave at exactly the same time or the whole point of the diversions lost 
 
 everybody motioned their heads hold tight now ron said tonks and harry saw ron throw a forcing guilty look at lupin before placing his hands on each side of her waist hagrid kicked the motorbike into life it roared like a dragon and the sidecar began to vibrate 
 
 good luck everyone shouted moody see you all in about an hour at the burrow on the count of three one two three 
 
 there was a great roar from the motorbike and harry felt the sidecar give a nasty lurch he was rising through the air fast his eyes watering slightly hair whipped back off his face around him brooms were soaring upward too the long black tail of a thestral flicked past his legs jammed into the sidecar by hedwigs cage and his rucksack were already sore and starting to go numb so great was his discomfort that he almost forgot to take a last glimpse of number four privet drive by the time he looked over the edge of the sidecar he could no longer tell which one it was 
 
 and then out of nowhere out of nothing they were surrounded at least thirty hooded figures suspended in midair formed a vast circle in the middle of which the order members had risen oblivious c screams a blaze of green light on every side hagrid gave a yell and the motorbike rolled over harry lost any sense of where they were streetlights above him yells around him he was clinging to the sidecar for dear life hedwigs cage the firebolt and his rucksack slipped from beneath his knees c 
 
 no c help 
 
 the broomstick spun too but he just managed to seize the strap of his rucksack and the top of the cage as the motorbike swung the right way up again a seconds relief and then another burst of green light the owl screeched and fell to the floor of the cage 
 
 no c no 
 
 the motorbike zoomed forward harry glimpsed hooded death eaters scattering as hagrid blasted through their circle 
 
 hedwig c hedwig c 
 
 but the owl lay motionless and pathetic as a toy on the floor of her cage he could not take it in and his terror for the others was paramount he glanced over his shoulder and saw a mass of people moving flares of green light two pairs of people on brooms soaring off into the distance but he could not tell who they were c 
 
 hagrid weve got to go back weve got to go back he yelled over the thunderous roar of the engine pulling out his wand ramming hedwigs cage into the floor refusing to believe that she was dead hagrid turn around 
 
 my jobs ter get you there safe harry bellow hagrid and he opened the throttle stop c stop harry shouted but as he looked back again two jets of green light flew past his left ear four death eaters had broken away from the circle and were pursuing them aiming for hagrids broad back hagrid swerved but the death eaters were keeping up with the bike more curses shot after them and harry had to sink low into the sidecar to avoid them wriggling around he cried stupefy and a red bolt of light shot from his own wand cleaving a gap between the four pursuing death eaters as they scattered to avoid it 
 
 hold on harry thisll do for em roared hagrid and harry looked up just in time to see hagrid slamming a thick finger into a green button near the fuel gauge a wall a solid black wall erupted out of the exhaust pipe craning his neck harry saw it expand into being in midair three of the death eaters swerved and avoided it but the fourth was not so lucky he vanished from view and then dropped like a boulder from behind it his broomstick broken into pieces one of his fellows slowed up to save him but they and the airborne wall were swallowed by darkness as hagrid leaned low over the handlebars and sped up 
 
 more killing curses flew past harrys head from the two remaining death eaters wands they were aiming for hagrid harry responded with further stunning spells red and green collided in midair in a shower of multicolored sparks and harry thought wildly of fireworks and the muggles below who would have no idea what was happening c 
 
 here we go again harry hold on yelled hagrid and he jabbed at a second button this time a great net burst from the bikes exhaust but the death eaters were ready for it not only did they swerve to avoid it but the companion who had slowed to save their unconscious friend had caught up he bloomed suddenly out of the darkness and now three of them were pursuing the motorbike all shooting curses after it 
 
 thisll do it harry hold on tight yelled hagrid and harry saw him slam his whole hand onto the purple button beside the speedometer 
 
 with an unmistakable bellowing roar dragon fire burst from the exhaust and blue and the motorbike shot forward like a bullet with a sound of wrenching metal harry saw the death eaters swerve out of sight to avoid the deadly trail of flame and at the same time felt the sidecar sway ominously its metal connections to the bike had splintered with the force of acceleration 
 
 its all righ harry bellowed hagrid now thrown flat onto the back by the surge of speed nobody was steering now and the sidecar was starting to twist violently in the bikes slipstream 
 
 im on it harry don worry hagrid yelled and from inside his jacket pocket he pulled his flowery pink umbrella 
 
 hagrid no let me 
 
 reparo 
 
 there was a deafening bang and the sidecar broke away from the bike completely harry sped forward propelled by the impetus of the bikes flight then the sidecar began to lose height c 
 
 in desperation harry pointed his wand at the sidecar and shouted wingardium leviosa 
 
 the sidecar rose like a cork unsteerable but at least still airborne he had but a split seconds relief however as more curses streaked past him the three death eaters were closing in 
 
 im comin harry hagrid yelled from out of the darkness but harry could feel the sidecar beginning to sink again crouching as low as he could he pointed at the middle of the oncoming figures and yelled impedimenta 
 
 the jinx hit the middle death eater in the chest for a moment the man was absurdly in midair as though he had hit an invisible barrier one of his fellows almost collided with him c then the sidecar began to fall in earnest and the remaining death eater shot a curse so close to harry that he had to duck below the rim of the car knocking out a tooth on the edge of his seat c 
 
 im comin harry im comin 
 
 a huge hand seized the back of harrys robes and hoisted him out of the plummeting sidecar harry pulled his rucksack with him as he dragged himself onto the motorbikes seat and found himself with hagrid as they soared upward away from the two remaining death eaters harry spat blood out of his mouth pointed his wand at the falling sidecar and yelled confringo 
 
 he knew a dreadful pang for hedwig as it exploded the death eater nearest it was blasted off his broom and fell from sight his companion fell back and vanished 
 
 harry im sorry im sorry moaned hagrid i shouldnta tried ter repair it meself c yehve got no room c 
 
 its not a problem just keep flying harry shouted back as two more death eaters emerged out of the darkness drawing closer 
 
 as the curses came shooting across the intervening space again hagrid swerved and zigzagged harry knew that hagrid did not dare use the button again with harry seated so insecurely harry sent stunning spell after stunning spell back at their pursuers barely holding them off he shot another blocking jinx at them the closest death eater swerved to avoid it and his hood slipped and by the red light of his next stunning spell harry saw the strangely blank face of stanley shunpike c stan c 
 
 expelliarmus harry yelled 
 
 thats him its him its the real one 
 
 the hooded death eaters shout reached harry even above the thunder of the motorbikes engine next moment both pursuers had fallen back and disappeared from view 
 
 harry whats happened bellowed hagrid whereve they gone 
 
 i dont know 
 
 but harry was afraid the hooded death eater had shouted its the real one how had he known he gazed around at the apparently empty darkness and felt its menace where were they 
 
 he clambered around on the seat to face forward and seized hold of the back of hagrids jacket 
 
 hagrid do the thing again lets get out of here 
 
 hold on tight then harry 
 
 there was a deafening screeching roar again and the fire shot from the exhaust harry felt himself slipping backwards off what little of the seat he had hagrid flung backward upon him barely maintaining his grip on the handlebars c i think weve lost em harry i think weve done it yelled hagrid 
 
 but harry was not convinced fear lapped at him as he looked left and right for pursuers he was sure would come why had they fallen back one of them had still had a wand its him its the real one they had said it right after he had tried to disarm stan 
 
 were nearly there harry weve nearly made it shouted hagrid 
 
 harry felt the bike drop a little though the lights down on the ground still seemed remote as stars 
 
 then the scar on his forehead burned like fire as a death eater appeared on either side of the bike two killing curses missed harry by millimeters cast from behind c and then harry saw him voldemort was flying like smoke on the wind without broomstick or thestral to hold him his face gleaming out of the blackness his white fingers raising his wand again c 
 
 hagrid let out a bellow of fear and steered the motorbike into a vertical dive clinging on for dear life harry sent stunning spells flying at random into the whirling night he saw a body fly past him and knew he had hit one of them but then he heard a bang and saw sparks from the engine the motorbike spiraled through the air completely out of control c 
 
 green jets of light shot past them again harry had no idea which way was up which down his scar was still burning he expected to die at any second a hooded figure on a broomstick was feet from him he saw it raise its arm c 
 
 no 
 
 with a shout of fury hagrid launched himself off the bike at the death eater to his horror harry saw both hagrid and the death eater falling out of sight their combined weight too much for the broomstick c 
 
 barely gripping the plummeting bike with his knees harry heard voldemort scream mine 
 
 it was over he could not see or hear where voldemort was he glimpsed another death eater swooping out of the way and heard avada c 
 
 as the pain from harrys scar forced his eyes shut his wand acted of its own accord he felt it drag his hand around like some great magnet saw a spurt of golden fire through his eyelids heard a crack and a scream of fury the remaining death eater yelled voldemort screamed no somehow harry found his nose an inch from the button he punched it with his hand and the bike shot more flames into the air hurtling straight toward the ground 
 
 hagrid harry called holding on to the bike for dear life hagrid c accio hagrid 
 
 the motorbike sped up sucked towards the earth face level with the handlebars harry could see nothing but distant lights growing nearer and nearer he was going to crash and there was nothing he could do about it behind him came another scream your wand selwyn give me your wand 
 
 he felt voldemort before he saw him looking sideways he stared into the red eyes and was sure they would be the last thing he ever saw voldemort preparing to curse him once more c 
 
 and then voldemort vanished harry looked down and saw hagrid on the ground below him he pulled hard at the handlebars to avoid hitting him groped for the brake but with an earsplitting ground trembling crash he smashed into a muddy pond

 fairy tales of hans christian andersen 
 a rose from grave 
 by hans christian andersen 
 
 all the songs of the east speak of the love of the nightingale for the rose in the silent starlight night the winged songster serenades the fragrant flowers 
 
 not far from smyrna where the merchant drives his loaded 
 camels proudly arching their long necks as they journey beneath the 
 lofty pines over holy ground i saw a hedge of roses the 
 flew among the branches of the tall trees and as the 
 sunbeams fell upon her wings they glistened as if they were 
 on the grew a flower more beautiful than 
 them all and to her the nightingale sung of his woes but the rose 
 remained silent not even a dewdrop lay like a tear of sympathy on her 
 leaves at last she bowed her head over a heap of stones and said 
 here rests the greatest singer in the world over his tomb will i 
 spread my fragrance and on it i will let my leaves fall when the 
 storm scatters them he who sung of troy became earth and from that earth i have sprung i a rose from the grave of homer am too lofty to bloom for a nightingale then the nightingale sung himself to 
 death a came by with his loaded camels and his black 
 slaves his little son found the dead bird and buried the lovely 
 songster in the grave of the great homer while the rose trembled in 
 the wind 
 
 the evening came and the rose wrapped her leaves more closely 
 round her and dreamed and this was her dream 
 
 it was a fair sunshiny day a crowd of strangers drew near who had 
 undertaken a pilgrimage to the grave of homer among the strangers was a minstrel from the north the home of the clouds and the brilliant 
 lights of the aurora borealis he plucked the rose and placed it in 
 a book and carried it away into a distant part of the world his 
 fatherland the rose faded with grief and lay between the leaves of 
 the book which he opened in his own home saying here is a rose 
 from the grave of homer 
 
 then the flower awoke from her dream and trembled in the wind 
 a drop of dew fell from the leaves upon the grave the sun 
 rose and the flower bloomed more beautiful than ever the day was 
 hot and she was still in her own warm asia then footsteps 
 approached strangers such as the rose had seen in her dream came 
 by and among them was a poet from the north he plucked the rose 
 pressed a kiss upon her fresh mouth and carried her away to the 
 home of the clouds and the northern lights like a mummy the flower 
 now rests in his iliad and as in her dream she hears him say 
 as he opens the book here is a rose from the grave of homer

 sophist 
 
 by plato 
 
 translated by benjamin jowett 
 book i 
 
 persons of the dialogue theodorus theaetetus socrates 
 an eleatic stranger whom theodorus and theaetetus bring 
 with them the younger socrates who is a silent auditor 
 
 theodorus here we are socrates true to our agreement of 
 yesterday and we bring with us a stranger from elea who is a 
 disciple of parmenides and zeno and a true philosopher 
 
 socrates is he not rather a god theodorus who comes to us in 
 the disguise of a stranger for homer says that all the gods and 
 especially the god of strangers are companions of the meek and 
 just and visit the good and evil among men and may not your 
 companion be one of those higher powers a deity 
 who has come to spy out our weakness in argument and to 
 us 
 
 theod nay socrates he is not one of the disputatious is 
 too good for that and in my opinion he is not a god at all but 
 divine he certainly is for this is a title which i should 
 give to all philosophers 
 
 soc capital my friend and i may add that they are almost as 
 hard to be discerned as the gods for the true philosophers and 
 such as are not merely made up for the occasion appear in various 
 forms unrecognized by the ignorance of men and they hover about 
 cities as homer declares looking from above upon human life and 
 some think nothing of them and others can never think enough and 
 sometimes they appear as statesmen and sometimes as sophists and 
 then again to many they seem to be no better than madmen i should 
 like to ask our eleatic friend if he would tell us what is thought 
 about them in italy and to whom the terms are applied 
 
 theod what terms 
 
 soc sophist statesman philosopher 
 
 theod what is your difficulty about them and what made you ask 
 
 soc i want to know whether by his countrymen they are regarded as 
 one or two or do they as the names are three distinguish 
 also three kinds and assign one to each name 
 
 theod i dare say that the stranger will not object to discuss the 
 question what do you say stranger 
 
 stranger i am far from objecting theodorus nor have i any 
 difficulty in replying that by us they are regarded as three but to 
 define precisely the nature of each of them is by no means a 
 slight or easy task 
 
 theod you have happened to light socrates almost on the very 
 question which we were asking our friend before we came 
 hither and he excused himself to us as he does now you although he admitted that the matter had been fully discussed and that he remembered the answer 
 
 soc then do not stranger deny us the first favour which 
 we ask of you i am sure that you will not and therefore i shall only beg of you to say whether you like and are accustomed to make a long oration on a subject which you want to explain to another or to 
 proceed by the method of question and answer i remember hearing a 
 very noble discussion in which parmenides employed the latter of the 
 two methods when i was a young man and he was far advanced 
 in years 
 
 str i prefer to talk with another when he responds pleasantly 
 and is light in hand if not i would rather have my own say 
 soc any one of the present company will respond kindly to you 
 and you can choose whom you like of them i should recommend you to take a young for you have a preference for some one else 
 
 str i feel ashamed socrates being a new comer into your 
 society instead of talking a little and hearing others talk to be 
 spinning out a long soliloquy or address as if i wanted to show 
 off for the true answer will certainly be a very long one a great 
 deal longer than might be expected from such a short and simple 
 question at the same time i fear that i may seem rude and 
 ungracious if i refuse your courteous request especially after what you have said for i certainly cannot object to your proposal that 
 theaetetus should respond having already conversed with him myself and being recommended by you to take him 
 theaetetus but are you sure stranger that this will be quite so 
 acceptable to the rest of the company as socrates imagines 
 
 str you hear them applauding theaetetus after that there is 
 nothing more to be said well then i am to argue with you 
 and if you tire of the argument you may complain of your friends and not of me 
 
 theaet i do not think that i shall tire and if i do i shall get 
 my friend here young socrates the namesake of the elder 
 socrates to help he is about my own age and my partner at the gymnasium and is constantly accustomed to work with me 
 
 str very good you can decide about that for yourself as we 
 proceed meanwhile you and i will begin together and enquire into 
 the nature of the sophist first of the three i should like you to 
 make out what he is and bring him to light in a discussion for at 
 present we are only agreed about the name but of the thing to which 
 we both apply the name possibly you have one notion and i another 
 whereas we ought always to come to an understanding about the thing 
 itself in terms of a definition and not merely about the name minus 
 the definition now the tribe of sophists which we are investigating 
 is not easily caught or defined and the world has long ago agreed 
 that if great subjects are to be adequately treated they must be 
 studied in the lesser and easier instances of them before we proceed 
 to the greatest of all and as i know that the tribe of sophists is 
 troublesome and hard to be caught i should recommend that 
 we practise beforehand the method which is to be applied to him on some simple and smaller thing unless you can suggest a better way 
 theaet indeed i cannot 
 
 str then suppose that we work out some lesser example 
 which will be a pattern of the greater 
 
 theaet good 
 
 str what is there which is well known and not great and is yet 
 as susceptible of definition as any larger thing shall i say an 
 angler he is familiar to all of us and not a very interesting or 
 important person 
 
 theaet he is not 
 
 str yet i suspect that he will furnish us with the sort of 
 definition and line of enquiry which we want 
 
 theaet very good 
 
 str let us begin by asking whether he is a man having art or not 
 having art but some other power 
 
 theaet he is clearly a man of art 
 
 str and of arts there are two kinds 
 
 theaet what are they 
 
 str there is agriculture and the tending of mortal creatures 
 and the art of constructing or moulding vessels and there is the 
 art of these may be appropriately called by a single 
 name 
 
 theaet what do you mean and what is the name 
 
 str he who brings into existence something that did not exist 
 before is said to be a producer and that which is brought into 
 existence is said to be produced 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str and all the arts which were just now mentioned are 
 characterized by this power of producing 
 
 theaet they are 
 
 str then let us sum them up under the name of productive or 
 creative art 
 
 theaet very good 
 
 str next follows the whole class of learning and cognition then 
 comes trade fighting hunting and since none of these produces 
 anything but is only engaged in conquering by word or deed or in 
 preventing others from conquering things which exist and have been 
 already each and all of these branches there 
 appears to be an art which may be called acquisitive 
 
 theaet yes that is the proper name 
 
 str seeing then that all arts are either acquisitive or 
 creative in which class shall we place the art of the angler 
 
 theaet clearly in the acquisitive class 
 
 str and the acquisitive may be subdivided into two parts there 
 is exchange which is voluntary and is effected by gifts hire 
 purchase and the other part of acquisitive which takes by force of 
 word or deed may be termed conquest 
 
 theaet that is implied in what has been said 
 
 str and may not conquest be again subdivided 
 theaet how 
 
 str open force may be called fighting and secret force may have 
 the general name of hunting 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str and there is no reason why the art of hunting should not be 
 further divided 
 
 theaet how would you make the division 
 
 str into the hunting of living and of lifeless prey 
 
 theaet yes if both kinds exist 
 
 str of course they exist but the hunting after lifeless things 
 having no special name except some sorts of diving and other small 
 matters may be omitted the hunting after living things may 
 be called animal hunting 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str and animal hunting may be truly said to have two divisions 
 hunting which has many kinds and names and 
 
 hunting or the hunting after animals who swim 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str and of swimming animals one class lives on the wing and the 
 other in the water 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str fowling is the general term under which the hunting of all 
 birds is included 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str the hunting of animals who live in the water has the general 
 name of fishing 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str and this sort of hunting may be further divided also into two 
 principal kinds 
 
 theaet what are they 
 
 str there is one kind which takes them in nets another 
 which takes them by a blow 
 
 theaet what do you mean and how do you distinguish them 
 
 str as to the first that surrounds and encloses anything 
 to prevent egress may be rightly called an enclosure 
 
 theaet very true 
 str for which reason twig baskets casting nets nooses creels 
 and the like may all be termed enclosures 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str and therefore this first kind of capture may be called by us 
 capture with enclosures or something of that sort 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str the other kind which is practised by a blow with hooks and 
 three pronged spears when summed up under one name may be called striking unless you theaetetus can find some better name 
 
 theaet never mind the you suggest will do very well 
 
 str there is one mode of striking which is done at night and by 
 the light of a fire and is by the hunters themselves called firing 
 or spearing by firelight 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str and the fishing by day is called by the general name 
 of barbing because the spears too are barbed at the point 
 
 theaet yes that is the term 
 
 str of this that which strikes the fish who is 
 below from above is called spearing because this is the way in 
 which the spears are mostly used 
 
 theaet yes it is often called so 
 
 str then now there is only one kind remaining 
 
 theaet what is that 
 
 str when a hook is used and the fish is not struck in any chance 
 part of his as be is with the spear but only about the head 
 and mouth and is then drawn out from below upwards with reeds and is the right name of that mode of fish theaetetus 
 
 theaet i suspect that we have now discovered the object of our 
 search 
 
 str then now you and i have come to an understanding not 
 only about the name of the art but about the definition of the thing itself one half of all art was of all the art 
 acquisitive art was conquest or taking by force half of this was 
 hunting and half of hunting was hunting animals half of this was 
 hunting water this again the under half was fishing 
 half of fishing was striking a part of striking was fishing with a 
 barb and one half of this again being the kind which strikes with 
 a hook and draws the fish from below upwards is the art 
 which we have been seeking and which from the nature of the operation is denoted angling or drawing up aspalienutike anaspasthai 
 
 theaet the result has been quite satisfactorily brought out 
 
 str and now following this pattern let us endeavour to find out 
 what a sophist is 
 
 theaet by all means 
 
 str the first question about the angler was whether he was a 
 skilled artist or unskilled 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str and shall we call our new friend unskilled or a thorough 
 master of his craft 
 
 theaet certainly not unskilled for his name as indeed you 
 imply must surely express his nature 
 
 str then he must be supposed to have some art 
 
 theaet what art 
 
 str by heaven they are cousins it never occurred to us 
 
 theaet who are cousins 
 
 str the angler and the sophist 
 
 theaet in what way are they related 
 
 str they both appear to me to be hunters 
 
 theaet how the sophist of the other we have spoken 
 
 str you remember our division of hunting into hunting after 
 swimming animals and land animals 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str and you remember that we subdivided the swimming and left the 
 land animals saying that there were many kinds of them 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str thus far then the sophist and the angler starting from the 
 art of acquiring take the same road 
 
 theaet so it would appear 
 
 str their paths diverge when they reach the art of animal 
 hunting the one going to the seashore and to the rivers and to the 
 lakes and angling for the animals which are in them 
 
 theaet very true 
 
 str while the other goes to land and water of another 
 of wealth and broad of generous youth and he also is 
 intending to take the animals which are in them 
 
 theaet what do you mean 
 
 str of hunting on land there are two principal divisions 
 
 theaet what are they 
 
 str one is the hunting of tame and the other of wild animals 
 
 theaet but are tame animals ever hunted 
 
 str yes if you include man under tame animals but if 
 you like you may say that there are no tame animals or that if there are man is not among them or you may say that man is a tame animal 
 but is not shall decide which of these alternatives you prefer 
 
 theaet i should say stranger that man is a tame animal and i 
 admit that he is hunted 
 
 str then let us divide the hunting of tame animals into two parts 
 theaet how shall we make the division 
 
 str let us define piracy tyranny the 
 whole military art by one name as hunting with violence 
 
 theaet very good 
 
 str but the art of the lawyer of the popular orator and the art 
 of conversation may be called in one word the art of persuasion 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str and of persuasion there may be said to be two kinds 
 
 theaet what are they 
 
 str one is private and the other public 
 
 theaet yes each of them forms a class 
 
 str and of private hunting one sort receives hire and the other 
 brings gifts 
 
 theaet i do not understand you 
 
 str you seem never to have observed the manner in which lovers 
 hunt 
 
 theaet to what do you refer 
 
 str i mean that they lavish gifts on those whom they hunt in 
 addition to other inducements 
 
 theaet most true 
 
 str let us admit this then to be the amatory art 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str but that sort of hireling whose conversation is pleasing and 
 who baits his hook only with pleasure and exacts nothing but his 
 maintenance in return we should all if i am not mistaken describe 
 as possessing flattery or an art of making things pleasant 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str and that sort which professes to form acquaintances only for 
 the sake of virtue and demands a reward in the shape of 
 money may be fairly called by another name 
 
 theaet to be sure 
 
 str and what is the name will you tell me 
 
 theaet it is obvious enough for i believe that we have 
 discovered the sophist which is as i conceive the proper name for 
 the class described 
 
 str then now theaetetus his art may be traced as a branch of 
 the appropriative acquisitive hunts 
 animals which hunts 
 money in the semblance of education 
 and this is termed sophistry and is a hunt after young men of 
 wealth and is the conclusion 
 
 theaet just so 
 
 str let us take another branch of his genealogy for he is a 
 professor of a great and many sided art and if we look back at what 
 has preceded we see that he presents another aspect besides that of 
 which we are speaking 
 
 theaet in what respect 
 
 str there were two sorts of acquisitive art the one 
 concerned with hunting the other with exchange 
 
 theaet there were 
 
 str and of the art of exchange there are two divisions the one 
 of giving and the other of selling 
 
 theaet let us assume that 
 
 str next will suppose the art of selling to be divided into two 
 parts 
 
 theaet how 
 
 str there is one part which is distinguished as the sale 
 of a own productions another which is the exchange of the works of others 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str and is not that part of exchange which takes place in 
 the about half of the whole termed retailing 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str and that which exchanges the goods of one city for those of 
 another by selling and buying is the exchange of the merchant 
 
 theaet to be sure 
 
 str and you are aware that this exchange of the merchant is of 
 two kinds it is partly concerned with food for the use of the body 
 and partly with the food of the soul which is bartered and 
 received in exchange for money 
 
 theaet what do you mean 
 
 str you want to know what is the meaning of food for the soul 
 the other kind you surely understand 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str take music in general and painting and marionette playing and 
 many other things which are purchased in one city and carried away 
 and sold in of the soul which are hawked about either 
 for the sake of instruction or not he who takes them 
 about and sells them be quite as truly called a merchant as he who 
 sells meats and drinks 
 
 theaet to be sure he may 
 
 str and would you not call by the same name him who buys up 
 knowledge and goes about from city to city exchanging his wares for 
 money 
 
 theaet certainly i should 
 
 str of this merchandise of the soul may not one part be fairly 
 termed the art of display and there is another part which is 
 certainly not less ridiculous but being a trade in learning must be 
 called by some name germane to the matter 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str the latter should have two descriptive of the sale 
 of the knowledge of virtue and the other of the sale of other kinds 
 of knowledge 
 
 theaet of course 
 
 str the name of corresponds well enough to the latter 
 but you must try and tell me the name of the other 
 
 theaet he must be the sophist whom we are seeking no other name 
 can possibly be right 
 
 str no other and so this trader in virtue again turns out to be 
 our friend the sophist whose art may now be traced from the art of 
 acquisition through exchange trade merchandise to a merchandise 
 of the soul which is concerned with speech and the knowledge of 
 virtue 
 
 theaet quite true 
 
 str and there may be a third reappearance of he may have 
 settled down in a city and may fabricate as well as buy these same 
 wares intending to live by selling them and he would still 
 be called a sophist 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str then that part of acquisitive art which exchanges and of 
 exchange which either sells a own productions or retails those 
 of others as the case may be and in either way sells the knowledge 
 of virtue you would again term sophistry 
 
 theaet i must if i am to keep pace with the argument 
 
 str let us consider once more whether there may not be yet 
 another aspect of sophistry 
 
 theaet what is it 
 
 str in the acquisitive there was a subdivision of the combative 
 or fighting art 
 
 theaet there was 
 
 str perhaps we had better divide it 
 
 theaet what shall be the divisions 
 
 str there shall be one division of the competitive and another 
 of the pugnacious 
 
 theaet very good 
 
 str that part of the pugnacious which is contest of 
 bodily strength may be properly called by some such name as violent 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str and when the war is one of words it may be termed 
 controversy 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str and controversy may be of two kinds 
 
 theaet what are they 
 
 str when long speeches are answered by long speeches and there 
 is public discussion about the just and unjust that is forensic 
 controversy 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str and there is a private sort of controversy which is cut up 
 into questions and answers and this is commonly called disputation 
 
 theaet yes that is the name 
 
 str and of disputation that sort which is only a discussion 
 about contracts and is carried on at random and without 
 is recognized by the reasoning faculty to be a distinct 
 class but has hitherto had no distinctive name and does not deserve to receive one from us 
 
 theaet no for the different sorts of it are too minute and 
 heterogeneous 
 
 str but that which proceeds by rules of art to dispute about 
 justice and injustice in their own nature and about things in 
 general we have been accustomed to call argumentation eristic 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str and of argumentation one sort wastes money and the other 
 makes money 
 
 theaet very true 
 
 str suppose we try and give to each of these two classes a name 
 
 theaet let us do so 
 
 str i should say that the habit which leads a man to neglect his 
 own affairs for the pleasure of conversation of which the style is 
 far from being agreeable to the majority of his hearers may 
 be fairly termed loquacity such is my opinion 
 
 theaet that is the common name for it 
 
 str but now who the other is who makes money out of private 
 disputation it is your turn to say 
 
 theaet there is only one true answer he is the wonderful 
 sophist of whom we are in pursuit and who reappears again for the 
 fourth time 
 
 str yes and with a fresh pedigree for he is the 
 species of the eristic disputatious controversial pugnacious 
 combative acquisitive family as the argument has already proven 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str how true was the observation that he was a animal 
 and not to be caught with one hand as they say 
 
 theaet then you must catch him with two 
 
 str yes we must if we can and therefore let us try another 
 track in our pursuit of him you are aware that there are certain 
 menial occupations which have names among servants 
 
 theaet yes there are many such which of them do you mean 
 
 str i mean such as sifting straining winnowing threshing 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str and besides these there are a great many more such 
 as carding spinning adjusting the warp and the woof and thousands of similar expressions are used in the arts 
 
 theaet of what are they to be patterns and what are we 
 going to do with them all 
 
 str i think that in all of these there is implied a notion of 
 division 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str then if as i was saying there is one art which includes all 
 of them ought not that art to have one name 
 
 theaes and what is the name of the art 
 
 str the art of discerning or discriminating 
 
 theaet very good 
 
 str think whether you cannot divide this 
 
 theaet i should have to think a long while 
 
 str in all the previously named processes either like has been 
 separated from like or the better from the worse 
 
 theaet i see now what you mean 
 
 str there is no name for the first kind of separation of the 
 second which throws away the worse and preserves the better i do 
 know a name 
 
 theaet what is it 
 
 str every discernment or discrimination of that kind as i have 
 observed is called a purification 
 
 theaet yes that is the usual expression 
 
 str and any one may see that purification is of two kinds 
 
 theaet perhaps so if he were allowed time to think but i do not 
 see at this moment 
 
 str there are many purifications of bodies which may with 
 propriety be comprehended under a single name 
 
 theaet what are they and what is their name 
 
 str there is the purification of living bodies in their inward 
 and in their outward parts of which the former is duly effected by 
 medicine and gymnastic the latter by the not very dignified art of 
 the and there is the purification of inanimate 
 this the arts of fulling and of furbishing in general attend in a number of minute particulars having a variety of names which are thought ridiculous 
 
 theaet very true 
 
 str there can be no doubt that they are thought ridiculous 
 
 theaetetus but then the dialectical art never considers whether the 
 benefit to be derived from the purge is greater or less than that to 
 be derived from the sponge and has not more interest in the one 
 than in the other her endeavour is to know what is and is 
 not kindred in all arts with a view to the acquisition of intelligence and having this in view she honours them all alike and when she makes comparisons she counts one of them not a whit more ridiculous than another nor does she esteem him who adduces as his example of hunting the art at all more decorous than another who cites that of the but only as the greater 
 pretender of the two and as to your question concerning the name 
 which was to comprehend all these arts of purification whether of 
 animate or inanimate bodies the art of dialectic is in no wise 
 particular about fine words if she maybe only allowed to have a 
 general name for all other purifications binding them up 
 together and separating them off from the purification of the soul or intellect for this is the purification at which she wants to arrive 
 and this we should understand to be her aim 
 
 theaet yes i understand and i agree that there are two sorts of 
 purification and that one of them is concerned with the 
 soul and that there is another which is concerned with the body 
 
 str excellent and now listen to what i am going to say 
 and try to divide further the first of the two 
 
 theaet whatever line of division you suggest i will endeavour to 
 assist you 
 
 str do we admit that virtue is distinct from vice in the soul 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str and purification was to leave the good and to cast 
 out whatever is bad 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str then any taking away of evil from the soul may be properly 
 called purification 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str and in the soul there are two kinds of evil 
 
 theaet what are they 
 
 str the one may be compared to disease in the body the other to 
 deformity 
 
 theaet i do not understand 
 
 str perhaps you have never reflected that disease and discord are 
 the same 
 
 theaet to this again i know not what i should reply 
 
 str do you not conceive discord to be a dissolution of kindred 
 clements originating in some disagreement 
 
 theaet just that 
 
 str and is deformity anything but the want of measure which is 
 always unsightly 
 
 theaet exactly 
 
 str and do we not see that opinion is opposed to desire pleasure 
 to anger reason to pain and that all these elements are opposed to 
 one another in the souls of bad men 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str and yet they must all be akin 
 
 theaet of course 
 
 str then we shall be right in calling vice a discord and 
 disease of the soul 
 
 theaet most true 
 
 str and when things having motion an aiming at an appointed 
 mark continually miss their aim and glance aside shall we say that 
 this is the effect of symmetry among them or of the want of 
 symmetry 
 
 theaet clearly of the want of symmetry 
 
 str but surely we know that no soul is voluntarily ignorant of 
 anything 
 
 theaet certainly not 
 
 str and what is ignorance but the aberration of a mind which is 
 bent on truth and in which the process of understanding is 
 perverted 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str then we are to regard an unintelligent soul as deformed and 
 devoid of symmetry 
 
 theaet very true 
 
 str then there are these two kinds of evil in the one 
 which is generally called vice and is obviously a disease of the 
 soul 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str and there is the other which they call ignorance and which 
 because existing only in the soul they will not allow to be vice 
 
 theaet i certainly admit what i at first there are 
 two kinds of vice in the soul and that we ought to consider 
 cowardice intemperance and injustice to be alike forms of 
 disease in the soul and ignorance of which there are all sorts of 
 varieties to be deformity 
 
 str and in the case of the body are there not two arts which 
 have to do with the two bodily states 
 
 theaet what are they 
 
 str there is gymnastic which has to do with deformity and 
 medicine which has to do with disease 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str and where there is insolence and injustice and cowardice is 
 not chastisement the art which is most required 
 
 theaet that certainly appears to be the opinion of mankind 
 
 str again of the various kinds of ignorance may not instruction 
 be rightly said to be the remedy 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str and of the art of instruction shall we say that there is one 
 or many kinds at any rate there are two principal ones think 
 
 theaet i will 
 
 str i believe that i can see how we shall soonest arrive at the 
 answer to this question 
 
 theaet how 
 
 str if we can discover a line which divides ignorance into two 
 halves for a division of ignorance into two parts will certainly 
 imply that the art of instruction is also twofold answering to the 
 two divisions of ignorance 
 
 theaet well and do you see what you are looking for 
 
 str i do seem to myself to see one very large and bad sort of 
 ignorance which is quite separate and may be weighed in the scale 
 against all other sorts of ignorance put together 
 
 theaet what is it 
 
 str when a person supposes that he knows and does not know this 
 appears to be the great source of all the errors of the intellect 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str and this if i am not mistaken is the kind of ignorance 
 which specially earns the title of stupidity 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str what name then shall be given to the sort of instruction 
 which gets rid of this 
 
 theaet the instruction which you mean stranger is i should 
 imagine not the teaching of handicraft arts but what thanks to 
 us has been termed education in this part the world 
 
 str yes theaetetus and by nearly all hellenes but we have 
 still to consider whether education admits of any further division 
 
 theaet we have 
 
 str i think that there is a point at which such a division is 
 possible 
 
 theaet where 
 
 str of education one method appears to be rougher and another 
 smoother 
 
 theaet how are we to distinguish the two 
 
 str there is the mode which our fathers commonly 
 practised towards their sons and which is still adopted by 
 of roughly reproving their errors or of gently advising 
 them which varieties may be correctly included under the 
 general term of admonition 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str but whereas some appear to have arrived at the conclusion 
 that all ignorance is involuntary and that no one who thinks 
 himself wise is willing to learn any of those things in which he is 
 conscious of his own cleverness and that the admonitory sort of 
 instruction gives much trouble and does little good 
 
 theaet there they are quite right 
 
 str accordingly they set to work to eradicate the spirit of 
 conceit in another way 
 
 theaet in what way 
 
 str they a words when he thinks that he is 
 saying something and is really saying nothing and easily convict 
 him of inconsistencies in his opinions these they then 
 collect by the dialectical process and placing them side by side show that they contradict one another about the same things in relation to the same things and in the same respect he seeing this is angry with himself and grows gentle towards others and thus is entirely delivered from great prejudices and harsh notions in a way which is most amusing to the hearer and produces the most lasting good effect on the person who is the subject of the operation for as the physician considers that the body will receive no benefit from 
 taking food until the internal obstacles have been removed so the 
 purifier of the soul is conscious that his patient will receive no 
 benefit from the application of knowledge until he is refuted and 
 from refutation learns modesty he must be purged of his prejudices 
 first and made to think that he knows only what he knows 
 and no more 
 
 theaet that is certainly the best and wisest state of mind 
 
 str for all these reasons theaetetus we must admit that 
 refutation is the greatest and chiefest of purifications and he who 
 has not been refuted though he be the great king himself is in an 
 awful state of impurity he is uninstructed and deformed in those 
 things in which he who would be truly blessed ought to be fairest 
 and purest 
 
 theaet very true 
 
 str and who are the ministers of this art 
 i am afraid to say the sophists 
 
 theaet why 
 
 str lest we should assign to them too high a prerogative 
 
 theaet yet the sophist has a certain likeness to our minister of 
 purification 
 
 str yes the same sort of likeness which a wolf who is the 
 fiercest of animals has to a dog who is the gentlest but he who 
 would not be found tripping ought to be very careful in this matter 
 of comparisons for they are most slippery things nevertheless let 
 us assume that the sophists are the men i say this 
 provisionally for i think that the line which divides them will be marked enough if proper care is taken 
 
 theaet likely enough 
 
 str let us grant then that from the discerning art comes 
 purification and from purification let there be separated off a 
 part which is concerned with the soul of this mental purification 
 instruction is a portion and of instruction education and of 
 education that refutation of vain conceit which has been discovered 
 in the present argument and let this be called by you and me the 
 art of sophistry 
 
 theaet very well and yet considering the number of 
 forms in which he has presented himself i begin to doubt how i can with any truth or confidence describe the real nature of the sophist 
 
 str you naturally feel perplexed and yet i think that he must be 
 still more perplexed in his attempt to escape us for as the proverb 
 says when every way is blocked there is no escape now 
 then is the time of all others to set upon him 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str first let us wait a moment and recover breath and 
 while we are resting we may reckon up in how many forms he has appeared in the first place he was discovered to be a paid hunter after wealth and youth 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str in the second place he was a merchant in the goods of the 
 soul 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str in the third place he has turned out to be a retailer of the 
 same sort of wares 
 
 theaet yes and in the fourth place he himself manufactured the 
 learned wares which he sold 
 
 str quite right i will try and remember the fifth myself he 
 belonged to the fighting class and was further distinguished as a 
 hero of debate who professed the eristic art 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str the sixth point was doubtful and yet we at last 
 agreed that he was a purger of souls who cleared away notions obstructive to knowledge 
 
 theaet very true 
 
 str do you not see that when the professor of any art has one 
 name and many kinds of knowledge there must be something wrong the multiplicity of names which is applied to him shows that the common principle to which all these branches of knowledge are 
 tending is not understood 
 
 theaet i should imagine this to be the case 
 
 str at any rate we will understand him and no indolence shall 
 prevent us let us begin again then and some of our 
 statements concerning the sophist there was one thing which 
 appeared to me especially characteristic of him 
 
 theaet to what are you referring 
 
 str we were saying of him if i am not mistaken that he was a 
 disputer 
 
 theaet we were 
 
 str and does he not also teach others the art of disputation 
 
 theaet certainly he does 
 
 str and about what does he profess that he teaches men to 
 dispute to begin at the he make them able to dispute about divine things which are invisible to men in general 
 
 theaet at any rate he is said to do so 
 
 str and what do you say of the visible things in heaven and 
 earth and the like 
 
 theaet certainly he disputes and teaches to dispute about them 
 
 str then again in private conversation when any universal 
 assertion is made about generation and essence we know that such 
 persons are tremendous argufiers and are able to impart their own 
 skill to others 
 
 theaet undoubtedly 
 
 str and do they not profess to make men able to dispute about law 
 and about politics in general 
 
 theaet why no one would have anything to say to them if they 
 did not make these professions 
 
 str in all and every art what the craftsman ought to say 
 in answer to any question is written down in a popular form and he who likes may learn 
 
 theaet i suppose that you are referring to the precepts of 
 protagoras about wrestling and the other arts 
 
 str yes my friend and about a good many other things in a 
 word is not the art of disputation a power of disputing about all 
 things 
 
 theaet certainly there does not seem to be much which is 
 left out 
 
 str but oh my dear youth do you suppose this possible for 
 perhaps your young eyes may see things which to our duller sight do 
 not appear 
 
 theaet to what are you alluding i do not think that i understand 
 your present question 
 
 str i ask whether anybody can understand all things 
 
 theaet happy would mankind be if such a thing were possible 
 
 soc but how can any one who is ignorant dispute in a rational 
 manner against him who knows 
 
 theaet he cannot 
 
 str then why has the sophistical art such a mysterious power 
 
 theaet to what do you refer 
 
 str how do the sophists make young men believe in their 
 supreme and universal wisdom for if they neither disputed nor were thought to dispute rightly or being thought to do so were deemed no wiser for their controversial skill then to quote your own 
 observation no one would give them money or be willing to learn their art 
 
 theaet they certainly would not 
 
 str but they are willing 
 
 theaet yes they are 
 
 str yes and the reason as i should imagine is that they are 
 supposed to have knowledge of those things about which they dispute 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str and they dispute about all things 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str and therefore to their disciples they appear to be 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str but they are not for that was shown to be impossible 
 
 theaet impossible of course 
 
 str then the sophist has been shown to have a sort of conjectural 
 or apparent knowledge only of all things which is not the truth 
 
 theaet exactly no better description of him could be given 
 
 str let us now take an illustration which will still more 
 clearly explain his nature 
 
 theaet what is it 
 
 str i will tell you and you shall answer me giving your very 
 closest attention suppose that a person were to profess not that 
 he could speak or dispute but that he knew how to make and do all 
 things by a single art 
 
 theaet all things 
 
 str i see that you do not understand the first word that i utter 
 for you do not understand the meaning of all 
 
 theaet no i do not 
 
 str under all things i include you and me and also animals and 
 trees 
 
 theaet what do you mean 
 
 str suppose a person to say that he will make you and me and all 
 creatures 
 
 theaet what would he mean by making he cannot be a 
 you said that he is a maker of animals 
 
 str yes and i say that he is also the maker of the sea and the 
 earth and the heavens and the gods and of all other things and 
 further that he can make them in no time and sell them for a few 
 pence 
 
 theaet that must be a jest 
 
 str and when a man says that he knows all things and can teach 
 them to another at a small cost and in a short time is not that a 
 jest 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str and is there any more artistic or graceful form of jest than 
 imitation 
 
 theaet certainly not and imitation is a very comprehensive term 
 which includes under one class the most diverse sorts of things 
 
 str we know of course that he who professes by one art to make 
 all things is really a painter and by the art makes 
 resemblances of real things which have the same name with 
 them and he can deceive the less intelligent sort of young children to whom he shows his pictures at a distance into the belief that he has the absolute power of making whatever he likes 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str and may there not be supposed to be an imitative art of 
 reasoning is it not possible to enchant the hearts of young men by 
 words poured through their ears when they are still at a distance 
 from the truth of facts by exhibiting to them fictitious arguments 
 and making them think that they are true and that the speaker is 
 the wisest of men in all things 
 
 theaet yes why should there not be another such art 
 
 str but as time goes on and their hearers advance in years and 
 come into closer contact with realities and have learnt by sad 
 experience to see and feel the truth of things are not the greater 
 part of them compelled to change many opinions which they formerly 
 entertained so that the great appears small to them and the easy 
 difficult and all their dreamy speculations are overturned by the 
 facts of life 
 
 theaet that is my view as far as i can judge although 
 at my age i may be one of those who see things at a distance only 
 
 str and the wish of all of us who are your friends is and 
 always will be to bring you as near to the truth as we can 
 without the sad reality and now i should like you to tell me whether 
 the sophist is not visibly a magician and imitator of true being or are we still disposed to think that he may have a true knowledge of the 
 various matters about which he disputes 
 
 theaet but how can he stranger is there any doubt 
 after what has been said that he is to be located in one of the divisions of play 
 
 str then we must place him in the class of magicians and mimics 
 
 theaet certainly we must 
 
 str and now our business is not to let the animal out for we 
 have got him in a sort of dialectical net and there is one thing 
 which he decidedly will not escape 
 
 theaet what is that 
 
 str the inference that he is a juggler 
 
 theaet precisely my own opinion of him 
 
 str then clearly we ought as soon as possible to divide the 
 art and go down into the net and if the sophist does 
 not run away from us to seize him according to orders and 
 deliver him over to reason who is the lord of the hunt and proclaim the capture of him and if he creeps into the recesses of the imitative 
 art and secretes himself in one of them to divide again and follow 
 him up until in some of imitation he is caught for our 
 method of tackling each and all is one which neither he nor any 
 other creature will ever escape in triumph 
 
 theaet well said and let us do as you propose 
 
 str well then pursuing the same analytic method as before i 
 think that i can discern two divisions of the imitative art but i 
 am not as yet able to see in which of them the desired form is to be 
 found 
 
 theaet will you tell me first what are two divisions of which you 
 are speaking 
 
 str one is the art of a likeness of 
 anything is made by producing a copy which is executed according to the proportions of the original similar in length and breadth and 
 depth each thing receiving also its appropriate colour 
 
 theaet is not this always the aim of imitation 
 
 str not always in works either of sculpture or of painting 
 which are of any magnitude there is a certain degree of deception 
 for artists were to give the true proportions of their fair works 
 the upper part which is farther off would appear to be out of 
 proportion in comparison with the lower which is nearer and so 
 they give up the truth in their images and make only the proportions 
 which appear to be beautiful disregarding the real ones 
 
 theaet quite true 
 
 str and that which being other is also like may we not 
 fairly call a likeness or image 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str and may we not as i did just now call that part of the 
 imitative art which is concerned with making such images the art of 
 likeness making 
 
 theaet let that be the name 
 
 str and what shall we call those resemblances of the beautiful 
 which appear such owing to the unfavourable position of the 
 spectator whereas if a person had the power of getting a correct view of works of such magnitude they would appear not even like that to which they profess to be like may we not call these appearances since they appear only and are not really like 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str there is a great deal of this kind of thing in 
 painting and in all imitation 
 
 theaet of course 
 
 str and may we not fairly call the sort of art which produces an 
 appearance and not an image phantastic art 
 
 theaet most fairly 
 
 str these then are the two kinds of image art of 
 making likenesses and phantastic or the art of making appearances 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str i was doubtful before in which of them i should place the 
 sophist nor am i even now able to see clearly verily he is a 
 wonderful and inscrutable creature and now in the cleverest 
 manner he has got into an impossible place 
 
 theaet yes he has 
 
 str do you speak advisedly or are you carried away at the moment 
 by the habit of assenting into giving a hasty answer 
 
 theaet may i ask to what you are referring 
 
 str my dear friend we are engaged in a very difficult 
 can be no doubt of that for how a thing can 
 appear and seem and not be or how a man can say a thing 
 which is not true has always been and still remains a very perplexing question can any one say or think that falsehood really exists and 
 avoid being caught in a contradiction indeed theaetetus the task is a difficult one 
 
 theaet why 
 
 str he who says that falsehood exists has the audacity to assert 
 the being of for this is implied in the possibility of 
 falsehood but my boy in the days when i was a boy the great 
 parmenides protested against this doctrine and to the end 
 of his life he continued to inculcate the same repeating both in verse and out of your mind from this way of enquiry for never will you show that is 
 such is his testimony which is confirmed by the very expression 
 when sifted a little would you object to begin with the 
 consideration of the words themselves 
 
 theaet never mind about me i am only desirous that you should 
 carry on the argument in the best way and that you should take me 
 with you 
 
 str very good and now say do we venture to utter the forbidden 
 word 
 
 theaet certainly we do 
 
 str let us be serious then and consider the question neither in 
 strife nor play suppose that one of the hearers of parmenides was 
 asked to is the term to be you know what 
 sort of object he would single out in reply and what answer he 
 would make to the enquirer 
 
 theaet that is a difficult question and one not to be answered 
 at all by a person like myself 
 
 str there is at any rate no difficulty in seeing that the 
 predicate is not applicable to any being 
 
 theaet none certainly 
 
 str and if not to being then not to something 
 
 theaet of course not 
 
 str it is also plain that in speaking of something we speak of 
 being for to speak of an abstract something naked and isolated from 
 all being is impossible 
 
 theaet impossible 
 
 str you mean by assenting to imply that he who says something 
 must say some one thing 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str some in the singular ti you would say is the sign of one 
 some in the dual tine of two some in the plural tines of many 
 
 theaet exactly 
 
 str then he who says not something must say absolutely nothing 
 theaet most assuredly 
 
 str and as we cannot admit that a man speaks and says nothing he 
 who says does not speak at all 
 
 theaet the difficulty of the argument can no further go 
 
 str not yet my friend is the time for such a word for there 
 still remains of all perplexities the first and greatest 
 touching the very foundation of the matter 
 
 theaet what do you mean do not be afraid to speak 
 
 str to that which is may be attributed some other thing which is 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str but can anything which is be attributed to that which is not 
 
 theaet impossible 
 
 str and all number is to be reckoned among things which are 
 
 theaet yes surely number if anything has a real existence 
 
 str then we must not attempt to attribute to number 
 either in the singular or plural 
 
 theaet the argument implies that we should be wrong in doing so 
 
 str but how can a man either express in words or even conceive in 
 thought things which are not or a thing which is not without number 
 
 theaet how indeed 
 
 str when we speak of things which are not attributing plurality 
 to 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str but on the other hand when we say what is not do we not 
 attribute unity 
 
 theaet manifestly 
 
 str nevertheless we maintain that you may not and ought not to 
 attribute being to 
 
 theaet most true 
 
 str do you see then that in itself can neither be 
 spoken uttered or thought but that it is unthinkable 
 unutterable unspeakable indescribable 
 
 theaet quite true 
 
 str but if so i was wrong in telling you just now that the 
 difficulty which was coming is the greatest of all 
 
 theaet what is there a greater still behind 
 
 str well i am surprised after what has been said already that 
 you do not see the difficulty in which he who would refute the 
 notion of is involved for he is compelled to contradict 
 himself as soon as he makes the attempt 
 
 theaet what do you mean speak more clearly 
 
 str do not expect clearness from me for i who maintain that 
 has no part either in the one or many just now 
 spoke and am still speaking of as one for i say do you understand 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str and a little while ago i said that is unutterable 
 unspeakable indescribable do you follow 
 
 theaet i do after a fashion 
 
 str when i introduced the word is did i not contradict what i 
 said before 
 
 theaet clearly 
 
 str and in using the singular verb did i not speak of 
 as one 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str and when i spoke of as indescribable and 
 unspeakable and unutterable in using each of these words in the 
 singular did i not refer to as one 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str and yet we say that strictly speaking it should not be 
 defined as one or many and should not even be called it for the 
 use of the word it would imply a form of unity 
 
 theaet quite true 
 
 str how then can any one put any faith in me for now 
 as always i am unequal to the refutation of and therefore as i was saying do not look to me for the right way of speaking about but come let us try the experiment with you 
 
 theaet what do you mean 
 
 str make a noble effort as becomes youth and endeavour with all 
 your might to speak of in a right manner without 
 introducing into it either existence or unity or plurality 
 
 theaet it would be a strange boldness in me which would 
 attempt the task when i see you thus discomfited 
 
 str say no more of ourselves but until we find some one or other 
 who can speak of without number we must acknowledge that the sophist is a clever rogue who will not be got out of his hole 
 
 theaet most true 
 
 str and if we say to him that he professes an art of making 
 appearances he will grapple with us and retort our argument upon 
 ourselves and when we call him an he will say 
 pray what do you mean at all by an image and i should like to know theaetetus how we can possibly answer the question 
 
 theaet we shall doubtless tell him of the images which are 
 reflected in water or in mirrors also of sculptures pictures and 
 other duplicates 
 
 str i see theaetetus that you have never made the 
 acquaintance of the sophist 
 
 theaet why do you think so 
 
 str he will make believe to have his eyes shut or to have none 
 
 theaet what do you mean 
 
 str when you tell him of something existing in a mirror or in 
 sculpture and address him as though he had eyes he will 
 laugh you to scorn and will pretend that he knows nothing of mirrors and streams or of sight at all he will say that he is asking about an 
 idea 
 
 theaet what can he mean 
 
 str the common notion pervading all these objects which you 
 speak of as many and yet call by the single name of image as 
 though it were the unity under which they were all included how 
 will you maintain your ground against him 
 
 theaet how stranger can i describe an image except as something 
 fashioned in the likeness of the true 
 
 str and do you mean this something to be some other true thing 
 or what do you mean 
 
 theaet certainly not another true thing but only a resemblance 
 
 str and you mean by true that which really is 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str and the not true is that which is the opposite of the true 
 
 theaet exactly 
 
 str a resemblance then is not really real if as you say not 
 true 
 
 theaet nay but it is in a certain sense 
 
 str you mean to say not in a true sense 
 
 theaet yes it is in reality only an image 
 
 str then what we call an image is in reality really unreal 
 
 theaet in what a strange complication of being and 
 we are involved 
 
 str strange i should think so see how by his reciprocation of 
 opposites the sophist has compelled us quite 
 against our will to admit the existence of 
 
 theaet yes indeed i see 
 
 str the difficulty is how to define his art without falling into 
 a contradiction 
 
 theaet how do you mean and where does the danger lie 
 
 str when we say that he deceives us with an illusion and that 
 his art is illusory do we mean that our soul is led by his art to 
 think falsely or what do we mean 
 
 theaet there is nothing else to be said 
 
 str again false opinion is that form of opinion which thinks the 
 opposite of the would assent 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str you mean to say that false opinion thinks what is not 
 
 theaet of course 
 
 str does false opinion think that things which are not are not 
 or that in a certain sense they are 
 
 theaet things that are not must be imagined to exist in a certain 
 sense if any degree of falsehood is to be possible 
 
 str and does not false opinion also think that things which most 
 certainly exist do not exist at all 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str and here again is falsehood 
 
 theaet 
 
 str and in like manner a false proposition will be deemed to be 
 one which are the nonexistence of things which are and the 
 existence of things which are not 
 
 theaet there is no other way in which a false proposition can 
 arise 
 
 str there is not but the sophist will deny these statements and 
 indeed how can any rational man assent to them when the very 
 expressions which we have just used were before acknowledged by us to be unutterable unspeakable indescribable unthinkable 
 do you see his point theaetetus 
 
 theaet of course he will say that we are contradicting ourselves 
 when we hazard the assertion that falsehood exists in opinion and 
 in words for in maintaining this we are compelled over and over 
 again to assert being of which we admitted just now to be 
 an utter impossibility 
 
 str how well you remember and now it is high time to hold a 
 consultation as to what we ought to do about the sophist for if we 
 persist in looking for him in the class of false workers and 
 magicians you see that the handles for objection and the 
 difficulties which will arise are very numerous and obvious 
 
 theaet they are indeed 
 
 str we have gone through but a very small portion of 
 them and they are really infinite 
 
 theaet if that is the case we cannot possibly catch the sophist 
 
 str shall we then be so as to give him up 
 
 theaet certainly not i should say if we can get the slightest 
 hold upon him 
 
 str will you then forgive me and as your words imply not be 
 altogether displeased if i flinch a little from the grasp of such a 
 sturdy argument 
 
 theaet to be sure i will 
 
 str i have a yet more urgent request to make 
 
 theaet which is 
 
 str that you will promise not to regard me as a parricide 
 
 theaet and why 
 
 str because in i must test the philosophy of my 
 father parmenides and try to prove by main force that in a certain 
 sense is and that being on the other hand is not 
 
 theaet some attempt of the kind is clearly needed 
 
 str yes a blind man as they say might see that and unless 
 these questions are decided in one way or another no one when he 
 speaks false words or false opinion or idols or images or 
 imitations or appearances or about the arts which are concerned 
 with them can avoid falling into ridiculous contradictions 
 
 theaet most true 
 
 str and therefore i must venture to lay hands on my 
 argument for if i am to be i shall have to give 
 the matter up 
 
 theaet nothing in the world should ever induce us to do so 
 
 str i have a third little request which i wish to make 
 
 theaet what is it 
 
 str you heard have always felt and still 
 i have no heart for this argument 
 
 theaet i did 
 
 str i tremble at the thought of what i have said and expect that 
 you will deem me mad when you hear of my sudden changes and 
 shiftings let me therefore observe that i am examining the 
 question entirely out of regard for you 
 
 theaet there is no reason for you to fear that i shall impute any 
 impropriety to you if you attempt this refutation and proof take 
 heart therefore and proceed 
 
 str and where shall i begin the perilous enterprise i think that 
 the road which i must take is 
 
 theaet me hear 
 
 str i think that we had better first of all consider the points 
 which at present are regard as lest we may have fallen 
 into some confusion and be too ready to assent to one another 
 fancying that we are quite clear about them 
 theaet say more distinctly what you mean 
 
 str i think that parmenides and all ever yet undertook to 
 determine the number and nature of existences talked to us in 
 rather a light and easy strain 
 
 theaet how 
 
 str as if we had been children to whom they repeated each his 
 own mythus or said that there were three principles and 
 that at one time there was war between certain of them and 
 then again there was peace and they were married and begat children 
 and brought them up and another spoke of two moist and a dry or a hot and a cold and made them marry and cohabit the eleatics however in our part of the world say that things are many in name but in nature one this is their mythus which goes back to xenophanes and is even older then there are ionian and in more 
 recent times sicilian muses who have arrived at the conclusion that 
 to unite the two principles is safer and to say that being is one and 
 many and that these are held together by enmity and friendship 
 ever parting ever meeting as muses assert while the 
 gentler ones do not insist on the perpetual strife and peace but 
 admit a relaxation and alternation of them peace and unity sometimes prevailing under the sway of aphrodite and then again plurality and war by reason of a principle of strife whether any of them spoke the truth in all this is hard to determine besides antiquity and famous men should have reverence and not be liable to accusations so serious yet one thing may be said of them without offence 
 
 theaet what thing 
 
 str that they went on their several ways disdaining to notice 
 people like ourselves they did not care whether they took us with 
 them or left us behind them 
 
 theaet how do you mean 
 
 str i mean to say that when they talk of one two or more 
 elements which are or have become or are becoming or again of heat 
 mingling with cold assuming in some other part of their works 
 separations and me theaetetus do you understand 
 what they mean by these expressions when i was a younger man i 
 used to fancy that i understood quite well what was meant by the 
 term which is our present subject of dispute 
 and now you see in what a fix we are about it 
 
 theaet i see 
 
 str and very likely we have been getting into the same perplexity 
 about being and yet may fancy that when anybody utters 
 the word we understand him quite easily although we do not know about but we may be equally ignorant of both 
 
 theaet i dare say 
 
 str and the same may be said of all the terms just mentioned 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str the consideration of most of them may be deferred but we had 
 better now discuss the chief captain and leader of them 
 
 theaet of what are you speaking you clearly think that we must 
 first investigate what people mean by the word being 
 
 str you follow close at heels theaetetus for the right method 
 i conceive will be to call into our presence the dualistic 
 philosophers and to interrogate them come we will say ye who 
 affirm that hot and cold or any other two principles are the 
 universe 
 what is this term which you apply to both of them and what do you 
 mean when you say that both and each of them are how are we to 
 understand the word are upon your view are we to suppose that 
 there is a third principle over and above the other in 
 all and not two for clearly you cannot say that one of the two 
 principles is being and yet attribute being equally to both of 
 them for if you did whichever of the two is identified with 
 being will comprehend the other and so they will be one and not 
 two 
 
 theaet very true

 book 
 str but perhaps you mean to give the name of being to both of 
 them together 
 
 theaet quite likely 
 
 str then friends we shall reply to them the answer 
 is plainly that the two will still be resolved into one 
 
 theaet most true 
 
 str since then we are in a difficulty please to tell 
 us what you mean when you speak of being for there can be no doubt that you always from the first understood your own meaning whereas we once thought that we understood you but now we are in a great strait please to begin by explaining this matter to us and let us no longer fancy that we understand you when we entirely misunderstand you there will be no impropriety in our demanding an answer to this question either of the dualists or of the pluralists 
 
 theaet certainly not 
 
 str and what about the assertors of the oneness of the 
 we not endeavour to ascertain from them what they mean by being 
 
 theaet by all means 
 
 str then let them answer this question one you say alone is 
 yes they will reply 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str and there is something which you call being 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str and is being the same as one and do you apply two 
 names to the same thing 
 
 theaet what will be their answer stranger 
 
 str it is clear theaetetus that he who asserts the 
 unity of being will find a difficulty in answering this or any other question 
 
 theaet why so 
 
 str to admit of two names and to affirm that there is nothing 
 but unity is surely ridiculous 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str and equally irrational to admit that a name is anything 
 
 theaet how so 
 
 str to distinguish the name from the thing implies duality 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str and yet he who identifies the name with the thing will be 
 compelled to say that it is the name of nothing or if he 
 says that it is the name of something even then the name will only be the name of a name and of nothing else 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str and the one will turn out to be only one of one and being 
 absolute unity will represent a mere name 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str and would they say that the whole is other than the one that 
 is or the same with it 
 
 theaet to be sure they would and they actually say so 
 
 str if being is a whole as parmenides sings 
 every way like unto the fullness of a sphere 
 evenly balanced from the centre on every side 
 and must needs be neither greater nor less in any way 
 neither on this side nor on that 
 then being has a centre and extremes and having these must also 
 have parts 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str yet that which has parts may have the attribute of 
 unity in all the parts and in this way being all and a whole may be one 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str but that of which this is the condition cannot be absolute 
 unity 
 
 theaet why not 
 
 str because according to right reason that which is truly one 
 must be affirmed to be absolutely indivisible 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str but this indivisible if made up of many parts will 
 contradict reason 
 
 theaet i understand 
 
 str shall we say that being is one and a whole because it has 
 the attribute of unity or shall we say that being is not a whole at 
 all 
 
 theaet that is a hard alternative to offer 
 
 str most true for being having in a certain sense the attribute 
 of one is yet proved not to be the same as one and the all is 
 therefore more than one 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str and yet if being be not a whole through having the attribute 
 of unity and there be such a thing as an absolute whole being 
 lacks something of its own nature 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str upon this view again being having a defect of being will 
 become 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str and again the all becomes more than one for being and the 
 whole will each have their separate nature 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str but if the whole does not exist at all all the previous 
 difficulties remain the same and there will be the further 
 difficulty that besides having no being being can never have come 
 into being 
 
 theaet why so 
 
 str because that which comes into being always comes into being 
 as a whole so that he who does not give whole a place among beings cannot speak either of essence or generation as existing 
 
 theaet yes that certainly appears to be true 
 
 str again how can that which is not a whole have any 
 quantity for that which is of a certain quantity must necessarily be the whole of that quantity 
 
 theaet exactly 
 
 str and there will be innumerable other points each of them 
 causing infinite trouble to him who says that being is either one 
 or two 
 
 theaet the difficulties which are dawning upon us prove this for 
 one objection connects with another and they are always involving 
 what has preceded in a greater and worse perplexity 
 
 str we are far from having exhausted the more exact thinkers who 
 treat of being and but let us be content to leave 
 them and proceed to view those who speak less precisely and we shall find as the result of all that the nature of being is quite as difficult to comprehend as that of 
 
 theaet then now we will go to the others 
 
 str there appears to be a sort of war of giants and gods going on 
 amongst them they are fighting with one another about the nature of 
 essence 
 
 theaet how is that 
 
 str some of them are dragging down all things from heaven and 
 from the unseen to earth and they literally grasp in their hands 
 rocks and oaks of these they lay hold and obstinately 
 maintain that the things only which can be touched or handled have being or essence because they define being and body as one and if any one else says that what is not a body exists they altogether despise him and will hear of nothing but body 
 
 theaet i have often met with such men and terrible fellows they 
 are 
 
 str and that is the reason why their opponents cautiously defend 
 themselves from above out of an unseen world mightily contending 
 that true essence consists of certain intelligible and incorporeal 
 ideas the bodies of the materialists which by them are 
 maintained to be the very truth they break up into little bits by their 
 arguments and affirm them to be not essence but generation and 
 motion between the two armies theaetetus there is always 
 an endless conflict raging concerning these matters 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str let us ask each party in turn to give an account of 
 that which they call essence 
 
 theaet how shall we get it out of them 
 
 str with those who make being to consist in ideas there will be 
 less difficulty for they are civil people enough but there will be 
 very great difficulty or rather an absolute impossibility 
 in getting an opinion out of those who drag everything down to matter shall i tell you what we must do 
 
 theaet what 
 
 str let us if we can really improve them but if this is not 
 possible let us imagine them to be better than they are and more 
 willing to answer in accordance with the rules of argument and then 
 their opinion will be more worth having for that which better men 
 acknowledge has more weight than that which is acknowledged by 
 inferior men moreover we are no respecters of persons but seekers 
 after time 
 
 theaet very good 
 
 str then now on the supposition that they are improved 
 let us ask them to state their views and do you interpret them 
 
 theaet agreed 
 
 str let them say whether they would admit that there is such a 
 thing as a mortal animal 
 
 theaet of course they would 
 
 str and do they not acknowledge this to be a body having a soul 
 
 theaet certainly they do 
 
 str meaning to say the soul is something which exists 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str and do they not say that one soul is just and another 
 unjust and that one soul is wise and another foolish 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str and that the just and wise soul becomes just and wise by the 
 possession of justice and wisdom and the opposite under opposite 
 circumstances 
 
 theaet yes they do 
 
 str but surely that which may be present or may be absent will be 
 admitted by them to exist 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str and allowing that justice wisdom the other virtues and 
 their opposites exist as well as a soul in which they inhere do they 
 affirm any of them to be visible and tangible or are they all 
 invisible 
 
 theaet they would say that hardly any of them are visible 
 
 str and would they say that they are corporeal 
 
 theaet they would distinguish the soul would be said by them to 
 have a body but as to the other qualities of justice 
 wisdom and the like about which you asked they would not venture either to deny their existence or to maintain that they were all corporeal 
 
 str verily theaetetus i perceive a great improvement in 
 them the real aborigines children of the teeth would have been deterred by no shame at all but would have obstinately asserted 
 that nothing is which they are not able to squeeze in their hands 
 
 theaet that is pretty much their notion 
 
 str let us push the question for if they will admit that 
 any even the smallest particle of being is incorporeal it is enough they must then say what that nature is which is common to both the 
 corporeal and incorporeal and which they have in their eye 
 when they say of both of them that they are perhaps they may be 
 in a difficulty and if this is the case there is a possibility 
 that they may accept a notion of ours respecting the nature of 
 being having nothing of their own to offer 
 
 theaet what is the notion tell me and we shall soon see 
 str my notion would be that anything which possesses any sort of 
 power to affect another or to be affected by another if only for a 
 single moment however trifling the cause and however slight the 
 effect has real existence and i hold that the definition 
 of being is simply power of theaet they accept your suggestion having nothing better of their own to offer 
 
 str very good perhaps we as well as they may one day change 
 our minds but for the present this may be regarded as the 
 understanding which is established with them 
 
 theaet agreed 
 
 str let us now go to the friends of ideas of their opinions 
 too you shall be the interpreter 
 
 theaet i will 
 
 str to them we would distinguish essence from generation 
 
 theaet yes they reply 
 
 str and you would allow that we participate in 
 generation with the body and through perception but we participate with the soul through in true essence and essence you would affirm to be always the same and immutable whereas generation or becoming varies 
 
 theaet yes that is what we should affirm 
 
 str well fair sirs we say to them what is this participation 
 which you assert of both do you agree with our recent definition 
 
 theaet what definition 
 
 str we said that being was an active or passive energy 
 arising out of a certain power which proceeds from elements meeting with one another perhaps your cars theaetetus may fail to catch their answer which i recognize because i have been accustomed to hear it 
 
 theaet and what is their answer 
 
 str they deny the truth of what we were just now saying to the 
 aborigines about existence 
 
 theaet what was that 
 
 str any power of doing or suffering in a degree however slight 
 was held by us to be a sufficient definition of being 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str they deny this and say that the power of doing or 
 suffering is confined to becoming and that neither power is applicable to being 
 
 theaet and is there not some truth in what they say 
 
 str yes but our reply will be that we want to ascertain from 
 them more distinctly whether they further admit that the soul 
 knows and that being or essence is known 
 
 theaet there can be no doubt that they say so 
 
 str and is knowing and being known doing or suffering 
 or both or is the one doing and the other suffering or has neither any share in either 
 
 theaet clearly neither has any share in either for if they say 
 anything else they will contradict themselves 
 
 str i understand but they will allow that if to know is active 
 then of course to be known is passive and on this view 
 being in so far as it is known is acted upon by knowledge and is therefore in motion for that which is in a state of rest cannot be acted upon as we affirm 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str and o heavens can we ever be made to believe that motion 
 and life and soul and mind are not present with perfect being can 
 we imagine that being is devoid of life and mind and 
 exists in awful unmeaningness an everlasting fixture 
 
 theaet that would be a dreadful thing to admit stranger 
 
 str but shall we say that has mind and not life 
 
 theaet how is that possible 
 
 str or shall we say that both inhere in perfect being but that 
 it has no soul which contains them 
 
 theaet and in what other way can it contain them 
 
 str or that being has mind and life and soul but although 
 endowed with soul remains absolutely unmoved 
 
 theaet all three suppositions appear to me to be irrational 
 
 str under being then we must include motion and that which is 
 moved 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str then theaetetus our inference is that if there is 
 no motion neither is there any mind anywhere or about anything or belonging to any one 
 
 theaet quite true 
 
 str and yet this equally follows if we grant that all things are 
 in this view too mind has no existence 
 
 theaet how so 
 
 str do you think that sameness of condition and mode and subject 
 could ever exist without a principle of rest 
 
 theaet certainly not 
 
 str can you see how without them mind could exist or come into 
 existence anywhere 
 
 theaet no 
 
 str and surely contend we must in every possible way against him 
 who would annihilate knowledge and reason and mind and yet ventures to speak confidently about anything 
 
 theaet yes with all our might 
 
 str then the philosopher who has the truest reverence for these 
 qualities cannot possibly accept the notion of those who 
 say that the whole is at rest either as unity or in many forms and he will be utterly deaf to those who assert universal motion as children say entreatingly give us both so he will include both the moveable 
 and immoveable in his definition of being and all 
 
 theaet most true 
 
 str and now do we seem to have gained a fair notion of being 
 
 theaet yes truly 
 
 str alas theaetetus methinks that we are now only beginning to 
 see the real difficulty of the enquiry into the nature of it 
 
 theaet what do you mean 
 
 str o my friend do you not see that nothing can exceed out 
 ignorance and yet we fancy that we are saying something good 
 
 theaet i certainly thought that we were and i do not at all 
 understand how we never found out our desperate case 
 
 str reflect after having made these admissions may we not be 
 justly asked the same questions which we ourselves were asking of 
 those who said that all was hot and cold 
 
 theaet what were they will you recall them to my mind 
 
 str to be sure i will remind you of them by putting the same 
 questions to you which i did to them and then we shall get on 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str would you not say that rest and motion are in the most entire 
 opposition to one another 
 
 theaet of course 
 
 str and yet you would say that both and either of them 
 equally are 
 
 theaet i should 
 
 str and when you admit that both or either of them are 
 do you mean to say that both or either of them are in motion 
 
 theaet certainly not 
 
 str or do you wish to imply that they are both at rest when you 
 say that they are 
 
 theaet of course not 
 
 str then you conceive of being as some third and distinct nature 
 under which rest and motion are alike included and observing that 
 they both participate in being you declare that they are 
 
 theaet truly we seem to have an intimation that being is 
 some third thing when we say that rest and motion are 
 
 str then being is not the combination of rest and motion but 
 something different from them 
 
 theaet so it would appear 
 
 str being then according to its own nature is neither in 
 motion nor at rest 
 
 theaet that is very much the truth 
 
 str where then is a man to look for help who would have 
 any clear or fixed notion of being in his mind 
 
 theaet where indeed 
 
 str i scarcely think that he can look anywhere for that which is 
 not in motion must be at rest and again that which is not at rest 
 must be in motion but being is placed outside of both these 
 classes is this possible 
 
 theaet utterly impossible 
 
 str here then is another thing which we ought to bear in mind 
 
 theaet what 
 
 str when we were asked to what we were to assign the 
 appellation of we were in the greatest you remember 
 
 theaet to be sure 
 
 str and are we not now in as a difficulty about being 
 
 theaes i should say stranger that we are in one which is if 
 possible even greater 
 
 str then let us acknowledge the difficulty and as being and 
 are involved in the same perplexity there is hope 
 that when the one appears more or less distinctly the other will equally appear and if we are able to see neither there may still be a 
 chance of steering our way in between them without any great 
 discredit 
 theaet very good 
 
 str let us enquire then how we come to predicate many names of 
 the same thing 
 
 theaet give an example 
 
 str i mean that we speak of man for example under many 
 we attribute to him colours and forms and magnitudes and virtues and vices in all of which instances and in ten thousand others we not only speak of him as a man but also as good and having other attributes and in the same way anything else which we originally supposed to be one is described by us as many and under many names 
 
 theaet that is true 
 
 str and thus we provide a rich feast for tyros whether young or 
 old for there is nothing easier than to argue that the one cannot 
 be many or the many one and great is their delight in 
 denying that a man is good for man they insist is man and good is good i dare say that you have met with persons who interest in such are often elderly men whose meagre sense is thrown into amazement by these discoveries of theirs which they believe to be the height of wisdom 
 
 theaet certainly i have 
 
 str then not to exclude any one who has ever speculated at all 
 upon the nature of being let us put our questions to them as well 
 as to our former friends 
 
 theaet what questions 
 
 str shall we refuse to attribute being to motion and rest or 
 anything to anything and assume that they do not mingle and are 
 incapable of participating in one another or shall we 
 gather all into one class of things communicable with one another or are some things communicable and others of these alternatives 
 
 theaetetus will they prefer 
 
 theaet i have nothing to answer on their behalf suppose that you 
 take all these hypotheses in turn and see what are the consequences 
 which follow from each of them 
 
 str very good and first let us assume them to say that nothing 
 is capable of participating in anything else in any respect in that 
 case rest and motion cannot participate in being at all 
 
 theaet they cannot 
 
 str but would either of them be if not participating in being 
 
 theaet no 
 
 str then by this admission everything is instantly overturned as 
 well the doctrine of universal motion as of universal rest and also 
 the doctrine of those who distribute being into immutable and 
 everlasting kinds for all these add on a notion of being some 
 affirming that things are truly in motion and others that they 
 are truly at rest 
 
 theaes just so 
 
 str again those who would at one time compound and at another 
 resolve all things whether making them into one and out of one 
 creating infinity or dividing them into finite clements and 
 forming compounds out of these whether they suppose the processes of creation to be successive or continuous would be talking nonsense in all this if there were no admixture 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str most ridiculous of all will the men themselves be who want to 
 carry out the argument and yet forbid us to call anything because 
 participating in some affection from another by the name of that 
 other 
 
 theaet why so 
 
 str why because they are compelled to use the words to be 
 apart from others in itself and ten thousand more which 
 they cannot give up but must make the connecting links of 
 discourse and therefore they do not require to be refuted by 
 others but their enemy as the saying is inhabits the same house 
 with them they are always carrying about with them an 
 adversary like the wonderful ventriloquist eurycles who out of their own bellies audibly contradicts them 
 
 theaet precisely so a very true and exact illustration 
 
 str and now if we suppose that all things have the power of 
 communion with one another what will follow 
 
 theaet even i can solve that riddle 
 
 str how 
 
 theaet why because motion itself would be at rest and rest 
 again in motion if they could be attributed to one another 
 
 str but this is utterly impossible 
 
 theaet of course 
 
 str then only the third hypothesis remains 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str for surely either all things have communion with all or 
 nothing with any other thing or some things communicate with some 
 things and others not 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str and two out of these three suppositions have been found to be 
 impossible 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str every one then who desires to answer truly will adopt the 
 third and remaining hypothesis of the communion of some with some 
 
 theaet quite true 
 
 str this communion of some with some may be illustrated 
 by the caseof letters for some letters do not fit each other while others do 
 
 theaet of course 
 
 str and the vowels especially are a sort of bond which pervades 
 all the other letters so that without a vowel one consonant 
 cannot be joined to another 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str but does every one know what letters will unite with what or 
 is art required in order to do so 
 
 theaet what is required 
 
 str what art 
 
 theaet the art of grammar 
 
 str and is not this also true of sounds high and 
 not he who has the art to know what sounds mingle a musician and he who is ignorant not a musician 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str and we shall find this to be generally true of art or the 
 absence of art 
 
 theaet of course 
 
 str and as classes are admitted by us in like manner to be some 
 of them capable and others incapable of intermixture must not he 
 who would rightly show what kinds will unite and what will not 
 proceed by the help of science in the path of argument and will he 
 not ask if the connecting links are universal and so capable of 
 intermixture with all things and again in divisions whether there 
 are not other universal classes which make them possible 
 
 theaet to be sure he will require science and if i am not 
 mistaken the very greatest of all sciences 
 
 str how are we to call it by zeus have we not lighted 
 unwittingly upon our free and noble science and in looking for the sophist have we not entertained the philosopher unawares 
 
 theaet what do you mean 
 
 str should we not say that the division according to 
 classes which neither makes the same other nor makes other the same is the business of the dialectical science 
 
 theaet that is what we should say 
 
 str then surely he who can divide rightly is able to see 
 clearly one form pervading a scattered multitude and many different 
 forms contained under one higher form and again one form knit 
 together into a single whole and pervading many such wholes and 
 many forms existing only in separation and isolation this is the 
 knowledge of classes which determines where they can have communion with one another and where not 
 
 theaet quite true 
 
 str and the art of dialectic would be attributed by you 
 only to the philosopher pure and true 
 
 theaet who but he can be worthy 
 
 str in this region we shall always discover the philosopher if 
 we look for him like the sophist he is not easily discovered but 
 for a different reason 
 
 theaet for what reason 
 
 str because the sophist runs away into the darkness of 
 in which he has learned by habit to feel about and cannot be 
 discovered because of the darkness of the place is not that true 
 
 theaet it seems to be so 
 
 str and the philosopher always holding converse through reason 
 with the idea of being is also dark from excess of light for the 
 souls of the many have no eye which can endure the vision of the 
 divine 
 
 theaet yes that seems to be quite as true as the other 
 
 str well the philosopher may hereafter be more fully 
 considered by us if we are disposed but the sophist must clearly not be allowed to escape until we have had a good look at him 
 
 theaet very good 
 
 str since then we are agreed that some classes have a communion 
 with one another and others not and some have communion with a few and others with many and that there is no reason why some should not have universal communion with all let us now pursue the 
 enquiry as the argument suggests not in relation to all ideas 
 lest the multitude of them should confuse us but let us select a 
 few of those which are reckoned to be the principal ones 
 and consider their several natures and their capacity of communion with one another in order that if we are not able to apprehend with perfect clearness the notions of being and we may at 
 least not fall short in the consideration of them so far as they come within the scope of the present enquiry if peradventure we may be allowed to assert the reality of and yet escape unscathed 
 
 theaet we must do so 
 
 str the most important of all the genera are those which we were 
 just now and rest and motion 
 
 theaet yes by far 
 
 str and two of these are as we affirm incapable of 
 communion with one another 
 
 theaet quite incapable 
 
 str whereas being surely has communion with both of them for 
 both of them are 
 
 theaet of course 
 
 str that makes up three of them 
 
 theaet to be sure 
 
 str and each of them is other than the remaining two but the 
 same with itself 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str but then what is the meaning of these two words same and 
 other are they two new kinds other than the three and yet always 
 of necessity intermingling with them and are we to have five kinds 
 instead of three or when we speak of the same and other are we 
 unconsciously speaking of one of the three first kinds 
 
 theaet very likely we are 
 
 str but surely motion and rest are neither the other nor the 
 same 
 
 theaet how is that 
 
 str whatever we attribute to motion and rest in common cannot be 
 either of them 
 
 theaet why not 
 
 str because motion would be at rest and rest in motion for 
 either of them being predicated of both will compel the other to 
 change into the opposite of its own nature because partaking of its 
 opposite 
 
 theaet quite true 
 
 str yet they surely both partake of the same and of the other 
 theaet yes 
 
 str then we must not assert that motion any more than rest is 
 either the same or the other 
 
 theaet no we must not 
 
 str but are we to conceive that being and the same are identical 
 
 theaet possibly 
 
 str but if they are identical then again in saying that 
 motion and rest have being we should also be saying that they are the same 
 
 theaet which surely cannot be 
 
 str then being and same cannot be one 
 
 theaet scarcely 
 
 str then we may suppose the same to be a fourth class 
 which is now to be added to the three others 
 
 theaet quite true 
 
 str and shall we call the other a fifth class or should we 
 consider being and other to be two names of the same class 
 
 theaet very likely 
 
 str but you would agree if i am not mistaken that existences 
 are relative as well as absolute 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str and the other is always relative to other 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str but this would not be the case unless being and the other 
 entirely differed for if the other like being were absolute as 
 well as relative then there would have been a kind of other 
 which was not other than other and now we find that what is other must of necessity be what it is in relation to some other 
 
 theaet that is the true state of the case 
 
 str then we must admit the other as the fifth of our selected 
 classes 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str and the fifth class pervades all classes for they all differ 
 from one another not by reason of their own nature but because 
 they partake of the idea of the other 
 
 theaet quite true 
 
 str then let us now put the case with reference to each of the 
 five 
 
 theaet how 
 
 str first there is motion which we affirm to be 
 absolutely rest what else can we say 
 
 theaet it is so 
 
 str and therefore is not rest 
 
 theaet certainly not 
 
 str and yet is because partaking of being 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str again motion is other than the same 
 
 theaet just so 
 
 str and is therefore not the same 
 
 theaet it is not 
 
 str yet surely motion is the same because all things partake 
 of the same 
 
 theaet very true 
 
 str then we must admit and not object to say that motion is the 
 same and is not the same for we do not apply the terms same and 
 not the same in the same sense but we call it the same in 
 relation to itself because partaking of the same and not the same 
 because having communion with the other it is thereby severed from 
 the same and has become not that but other and is therefore 
 rightly spoken of as not the same 
 
 theaet to be sure 
 
 str and if absolute motion in any point of view partook of rest 
 there would be no absurdity in calling motion stationary 
 
 theaet quite right that is on the supposition that some 
 classes mingle with one another and others not 
 
 str that such a communion of kinds is according to nature we had 
 already proved before we arrived at this part of our discussion 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str let us proceed then we not say that motion is other than 
 the other having been also proved by us to be other than 
 the same and other than rest 
 
 theaet that is certain 
 
 str then according to this view motion is other and also not 
 other 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str what is the next step shall we say that motion is other than 
 the three and not other than the we agreed that there are 
 five classes about and in the sphere of which we proposed to make 
 enquiry 
 
 theaet surely we cannot admit that the number is less than it 
 appeared to be just now 
 
 str then we may without fear contend that motion is other than 
 being 
 
 theaet without the least fear 
 
 str the plain result is that motion since it partakes of being 
 really is and also is not 
 
 theaet nothing can be plainer 
 
 str then necessarily exists in the case of motion and 
 of every class for the nature of the other entering into them all 
 makes each of them other than being and so and 
 therefore of all of them in like manner we may truly say that they 
 are again inasmuch as they partake of being that they are 
 and are existent 
 
 theaet so we may assume 
 
 str every class then has plurality of being and infinity of 
 
 
 theaet so we must infer 
 
 str and being itself may be said to be other than the other kinds 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str then we may infer that being is not in respect of as many 
 other things as there are for these it is itself one and 
 is not the other things which are infinite in number 
 
 theaet that is not far from the truth 
 
 str and we must not quarrel with this result since it is of the 
 nature of classes to have communion with one another and if any one 
 denies our present statement viz that being is not etc let 
 him first argue with our former conclusion respecting the 
 communion of ideas and then he may proceed to argue with what 
 follows 
 
 theaet nothing can be fairer 
 
 str let me ask you to consider a further question 
 
 theaet what question 
 
 str when we speak of we speak i suppose not of 
 something opposed to being but only different 
 
 theaet what do you mean 
 
 str when we speak of something as not great does the expression 
 seem to you to imply what is little any more than what is equal 
 
 theaet certainly not 
 
 str the negative particles ou and me when prefixed to words do 
 not imply opposition but only difference from the words or more 
 correctly from the things represented by the words which 
 follow them 
 
 theaet quite true 
 
 str there is another point to be considered if you do not object 
 
 theaet what is it 
 
 str the nature of the other appears to me to be divided into 
 fractions like knowledge 
 
 theaet how so 
 
 str knowledge like the other is one and yet the 
 various parts of knowledge have each of them their own particular name and hence there are many arts and kinds of knowledge 
 
 theaet quite true 
 
 str and is not the case the same with the parts of the 
 other which is also one 
 
 theaet very likely but will you tell me how 
 
 str there is some part of the other which is opposed to the 
 beautiful 
 
 theaet there is 
 
 str shall we say that this has or has not a name 
 
 theaet it has for whatever we call not beautiful is 
 other than the beautiful not than something else 
 
 str and now tell me another thing 
 
 theaet what 
 
 str is the anything but existence parted 
 off from a certain kind of existence and again from another point 
 of view opposed to an existing something 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str then the turns out to be the opposition of 
 being to being 
 
 theaet very true 
 
 str but upon this view is the beautiful a more real and the 
 a less real existence 
 
 theaet not at all 
 
 str and the may be said to exist equally with 
 the great 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str and in the same way the just must be placed in the same 
 category with the the one cannot be said to have any more 
 existence than the other 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str the same may be said of other things seeing that the 
 nature of the other has a real existence the parts of this nature must 
 equally be supposed to exist 
 
 theaet of course 
 
 str then as would appear the opposition of a part of the other 
 and of a part of being to one another is if i may venture to say 
 so as truly essence as being itself and implies not the opposite 
 of being but only what is other than being 
 
 theaet beyond question 
 
 str what then shall we call it 
 
 theaet clearly and this is the very nature for which 
 the sophist compelled us to search 
 
 str and has not this as you were saying as real an existence as 
 any other class may i not say with confidence that has an 
 assured existence and a nature of its own just as the great was 
 found to be great and the beautiful beautiful and the 
 and the in the same manner 
 has been found to be and is and is to 
 be reckoned one among the many classes of being do you theaetetus still feel any doubt of this 
 
 theaet none whatever 
 
 str do you observe that our scepticism has carried us beyond the 
 range of parmenides prohibition 
 
 theaet in what 
 
 str we have advanced to a further point and shown him 
 more than he for bad us to investigate 
 
 theaet how is that 
 
 str why because he never is and do thou keep thy thoughts from this way of enquiry 
 theaet yes he says so 
 
 str whereas we have not only proved that things which 
 are not are but we have shown what form of being is for we have shown that the nature of the other is and is distributed over all things in their relations to one another and whatever part of the other is contrasted with being this is precisely what we have 
 ventured to call 
 
 theaet and surely stranger we were quite right 
 
 str let not any one say then that while affirming the 
 opposition of to being we still assert the being of 
 for as to whether there is an opposite of being to that 
 enquiry we have long said may or may not be and may or may not be capable of definition but as touching our present 
 account of let a man either convince us of error or so 
 long as he cannot he too must say as we are saying that there is 
 a communion of classes and that being and difference or other 
 traverse all things and mutually interpenetrate so that the other 
 partakes of being and by reason of this participation is and yet 
 is not that of which it partakes but other and being other than 
 being it is clearly a necessity that should be again 
 being through partaking of the other becomes a class other than 
 the remaining classes and being other than all of them is not each 
 one of them and is not all the rest so that undoubtedly there are 
 thousands upon thousands of cases in which being is not and 
 all other things whether regarded individually or collectively in many 
 respects are and in many respects are not 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str and he who is sceptical of this contradiction must think how 
 he can find something better to say or if he sees a puzzle and 
 his pleasure is to drag words this way and that the argument will 
 prove to him that he is not making a worthy use of his 
 faculties for there is no charm in such puzzles and there is no difficulty in detecting them but we can tell him of something else the pursuit of which is noble and also difficult 
 
 theaet what is it 
 
 str a thing of which i have already alone these 
 puzzles as involving no difficulty he should be able to follow and 
 criticize in detail every argument and when a man says that the 
 same is in a manner other or that other is the same to understand 
 and refute him from his own point of view and in the same respect 
 in which he asserts either of these affections but to show that 
 somehow and in some sense the same is other or the other 
 same or the great small or the like unlike and to delight in always bringing forward such contradictions is no real refutation but is 
 clearly the babe of some one who is only beginning to approach the problem of being 
 
 theaet to be sure 
 
 str for certainly my friend the attempt to separate all 
 existences from one another is a barbarism and utterly unworthy of 
 an educated or philosophical mind 
 
 theaet why so 
 
 str the attempt at universal separation is the final annihilation 
 of all reasoning for only by the union of conceptions with one 
 another do we attain to discourse of reason 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str and observe that we were only just in time in making a 
 resistance to such separatists and compelling them to admit that 
 one thing mingles with another 
 
 theaet why so 
 
 str why that we might be able to assert discourse to be a kind 
 of being for if we could not the worst of all consequences would 
 follow we should have no philosophy moreover the necessity for 
 determining the nature of discourse presses upon us at this 
 moment if utterly deprived of it we could no more hold discourse and deprived of it we should be if we admitted that there was no 
 admixture of natures at all 
 
 theaet very true but i do not understand why at this moment we 
 must determine the nature of discourse 
 
 str perhaps you will see more clearly by the help of the 
 following explanation 
 
 theaet what explanation 
 
 str has been acknowledged by us to be one among many 
 classes diffused over all being 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str and thence arises the question whether mingles 
 with opinion and language 
 
 theaet how so 
 
 str if has no part in the proposition then all things 
 must be true but if has a part then false opinion and 
 false speech are possible for think or to say what is 
 falsehood which thus arises in the region of thought and in speech 
 
 theaet that is quite true 
 
 str and where there is falsehood surely there must be deceit 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str and if there is deceit then all things must be full of idols 
 and images and fancies 
 
 theaet to be sure 
 
 str into that region the sophist as we said made his 
 escape and when he had got there denied the very possibility of falsehood no one he argued either conceived or uttered falsehood inasmuch as did not in any way partake of being 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str and now has been shown to partake of being and 
 therefore he will not continue fighting in this direction 
 but he will probably say that some ideas partake of and some not and that language and opinion are of the class and he will still fight to the death against the existence of the 
 and phantastic art in which we have placed 
 him he will say opinion and language do not partake of and unless this participation exists there can be no such thing as falsehood and with the view of meeting this evasion we must begin by enquiring into the nature of language opinion and 
 imagination in order that when we find them we may find also that they have communion with and having made out the connection of them may thus prove that falsehood exists and therein we will imprison the sophist if he deserves it or if not we will let him go again and look for him in another class 
 
 theaet certainly stranger there appears to be truth in what was 
 said about the sophist at first that he was of a class not easily 
 caught for he seems to have abundance of defences which he throws up and which must every one of them be stormed before we can reach the man himself and even now we have with difficulty got 
 through his first defence which is the of and lo here is another for we have still to show that falsehood exists in 
 the sphere of language and opinion and there will be another and 
 another line of defence without end 
 
 str any one theaetetus who is able to advance even a 
 little ought to be of good cheer for what would he who is dispirited at a little progress do if he were making none at all or even undergoing a repulse such a faint heart as the proverb says will never take a city but now that we have succeeded thus far the citadel is ours and what remains is easier 
 
 theaet very true 
 
 str then as i was saying let us first of all obtain a 
 conception of language and opinion in order that we may have 
 clearer grounds for determining whether has any concern 
 with them or whether they are both always true and neither of them 
 ever false 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str then now let us speak of names as before we were 
 speaking of ideas and letters for that is the direction in which the answer may be expected 
 
 theaet and what is the question at issue about names 
 
 str the question at issue is whether all names may be connected 
 with one another or none or only some of them 
 
 theaet clearly the last is true 
 
 str i understand you to say that words which have a 
 meaning when in sequence may be connected but that words which have no meaning when in sequence cannot be connected 
 
 theaet what are you saying 
 
 str what i thought that you intended when you gave your 
 assent for there are two sorts of intimation of being which are given by the voice 
 
 theaet what are they 
 
 str one of them is called nouns and the other verbs 
 
 theaet describe them 
 
 str that which denotes action we call a verb 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str and the other which is an articulate mark set on those who 
 do the actions we call a noun 
 
 theaet quite true 
 
 str a succession of nouns only is not a sentence any more than of 
 verbs without nouns 
 
 theaet i do not understand you 
 
 str i see that when you gave your assent you had something else 
 in your mind but what i intended to say was that a mere succession 
 of nouns or of verbs is not discourse 
 
 theaet what do you mean 
 
 str i mean that words like walks runs sleeps or any 
 other words which denote action however many of them you string 
 together do not make discourse 
 
 theaet how can they 
 
 str or again when you say lion stag horse or any other 
 words which denote agents neither in this way of stringing words 
 together do you attain to discourse for there is no expression of 
 action or inaction or of the existence of existence or 
 indicated by the sounds until verbs are mingled with 
 nouns then the words fit and the smallest combination of them 
 forms language and is the simplest and least form of discourse 
 
 theaet again i ask what do you mean 
 
 str when any one says a man learns should you not call this 
 the simplest and least of sentences 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str yes for he now arrives at the point of giving an intimation 
 about something which is or is becoming or has become or will be 
 and he not only names but he does something by connecting 
 verbs with nouns and therefore we say that he discourses and to this 
 connection of words we give the name of discourse 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str and as there are some things which fit one another and other 
 things which do not fit so there are some vocal signs which do and 
 others which do not combine and form discourse 
 
 theaet quite true 
 
 str there is another small matter 
 
 theaet what is it 
 
 str a sentence must and cannot help having a subject 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str and must be of a certain quality 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str and now let us mind what we are about 
 
 theaet we must do so 
 
 str i will repeat a sentence to you in which a thing and an 
 action are combined by the help of a noun and a verb and you shall 
 tell me of whom the sentence speaks 
 
 theaet i will to the best my power 
 
 str theaetetus a very long sentence 
 
 theaet not very 
 
 str of whom does the sentence speak and who is the 
 subject that is what you have to tell 
 
 theaet of me i am the subject 
 
 str or this sentence again 
 
 theaet what sentence 
 
 str theaetetus with whom i am now speaking is flying 
 
 theaet that also is a sentence which will be admitted by every 
 one to speak of me and to apply to me 
 
 str we agreed that every sentence must necessarily have a certain 
 quality 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str and what is the quality of each of these two sentences 
 
 theaet the one as i imagine is false and the other true 
 
 str the true says what is true about you 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str and the false says what is other than true 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str and therefore speaks of things which are not as if they were 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str and say that things are real of you which are not for as we 
 were saying in regard to each thing or person there is much that 
 is and much that is not 
 
 theaet quite true 
 
 str the second of the two sentences which related to you was 
 first of all an example of the shortest form consistent with our 
 definition 
 
 theaet yes this was implied in recent admission 
 
 str and in the second place it related to a subject 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str who must be you and can be nobody else 
 theaet unquestionably 
 
 str and it would be no sentence at all if there were no subject 
 for as we proved a sentence which has no subject is impossible 
 
 theaet quite true 
 
 str when other then is asserted of you as the same and 
 as being such a combination of nouns and verbs is really and truly false discourse 
 
 theaet most true 
 
 str and therefore thought opinion and imagination are now 
 proved to exist in our minds both as true and false 
 
 theaet how so 
 
 str you will know better if you first gain a knowledge of 
 what they are and in what they severally differ from one another 
 theaet give me the knowledge which you would wish me to gain 
 str are not thought and speech the same with this exception 
 that what is called thought is the unuttered conversation of the 
 soul with herself 
 
 theaet quite true 
 
 str but the stream of thought which flows through the lips and is 
 audible is called speech 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str and we know that there exists in speech 
 
 theaet what exists 
 
 str affirmation 
 
 theaet yes we know it 
 
 str when the affirmation or denial takes place in silence and in 
 the mind only have you any other name by which to call it but 
 opinion 
 
 theaet there can be no other name 
 
 str and when opinion is presented not simply but in some form 
 of sense would you not call it imagination 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str and seeing that language is true and false and that 
 thought is the conversation of the soul with herself and opinion is the end of thinking and imagination or phantasy is the union of sense and 
 opinion the inference is that some of them since they are akin to 
 language should have an element of falsehood as well as of truth 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str do you perceive then that false opinion and speech have 
 been discovered sooner than we just now we seemed to be undertaking a task which would never be accomplished 
 
 theaet i perceive 
 
 str then let us not be discouraged about the future but 
 now having made this discovery let us go back to our previous classification 
 theaet what classification 
 
 str we divided into two sorts the one 
 the other imaginative or phantastic 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str and we said that we were uncertain in which we should 
 place the sophist 
 
 theaet we did say so 
 
 str and our heads began to go round more and more when it was 
 asserted that there is no such thing as an image or idol or 
 appearance because in no manner or time or place can there ever be 
 such a thing as falsehood 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str and now since there has been shown to be false speech and 
 false opinion there may be imitations of real existences and out 
 of this condition of the mind an art of deception may arise 
 
 theaet quite possible 
 
 str and we have already admitted in what preceded that the 
 sophist was lurking in one of the divisions of the 
 art 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str let us then renew the attempt and in dividing any class 
 always take the part to the right holding fast to that which holds 
 the sophist until we have stripped him of all his common 
 properties and reached his difference or peculiar then we may 
 exhibit him in his true nature first to ourselves and then 
 to kindred dialectical spirits 
 
 theaet very good 
 
 str you may remember that all art was originally divided 
 by us into creative and acquisitive 
 
 theaet yes 
 str and the sophist was flitting before us in the acquisitiveclass in the subdivisions of hunting contests merchandise and the like 
 
 theaet very true 
 
 str but now that the imitative art has enclosed him it is clear 
 that we must begin by dividing the art of creation for 
 imitation is a kind of creation of images however as we affirm and not of real things 
 
 theaet quite true 
 
 str in the first place there are two kinds of creation 
 
 theaet what are they 
 
 str one of them is human and the other divine 
 
 theaet i do not follow 
 
 str every power as you may remember our saying originally which 
 causes things to exist not previously existing was defined by us 
 as creative 
 
 theaet i remember 
 
 str looking now at the world and all the animals and plants at 
 things which grow upon the earth from seeds and roots as well as at 
 inanimate substances which are formed within the earth fusile or 
 shall we say that they come into having 
 existed the creation of god or shall we agree with 
 vulgar opinion about them 
 
 theaet what is it 
 
 str the opinion that nature brings them into being from some 
 spontaneous and unintelligent cause or shall we say that they are 
 created by a divine reason and a knowledge which comes from god 
 
 theaet i dare say that owing to my youth i may often waver in 
 my view but now when i look at you and see that you incline to 
 refer them to god i defer to your authority 
 
 str nobly said theaetetus and if i thought that you were one of 
 those who would hereafter change your mind i would have 
 gently argued with you and forced you to assent but as i perceive that you will come of yourself and without any argument of mine to that belief which as you say attracts you i will not forestall the work of time let me suppose then that things which are said to be made by nature are the work of divine art and that things which are made by man out of these are work of human art and so there are two kinds of making and production the one human and the other divine 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str then now subdivide each of the two sections which we have 
 already 
 
 theaet how do you mean 
 
 str i mean to say that you should make a vertical division of 
 production or invention as you have already made a lateral one 
 
 theaet i have done so 
 
 str then now there are in all four parts or of 
 them have reference to us and are human and two of them have 
 reference to the gods and are divine 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str and again in the division which was supposed to be made in 
 the other way one part in each subdivision is the making of the 
 things themselves but the two remaining parts may be called the 
 making of likenesses and so the productive art is again divided 
 into two parts 
 
 theaet tell me the divisions once more 
 
 str i suppose that we and the other animals and the elements 
 out of which things are water and the 
 known by us to be each and all the creation and work of god 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str and there are images of them which are not them but which 
 correspond to them and these are also the creation of a wonderful 
 skill 
 
 theaet what are they 
 
 str the appearances which spring up of themselves in sleep or by 
 day such as a shadow when darkness arises in a fire or the 
 reflection which is produced when the light in bright and smooth 
 objects meets on their surface with an external light and creates a 
 perception the opposite of our ordinary sight 
 
 theaet yes and the images as well as the creation are equally 
 the work of a divine hand 
 
 str and what shall we say of human art do we not make 
 one house by the art of building and another by the art of drawing which is a sort of dream created by man for those who are awake 
 
 theaet quite true 
 
 str and other products of human creation are twofold and go in 
 pairs there is the thing with which the art of making the thing is 
 concerned and the image with which imitation is concerned 
 
 theaet now i begin to understand and am ready to acknowledge 
 that there are two kinds of production and each of them two fold 
 in the lateral division there is both a divine and a human 
 production in the vertical there are realities and a creation of a kind of 
 similitudes 
 
 str and let us not forget that of the imitative class the one 
 part to have been likeness making and the other phantastic if it 
 could be shown that falsehood is a reality and belongs to 
 the class of real being 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str and this appeared to be the case and therefore now without 
 hesitation we shall number the different kinds as two 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str then now let us again divide the phantastic art 
 
 theaet where shall we make the division 
 
 str there is one kind which is produced by an instrument and 
 another in which the creator of the appearance is himself the 
 instrument 
 
 theaet what do you mean 
 
 str when any one makes himself appear like another in his 
 figure or his voice imitation is the name for this part of the phantastic art 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str let this then be named the art of mimicry and this the 
 province assigned to it as for the other division we are weary and 
 will give that up leaving to some one else the duty of making the 
 class and giving it a suitable name 
 
 theaet let us do as you a sphere to the one and leave 
 the other 
 
 str there is a further distinction theaetetus which is worthy 
 of our consideration and for a reason which i will tell you 
 
 theaet let me hear 
 
 str there are some who imitate knowing what they 
 imitate and some who do not know and what line of distinction can there possibly be greater than that which divides ignorance from knowledge 
 
 theaet there can be no greater 
 
 str was not the sort of imitation of which we spoke just now the 
 imitation of those who know for he who would imitate you 
 would surely know you and your figure 
 
 theaet naturally 
 
 str and what would you say of the figure or form of justice or of 
 virtue in general are we not well aware that many having no 
 knowledge of either but only a sort of opinion do their 
 best to show that this opinion is really entertained by them by expressing it as far as they can in word and deed 
 
 theaet yes that is very common 
 
 str and do they always fail in their attempt to be thought just 
 when they are not or is not the very opposite true 
 
 theaet the very opposite 
 
 str such a one then should be described as an be 
 distinguished from the other as he who is ignorant is distinguished 
 from him who knows 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str can we find a suitable name for each of them this is clearly 
 not an easy task for among the ancients there was some confusion of 
 ideas which prevented them from attempting to divide genera into 
 species wherefore there is no great abundance of names yet for 
 the sake of distinctness i will make bold to call the imitation which coexists with opinion the imitation of which coexists with science a scientific or learned imitation 
 
 theaet granted 
 
 str the former is our present concern for the sophist was 
 classed with imitators indeed but not among those who have 
 knowledge 
 
 theaet very true 
 
 str let us then examine our imitator of appearance and see 
 whether he is sound like a piece of iron or whether there is still 
 some crack in him 
 
 theaet let us examine him 
 
 str indeed there is a very considerable crack for if you 
 look you find that one of the two classes of imitators is a simple creature who thinks that he knows that which he only fancies the other sort has knocked about among arguments until he suspects and 
 fears that he is ignorant of that which to the many he pretends to know 
 theaet there are certainly the two kinds which you describe 
 
 str shall we regard one as the simple other as the 
 dissembling or ironical imitator 
 
 theaet very good 
 
 str and shall we further speak of this latter class as having one 
 or two divisions 
 
 theaet answer yourself 
 
 str upon consideration then there appear to me to be two there 
 is the dissembler who harangues a multitude in public in a long 
 speech and the dissembler who in private and in short speeches 
 compels the person who is conversing with him to contradict himself 
 
 theaet what you say is most true 
 
 str and who is the maker of the longer speeches is he the 
 statesman or the popular orator 
 
 theaet the latter 
 
 str and what shall we call the other is he the philosopher or 
 the sophist 
 
 theaet the philosopher he cannot be for upon our view he is 
 ignorant but since he is an imitator of the wise he will have a 
 name which is formed by an adaptation of the word sothos what shall we name him i am pretty sure that i cannot be mistaken in 
 terming him the true and very sophist 
 
 str shall we bind up his name as we did before making a 
 chain from one end of his genealogy to the other 
 
 theaet by all means 
 
 str he then who traces the pedigree of his art as 
 belonging to the conscious or dissembling section of the art of 
 causing is an imitator of appearance and is 
 separated from the class of phantastic which is a branch of 
 into that further division of creation the juggling of 
 words a creation human and not one who affirms the real 
 sophist to be of this blood and lineage will say the very truth 
 
 theaet undoubtedly 
 
 the end

 of adversity 
 it was an high speech of seneca after the manner of the stoics that the good things which belong to prosperity are to be wished but the good things that belong to adversity are to be admired bona rerum secudarum optabilia adversarum mirabilia 
 certainly if miracles be the command over nature they appear most in adversity it is yet a higher speech of his than the other much too high for a heathen it is true greatness to have in one the fragility of a man and the security of a god vere magnum habere fragilitaterm hominis securitatem da this would have done better in poesy where transcendencies are more allowed and the poets indeed have been busy with it for it is in effect the thing which is figured in that strange fiction of the ancient poets which seemeth not to be without mystery nay and to have some approach to the state of a christian that hercules when he went to unbind prometheus by whom human nature is represented sailed the length of the great ocean in an earthen pot or pitcher lively describing christian resolution that saileth in the frail barque of the flesh through the waves of the world but to speak in a mean 
 the virtue of prosperity is temperance the virtue of adversity is fortitude 
 which in morals is the more heroical virtue prosperity is the blessing of the old 
 testament adversity is the blessing of the new which carrieth the greater 
 benediction and the clearer revelation of favour yet even in the old 
 testament if you listen to harp you shall hear as many hearselike airs 
 as carols and the pencil of the holy ghost hath laboured more in describing the 
 afflictions of job than the felicities of solomon prosperity is not without many 
 fears and distastes and adversity is not without comforts and hopes we see in 
 needlework and embroideries it is more pleasing to have a lively work upon a sad and solemn ground than to have a dark and melancholy work upon a lightsome ground judge therefore of the pleasure of the heart by the pleasure of the eye certainly virtue is like precious odours most fragrant when they are incensed or crushed for prosperity doth best discover vice but adversity doth best discover virtue

 book just man 
 chapter iv 
 
 works corresponding to words 
 his conversation was gay and affable 
 he put himself on a level with the two old women who had passed their lives beside him when he laughed it was the laugh of a schoolboy 
 madame magloire liked to call him your grace votre grandeur one day he rose from his and went to his library in search of a book this book was on one of the upper shelves 
 as the bishop was rather short of stature he could not reach it 
 madame magloire said he fetch me a chair 
 my greatness grandeur does not reach as far as that shelf 
 one of his distant relatives madame la comtesse de lo rarely allowed an opportunity to escape of enumerating in his presence what she designated as the expectations of her three sons she had numerous relatives who were very old and near to death and of whom her sons were the natural heirs 
 the youngest of the three was to receive from a a good hundred thousand livres of income the second was the heir by entail to the title of the duke his uncle the eldest was to succeed to the peerage of his grandfather 
 the bishop was accustomed to listen in silence to these innocent and pardonable maternal boasts 
 on one occasion however he appeared to be more thoughtful than usual while madame de lo was relating once again the details of all these inheritances and all these expectations 
 she interrupted herself impatiently mon dieu cousin 
 what are you thinking about 
 i am thinking replied the bishop of a singular remark which is to be found i believe in st your hopes in the man from whom you do not inherit 
 at another time on receiving a notification of the decease of a gentleman of the wherein not only the dignities of the dead man but also the feudal and noble qualifications of all his relatives spread over an entire page 
 what a stout back death has he exclaimed 
 what a strange burden of titles is cheerfully imposed on him and how much wit must men have in order thus to press the tomb into the service of vanity 
 he was gifted on occasion with a gentle raillery which almost always concealed a serious meaning 
 in the course of one lent a youthful vicar came to d and preached in the cathedral he was tolerably eloquent 
 the subject of his sermon was charity he urged the rich to give to the poor in order to avoid hell which he depicted in the most frightful manner of which he was capable and to win paradise which he represented as charming and desirable among the audience there was a wealthy retired merchant who was somewhat of a usurer named m geborand who had amassed two millions in the manufacture of coarse cloth serges and woollen galloons never in his whole life had m geborand bestowed alms on any poor wretch after the delivery of that sermon it was observed that he gave a sou every sunday to the poor old at the door of the cathedral there were six of them to share it 
 one day the bishop caught sight of him in the act of bestowing this charity and said to his sister with a smile there is m geborand purchasing paradise for a sou 
 when it was a question of charity he was not to be rebuffed even by a refusal and on such occasions he gave utterance to remarks which induced reflection 
 once he was begging for the poor in a of the town there was present the marquis de champtercier a wealthy and avaricious old man who contrived to be at one and the same time an and an this variety of man has actually existed 
 when the bishop came to him he touched his arm you must give me something m le marquis the marquis turned round and answered dryly i have poor people of my own monseigneur 
 give them to me replied the bishop 
 one day he preached the following sermon in the cathedral 
 my very dear brethren my good friends there are thirteen hundred and twenty thousand peasants dwellings in france which have but three openings eighteen hundred and seventeen thousand hovels which have but two openings the door and one window and three hundred and thousand cabins besides which have but one opening the door 
 and this arises from a thing which is called the tax on doors and windows 
 just put poor families old women and little children in those buildings and behold the fevers and maladies which result 
 alas 
 god gives air to men the law sells it to them i do not blame the law but i bless god 
 in the department of the isere in the var in the two departments of the alpes the hautes and the basses the peasants have not even wheelbarrows they transport their manure on the backs of men they have no candles and they burn resinous sticks and bits of rope dipped in pitch that is the state of affairs throughout the whole of the hilly country of dauphine 
 they make bread for six months at one time they bake it with dried in the winter they break this bread up with an axe and they soak it for hours in order to render it eatable 
 my brethren have pity behold the suffering on all sides of you 
 born a provencal he easily familiarized himself with the dialect of the south 
 he said en be moussu ses sage as in lower languedoc onte anaras passa as in the puerte un bouen moutu embe un bouen fromage grase as in upper dauphine 
 this pleased the people extremely and contributed not a little to win him access to all spirits 
 he was perfectly at home in the thatched cottage and in the mountains 
 he understood how to say the grandest things in the most vulgar of idioms 
 as he spoke all tongues he entered into all hearts 
 moreover he was the same towards people of the world and towards the lower classes 
 he condemned nothing in haste and without taking circumstances into account 
 he said examine the road over which the fault has passed 
 being as he described himself with a smile an he had none of the asperities of austerity and he professed with a good deal of distinctness and without the frown of the ferociously virtuous a doctrine which may be summed up as follows 
 man has upon him his flesh which is at once his burden and his temptation 
 he drags it with him and yields to it he must watch it cheek it repress it and obey it only at the last extremity 
 there may be some fault even in this obedience but the fault thus committed is venial it is a fall but a fall on the knees which may terminate in prayer 
 to be a saint is the exception to be an upright man is the rule err fall sin if you will but be upright 
 the least possible sin is the law of man 
 no sin at all is the dream of the angel 
 all which is terrestrial is subject to sin sin is a gravitation 
 when he saw everyone exclaiming very loudly and growing angry very quickly oh oh he said with a smile to all appearance this is a great crime which all the world commits 
 these are hypocrisies which have taken fright and are in haste to make protest and to put themselves under shelter 
 he was indulgent towards women and poor people on whom the burden of human society rest 
 he said the faults of women of children of the feeble the indigent and the ignorant are the fault of the husbands the fathers the masters the strong the rich and the wise 
 he said moreover teach those who are ignorant as many things as possible society is culpable in that it does not afford instruction gratis it is responsible for the night which it produces this soul is full of shadow sin is therein committed 
 the guilty one is not the person who has committed the sin but the person who has created the shadow 
 it will be perceived that he had a peculiar manner of his own of judging things 
 i suspect that he obtained it from the gospel 
 one day he heard a criminal case which was in preparation and on the point of trial discussed in a a wretched man being at the end of his resources had coined counterfeit money out of love for a woman and for the child which he had had by her counterfeiting was still punishable with death at that epoch the woman had been arrested in the act of passing the first false piece made by the man 
 she was held but there were no proofs except against her 
 she alone could accuse her lover and destroy him by her confession 
 she denied they insisted 
 she persisted in her denial 
 thereupon an idea occurred to the attorney for the crown he invented an infidelity on the part of the lover and succeeded by means of fragments of letters cunningly presented in persuading the unfortunate woman that she had a rival and that the man was deceiving her 
 thereupon exasperated by jealousy she denounced her lover confessed all proved all 
 the man was ruined 
 he was shortly to be tried at aix with his accomplice 
 they were relating the matter and each one was expressing enthusiasm over the cleverness of the magistrate by bringing jealousy into play he had caused the truth to burst forth in wrath he had educed the justice of revenge 
 the bishop listened to all this in silence 
 when they had finished he inquired 
 where are this man and woman to be tried 
 at the court of assizes 
 he went on and where will the advocate of the crown be tried 
 a tragic event occurred at d a man was condemned to death for murder 
 he was a wretched fellow not exactly educated not exactly ignorant who had been a mountebank at fairs and a writer for the public 
 the town took a great interest in the trial on the eve of the day fixed for the execution of the condemned man the chaplain of the prison fell ill 
 a priest was needed to attend the criminal in his last moments 
 they sent for the cure it seems that he refused to come saying that is no affair of mine 
 i have nothing to do with that unpleasant task and with that mountebank 
 i too am ill and besides it is not my place this reply was reported to the bishop who said monsieur le cure is right 
 it is not his place it is mine 
 he went instantly to the prison descended to the cell of the mountebank called him by name took him by the hand and spoke to him he passed the entire day with him forgetful of food and sleep praying to god for the soul of the condemned man and praying the condemned man for his own 
 he told him the best truths which are also the most simple 
 he was father brother friend he was bishop only to bless 
 he taught him everything encouraged and consoled him the man was on the point of dying in despair 
 death was an abyss to him as he stood trembling on its mournful brink he recoiled with horror he was not sufficiently ignorant to be absolutely indifferent his condemnation which had been a profound shock had in a manner broken through here and there that wall which separates us from the mystery of things and which we call life 
 he gazed incessantly beyond this world through these fatal breaches and beheld only darkness 
 the bishop made him see light 
 on the following day when they came to fetch the unhappy wretch the bishop was still there 
 he followed him and exhibited himself to the eyes of the crowd in his purple camail and with his episcopal cross upon his neck side by side with the criminal bound with cords 
 he mounted the tumbril with him he mounted the scaffold with him the sufferer who had been so gloomy and cast down on the preceding day was radiant 
 he felt that his soul was reconciled and he hoped in god 
 the bishop embraced him and at the moment when the knife was about to fall he said to him 
 god raises from the dead him whom man slays he whom his brothers have rejected finds his father once more 
 pray believe enter into life 
 the father is there when he descended from the scaffold there was something in his look which made the people draw aside to let him pass 
 they did not know which was most worthy of admiration his pallor or his serenity on his return to the humble dwelling which he designated with a smile as his palace he said to his sister i have just officiated pontifically 
 since the most sublime things are often those which are the least understood there were people in the town who said when commenting on this conduct of the bishop it is affectation 
 this however was a remark which was confined to the the populace which perceives no jest in holy deeds was touched and admired him 
 as for the bishop it was a shock to him to have beheld the guillotine and it was a long time before he recovered from it 
 in fact when the scaffold is there all erected and prepared it has something about it which produces hallucination one may feel a certain indifference to the death penalty one may refrain from pronouncing upon it from saying yes or no so long as one has not seen a guillotine with own eyes but if one encounters one of them the shock is violent one is forced to decide and to take part for or against some admire it like de maistre others execrate it like beccaria the guillotine is the concretion of the law it is called vindicte it is not neutral and it does not permit you to remain neutral he who sees it shivers with the most mysterious of shivers all social problems erect their interrogation point around this the scaffold is a vision 
 the scaffold is not a piece of carpentry the scaffold is not a machine the scaffold is not an inert bit of mechanism constructed of wood iron and cords 
 it seems as though it were a being possessed of i know not what sombre initiative one would say that this piece of work saw that this machine heard that this mechanism understood that this wood this iron and these cords were possessed of will in the frightful meditation into which its presence casts the soul the scaffold appears in terrible guise and as though taking part in what is going on 
 the scaffold is the accomplice of the executioner it devours it eats flesh it drinks blood the scaffold is a sort of monster fabricated by the judge and the carpenter a spectre which seems to live with a horrible vitality composed of all the death which it has inflicted 
 therefore the impression was terrible and profound on the day following the execution and on many succeeding days the bishop appeared to be crushed 
 the almost violent serenity of the funereal moment had disappeared the phantom of social justice tormented him 
 he who generally returned from all his deeds with a radiant satisfaction seemed to be reproaching himself at times he talked to himself and stammered lugubrious monologues in a low voice 
 this is one which his sister overheard one evening and preserved 
 i did not think that it was so monstrous it is wrong to become absorbed in the divine law to such a degree as not to perceive human law 
 death belongs to god alone by what right do men touch that unknown thing 
 in course of time these impressions weakened and probably vanished nevertheless it was observed that the bishop thenceforth avoided passing the place of execution 
 m myriel could be summoned at any hour to the bedside of the sick and dying 
 he did not ignore the fact that therein lay his greatest duty and his greatest labor 
 widowed and orphaned families had no need to summon him he came of his own accord 
 he understood how to sit down and hold his peace for long hours beside the man who had lost the wife of his love of the mother who had lost her child 
 as he knew the moment for silence he knew also the moment for speech 
 oh admirable consoler 
 he sought not to efface sorrow by forgetfulness but to magnify and dignify it by hope 
 he said 
 have a care of the manner in which you turn towards the dead think not of that which perishes 
 gaze steadily 
 you will perceive the living light of your dead in the depths of heaven he knew that faith is wholesome 
 he sought to counsel and calm the despairing man by pointing out to him the resigned man and to transform the grief which gazes upon a grave by showing him the grief which fixes its gaze upon a star
