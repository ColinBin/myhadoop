 a nest for owl and a warbler 
 it was in front of this gorbeau house that jean valjean halted like wild birds he had chosen this desert place to construct his nest 
 he fumbled in his waistcoat pocket drew out a sort of a opened the door entered closed it again carefully and ascended the staircase still carrying cosette 
 at the top of the stairs he drew from his pocket another key with which he opened another door 
 the chamber which he entered and which he closed again instantly was a kind of moderately spacious attic furnished with a mattress laid on the floor a table and several chairs a stove in which a fire was burning and whose embers were visible stood in one corner 
 a lantern on the boulevard cast a vague light into this poor room at the extreme end there was a with a folding bed jean valjean carried the child to this bed and laid her down there without waking her 
 he struck a match and lighted a candle 
 all this was prepared beforehand on the table and as he had done on the previous evening he began to scrutinize face with a gaze full of ecstasy in which the expression of kindness and tenderness almost amounted to aberration 
 the little girl with that tranquil confidence which belongs only to extreme strength and extreme weakness had fallen asleep without knowing with whom she was and continued to sleep without knowing where she was 
 jean valjean bent down and kissed that hand 
 nine months before he had kissed the hand of the mother who had also just fallen asleep 
 the same sad piercing religious sentiment filled his heart 
 he knelt beside bed 
 lt was broad daylight and the child still slept 
 a wan ray of the december sun penetrated the window of the attic and lay upon the ceiling in long threads of light and shade 
 all at once a heavily laden cart which was passing along the boulevard shook the frail bed like a clap of thunder and made it quiver from top to bottom 
 yes madame cried cosette waking with a start here i am here i am 
 and she sprang out of bed her eyes still half shut with the heaviness of sleep extending her arms towards the corner of the wall 
 ah mon dieu my broom said she 
 she opened her eyes wide now and beheld the smiling countenance of jean valjean 
 ah so it is true said the child 
 good morning monsieur 
 children accept joy and happiness instantly and familiarly being themselves by nature joy and happiness 
 cosette caught sight of catherine at the foot of her bed and took possession of her and as she played she put a hundred questions to jean valjean 
 where was she 
 was paris very large was madame thenardier very far away 
 was she to go back etc etc all at once she exclaimed how pretty it is here 
 it was a frightful hole but she felt free 
 must i sweep she resumed at last 
 play said jean valjean 
 the day passed thus 
 cosette without troubling herself to understand anything was inexpressibly happy with that doll and that kind man

 prince andrew had spent two years continuously in the country 
 all the plans pierre had attempted on his estates and constantly changing from one thing to another had never accomplished were carried out by prince andrew without display and without perceptible difficulty 
 he had in the highest degree a practical tenacity which pierre lacked and without fuss or strain on his part this set things going 
 on one of his estates the three hundred serfs were liberated and became free agricultural laborers this being one of the first examples of the kind in russia on other estates the serfs compulsory labor was commuted for a quitrent a trained midwife was engaged for bogucharovo at his expense and a priest was paid to teach reading and writing to the children of the peasants and household serfs 
 prince andrew spent half his time at bald hills with his father and his son who was still in the care of nurses the other half he spent in bogucharovo cloister as his father called prince estate despite the indifference to the affairs of the world he had expressed to pierre he diligently followed all that went on received many books and to his surprise noticed that when he or his father had visitors from petersburg the very vortex of life these people lagged behind himself who never left the country in knowledge of what was happening in home and foreign affairs 
 besides being occupied with his estates and reading a great variety of books prince andrew was at this time busy with a critical of survey our last two unfortunate campaigns and with drawing up a proposal for a reform of the army rules and regulations 
 in the spring of he went to visit the ryazan estates which had been inherited by his son whose guardian he was 
 warmed by the spring sunshine he sat in the caleche looking at the new grass the first leaves on the birches and the first puffs of white spring clouds floating across the clear blue sky he was not thinking of anything but looked and cheerfully from side to side 
 they crossed the ferry where he had talked with pierre the year before they went through the muddy village past threshing floors and green fields of winter rye downhill where snow still lodged near the bridge uphill where the clay had been liquefied by the rain past strips of stubble land and bushes touched with green here and there and into a birch forest growing on both sides of the road in the forest it was almost hot no wind could be felt the birches with their sticky green leaves were motionless and flowers and the first blades of green grass were pushing up and lifting last leaves the coarse evergreen color of the small fir trees scattered here and there among the birches was an unpleasant reminder of winter on entering the forest the horses began to snort and sweated visibly 
 peter the footman made some remark to the coachman the latter assented but apparently the sympathy was not enough for peter and he turned on the box toward his master 
 how pleasant it is your excellency he said with a respectful smile 
 what 
 pleasant your excellency 
 what is he talking about thought prince andrew oh the spring i suppose he thought as he turned round yes really everything is green already how early the birches and cherry and alders too are coming out but the oaks show no sign yet ah here is one oak 
 at the edge of the road stood an oak probably ten times the age of the birches that formed the forest it was ten times as thick and twice as tall as they it was an enormous tree its girth twice as great as a man could embrace and evidently long ago some of its branches had been broken off and its bark scarred with its huge ungainly limbs sprawling unsymmetrically and its gnarled hands and fingers it stood an aged stern and scornful monster among the smiling birch trees only the evergreen firs dotted about in the forest and this oak refused to yield to the charm of spring or notice either the spring or the sunshine 
 spring love happiness this oak seemed to say are you not weary of that stupid meaningless constantly repeated fraud always the same and always a fraud there is no spring no sun no happiness look at those cramped dead firs ever the same and at me too sticking out my broken and barked fingers just where they have grown whether from my back or my sides as they have grown so i stand and i do not believe in your hopes and your lies 
 as he passed through the forest prince andrew turned several times to look at that oak as if expecting something from it under the oak too were flowers and grass but it stood among them scowling rigid misshapen and grim as ever 
 yes the oak is right a thousand times right thought prince andrew let others the young yield afresh to that fraud but we know life our life is finished 
 a whole sequence of new thoughts hopeless but mournfully pleasant rose in his soul in connection with that tree during this journey he as it were considered his life afresh and arrived at his old conclusion restful in its hopelessness that it was not for him to begin anything anew but that he must live out his life content to do no harm and not disturbing himself or desiring anything

 chapter iii 
 
 two misfortunes make one piece of good fortune 
 on the following morning at daybreak jean valjean was still by bedside he watched there motionless waiting for her to wake 
 some new thing had come into his soul 
 jean valjean had never loved anything for years he had been alone in the world 
 he had never been father lover husband friend in the prison he had been vicious gloomy chaste ignorant and shy 
 the heart of that was full of virginity his sister and his children had left him only a vague and memory which had finally almost completely vanished he had made every effort to find them and not having been able to find them he had forgotten them 
 human nature is made thus the other tender emotions of his youth if he had ever had any had fallen into an abyss 
 when he saw cosette when he had taken possession of her carried her off and delivered her he felt his heart moved within him 
 all the passion and affection within him awoke and rushed towards that child 
 he approached the bed where she lay sleeping and trembled with joy 
 he suffered all the pangs of a mother and he knew not what it meant for that great and singular movement of a heart which begins to love is a very obscure and a very sweet thing 
 poor old man with a perfectly new heart 
 only as he was five and fifty and cosette eight years of age all that might have been love in the whole course of his life flowed together into a sort of ineffable light 
 it was the second white apparition which he had encountered the bishop had caused the dawn of virtue to rise on his horizon cosette caused the dawn of love to rise 
 the early days passed in this dazzled state 
 cosette on her side had also unknown to herself become another being poor little thing 
 she was so little when her mother left her that she no longer remembered her 
 like all children who resemble young shoots of the vine which cling to everything she had tried to love she had not succeeded 
 all had repulsed her the thenardiers their children other children 
 she had loved the dog and he had died after which nothing and nobody would have anything to do with her 
 it is a sad thing to say and we have already intimated it that at eight years of age her heart was cold it was not her fault it was not the faculty of loving that she lacked alas it was the possibility 
 thus from the very first day all her sentient and thinking powers loved this kind man 
 she felt that which she had never felt sensation of expansion 
 the man no longer produced on her the effect of being old or poor she thought jean valjean handsome just as she thought the hovel pretty 
 these are the effects of the dawn of childhood of joy 
 the novelty of the earth and of life counts for something here 
 nothing is so charming as the coloring reflection of happiness on a garret we all have in our past a delightful garret 
 nature a difference of fifty years had set a profound gulf between jean valjean and cosette destiny filled in this gulf destiny suddenly united and wedded with its irresistible power these two uprooted existences differing in age alike in sorrow one in fact completed the other 
 instinct sought a father as jean instinct sought a child 
 to meet was to find each other 
 at the mysterious moment when their hands touched they were welded together 
 when these two souls perceived each other they recognized each other as necessary to each other and embraced each other closely 
 taking the words in their most comprehensive and absolute sense we may say that separated from every one by the walls of the tomb jean valjean was the widower and cosette was the orphan this situation caused jean valjean to become father after a celestial fashion 
 and in truth the mysterious impression produced on cosette in the depths of the forest of chelles by the hand of jean valjean grasping hers in the dark was not an illusion but a reality the entrance of that man into the destiny of that child had been the advent of god 
 moreover jean valjean had chosen his refuge well 
 there he seemed perfectly secure 
 the chamber with a which he occupied with cosette was the one whose window opened on the boulevard 
 this being the only window in the house no neighbors glances were to be feared from across the way or at the side 
 the of number a sort of dilapidated penthouse served as a for and no communication existed between it and the first story 
 it was separated by the flooring which had neither traps nor stairs and which formed the diaphragm of the building as it were 
 the first story contained as we have said numerous chambers and several attics only one of which was occupied by the old woman who took charge of jean housekeeping all the rest was uninhabited 
 it was this old woman ornamented with the name of the principal lodger and in reality intrusted with the functions of portress who had let him the lodging on christmas eve 
 he had represented himself to her as a gentleman of means who had been ruined by spanish bonds who was coming there to live with his little daughter he had paid her six months in advance and had commissioned the old woman to furnish the chamber and as we have seen it was this good woman who had lighted the fire in the stove and prepared everything on the evening of their arrival 
 week followed week these two beings led a happy life in that hovel 
 cosette laughed chattered and sang from daybreak 
 children have their morning song as well as birds 
 it sometimes happened that jean valjean clasped her tiny red hand all cracked with chilblains and kissed it 
 the poor child who was used to being beaten did not know the meaning of this and ran away in confusion 
 at times she became serious and stared at her little black gown cosette was no longer in rags she was in mourning 
 she had emerged from misery and she was entering into life 
 jean valjean had undertaken to teach her to read 
 sometimes as he made the child spell he remembered that it was with the idea of doing evil that he had learned to read in prison 
 this idea had ended in teaching a child to read 
 then the smiled with the pensive smile of the angels 
 he felt in it a premeditation from on high the will of some one who was not man and he became absorbed in revery 
 good thoughts have their abysses as well as evil ones 
 to teach cosette to read and to let her play this constituted nearly the whole of jean existence 
 and then he talked of her mother and he made her pray 
 she called him father and knew no other name for him 
 he passed hours in watching her dressing and undressing her doll and in listening to her prattle 
 life henceforth appeared to him to be full of interest men seemed to him good and just he no longer reproached any one in thought he saw no reason why he should not live to be a very old man now that this child loved him he saw a whole future stretching out before him illuminated by cosette as by a charming light 
 the best of us are not exempt from egotistical thoughts 
 at times he reflected with a sort of joy that she would be ugly 
 this is only a personal opinion but to utter our whole thought at the point where jean valjean had arrived when he began to love cosette it is by no means clear to us that he did not need this encouragement in order that he might persevere in he had just viewed the malice of men and the misery of society under a new aspect incomplete aspects which unfortunately only exhibited one side of the truth the fate of woman as summed up in fantine and public authority as personified in javert 
 he had returned to prison this time for having done right he had quaffed fresh bitterness disgust and lassitude were overpowering him even the memory of the bishop probably suffered a temporary eclipse though sure to reappear later on luminous and triumphant but after all that sacred memory was growing dim 
 who knows whether jean valjean had not been on the eve of growing discouraged and of falling once more he loved and grew strong again 
 alas he walked with no less indecision than cosette 
 he protected her and she strengthened him thanks to him she could walk through life thanks to her he could continue in virtue 
 he was that stay and she was his prop 
 oh unfathomable and divine mystery of the balances of destiny

 book six 
 chapter ii 
 
 prince andrew had to see the marshal of the nobility for the district in connection with the affairs of the ryazan estate of which he was trustee this marshal was count ilya rostov and in the middle of may prince andrew went to visit him 
 it was now hot spring weather the whole forest was already clothed in green it was dusty and so hot that on passing near water one longed to bathe 
 prince andrew depressed and preoccupied with the business about which he had to speak to the marshal was driving up the avenue in the grounds of the rostovs house at otradnoe he heard merry girlish cries behind some trees on the right and saw group of girls running to cross the path of his caleche ahead of the rest and nearer to him ran a remarkably slim pretty girl in a yellow chintz dress with a white handkerchief on her head from under which loose locks of hair escaped the girl was shouting something but seeing that he was a stranger ran back laughing without looking at him 
 suddenly he did not know why he felt a pang the day was so beautiful the sun so bright everything around so gay but that slim pretty girl did not know or wish to know of his existence and was contented and cheerful in her own separate probably foolish but bright and happy life what is she so glad about what is she thinking of not of the military regulations or of the arrangement of the ryazan serfs quitrents of what is she thinking why is she so happy prince andrew asked himself with instinctive curiosity 
 in count ilya rostov was living at otradnoe just as he had done in former years that is entertaining almost the whole province with hunts theatricals dinners and music he was glad to see prince andrew as he was to see any new visitor and insisted on his staying the night 
 during the dull day in the course of which he was entertained by his elderly hosts and by the more important of the visitors the old house was crowded on account of an approaching name day prince andrew repeatedly glanced at natasha gay and laughing among the younger members of the company and asked himself each time what is she thinking about why is she so glad 
 that night alone in new surroundings he was long unable to sleep he read awhile and then put out his candle but relit it it was hot in the room the inside shutters of which were closed he was cross with the stupid old man as he called rostov who had made him stay by assuring him that some necessary documents had not yet arrived from town and he was vexed with himself for having stayed 
 he got up and went to the window to open it as soon as he opened the shutters the moonlight as if it had long been watching for this burst into the room he opened the casement the night was fresh bright and very still just before the window was a row of pollard trees looking black on one side and with a silvery light on the other beneath the trees grewsome kind of lush wet bushy vegetation with leaves and stems here and there farther back beyond the dark trees a roof glittered with dew to the right was a leafy tree with brilliantly white trunk and branches and above it shone the moon nearly at its full in a pale almost starless spring sky prince andrew leaned his elbows on the window ledge and his eyes rested on that sky 
 his room was on the first floor those in the rooms above were also awake he heard female voices overhead 
 just once more said a girlish voice above him which prince andrew recognized at once 
 but when are you coming to bed replied another voice 
 i i sleep the use come now for the last time 
 two girlish voices sang a musical passage the end of some song 
 oh how lovely now go to sleep and an end of it 
 you go to sleep but i said the first voice coming nearer to the window she was evidently leaning right out for the rustle of her dress and even her breathing could be heard everything was like the moon and its light and the shadows prince andrew too dared not stir for fear of betraying his unintentional presence 
 sonya sonya he again heard the first speaker oh how can you sleep only look how glorious it is ah how glorious do wake up sonya she said almost with tears in her voice there never never was such a lovely night before 
 sonya made some reluctant reply 
 do just come and see what a moon oh how lovely come here darling sweetheart come here there you see i feel like sitting down on my heels putting my arms round my knees like this straining tight as tight as possible and flying away like this 
 take care fall out 
 he heard the sound of a scuffle and disapproving voice past one 
 oh you only spoil things for me all right go go 
 again all was silent but prince andrew knew she was still sitting there from time to time he heard a soft rustle and at times a sigh 
 o god o god what does it mean she suddenly exclaimed to bed then if it must be and she slammed the casement 
 for her i might as well not exist thought prince andrew while he listened to her voice for some reason expecting yet fearing that she might say something about him there she is again as if it were on purpose thought he 
 in his soul there suddenly arose such an unexpected turmoil of youthful thoughts and hopes contrary to the whole tenor of his life that unable to explain his condition to himself he lay down and fell asleep at once

 chapter ii 
 
 prince andrew had to see the marshal of the nobility for the district in connection with the affairs of the ryazan estate of which he was trustee this marshal was count ilya rostov and in the middle of may prince andrew went to visit him 
 it was now hot spring weather the whole forest was already clothed in green it was dusty and so hot that on passing near water one longed to bathe 
 prince andrew depressed and preoccupied with the business about which he had to speak to the marshal was driving up the avenue in the grounds of the rostovs house at otradnoe he heard merry girlish cries behind some trees on the right and saw group of girls running to cross the path of his caleche ahead of the rest and nearer to him ran a remarkably slim pretty girl in a yellow chintz dress with a white handkerchief on her head from under which loose locks of hair escaped the girl was shouting something but seeing that he was a stranger ran back laughing without looking at him 
 suddenly he did not know why he felt a pang the day was so beautiful the sun so bright everything around so gay but that slim pretty girl did not know or wish to know of his existence and was contented and cheerful in her own separate probably foolish but bright and happy life what is she so glad about what is she thinking of not of the military regulations or of the arrangement of the ryazan serfs quitrents of what is she thinking why is she so happy prince andrew asked himself with instinctive curiosity 
 in count ilya rostov was living at otradnoe just as he had done in former years that is entertaining almost the whole province with hunts theatricals dinners and music he was glad to see prince andrew as he was to see any new visitor and insisted on his staying the night 
 during the dull day in the course of which he was entertained by his elderly hosts and by the more important of the visitors the old house was crowded on account of an approaching name day prince andrew repeatedly glanced at natasha gay and laughing among the younger members of the company and asked himself each time what is she thinking about why is she so glad

 the remarks of the principal tenant 
 jean valjean was prudent enough never to go out by day every evening at twilight he walked for an hour or two sometimes alone often with cosette seeking the most deserted side alleys of the boulevard and entering churches at nightfall he liked to go to which is the nearest church when he did not take cosette with him she remained with the old woman but the delight was to go out with the good man 
 she preferred an hour with him to all her rapturous with catherine he held her hand as they walked and said sweet things to her 
 it turned out that cosette was a very gay little person 
 the old woman attended to the housekeeping and cooking and went to market 
 they lived soberly always having a little fire but like people in very moderate circumstances 
 jean valjean had made no alterations in the furniture as it was the first day he had merely had the glass door leading to replaced by a solid door 
 he still wore his yellow coat his black breeches and his old hat in the street he was taken for a poor man 
 it sometimes happened that women turned back to bestow a sou on him jean valjean accepted the sou with a deep bow 
 it also happened occasionally that he encountered some poor wretch asking alms then he looked behind him to make sure that no one was observing him stealthily approached the unfortunate man put a piece of money into his hand often a silver coin and walked rapidly away this had its disadvantages 
 he began to be known in the neighborhood under the name of the beggar who gives alms 
 the old principal lodger a creature who was thoroughly permeated so far as her neighbors were concerned with the inquisitiveness peculiar to envious persons scrutinized jean valjean a great deal without his suspecting the fact 
 she was a little deaf which rendered her talkative 
 there remained to her from her past two above the other she was continually knocking against each other 
 she had questioned cosette who had not been able to tell her anything since she knew nothing herself except that she had come from montfermeil 
 one morning this spy saw jean valjean with an air which struck the old gossip as peculiar entering one of the uninhabited compartments of the hovel she followed him with the step of an old cat and was able to observe him without being seen through a crack in the door which was directly opposite him 
 jean valjean had his back turned towards this door by way of greater security no doubt 
 the old woman saw him fumble in his pocket and draw thence a case scissors and thread then he began to rip the lining of one of the skirts of his coat and from the opening he took a bit of yellowish paper which he unfolded the old woman recognized with terror the fact that it was a for a thousand francs 
 it was the second or third only that she had seen in the course of her existence 
 she fled in alarm 
 a moment later jean valjean accosted her and asked her to go and get this bill changed for him adding that it was his quarterly income which he had received the day before where thought the old woman 
 he did not go out until six in the evening and the government bank certainly is not open at that hour 
 the old woman went to get the bill changed and mentioned her surmises 
 that note commented on and multiplied produced a vast amount of terrified discussion among the gossips of the rue des vignes 
 a few days later it chanced that jean valjean was sawing some wood in his in the corridor 
 the old woman was in the chamber putting things in order 
 she was alone 
 cosette was occupied in admiring the wood as it was sawed 
 the old woman caught sight of the coat hanging on a nail and examined it 
 the lining had been sewed up again 
 the good woman felt of it carefully and thought she observed in the skirts and revers thicknesses of paper more no doubt 
 she also noticed that there were all sorts of things in the pockets not only the needles thread and scissors which she had seen but a big a very large knife suspicious circumstance several wigs of various colors 
 each pocket of this coat had the air of being in a manner provided against unexpected accidents 
 thus the inhabitants of the house reached the last days of winter

 next morning having taken leave of no one but the count and not waiting for the ladies to appear prince andrew set off for home 
 it was already the beginning of june when on his return journey he drove into the birch forest where the gnarled old oak had made so strange and memorable an impression on him in the forest the harness bells sounded yet more muffled than they had done six weeks before for now all was thick shady and dense and the young firs dotted about in the forest did not jar on the general beauty but lending themselves to the mood around were delicately green with fluffy young shoots 
 the whole day had been hot somewhere a storm was gathering but only a small cloud had scattered some raindrops lightly sprinkling the road and the sappy leaves the left side of the forest was dark in the shade the right side glittered in the sunlight wet and shiny and scarcely swayed by the breeze everything was in blossom the nightingales trilled and their voices reverberated now near now far away 
 yes here in this forest was that oak with which i agreed thought prince andrew but where is it he again wondered gazing at the left side of the road and without recognizing it he looked with admiration at the very oak he sought the old oak quite transfigured spreading out a canopy of sappy foliage stood rapt and slightly trembling in the rays of the evening sun neither gnarled fingers nor old scars nor old doubts and sorrows were any of them in evidence now through the hard bark even where there were no twigs leaves had sprouted such as one could hardly believe the old veteran could have produced 
 yes it is the same oak thought prince andrew and all at once he was seized by an unreasoning springtime feeling of joy and renewal all the best moments of his life suddenly rose to his memory austerlitz with the lofty heavens his dead reproachful face pierre at the ferry that girl thrilled by the beauty of the night and that night itself and the moon and all this rushed suddenly to his mind 
 no life is not over at prince andrew suddenly decided finally and decisively it is not enough for me to know what i have in me everyone must know it pierre and that young girl who wanted to fly away into the sky everyone must know me so that my life may not be lived for myself alone while others live so apart from it but so that it may be reflected in them all and they and i may live in harmony 
 on reaching home prince andrew decided to go to petersburg that autumn and found all sorts of reasons for this decision a whole serics of sensible and logical considerations showing it to be essential for him to go to petersburg and even to the service kept springing up in his mind he could not now understand how he could ever even have doubted the necessity of taking an active share in life just as a month before he had not understood how the idea of leaving the quiet country could ever enter his head it now seemed clear to him that all his experience of life must be senselessly wasted unless he applied it to some kind of work and again played an active part in life he did not even remember how formerly on the strength of similar wretched logical arguments it had seemed obvious that he would be degrading himself if he now after the lessons he had had in life allowed himself to believe in the possibility of being useful and in the possibility of happiness or love now reason suggested quite the opposite after that journey to ryazan he found the country dull his former pursuits no longer interested him and often when sitting alone in his study he got up went to the mirror and gazed a long time at his own face then he would turn away to the portrait of his dead lise who with hair curled a la grecque looked tenderly and gaily at him out of the gilt frame she did not now say those former terrible words to him but looked simply merrily and inquisitively at him and prince andrew crossing his arms behind him long paced the room now frowning now smiling as he reflected on those irrational inexpressible thoughts secret as a crime which altered his whole life and were connected with pierre with fame with the girl at the window the oak and beauty and love and if anyone came into his room at such moments he was particularly cold stern and above all unpleasantly logical 
 my dear princess mary entering at such a moment would say little nicholas go out today very cold 
 if it were hot prince andrew would reply at such times very dryly to his sister he could go out in his smock but as it is cold he must wear warm clothes which were designed for that purpose that is what follows from the fact that it is cold and not that a child who needs fresh air should remain at home he would add with extreme logic as if punishing someone for those secret illogical emotions that stirred within him 
 at such moments princess mary would think how intellectual work dries men up

 of love 
 the stage is more beholding to love than the life of man for as to the stage love is ever matter of comedies and now and then of tragedies but in life it doth much mischief sometimes like a siren sometimes like a fury you may observe that amongst all the great and worthy persons whereof the memory remaineth either ancient or recent there is not one that hath been transported to the mad degree of love which shows that great spirits and great business do keep out this weak passion 
 you must except nevertheless marcus antonius the half partner of the empire of rome and appius claudius the decemvir and lawgiver whereof the former was indeed a voluptuous man and inordinate but the latter was an austere and wise man and therefore it seems though rarely that love can find entrance not only into an open heart but also into a heart well fortified if watch be not well kept it is a poor saying of epicurus satis magnum alter alteri theatrum sumus as if man made for the contemplation of heaven and all noble objects should do nothing but kneel before a little idol and make himself subject though not of the mouth as beasts are yet of the eye which was given him for higher purposes it is a strange thing to note the excess of this passion and how it braves the nature and value of things by this that the speaking in a perpetual hyperbole is comely in nothing but in love neither is it merely in the phrase for whereas it hath been well said that the with whom all the petty flatterers have intelligence is a self certainly the lover is more for there was never proud man thought so absurdly well of himself as the lover doth of me person loved and therefore it was well said mat it is impossible to love and to be wise neither doth his weakness appear to others only and not to the party loved but to the loved most of all except the love be reciproque 
 
 for it is a true rule that love is ever rewarded either with the reciproque or 
 with an inward and secret contempt by how much the more men ought to beware of this passion which loseth not only other things but itself as for the other losses the relation doth well figure them that he that preferred helena quitted the gifts of juno and pallas for whosoever esteemeth too much of amorous affection quitteth both riches and wisdom this passion hath his floods in the very times of weakness which are great prosperity and great adversity though this latter hath been less observed both which times kindle love and make it more fervent and therefore show it to be the child of folly they do best who if they cannot but admit love yet make it keep quarter 
 and sever it wholly from their serious affairs and actions of life for if it check 
 once with business it troubleth men s fortunes and maketh men that they can no ways be true to their own ends i know not how but martial men are given to love i think it is but as they are given to wine for perils commonly ask to be paid in pleasures there is in nature a secret inclination and motion towards love of others which if it be not spent upon some one or a few doth naturally spread itself towards many and maketh men become humane and charitable as it is seen sometime in friars nuptial love maketh mankind friendly love perfecteth it but wanton love corrupteth and embaseth it

 book just man 
 chapter ix 
 
 the brother as depicted by the sister 
 in order to furnish an idea of the private establishment of the bishop of d and of the manner in which those two sainted women subordinated their actions their thoughts their feminine instincts even which are easily alarmed to the habits and purposes of the bishop without his even taking the trouble of speaking in order to explain them we cannot do better than transcribe in this place a letter from mademoiselle baptistine to madame the vicomtess de boischevron the friend of her childhood 
 this letter is in our possession 
 d dec my good madam 
 not a day passes without our speaking of you it is our established custom but there is another reason besides just imagine while washing and dusting the ceilings and walls madam magloire has made some discoveries now our two chambers hung with antique paper whitewashed over would not discredit a chateau in the style of yours 
 madam magloire has pulled off all the paper there were things beneath 
 my which contains no furniture and which we use for spreading out the linen after washing is fifteen feet in height eighteen square with a ceiling which was formerly painted and gilded and with beams as in yours this was covered with a cloth while this was the hospital and the woodwork was of the era of our grandmothers 
 but my room is the one you ought to see 
 madam magloire has discovered under at least ten thicknesses of paper pasted on top some paintings which without being good are very tolerable 
 the subject is telemachus being knighted by minerva in some gardens the name of which escapes me 
 in short where the roman ladies repaired on one single night 
 what shall i say to you 
 i have romans and roman ladies here occurs an illegible word and the whole train madam magloire has cleaned it all off this summer she is going to have some small injuries repaired and the whole revarnished and my chamber will be a regular museum 
 she has also found in a corner of the attic two wooden of ancient fashion they asked us two crowns of six francs each to regild them but it is much better to give the money to the poor and they are very ugly besides and i should much prefer a round table of mahogany 
 i am always very happy 
 my brother is so good 
 he gives all he has to the poor and sick 
 we are very much cramped 
 the country is trying in the winter and we really must do something for those who are in need 
 we are almost comfortably lighted and warmed you see that these are great treats 
 my brother has ways of his own 
 when he talks he says that a bishop ought to be so 
 just imagine the door of our house is never fastened whoever chooses to enter finds himself at once in my room he fears nothing even at night 
 that is his sort of bravery he says 
 he does not wish me or madame magloire feel any fear for him he exposes himself to all sorts of dangers and he does not like to have us even seem to notice it 
 one must know how to understand him 
 he goes out in the rain he walks in the water he travels in winter he fears neither suspicious roads nor dangerous encounters nor night 
 last year he went quite alone into a country of robbers 
 he would not take us 
 he was absent for a fortnight 
 on his return nothing had happened to him he was thought to be dead but was perfectly well and said this is the way i have been robbed 
 and then he opened a trunk full of jewels all the jewels of the cathedral of embrun which the thieves had given him 
 when he returned on that occasion i could not refrain from scolding him a little taking care however not to speak except when the carriage was making a noise so that no one might hear me 
 at first i used to say to myself there are no dangers which will stop him he is terrible 
 now i have ended by getting used to it i make a sign to madam magloire that she is not to oppose him he risks himself as he sees fit 
 i carry off madam magloire i enter my chamber i pray for him and fall asleep 
 i am at ease because i know that if anything were to happen to him it would be the end of me 
 i should go to the good god with my brother and my bishop 
 it has cost madam magloire more trouble than it did me to accustom herself to what she terms his imprudences 
 but now the habit has been acquired 
 we pray together we tremble together and we fall asleep 
 if the devil were to enter this house he would be allowed to do so 
 after all what is there for us to fear in this house 
 there is always some one with us who is stronger than we 
 the devil may pass through it but the good god dwells here 
 this suffices me 
 my brother has no longer any need of saying a word to me 
 i understand him without his speaking and we abandon ourselves to the care of providence 
 that is the way one has to do with a man who possesses grandeur of soul 
 i have interrogated my brother with regard to the information which you desire on the subject of the faux family 
 you are aware that he knows everything and that he has memories because he is still a very good royalist 
 they really are a very ancient norman family of the generalship of caen 
 five hundred years ago there was a raoul de faux a jean de faux and a thomas de faux who were gentlemen and one of whom was a seigneur de rochefort the last was and was commander of a regiment and something in the light horse of bretagne 
 his daughter married de gramont son of the duke louis de gramont peer of france colonel of the french guards and of the army 
 it is written faux fauq and faoucq 
 good madame recommend us to the prayers of your sainted relative monsieur the cardinal 
 as for your dear sylvanie she has done well in not wasting the few moments which she passes with you in writing to me 
 she is well works as you would wish and loves me 
 that is all that i desire 
 the souvenir which she sent through you reached me safely and it makes me very happy 
 my health is not so very bad and yet i grow thinner every day 
 farewell my paper is at an end and this forces me to leave you 
 a thousand good wishes 
 baptistine 
 your grand nephew is charming 
 do you know that he will soon be five years old 
 yesterday he saw some one riding by on horseback who had on and he said what has he got on his knees he is a charming child 
 his little brother is dragging an old broom about the room like a carriage and saying hu 
 as will be perceived from this letter these two women understood how to mould themselves to the ways with that special feminine genius which comprehends the man better than he comprehends himself the bishop of d in spite of the gentle and candid air which never deserted him sometimes did things that were grand bold and magnificent without seeming to have even a suspicion of the fact they trembled but they let him alone 
 sometimes madame magloire essayed a remonstrance in advance but never at the time nor afterwards they never interfered with him by so much as a word or sign in any action once entered upon 
 at certain moments without his having occasion to mention it when he was not even conscious of it himself in all probability so perfect was his simplicity they vaguely felt that he was acting as a bishop then they were nothing more than two shadows in the house 
 they served him passively and if obedience consisted in disappearing they disappeared they understood with an admirable delicacy of instinct that certain cares may be put under constraint 
 thus even when believing him to be in peril they understood i will not say his thought but his nature to such a degree that they no longer watched over him they confided him to god 
 moreover baptistine said as we have just read that her end would prove her own 
 madame magloire did not say this but she knew it

 his little brother is dragging an old broom about the room like a carriage and saying hu 
 as will be perceived from this letter these two women understood how to mould themselves to the ways with that special feminine genius which comprehends the man better than he comprehends himself the bishop of d in spite of the gentle and candid air which never deserted him sometimes did things that were grand bold and magnificent without seeming to have even a suspicion of the fact they trembled but they let him alone 
 sometimes madame magloire essayed a remonstrance in advance but never at the time nor afterwards they never interfered with him by so much as a word or sign in any action once entered upon 
 at certain moments without his having occasion to mention it when he was not even conscious of it himself in all probability so perfect was his simplicity they vaguely felt that he was acting as a bishop then they were nothing more than two shadows in the house 
 they served him passively and if obedience consisted in disappearing they disappeared they understood with an admirable delicacy of instinct that certain cares may be put under constraint 
 thus even when believing him to be in peril they understood i will not say his thought but his nature to such a degree that they no longer watched over him they confided him to god 
 moreover baptistine said as we have just read that her end would prove her own 
 madame magloire did not say this but she knew it

 a new hope 
 ix 
 
 as they traveled father and deeper into the bowels of the gigantic station they foundit increasingly difficult to maintain an air of casual indifference fortunately thosewho might have sensed some nervousness on the part of the two armored trooperswould regard it as only natural considering their huge dangerous wookie also made it impossible for the two young men to be as inconspicuous asthey would have liked 
 the farther they traveled the heavier the traffic became other technicians and mechanicals bustled around them intent on their ownassignments they ignored the trio completely only a few of the humans sparing thewookie a curious glance morose expression and the seemingconfidence of his captors reassured the inquisitive 
 eventually they reached a wide bank of elevators luke breathed a sigh ofrelief the transport ought to be capable of taking them justabout anywhere on the station in response to a verbal command 
 there was a nervous second when a minor official raced to get aboard sologestured sharply and the other without voicing a protest shifted to the next elevatortube in line 
 luke studied the operating panel then tried to sound at once knowledgeable andimportant as he spoke into the pickup grid instead he sounded nervous and the elevator was a mechanism not programmed to differentiate theappropriateness of emotions conveyed vocally so the door slid shut and they wereon their way after what felt like hours but was in reality only minutes the dooropened and they stepped out into the security area 
 it had been hope they would discover something like the cells of the kind used on tatooine in towns like mos eisley instead they sawonly narrow ramps bordering a bottomless ventilation shaft these levels of them ran parallel to smooth curving walls which held facelessdetention cells guards and energy gates seemed to be everywherethey looked 
 uncomfortably aware that the longer they stood frozen in place the soonersomeone was bound to come over and ask unanswerable questions luke searchedfrantically for a course of action 
 this going to work solo whispered leaning toward him 
 why you say so before a frustrated frightened luke shot back 
 i think i did i 
 shssh 
 solo shuts up worst fears were realized a tall officerapproached them he frowned as he examined the silent chewbacca 
 where are you two going with 
 chewbacca snarled at the remark and solo quieted him with a hasty jab in theribs a panicky luke found himself replying almost instinctively prisonertransfer from block ts 
 the officer looked puzzled i notified have to clear it 
 turning the man walked to a small console nearby and began entering hisrequest luke and han hurriedly surveyed the situation their gaze traveling fromalarms energy gates and remote photosensors to the three other guards station in thearea 
 solo nodded to luke as he unfastened cuffs then he whisperedsomething to the wookie an howl shook the corridor as chewbaccathrew up both hands grabbing rifle from him 
 look out a seemingly terrified solo shouted loose rip us allapart 
 both he and luke had darted clear of the rampaging wookie pulled out theirpistols and were blasting away at him their reaction was excellent theirenthusiasm undeniable and their aim execrable not a single shot came close to thedodging wookie instead they blasted automatic cameras controls andthe three dumbfounded guards 
 at this point it occurred to the officer in charge that the abominable aim of thetwo soldiers was a bit too selectively efficient he was preparing to jab the generalalarm when a burst from pistol caught him in the midsection and he fellwithout a word to the gray deck 
 solo rushed to the open comlink speaker which was screeching anxiousquestions about what was going on apparently there were audio as well as visuallinks between this detention station and elsewhere 
 ignoring the barrage of alternate threats and queries he checked the readout setin the panel nearby got to find out which cell this princess of yours is must a dozen levels it is cell go and them here 
 luke nodded once and was racing down the narrow walkway 
 after gesturing for the wookie to take up a position where he could cover theelevators solo took a deep breath and responded to the unceasing calls from thecomlink 
 under control he said into the pickup sounding reasonablyofficial situation normal 
 it sound like that a voice snapped back in a tone whathappened 
 uh well one of the guards experienced a weapon malfunction solostammered his temporary officialese lapsing into nervousness no problem all fine thanks how about you 
 sending a squad up the voice announced suddenly 
 han could almost smell the suspicion at the other end what to say hespoke more eloquently with the business end of a pistol 
 we have an energy dangerous 
 weapon malfunction energy leakwho is this your operating 
 pointing his pistol at the panels solo blew the instrumentation to silent was a dumb conversation anyway he murmured turning he shouted down thecorridor hurry it up luke going to have company 
 luke heard but he was absorbed in running from one cell to the next andstudying the numbers glowing above each doorway the cell it appeared didnot exist but it did and he found it just as he was about to give up and try the nextlevel down 
 for a long moment he examined the featureless convex metal wall turning hispistol to maximum and hoping it melt in his hand before it broke through heopened fire on the door when the weapon became too hot to hold he tossed it fromhand to hand as he did so the smoke had time to clear and he saw with somesurprise that the door had been blown away 
 peering through the smoke with an uncomprehending look on her face was theyoung woman whose portrait artoo detoo had projected in a garage on tatooineseveral centuries ago or it seemed 
 she was even more beautiful than her image luke decided staring dazedly ather i 
 her look of confusion and uncertainty was replaced by first puzzlement and thenimpatience you a littler short for a storm trooper she finally commented 
 what uniform he removed the helmet regaining a littlecomposure at the same time come to rescue you luke skywalker 
 i beg your pardon she said politely 
 i said come to rescue you ben kenobi is with me got yourtwo droids 
 the uncertainty was instantly replaced by hope at the mention of the ben kenobi she looked around luke ignoring him as she searched forthe jedi where is he 
 governor tarkin watched as darth vader paced rapidly back and forth in theotherwise empty conference room finally the dark lord paused glancing aroundas though a great bell only he could hear had rung somewhere close by 
 he is here vader stated unemotionally 
 tarkin looked startled kenobi impossible what makesyou think so 
 a stirring in the force of a kind felt only in the presence of my old is unmistakable 
 he must be dead by now 
 vader hesitated his assurance suddenly gone perhapsit is gone now itwas only a brief sensation 
 the jedi are extinct declared tarkin positively their fire was quencheddecades ago you my friend are all left of their ways 
 a comlink buzzed softly for attention yes tarkin acknowledged 
 we have an emergency alert in detention block aa 
 the princess tarkin yelped jumping to his feet vader whirled trying tostare through the walls 
 i know is here i knew i could not mistake a stirring in the forceof such power 
 put all sections on alert tarkin ordered through the comlink then he turnedto stare at vader if right he must not be allowed to escape 
 escape may not be intention vader replied struggling tocontrol his emotions he is the last of the the greatest the danger hepresents to us must not be only i can deal with him his headsnapped around to stare fixedly at tarkin alone 
 luke and leia had started back up the corridor when a series of blindingexplosion ripped the walkway ahead of them several troopers had tried comingthrough the elevator only to be crisped one after another by chewbacca disdainingthe elevators they had blasted a gaping hole through a wall the opening was toolarge for solo and the wookie to cover completely in twos and threes the imperialswere working their way into the detention block 
 retreating down the walkway han and chewbacca encountered luke and theprincess we go back that way solo told them his face flushed withexcitement and worry 
 no it looks like managed to cut off our only escape route leia agreedreadily this is a detention area you know they build them with multipleexits 
 breathing heavily solo turned to look her up and down begging yourforgiveness your highness he said sarcastically but maybe prefer it back inyour cell she looked away her face impassive 
 got to be another way out luke muttered pulling a small transmitterunit from his belt and carefully adjusting the frequency see threepioseethreepio 
 a familiar voice responded with gratifying speed yes sir 
 been cut off here are there any other ways out of the detention at all 
 static crackled over the tiny grid as solo and chewbacca kept the imperial troopsbottled up at the other end of the walkway 
 what was that i copy 
 back in the gentry office artoo detoo beeped and whistled frantically asthreepio adjusted controls fighting to clear the awkward transmission i said allsystems have been alerted to your presence sir the main entry seems to be the onlyway in or out of the cell block he pressed instruments and the view on the nearbyreadouts changed steadily all other information on your section is restricted 
 someone began banging on the locked door to the at first andthen when no response was forthcoming from within more insistently 
 oh no threepio groaned 
 the smoke in the cell corridor was now so intense that it was difficult for soloand chewbacca to pick their targets that was fortunate inasmuch as they were nowbadly outnumbered and the smoke confused the imperials fire with equalthoroughness 
 every so often one of the soldiers would attempt to move closer only to standexposed as he penetrated the smoke under the accurate fire of the two would rapidly join the accumulating mass of motionless figures on the rampwayflooring 
 energy bolts continued to ricochet wildly through the block as luke moved closeto solo 
 there other way out he yelled over the deafening roar of concentratedfire 
 well closing in on us what do we do now 
 this is some rescue an irritated voice complained from behind them bothmen turned to see a thoroughly disgusted princess eyeing them with regal you came in here you have a plan of getting out 
 solo nodded toward luke the brains sweetheart 
 luke managed an embarrassed grin and shrugged helplessly he turned to helpreturn fire but before he could do so the princess had snatched the pistol from hishand 
 hey 
 luke stared as she moved along the wall finally locating a small grate pointed the pistol at it and fired 
 solo gazed at her in disbelief what do you think doing 
 it looks like up to me to save our skins get into the garbage 
 while the others looked on in amazement she jumped feet first into the openingand disappeared chewbacca rumbled threateningly but solo slowly shook his head 
 no chewie i want you to rip her apart not sure about her beginning to like her or going to kill her myself the wookiesnorted something else and solo yelled back at him go on in you furry oaf care what you smell this is no time to go dainty on me 
 shoving the reluctant wookie toward the tiny opening solo helped jam themassive bulk through as soon as he disappeared the corellian followed him fired off the last series of blasts more in the hope of creating a covering smokethan hitting anything slid into the chute and was gone 
 not wanting to incur further losses in such a confined space the pursuingsoldiers had momentarily halted to await the arrival of reinforcements and heavierweapons besides they had their quarry trapped and despite their dedication noneof them were anxious to die needlessly 
 the chamber luke tumbled into was dimly lit not that the light was needed todiscern its contents he smelled the decay long before he was dumped into except for the concealed illuminants the garbage room was at least aquarter full of slimy muck much of which had already achieved a state ofdecomposition sufficient to wrinkle nose 
 solo was stumbling around the edge of the room slipping and sinking up to hisknees in the uncertain footing in an attempt to locate an exit al he found was asmall thick hatchway which he grunted and heaved to pry open the hatchcoverrefused to budge 
 the garbage chute was a wonderful idea he told the princess the sweat from his forehead what an incredible smell we ride out here on a drifting odor and there seem to beany other exit unless i can get this hatch open 
 stepping back he pulled his pistol and fired at the cover the bolt promptlywent howling around the room as everyone sought cover in the garbage a lastglance and the bolt detonated almost on top of them 
 looking less dignified by the moment leia was the first to emerge from thepungent cover put that thing away she told solo grimly or going to getus all killed 
 yes your worship solo muttered in snide supplication he made no moveto reholster his weapon as he glanced back up toward the open chute above take long for them to figure out what happened to us we had things wellunder you led us down here 
 sure you did she shot back brushing refuse from her hair and well it could be worse 
 as if in reply a piercing horrible moaning filled the room it seemed to comefrom somewhere beneath them chewbacca let out a terrified yowl of his own andtried to flatten himself against a wall luke drew his own pistol and peered hard atvarious clumps of debris but saw nothing 
 what was that solo asked 
 not too sure luke suddenly jumped looking down and behind just moved past me i think watch out 
 with shocking suddenness luke disappeared straight down into the garbage 
 got luke the princess shouted it took him under solo lookedaround frantically for something to shoot at 
 as abruptly as he had vanished luke so did part of somethingelse a thick whitish tentacle was wrapped tight around his throat 
 shoot it kill it luke screamed 
 shoot it i even see it solo protested 
 once again luke was sucked under by whatever that gruesome appendage wasattached to solo stared helplessly around the multicolored surface 
 there was a distant rumble of heavy machinery and two opposing walls of thechamber moved inward several centimeters the rumble ceased and then it wasquiet again luke appeared unexpectedly close to solo scrabbling his way clear ofthe suffocating mess and rubbing at the welt on his neck 
 what happened to it leia wondered eyeing the quiescent garbage warily 
 luke looked genuinely puzzled i know it had then i wasfree it just let me go and disappeared maybe i smell bad enough for it 
 got a very bad feeling about this solo murmured 
 again the distant rumble filled the room again the walls began their inwardmarch only this time neither sound nor movement showed any sign of stopping 
 just stand there gaping at each other the princess urged them try tobrace them with something 
 even with the thick poles and old metal beams chewbacca could handle theywere unable to find anything capable of slowing the walls advance it seemed as ifthe stronger the object was that they placed against the walls the easier it wassnapped luke pulled out his comlink simultaneously trying to talk and will thewalls to retreat threepiocome in threepio a decent paused produced noresponse causing luke to look worriedly at his companions 
 i know why he answer he tried again see threepio comein do you read 
 see threepio the muted voice continued to call come in see threepio itwas voice and it issued softly in between buzzings from the small handcomlink resting on the deserted computer console save for the intermittent gantry office was silent 
 a tremendous explosion drowned out the muffled pleadings it blew the officedoor clean across the room sending metal fragments flying in all directions severalof them struck the comlink sending it flying to the floor and cutting off voicein midtransmission 
 in the wake of the minor cataclysm four armed and ready troopers enteredthrough the blown portal initial study indicated the office was adim frightened voice was heard coming from one of the tall supply cabinets near theback of the room 
 help help let us out 
 several of the troopers bent to inspect the immobile bodies of the gantry officerand his aide while others opened the noisy cabinet two robots one tall andhumanoid the other purely mechanical and stepped out into the taller one gave the impression of being half unbalanced with fear 
 madmen i tell you madmen he gestured urgently toward thedoorway i think they said something about heading for the prison level theyjust left if you hurry you might catch them that way that way 
 two of the troopers inside joined those waiting in the hallway in hustling offdown the corridor that left two guards to watch over the office they totallyignored the robots as they discussed what might have taken place 
 all the excitement has overloaded the circuitry in my companion explained carefully if you mind like to take him down tomaintenance 
 hmmm one of the guards looked up indifferently and nodded to the and artoo hurried out the door without looking back as they departed itoccurred to the guard that the taller of the two droids was of a type he had never seenbefore he shrugged that was not surprising on a station of this size 
 that was too close threepio muttered as they scurried down an emptycorridor now have to find another console and plug youback in or everything is lost 
 the garbage chamber grew remorselessly smaller the smoothly fitting metalwalls moving toward one another with stolid precision larger pieces of refuseperformed a concerto of snapping and popping that was rising toward a finalshuddering crescendo 
 chewbacca whined pitifully as he fought with all his incredible strength andweight to hold back one of the walls looking like a hirsute tantalus approaching hisfinal summit 
 one for sure solo noted unhappily all going to be muchthinner this could prove popular for slimming the only trouble is itspermanence 
 luke paused for breath shaking the innocent comlink angrily what couldhave happened to threepio 
 try the hatch again advised leia our only hope 
 solo shielded his eyes and did so the ineffectual blast echoed mockinglythrough the narrowing chamber

 a new hope 
 ix 
 
 as they traveled father and deeper into the bowels of the gigantic station they foundit increasingly difficult to maintain an air of casual indifference fortunately thosewho might have sensed some nervousness on the part of the two armored trooperswould regard it as only natural considering their huge dangerous wookie also made it impossible for the two young men to be as inconspicuous asthey would have liked 
 the farther they traveled the heavier the traffic became other technicians and mechanicals bustled around them intent on their ownassignments they ignored the trio completely only a few of the humans sparing thewookie a curious glance morose expression and the seemingconfidence of his captors reassured the inquisitive 
 eventually they reached a wide bank of elevators luke breathed a sigh ofrelief the transport ought to be capable of taking them justabout anywhere on the station in response to a verbal command 
 there was a nervous second when a minor official raced to get aboard sologestured sharply and the other without voicing a protest shifted to the next elevatortube in line 
 luke studied the operating panel then tried to sound at once knowledgeable andimportant as he spoke into the pickup grid instead he sounded nervous and the elevator was a mechanism not programmed to differentiate theappropriateness of emotions conveyed vocally so the door slid shut and they wereon their way after what felt like hours but was in reality only minutes the dooropened and they stepped out into the security area 
 it had been hope they would discover something like the cells of the kind used on tatooine in towns like mos eisley instead they sawonly narrow ramps bordering a bottomless ventilation shaft these levels of them ran parallel to smooth curving walls which held facelessdetention cells guards and energy gates seemed to be everywherethey looked 
 uncomfortably aware that the longer they stood frozen in place the soonersomeone was bound to come over and ask unanswerable questions luke searchedfrantically for a course of action 
 this going to work solo whispered leaning toward him 
 why you say so before a frustrated frightened luke shot back 
 i think i did i 
 shssh 
 solo shuts up worst fears were realized a tall officerapproached them he frowned as he examined the silent chewbacca 
 where are you two going with 
 chewbacca snarled at the remark and solo quieted him with a hasty jab in theribs a panicky luke found himself replying almost instinctively prisonertransfer from block ts 
 the officer looked puzzled i notified have to clear it 
 turning the man walked to a small console nearby and began entering hisrequest luke and han hurriedly surveyed the situation their gaze traveling fromalarms energy gates and remote photosensors to the three other guards station in thearea 
 solo nodded to luke as he unfastened cuffs then he whisperedsomething to the wookie an howl shook the corridor as chewbaccathrew up both hands grabbing rifle from him 
 look out a seemingly terrified solo shouted loose rip us allapart 
 both he and luke had darted clear of the rampaging wookie pulled out theirpistols and were blasting away at him their reaction was excellent theirenthusiasm undeniable and their aim execrable not a single shot came close to thedodging wookie instead they blasted automatic cameras controls andthe three dumbfounded guards 
 at this point it occurred to the officer in charge that the abominable aim of thetwo soldiers was a bit too selectively efficient he was preparing to jab the generalalarm when a burst from pistol caught him in the midsection and he fellwithout a word to the gray deck 
 solo rushed to the open comlink speaker which was screeching anxiousquestions about what was going on apparently there were audio as well as visuallinks between this detention station and elsewhere 
 ignoring the barrage of alternate threats and queries he checked the readout setin the panel nearby got to find out which cell this princess of yours is must a dozen levels it is cell go and them here 
 luke nodded once and was racing down the narrow walkway 
 after gesturing for the wookie to take up a position where he could cover theelevators solo took a deep breath and responded to the unceasing calls from thecomlink 
 under control he said into the pickup sounding reasonablyofficial situation normal 
 it sound like that a voice snapped back in a tone whathappened 
 uh well one of the guards experienced a weapon malfunction solostammered his temporary officialese lapsing into nervousness no problem all fine thanks how about you 
 sending a squad up the voice announced suddenly 
 han could almost smell the suspicion at the other end what to say hespoke more eloquently with the business end of a pistol 
 we have an energy dangerous 
 weapon malfunction energy leakwho is this your operating 
 pointing his pistol at the panels solo blew the instrumentation to silent was a dumb conversation anyway he murmured turning he shouted down thecorridor hurry it up luke going to have company 
 luke heard but he was absorbed in running from one cell to the next andstudying the numbers glowing above each doorway the cell it appeared didnot exist but it did and he found it just as he was about to give up and try the nextlevel down 
 for a long moment he examined the featureless convex metal wall turning hispistol to maximum and hoping it melt in his hand before it broke through heopened fire on the door when the weapon became too hot to hold he tossed it fromhand to hand as he did so the smoke had time to clear and he saw with somesurprise that the door had been blown away 
 peering through the smoke with an uncomprehending look on her face was theyoung woman whose portrait artoo detoo had projected in a garage on tatooineseveral centuries ago or it seemed 
 she was even more beautiful than her image luke decided staring dazedly ather i 
 her look of confusion and uncertainty was replaced by first puzzlement and thenimpatience you a littler short for a storm trooper she finally commented 
 what uniform he removed the helmet regaining a littlecomposure at the same time come to rescue you luke skywalker 
 i beg your pardon she said politely 
 i said come to rescue you ben kenobi is with me got yourtwo droids 
 the uncertainty was instantly replaced by hope at the mention of the ben kenobi she looked around luke ignoring him as she searched forthe jedi where is he 
 governor tarkin watched as darth vader paced rapidly back and forth in theotherwise empty conference room finally the dark lord paused glancing aroundas though a great bell only he could hear had rung somewhere close by 
 he is here vader stated unemotionally 
 tarkin looked startled kenobi impossible what makesyou think so 
 a stirring in the force of a kind felt only in the presence of my old is unmistakable 
 he must be dead by now 
 vader hesitated his assurance suddenly gone perhapsit is gone now itwas only a brief sensation 
 the jedi are extinct declared tarkin positively their fire was quencheddecades ago you my friend are all left of their ways 
 a comlink buzzed softly for attention yes tarkin acknowledged 
 we have an emergency alert in detention block aa 
 the princess tarkin yelped jumping to his feet vader whirled trying tostare through the walls 
 i know is here i knew i could not mistake a stirring in the forceof such power 
 put all sections on alert tarkin ordered through the comlink then he turnedto stare at vader if right he must not be allowed to escape 
 escape may not be intention vader replied struggling tocontrol his emotions he is the last of the the greatest the danger hepresents to us must not be only i can deal with him his headsnapped around to stare fixedly at tarkin alone 
 luke and leia had started back up the corridor when a series of blindingexplosion ripped the walkway ahead of them several troopers had tried comingthrough the elevator only to be crisped one after another by chewbacca disdainingthe elevators they had blasted a gaping hole through a wall the opening was toolarge for solo and the wookie to cover completely in twos and threes the imperialswere working their way into the detention block 
 retreating down the walkway han and chewbacca encountered luke and theprincess we go back that way solo told them his face flushed withexcitement and worry 
 no it looks like managed to cut off our only escape route leia agreedreadily this is a detention area you know they build them with multipleexits 
 breathing heavily solo turned to look her up and down begging yourforgiveness your highness he said sarcastically but maybe prefer it back inyour cell she looked away her face impassive 
 got to be another way out luke muttered pulling a small transmitterunit from his belt and carefully adjusting the frequency see threepioseethreepio 
 a familiar voice responded with gratifying speed yes sir 
 been cut off here are there any other ways out of the detention at all 
 static crackled over the tiny grid as solo and chewbacca kept the imperial troopsbottled up at the other end of the walkway 
 what was that i copy 
 back in the gentry office artoo detoo beeped and whistled frantically asthreepio adjusted controls fighting to clear the awkward transmission i said allsystems have been alerted to your presence sir the main entry seems to be the onlyway in or out of the cell block he pressed instruments and the view on the nearbyreadouts changed steadily all other information on your section is restricted 
 someone began banging on the locked door to the at first andthen when no response was forthcoming from within more insistently 
 oh no threepio groaned 
 the smoke in the cell corridor was now so intense that it was difficult for soloand chewbacca to pick their targets that was fortunate inasmuch as they were nowbadly outnumbered and the smoke confused the imperials fire with equalthoroughness 
 every so often one of the soldiers would attempt to move closer only to standexposed as he penetrated the smoke under the accurate fire of the two would rapidly join the accumulating mass of motionless figures on the rampwayflooring 
 energy bolts continued to ricochet wildly through the block as luke moved closeto solo 
 there other way out he yelled over the deafening roar of concentratedfire 
 well closing in on us what do we do now 
 this is some rescue an irritated voice complained from behind them bothmen turned to see a thoroughly disgusted princess eyeing them with regal you came in here you have a plan of getting out 
 solo nodded toward luke the brains sweetheart 
 luke managed an embarrassed grin and shrugged helplessly he turned to helpreturn fire but before he could do so the princess had snatched the pistol from hishand 
 hey 
 luke stared as she moved along the wall finally locating a small grate pointed the pistol at it and fired 
 solo gazed at her in disbelief what do you think doing 
 it looks like up to me to save our skins get into the garbage 
 while the others looked on in amazement she jumped feet first into the openingand disappeared chewbacca rumbled threateningly but solo slowly shook his head 
 no chewie i want you to rip her apart not sure about her beginning to like her or going to kill her myself the wookiesnorted something else and solo yelled back at him go on in you furry oaf care what you smell this is no time to go dainty on me 
 shoving the reluctant wookie toward the tiny opening solo helped jam themassive bulk through as soon as he disappeared the corellian followed him fired off the last series of blasts more in the hope of creating a covering smokethan hitting anything slid into the chute and was gone 
 not wanting to incur further losses in such a confined space the pursuingsoldiers had momentarily halted to await the arrival of reinforcements and heavierweapons besides they had their quarry trapped and despite their dedication noneof them were anxious to die needlessly 
 the chamber luke tumbled into was dimly lit not that the light was needed todiscern its contents he smelled the decay long before he was dumped into except for the concealed illuminants the garbage room was at least aquarter full of slimy muck much of which had already achieved a state ofdecomposition sufficient to wrinkle nose 
 solo was stumbling around the edge of the room slipping and sinking up to hisknees in the uncertain footing in an attempt to locate an exit al he found was asmall thick hatchway which he grunted and heaved to pry open the hatchcoverrefused to budge 
 the garbage chute was a wonderful idea he told the princess the sweat from his forehead what an incredible smell we ride out here on a drifting odor and there seem to beany other exit unless i can get this hatch open 
 stepping back he pulled his pistol and fired at the cover the bolt promptlywent howling around the room as everyone sought cover in the garbage a lastglance and the bolt detonated almost on top of them 
 looking less dignified by the moment leia was the first to emerge from thepungent cover put that thing away she told solo grimly or going to getus all killed 
 yes your worship solo muttered in snide supplication he made no moveto reholster his weapon as he glanced back up toward the open chute above take long for them to figure out what happened to us we had things wellunder you led us down here 
 sure you did she shot back brushing refuse from her hair and well it could be worse 
 as if in reply a piercing horrible moaning filled the room it seemed to comefrom somewhere beneath them chewbacca let out a terrified yowl of his own andtried to flatten himself against a wall luke drew his own pistol and peered hard atvarious clumps of debris but saw nothing 
 what was that solo asked 
 not too sure luke suddenly jumped looking down and behind just moved past me i think watch out 
 with shocking suddenness luke disappeared straight down into the garbage 
 got luke the princess shouted it took him under solo lookedaround frantically for something to shoot at 
 as abruptly as he had vanished luke so did part of somethingelse a thick whitish tentacle was wrapped tight around his throat 
 shoot it kill it luke screamed 
 shoot it i even see it solo protested 
 once again luke was sucked under by whatever that gruesome appendage wasattached to solo stared helplessly around the multicolored surface 
 there was a distant rumble of heavy machinery and two opposing walls of thechamber moved inward several centimeters the rumble ceased and then it wasquiet again luke appeared unexpectedly close to solo scrabbling his way clear ofthe suffocating mess and rubbing at the welt on his neck 
 what happened to it leia wondered eyeing the quiescent garbage warily 
 luke looked genuinely puzzled i know it had then i wasfree it just let me go and disappeared maybe i smell bad enough for it 
 got a very bad feeling about this solo murmured 
 again the distant rumble filled the room again the walls began their inwardmarch only this time neither sound nor movement showed any sign of stopping 
 just stand there gaping at each other the princess urged them try tobrace them with something 
 even with the thick poles and old metal beams chewbacca could handle theywere unable to find anything capable of slowing the walls advance it seemed as ifthe stronger the object was that they placed against the walls the easier it wassnapped luke pulled out his comlink simultaneously trying to talk and will thewalls to retreat threepiocome in threepio a decent paused produced noresponse causing luke to look worriedly at his companions 
 i know why he answer he tried again see threepio comein do you read 
 see threepio the muted voice continued to call come in see threepio itwas voice and it issued softly in between buzzings from the small handcomlink resting on the deserted computer console save for the intermittent gantry office was silent 
 a tremendous explosion drowned out the muffled pleadings it blew the officedoor clean across the room sending metal fragments flying in all directions severalof them struck the comlink sending it flying to the floor and cutting off voicein midtransmission 
 in the wake of the minor cataclysm four armed and ready troopers enteredthrough the blown portal initial study indicated the office was adim frightened voice was heard coming from one of the tall supply cabinets near theback of the room 
 help help let us out 
 several of the troopers bent to inspect the immobile bodies of the gantry officerand his aide while others opened the noisy cabinet two robots one tall andhumanoid the other purely mechanical and stepped out into the taller one gave the impression of being half unbalanced with fear 
 madmen i tell you madmen he gestured urgently toward thedoorway i think they said something about heading for the prison level theyjust left if you hurry you might catch them that way that way 
 two of the troopers inside joined those waiting in the hallway in hustling offdown the corridor that left two guards to watch over the office they totallyignored the robots as they discussed what might have taken place 
 all the excitement has overloaded the circuitry in my companion explained carefully if you mind like to take him down tomaintenance 
 hmmm one of the guards looked up indifferently and nodded to the and artoo hurried out the door without looking back as they departed itoccurred to the guard that the taller of the two droids was of a type he had never seenbefore he shrugged that was not surprising on a station of this size 
 that was too close threepio muttered as they scurried down an emptycorridor now have to find another console and plug youback in or everything is lost 
 the garbage chamber grew remorselessly smaller the smoothly fitting metalwalls moving toward one another with stolid precision larger pieces of refuseperformed a concerto of snapping and popping that was rising toward a finalshuddering crescendo 
 chewbacca whined pitifully as he fought with all his incredible strength andweight to hold back one of the walls looking like a hirsute tantalus approaching hisfinal summit 
 one for sure solo noted unhappily all going to be muchthinner this could prove popular for slimming the only trouble is itspermanence 
 luke paused for breath shaking the innocent comlink angrily what couldhave happened to threepio 
 try the hatch again advised leia our only hope 
 solo shielded his eyes and did so the ineffectual blast echoed mockinglythrough the narrowing chamber 
 the service bay was unoccupied everyone apparently having been drawn awayby the commotion elsewhere after a cautious survey of the room threepiobeckoned for artoo to follow together they commenced a hurried search of themany service panels artoo let out a beep and threepio rushed to him he waitedimpatiently as the smaller unit plugged the receptive arm carefully into the opensocket 
 a superfast flurry of electronics spewed in undisciplined fashion from the grid ofthe little droid threepio made cautioning motions 
 wait a minute slow down the sounds dropped to a crawl where they what oh no only come out of there as liquid 
 less than a meter of life was left to the trapped occupants of the garbage and solo had been forced to turn sideways had ended up facing each other forthe first time the haughtiness was gone from the face reaching out shetook hand clutching it convulsively as she felt the first touch of the closingwalls 
 luke had fallen and was lying on his side fighting to keep his head above therising ooze he nearly choked on a mouthful of compressed sludge when hiscomlink began buzzing for attention 
 threepio 
 are you there sir the droid replied had some minor would not believe 
 shut up threepio luke screamed into the unit and shut down all therefuse units on the detention level or immediately below it do you copy shutdown the refuse 
 moments later threepio grabbed at his head in pain as a terrific screeching andyelling sounded over the comlink

 prince vasili kept the promise he had given to princess drubetskaya who had spoken to him on behalf of her only son boris on the evening of anna soiree the matter was mentioned to the emperor an exception made and boris transferred into the regiment of semenov guards with the rank of cornet he received however no appointment to staff despite all anna endeavors and entreaties soon after anna reception anna mikhaylovna returned to moscow and went straight to her rich relations the rostovs with whom she stayed when in the town and where and where her darling bory who had only just entered a regiment of the line and was being at once transferred to the guards as a cornet had been educated from childhood and lived for years at a time the guards had already left petersburg on the tenth of august and her son who had remained in moscow for his equipment was to join them on the march to radzivilov 
 it was st day and the name day of two of the rostovs the mother and the youngest daughter both named nataly ever since the morning carriages with six horses had been coming and going continually bringing visitors to the countess big house on the povarskaya so well known to all moscow the countess herself and her handsome eldest daughter were in the with the visitors who came to congratulate and who constantly succeeded one another in relays 
 the countess was a woman of about with a thin oriental type of face evidently worn out with childbearing she had had twelve a languor of motion and speech resulting from weakness gave her a distinguished air which inspired respect princess anna mikhaylovna drubetskaya who as a member of the household was also seated in the drawing room helped to receive and entertain the visitors the young people were in one of the inner rooms not considering it necessary to take part in receiving the visitors the count met the guests and saw them off inviting them all to dinner 
 i am very very grateful to you mon cher or ma chere he called everyone without exception and without the slightest variation in his tone my dear whether they were above or below him in rank i thank you for myself and for our two dear ones whose name day we are keeping but mind you come to dinner or i shall be offended ma chere on behalf of the whole family i beg you to come mon cher these words he repeated to everyone without exception or variation and with the same expression on his full cheerful face the same firm pressure of the hand and the same quick repeated bows as soon as he had seen a visitor off he returned to one of those who were still in the drawing room drew a chair toward him or her and jauntily spreading out his legs and putting his hands on his knees with the air of a man who enjoys life and knows how to live he swayed to and fro with dignity offered surmises about the weather or touched on questions of health sometimes in russian and sometimes in very bad but french then again like a man weary but unflinching in the fulfillment of duty he rose to see some visitors off and stroking his scanty gray hairs over his bald patch also asked them to dinner sometimes on his way back from the anteroom he would pass through the conservatory and pantry into the large marble dining hall where tables were being set out for eighty people and looking at the footmen who were bringing in silver and china moving tables and unfolding damask table linen he would call dmitri vasilevich a man of good family and the manager of all his affairs and while looking with pleasure at the enormous table would say well dmitri see that things are all as they should be right the great thing is the serving it and with a complacent sigh he would return to the drawing room 
 marya lvovna karagina and her daughter announced the countess gigantic footman in his bass voice entering the drawing room the countess reflected a moment and took a pinch from a gold snuffbox with her portrait on it 
 quite worn out by these callers however see her and no more she is so affected ask her in she said to the footman in a sad voice as if saying very well finish me off 
 a tall stout and woman with a smiling daughter entered the drawing room their dresses rustling 
 dear countess what an age she has been laid up poor child at the ball and countess apraksina i was so delighted came the sounds of animated feminine voices interrupting one another and mingling with the rustling of dresses and the scraping of chairs then one of those conversations began which last out until at the first pause the guests rise with a rustle of dresses and say i am so delighted health and countess apraksina and then again rustling pass into the anteroom put on cloaks or mantles and drive away the conversation was on the chief topic of the day the illness of the wealthy and celebrated beau of day count bezukhov and about his illegitimate son pierre the one who had behaved so improperly at anna reception 
 i am so sorry for the poor count said the visitor he is in such bad health and now this vexation about his son is enough to kill him 
 what is that asked the countess as if she did not know what the visitor alluded to though she had already heard about the cause of count distress some fifteen times 
 what comes of a modern education exclaimed the visitor it seems that while he was abroad this young man was allowed to do as he liked now in petersburg i hear he has been doing such terrible things that he has been expelled by the police 
 you say so replied the countess 
 he chose his friends badly interposed anna mikhaylovna prince son he and a certain dolokhov have it is said been up to heaven only knows what and they have had to suffer for it dolokhov has been degraded to the ranks and son sent back to moscow anatole father managed somehow to get his affair hushed up but even he was ordered out of petersburg 
 but what have they been up to asked the countess 
 they are regular brigands especially dolokhov replied the visitor he is a son of marya ivanovna dolokhova such a worthy woman but there just fancy those three got hold of a bear somewhere put it in a carriage and set off with it to visit some actresses the police tried to interfere and what did the young men do they tied a policeman and the bear back to back and put the bear into the moyka canal and there was the bear swimming about with the policeman on his back 
 what a nice figure the policeman must have cut my dear shouted the count dying with laughter 
 oh how dreadful how can you laugh at it count 
 yet the ladies themselves could not help laughing 
 it was all they could do to rescue the poor man continued the visitor and to think it is cyril vladimirovich son who amuses himself in this sensible manner and he was said to be so well educated and clever this is all that his foreign education has done for him i hope that here in moscow no one will receive him in spite of his money they wanted to introduce him to me but i quite declined i have my daughters to consider 
 why do you say this young man is so rich asked the countess turning away from the girls who at once assumed an air of inattention his children are all illegitimate i think pierre also is illegitimate 
 the visitor made a gesture with her hand 
 i should think he has a score of them 
 princess anna mikhaylovna intervened in the conversation evidently wishing to show her connections and knowledge of what went on in society 
 the fact of the matter is said she significantly and also in a half whisper everyone knows count reputation he has lost count of his children but this pierre was his favorite 
 how handsome the old man still was only a year ago remarked the countess i have never seen a handsomer man 
 he is very much altered now said anna mikhaylovna well as i was saying prince vasili is the next heir through his wife but the count is very fond of pierre looked after his education and wrote to the emperor about him so that in the case of his death and he is so ill that he may die at any moment and dr lorrain has come from petersburg no one knows who will inherit his immense fortune pierre or prince vasili forty thousand serfs and millions of rubles i know it all very well for prince vasili told me himself besides cyril vladimirovich is my second cousin also my godfather she added as if she attached no importance at all to the fact 
 prince vasili arrived in moscow yesterday i hear he has come on some inspection business remarked the visitor 
 yes but between ourselves said the princess that is a pretext the fact is he has come to see count cyril vladimirovich hearing how ill he is 
 but do you know my dear that was a capital joke said the count and seeing that the elder visitor was not listening he turned to the young ladies i can just imagine what a funny figure that policeman cut 
 and as he waved his arms to impersonate the policeman his portly form again shook with a deep ringing laugh the laugh of one who always eats well and in particular drinks well so do come and dine with us he said

 they are regular brigands especially dolokhov replied the visitor he is a son of marya ivanovna dolokhova such a worthy woman but there just fancy those three got hold of a bear somewhere put it in a carriage and set off with it to visit some actresses the police tried to interfere and what did the young men do they tied a policeman and the bear back to back and put the bear into the moyka canal and there was the bear swimming about with the policeman on his back 
 what a nice figure the policeman must have cut my dear shouted the count dying with laughter 
 oh how dreadful how can you laugh at it count 
 yet the ladies themselves could not help laughing 
 it was all they could do to rescue the poor man continued the visitor and to think it is cyril vladimirovich son who amuses himself in this sensible manner and he was said to be so well educated and clever this is all that his foreign education has done for him i hope that here in moscow no one will receive him in spite of his money they wanted to introduce him to me but i quite declined i have my daughters to consider 
 why do you say this young man is so rich asked the countess turning away from the girls who at once assumed an air of inattention his children are all illegitimate i think pierre also is illegitimate 
 the visitor made a gesture with her hand 
 i should think he has a score of them 
 princess anna mikhaylovna intervened in the conversation evidently wishing to show her connections and knowledge of what went on in society 
 the fact of the matter is said she significantly and also in a half whisper everyone knows count reputation he has lost count of his children but this pierre was his favorite 
 how handsome the old man still was only a year ago remarked the countess i have never seen a handsomer man 
 he is very much altered now said anna mikhaylovna well as i was saying prince vasili is the next heir through his wife but the count is very fond of pierre looked after his education and wrote to the emperor about him so that in the case of his death and he is so ill that he may die at any moment and dr lorrain has come from petersburg no one knows who will inherit his immense fortune pierre or prince vasili forty thousand serfs and millions of rubles i know it all very well for prince vasili told me himself besides cyril vladimirovich is my second cousin also my godfather she added as if she attached no importance at all to the fact 
 prince vasili arrived in moscow yesterday i hear he has come on some inspection business remarked the visitor 
 yes but between ourselves said the princess that is a pretext the fact is he has come to see count cyril vladimirovich hearing how ill he is 
 but do you know my dear that was a capital joke said the count and seeing that the elder visitor was not listening he turned to the young ladies i can just imagine what a funny figure that policeman cut 
 and as he waved his arms to impersonate the policeman his portly form again shook with a deep ringing laugh the laugh of one who always eats well and in particular drinks well so do come and dine with us he said

 chapter 
 
 a charming introduction to a life four weeks torture tossing and sickness oh these bleak winds and bitter northern skies and impassable roads and dilatory country surgeons and oh this dearth of the human physiognomy and worse than all the terrible intimation of kenneth that i need not expect to be out of doors till spring 
 mr heathcliff has just honoured me with a calls about seven days ago he sent me a brace of last of the season scoundrel he is not altogether guiltless in this illness of mine and that i had a great mind to tell him but alas how could i offend a man who was charitable enough to sit at my bedside a good hour and talk on some other subject than pills and draughts blisters and leeches this is quite an easy interval i am too weak to read yet i feel as if i could enjoy something interesting why not have up mrs dean to finish her tale i can recollect its chief incidents as far as she had gone yes i remember her hero had run off and never been heard of for three years and the heroine was married ring be delighted to find me capable of talking cheerfully mrs dean came 
 it wants twenty minutes sir to taking the medicine she commenced 
 away away with it i replied i desire to have 
 the doctor says you must drop the powders 
 with all my heart interrupt me come and take your seat here keep your fingers from that bitter phalanx of vials draw your knitting out of your will continue the history of mr heathcliff from where you left off to the present day did he finish his education on the continent and come back a gentleman or did he get a place at college or escape to america and earn honours by drawing blood from his or make a fortune more promptly on the english highways 
 he may have done a little in all these vocations mr lockwood but i give my word for any i stated before that i know how he gained his money neither am i aware of the means he took to raise his mind from the savage ignorance into which it was sunk but with your leave proceed in my own fashion if you think it will amuse and not weary you are you feeling better this morning 
 much 
 good news i got miss catherine and myself to thrushcross grange and to my agreeable disappointment she behaved infinitely better than i dared expect she seemed almost over fond of mr linton and even to his sister she showed plenty of affection they were both very attentive to her comfort certainly it was not the thorn bending to the honeysuckles but the honeysuckles embracing the thorn there were no mutual concessions one stood erect and the others yielded and who can be and when they encounter neither opposition nor indifference i observed that mr edgar had a deeprooted fear of ruffling her humour he concealed it from her but if ever he heard me answer sharply or saw any other servant grow cloudy at some imperious order of hers he would show his trouble by a frown of displeasure that never darkened on his own account he many a time spoke sternly to me about my pertness and averred that the stab of a knife could not inflict a worse pang than he suffered at seeing his lady vexed not to grieve a kind master i learned to be less touchy and for the space of half a year the gunpowder lay as harmless as sand because no fire came near to explode it catherine had seasons of gloom and silence now and then they were respected with sympathizing silence by her husband who ascribed them to an alteration in her constitution produced by her perilous illness as she was never subject to depression of spirits before the return of sunshine was welcomed by answering sunshine from him i believe i may assert that they were really in possession of deep and growing happiness 
 it ended well we must be for ourselves in the long run the mild and generous are only more justly selfish than the domineering and it ended when circumstances caused each to feel that the ones interest was not the chief consideration in the thoughts on a mellow evening in september i was coming from the garden with a heavy basket of apples which i had been gathering it had got dusk and the moon looked over the high wall of the court causing undefined shadows to lurk in the corners of the numerous projecting portions of the building i set my burden on the house steps by the kitchen door and lingered to rest and drew in a few more breaths of the soft sweet air my eyes were on the moon and my back to the entrance when i heard a voice behind me say 
 nelly is that you 
 it was a deep voice and foreign in tone yet there was something in the manner of pronouncing my name which made it sound familiar i turned about to discover who spoke fearfully for the doors were shut and i had seen nobody on approaching the steps something stirred in the porch and moving nearer i distinguished a tall man dressed in dark clothes with dark face and hair he leant against the side and held his fingers on the latch as if intending to open for himself who can it be i thought mr earnshaw oh no the voice has no resemblance to his 
 i have waited here an hour he resumed while i continued staring and the whole of that time all round has been as still as death i dared not enter you do not know me look not a stranger 
 a ray fell on his features the cheeks were sallow and half covered with black whiskers the brows lowering the eyes deep set and singular i remembered the eyes 
 what i cried uncertain whether to regard him as a worldly visitor and i raised my hands in amazement what you come back is it really you is it 
 yes heathcliff he replied glancing from me up to the windows which reflected a score of glittering moons but showed no lights from within are they at home where is she nelly you are not glad you be so disturbed is she here speak i want to have one word with mistress go and say some person from gimmerton desires to see her 
 how will she take it i exclaimed what will she do the surprise bewilders will put her out of her head and you are heathcliff but altered nay no comprehending it have you been for a soldier 
 go and carry my message he interrupted impatiently in hell till you do 
 he lifted the latch and i entered but when i got to the parlour where mr and mrs linton were i could not persuade myself to proceed at length i resolved on making an excuse to ask if they would have the candles lighted and i opened the door 
 they sat together in a window whose lattice lay back against the wall and displayed beyond the garden trees and the wild green park the valley of gimmerton with a long line of mist winding nearly to its top for very soon after you pass the chapel as you may have noticed the sough that runs from the marshes joins a beck which follows the bend of the glen wuthering heights rose above this silvery vapour but our old house was invisible it rather dips down on the other side both the room and its occupants and the scene they gazed on looked wondrously peaceful i shrank reluctantly from performing my errand and was actually going away leaving it unsaid after having put my question about the candles when a sense of my folly compelled me to return and person from gimmerton wishes to see you 
 what does he want asked mrs linton 
 i did not question him i answered 
 well close the curtains nelly she said and bring up tea be back again directly 
 she quitted the apartment mr edgar inquired carelessly who it was 
 someone mistress does not expect i replied that recollect him used to live at mr 
 what the ploughboy he cried why did you not say so to catherine 
 hush you must not call him by those names master i said be sadly grieved to hear you she was nearly heartbroken when he ran off i guess his return will make a jubilee to her 
 mr linton walked to a window on the other side of the room that overlooked the court he unfastened it and leant out i suppose they were below for he exclaimed stand there love bring the person in if it be anyone particular ere long i heard the click of the latch and catherine flew upstairs breathless and wild too excited to show gladness indeed by her face you would rather have surmised an awful calamity 
 oh edgar edgar she panted flinging her arms round his neck oh edgar darling come is and she tightened her embrace to a squeeze 
 well well cried her husband crossly strangle me for that he never struck me as such a marvellous treasure there is no need to be frantic 
 i know you like him she answered repressing a little the intensity of her delight yet for my sake you must be friends now shall i tell him to come up 
 here he said into the parlour 
 where else she asked 
 he looked vexed and suggested the kitchen as a more suitable place for him mrs linton eyed him with a droll angry half laughing at his fastidiousness 
 no she added after a while i cannot sit in the kitchen set two tables here ellen one for your master and miss isabella being gentry the other for heathcliff and myself being of the lower orders will that please you dear or must i have a fire lighted elsewhere if so give directions run down and secure my guest afraid the joy is too great to be real 
 she was about to dart off again but edgar arrested her 
 you bid him step up he said addressing me and catherine try to be glad without being absurd the whole household need not witness the sight of your welcoming a runaway servant as a brother 
 i descended and found heathcliff waiting under the porch evidently anticipating an invitation to enter he followed my guidance without waste of words and i ushered him into the presence of the master and mistress whose flushed cheeks betrayed signs of warm talking but the glowed with another feeling when her friend appeared at the door she sprang forward took both his hands and led him to linton and then she seized reluctant fingers and crushed them into his now fully revealed by the fire and candlelight i was amazed more than ever to behold the transformation of heathcliff he had grown a tall athletic man beside whom my master seemed quite slender and his upright carriage suggested the idea of his having been in the army his countenance was much older in expression and decision of feature than mr it looked intelligent and retained no marks of former degradation a ferocity lurked yet in the depressed brows and eyes full of black fire but it was subdued and his manner was even dignified quite divested of roughness though too stern for grace my surprise equalled or exceeded mine he remained for a minute at a loss how to address the ploughboy as he had called him heathcliff dropped his slight hand and stood looking at him coolly till he chose to speak 
 sit down sir he said at length mrs linton recalling old times would have me give you a cordial reception and of course i am gratified when anything occurs to please her 
 and i also answered heathcliff especially if it be anything in which i have a part i shall stay an hour or two willingly 
 he took a seat opposite catherine who kept her gaze fixed on him as if she feared he would vanish were she to remove it he did not raise his to her often a quick glance now and then sufficed but it flashed back each time more confidently the undisguised delight he drank from hers they were too much absorbed in their mutual joy to suffer embarrassment not so mr edgar he grew pale with pure annoyance a feeling that reached its climax when his lady rose and stepping across the rug seized hands again and laughed like one beside herself 
 i shall think it a dream tomorrow she cried i shall not be able to believe that i have seen and touched and spoken to you once more and yet cruel heathcliff you deserve this welcome to be absent and silent for three years and never to think of me 
 a little more than you have thought of me he murmured i heard of your marriage cathy not long since and while waiting in the yard below i meditated this to have one glimpse of your face a stare of surprise perhaps and pretended pleasure afterwards settle my score with hindley and then prevent the law by doing execution on myself your welcome has put these ideas out of my mind but beware of meeting me with another aspect next time nay not drive me off again you were really sorry for me were you well there was cause fought through a bitter life since i last heard your voice and you must forgive me for i struggled only for you 
 catherine unless we are to have cold tea please to come to the table interrupted linton striving to preserve his ordinary tone and a due measure of politeness mr heathcliff will have a long walk wherever he may lodge tonight and thirsty 
 she took her post before the urn and miss isabella came summoned by the bell then having handed their chairs forward i left the room the meal hardly endured ten minutes cup was never filled she could neither eat nor drink edgar had made a slop in his saucer and scarcely swallowed a mouthful their guest did not protract his stay that evening above an hour longer i asked as he departed if he went to gimmerton 
 no to wuthering heights he answered mr earnshaw invited me when i called this morning 
 mr earnshaw invited him and he called on mr earnshaw i pondered this sentence painfully after he was gone is he turning out a bit of a hypocrite and coming into the country to work mischief under a cloak i mused i had a presentiment in the bottom of my heart that he had better have remained away 
 about the middle of the night i was wakened from my first nap by mrs linton gliding into my chamber taking a seat on my bedside and pulling me by the hair to rouse me 
 i cannot rest ellen she said by way of apology and i want some living creature to keep me company in my happiness edgar is sulky because glad of a thing that does not interest him he refuses to open his mouth except to utter pettish silly speeches and he affirmed i was cruel and selfish for wishing to talk when he was so sick and sleepy he always contrives to be sick at the least cross i gave a few sentences of commendation to heathcliff and he either for a headache or a pang of envy began to cry so i got up and left him 
 what use is it praising heathcliff to him i answered as lads they had an aversion to each other and heathcliff would hate just as much to hear him praised human nature let mr linton alone about him unless you would like an open quarrel between them 
 but does it not show great weakness pursued she not envious i never feel hurt at the brightness of yellow hair and the whiteness of her skin at her dainty elegance and the fondness all the family exhibit for her even you nelly if we have a dispute sometimes you back isabella at once and i yield like a foolish mother i call her a darling and flatter her into a good temper it pleases her brother to see us cordial and that pleases me but they are very much alike they are spoiled children and fancy the world was made for their accommodation and though i humour both i think a smart chastisement might improve them all the same 
 mistaken mrs linton said i they humour you i know what there would be to do if they did not you can well afford to indulge their passing whims as long as their business is to anticipate all your desires you may however fall out at last over something of equal consequence to both sides and then those you term weak are very capable of being as obstinate as you 
 and then we shall fight to the death we nelly she returned laughing no i tell you i have such faith in love that i believe i might kill him and he wish to retaliate 
 i advised her to value him the more for his affection 
 i do she answered but he resort to whining for trifles it is childish and instead of melting into tears because i said that heathcliff was now worthy of regard and it would honour the first gentleman in the country to be his friend he ought to have said it for me and been delighted from sympathy he must get accustomed to him and he may as well like him considering how heathcliff has reason to object to him sure he behaved excellently 
 what do you think of his going to wuthering heights i inquired he is reformed in every respect apparently quite a christian offering the right hand of fellowship to his enemies all around 
 he explained it she replied i wondered as much as you he said he called to gather information concerning me from you supposing you resided there still and joseph told hindley who came out and fell to questioning him of what he had been doing and how he had been living and finally desired him to walk in there were some persons sitting at cards heathcliff joined them my brother lost some money to him and finding him plentifully supplied he requested that he would come again in the evening to which he consented hindley is too reckless to select his acquaintance prudently he trouble himself to reflect on the causes he might have for mistrusting one whom he has basely injured but heathcliff affirms his principal reason for resuming a connection with his ancient persecutor is a wish to install himself in quarters at walking distance from the grange and an attachment to the house where we lived together and likewise a hope that i shall have more opportunities of seeing him there than i could have if he settled in gimmerton he means to offer liberal payment for permission to lodge at the heights and doubtless my covetousness will prompt him to accept the terms he was always greedy though what he grasps with one hand he flings away with the other 
 a nice place for a young man to fix his dwelling in said i have you no fear of the consequences mrs linton 
 none for my friend she replied his strong head will keep him from danger a little for hindley but he be made morally worse than he is and i stand between him and bodily harm the event of this evening has reconciled me to god and humanity i had risen in angry rebellion against providence oh endured very very bitter misery nelly if that creature knew how bitter be ashamed to cloud its removal with idle petulance it was kindness for him which induced me to bear it alone had i expressed the agony i frequently felt he would have been taught to long for its alleviation as ardently as l however over and take no revenge on his folly i can afford to suffer anything hereafter should the meanest thing alive slap me on the cheek not only turn the other but ask pardon for provoking it and as a proof go make my peace with edgar instantly good night an angel 
 in this conviction she departed and the success of her fulfilled resolution was obvious on the morrow mr linton had not only abjured his peevishness though his spirits seemed still subdued by exuberance of vivacity but he ventured no objection to her taking isabella with her to wuthering heights in the afternoon and she rewarded him with such a summer of sweetness and affection in return as made the house a paradise for several days both master and servants profiting from the perpetual sunshine 
 heathcliff i should say in the liberty of visiting at thrushcross grange cautiously at first he seemed estimating how far its owner would bear his intrusion catherine also deemed it judicious to moderate her expressions of pleasure in receiving him and he gradually established his right to be expected he retained a great deal of the reserve for which his boyhood was remarkable and that served to repress all startling demonstrations of feeling my uneasiness experienced a lull and further circumstances diverted it into another channel for a space 
 his new source of trouble sprang from the not anticipated misfortune of isabella linton evincing a sudden and irresistible attraction towards the tolerated guest she was at that time a charming young lady of eighteen infantile in manners though possessed of keen wit keen feelings and a keen temper too if irritated her brother who loved her tenderly was appalled at this fantastic preference leaving aside the degradation of an alliance with a nameless man and the possible fact that his property in default of heirs male might pass into such a power he had sense to comprehend disposition to know that though his exterior was altered his mind was unchangeable and unchanged and he dreaded that mind it revolted him he shrank forebodingly from the idea of committing isabella to his keeping he would have recoiled still more had he been aware that her attachment rose unsolicited and was bestowed where it awakened no reciprocation of sentiment for the minute he discovered its existence he laid the blame on deliberate designing 
 we had all remarked during some time that miss linton fretted and pined over something she grew cross and wearisome snapping at and teasing catherine continually at the imminent risk of exhausting her limited patience we excused her to a certain extent on the plea of she was dwindling and fading before our eyes but one day when she had been peculiarly wayward rejecting her breakfast complaining that the servants did not do what she told them that the mistress would allow her to be nothing in the house and edgar neglected her that she had caught a cold with the doors being left open and we let the parlour fire go out on purpose to vex her with a hundred yet more frivolous accusations mrs linton peremptorily insisted that she should get to bed and having scolded her heartily threatened to send for the doctor mention of kenneth caused her to exclaim instantly that her health was perfect and it was only harshness which made her unhappy 
 how can you say i am harsh you naughty fondling cried the mistress amazed at the unreasonable assertion you are surely losing your reason when have i been harsh tell me 
 yesterday sobbed isabella and now 
 yesterday said her on what occasion 
 in our walk along the moor you told me to ramble where i pleased while you sauntered on with mr heathcliff 
 and your notion of harshness said catherine laughing it was no hint that your company was superfluous we care whether you kept with us or not i merely thought heathcliffs talk would have nothing entertaining for your ears 
 oh no wept the young lady you wished me away because you knew i liked to be there 
 is she sane asked mrs linton appealing to me repeat our conversation word for word isabella and you point out any charm it could have had for you 
 i mind the conversation she answered i wanted to be with 
 well said catherine perceiving her hesitate to complete the sentence 
 with him and i be always sent off she continued kindling up you are a dog in the manger cathy and desire no one to be loved but yourself 
 you are an impertinent little monkey exclaimed mrs linton in surprise but not believe this idiocy it is impossible that you can covet the admiration of you consider him an agreeable person i hope i have misunderstood you isabella 
 no you have not said the infatuated girl i love him more than ever you loved edgar and he might love me if you would let him 
 i be you for a kingdom then catherine declared emphatically and she seemed to speak sincerely nelly help me to convince her of her madness tell her what heathcliff is an unreclaimed creature without refinement without cultivation an arid wilderness of furze and whinstone as soon put that little canary into the park on a day as recommend you to bestow your heart on him it is deplorable ignorance of his character child and nothing else which makes that dream enter your head pray imagine that he conceals depths of benevolence and affection beneath a stern exterior not a rough oyster of a rustic a fierce pitiless wolfish man i never say to him let this or that enemy alone because it would be ungenerous or cruel to harm them i say let them alone because i should hate them to be wronged and crush you like a egg isabella if he found you a troublesome charge i know he love a linton and yet be quite capable of marrying your fortune and expectations avarice is growing with him a besetting sin my picture and his much so that had he thought seriously to catch you i should perhaps have held my tongue and let you fall into his trap 
 miss linton regarded her with indignation 
 for shame for shame she repeated angrily you are worse than twenty foes you poisonous friend 
 ah you believe me then said catherine you think i speak from wicked selfishness 
 certain you do retorted isabella and i shudder at you 
 good cried the other try for yourself if that be your spirit i have done and yield the argument to your saucy insolence 
 and i must suffer for her egotism she sobbed as mrs linton left the room all all is against me she has blighted my single consolation but she uttered falsehoods she mr heathcliff is not a fiend he has an honourable soul and a true one or how could he remember her 
 banish him from your thoughts miss i said a bird of bad omen no mate for you mrs linton spoke strongly and yet i contradict her she is better acquainted with his heart than i or anyone besides and she would never represent him as worse than he is honest people hide their deeds how has he been living how has he got rich why is he staying at wuthering heights the house of a man whom he abhors they say mr earnshaw is worse and worse since he came they sit up all night together continually and hindley has been borrowing money on his land and does nothing but play and drink i heard only a week was joseph who told met him at gimmerton nelly he said hae a quest enah at ahr folks one on getten his finger cut off wi hauding froo sticking hisseln loike a cawlf maister yah knaw soa up uh going tuh t grand sizes noan feard uh t bench uh judges norther paul nur peter nur john nur matthew nor noan on em nut he he fair langs to set his brazened face agean em and yon bonny lad heathcliff yah mind a rare un he can girn a laugh as onybody at a raight jest does he niver say nowt of his fine living amang us when he goas tuh t grange this is t way at sundahn dice brandy cloised shutters und till next day at nooin then t fooil gangs banning un raving to his makking dacent fowks dig thur fingers i thur lugs fur varry shaume un the knave wah he carn cahnt his brass un ate un sleep un off to his tuh gossip wi t wife i course he tells dame catherine hah hor goold runs intuh his pocket and her son gallops dahn t broad road while he flees afore to oppen t pikes now miss linton joseph is an old rascal but no liar and if his account of conduct be true you would never think of desiring such a husband would you 
 you are leagued with the rest ellen she replied not listen to your slanders what malevolence you must have to wish to convince me that there is no happiness in the world 
 whether she would have got over this fancy if left to herself or persevered in nursing it perpetually i cannot say she had little time to reflect the day after there was a at the next town my master was obliged to attend and mr heathcliff aware of his absence called rather earlier than usual catherine and isabella were sitting in the library on hostile terms but silent the latter alarmed at her recent indiscretion and the disclosure she had made of her secret feelings in a transient fit of passion the former on mature consideration really offended with her companion and if she laughed again at her pertness inclined to make it no laughing matter to her she did laugh as she saw heathcliff pass the window i was sweeping the hearth and i noticed a mischievous smile on her lips isabella absorbed in her meditations or a book remained till the door opened and it was too late to attempt an escape which she would gladly have done had it been practicable 
 come in right exclaimed the mistress gaily pulling a chair to the fire here are two people sadly in need of a third to thaw the ice between them and you are the very one we should both of us choose heathcliff proud to show you at last somebody that dotes on you more than myself i expect you to feel flattered nay not nelly look at her my poor little is breaking her heart by mere contemplation of your physical and moral beauty it lies in your own power to be brother no no isabella you run off she continued arresting with feigned playfulness the confounded girl who had risen indignantly we were quarrelling like cats about you heathcliff and i was fairly beaten in protestations of devotion and admiration and moreover i was informed that if i would but have the manners to stand aside my rival as she will herself to be would shoot a shaft into your soul that would fix you for ever and send my image into eternal oblivion 
 catherine said isabella calling up her dignity and disdaining to struggle from the tight grasp that held her thank you to adhere to the truth and not slander me even in joke mr heathcliff be kind enough to bid this friend of yours release me she forgets that you and i are not intimate acquaintances and what amuses her is painful to me beyond expression 
 as the guest answered nothing but took his seat and looked thoroughly indifferent what sentiments she cherished concerning him she turned and whispered an earnest appeal for liberty to her tormentor 
 by no means cried mrs linton in answer i be named a dog in the manger again you shall stay now then heathcliff why you evince satisfaction at my pleasant news isabella swears that the love edgar has for me is nothing to that she entertains for you sure she made some speech of the kind did she not ellen and she has fasted ever since the day before walk from sorrow and rage that i dispatched her out of your society under the idea of its being unacceptable 
 i think you belie her said heathcliff twisting his chair to face them she wishes to be out of my society now at any rate and he stared hard at the object of discourse as one might do at a strange repulsive animal a centipede from the indies for instance which curiosity leads one to examine in spite of the aversion it raises the poor thing bear that she grew white and red in rapid succession and while tears beaded her lashes bent the strength of her small fingers to loosen the firm clutch of catherine and perceiving that as fast as she raised one finger off her arm another closed down and she could not remove the whole together she began to make use of her nails and their sharpness presently ornamented the with crescents of red 
 a tigress exclaimed mrs linton setting her free and shaking her hand with pain begone for sake and hide your vixen face how foolish to reveal those talons to him you fancy the conclusions draw look heathcliff they are instruments that will do must beware of your eyes 
 wrench them off her fingers if they ever menaced me he answered brutally when the door had closed after her but what did you mean by teasing the creature in that manner cathy you were not speaking the truth were you 
 i assure you i was she returned she has been pining for your sake several weeks and raving about you this morning and pouring forth a deluge of abuse because i represented your failings in a plain light for the purpose of mitigating her adoration but notice it further i wished to punish her sauciness all i like her too well my dear heathcliff to let you absolutely seize and devour her up 
 and i like her too ill to attempt it said he except in a very ghoulish fashion hear of odd things if i lived alone with that mawkish waxen face the most ordinary would be painting on its white the colours of the rainbow and turning the blue eyes black every day or two they detestably resemble 
 delectably observed catherine they are 
 her heir is she not he asked after a brief silence 
 i should be sorry to think so returned his companion half a dozen nephews shall erase her title please heaven abstract your mind from the subject at present you are too prone to covet your goods remember this goods are mine 
 if they were mine they would be none the less that said heathcliff but though isabella linton may be silly she is scarcely mad and in short dismiss the matter as you advise 
 from their tongues they did dismiss it and catherine probably from her thoughts the other i felt certain recalled it often in the course of the evening i saw him smile to lapse into ominous musing whenever mrs linton had occasion to be absent from the apartment 
 i determined to watch his movements my heart invariably cleaved to the in preference to side with reason i imagined for he was kind and trustful and honourable and could not be called the opposite yet she seemed to allow herself such wide latitude that i had little faith in her principles and still less sympathy for her feelings i wanted something to happen which might have the effect of freeing both wuthering heights and the grange of mr heathcliff quietly leaving us as we had been prior to his advent his visits were a continual nightmare to me and i suspected to my master also his abode at the heights was an oppression past explaining i felt that god had forsaken the stray sheep there to its own wicked wanderings and an evil beast prowled between it and the fold waiting his time to spring and destroy

 good news i got miss catherine and myself to thrushcross grange and to my agreeable disappointment she behaved infinitely better than i dared expect she seemed almost over fond of mr linton and even to his sister she showed plenty of affection they were both very attentive to her comfort certainly it was not the thorn bending to the honeysuckles but the honeysuckles embracing the thorn there were no mutual concessions one stood erect and the others yielded and who can be and when they encounter neither opposition nor indifference i observed that mr edgar had a deeprooted fear of ruffling her humour he concealed it from her but if ever he heard me answer sharply or saw any other servant grow cloudy at some imperious order of hers he would show his trouble by a frown of displeasure that never darkened on his own account he many a time spoke sternly to me about my pertness and averred that the stab of a knife could not inflict a worse pang than he suffered at seeing his lady vexed not to grieve a kind master i learned to be less touchy and for the space of half a year the gunpowder lay as harmless as sand because no fire came near to explode it catherine had seasons of gloom and silence now and then they were respected with sympathizing silence by her husband who ascribed them to an alteration in her constitution produced by her perilous illness as she was never subject to depression of spirits before the return of sunshine was welcomed by answering sunshine from him i believe i may assert that they were really in possession of deep and growing happiness 
 it ended well we must be for ourselves in the long run the mild and generous are only more justly selfish than the domineering and it ended when circumstances caused each to feel that the ones interest was not the chief consideration in the thoughts on a mellow evening in september i was coming from the garden with a heavy basket of apples which i had been gathering it had got dusk and the moon looked over the high wall of the court causing undefined shadows to lurk in the corners of the numerous projecting portions of the building i set my burden on the house steps by the kitchen door and lingered to rest and drew in a few more breaths of the soft sweet air my eyes were on the moon and my back to the entrance when i heard a voice behind me say 
 nelly is that you 
 it was a deep voice and foreign in tone yet there was something in the manner of pronouncing my name which made it sound familiar i turned about to discover who spoke fearfully for the doors were shut and i had seen nobody on approaching the steps something stirred in the porch and moving nearer i distinguished a tall man dressed in dark clothes with dark face and hair he leant against the side and held his fingers on the latch as if intending to open for himself who can it be i thought mr earnshaw oh no the voice has no resemblance to his 
 i have waited here an hour he resumed while i continued staring and the whole of that time all round has been as still as death i dared not enter you do not know me look not a stranger 
 a ray fell on his features the cheeks were sallow and half covered with black whiskers the brows lowering the eyes deep set and singular i remembered the eyes 
 what i cried uncertain whether to regard him as a worldly visitor and i raised my hands in amazement what you come back is it really you is it 
 yes heathcliff he replied glancing from me up to the windows which reflected a score of glittering moons but showed no lights from within are they at home where is she nelly you are not glad you be so disturbed is she here speak i want to have one word with mistress go and say some person from gimmerton desires to see her 
 how will she take it i exclaimed what will she do the surprise bewilders will put her out of her head and you are heathcliff but altered nay no comprehending it have you been for a soldier 
 go and carry my message he interrupted impatiently in hell till you do 
 he lifted the latch and i entered but when i got to the parlour where mr and mrs linton were i could not persuade myself to proceed at length i resolved on making an excuse to ask if they would have the candles lighted and i opened the door 
 they sat together in a window whose lattice lay back against the wall and displayed beyond the garden trees and the wild green park the valley of gimmerton with a long line of mist winding nearly to its top for very soon after you pass the chapel as you may have noticed the sough that runs from the marshes joins a beck which follows the bend of the glen wuthering heights rose above this silvery vapour but our old house was invisible it rather dips down on the other side both the room and its occupants and the scene they gazed on looked wondrously peaceful i shrank reluctantly from performing my errand and was actually going away leaving it unsaid after having put my question about the candles when a sense of my folly compelled me to return and person from gimmerton wishes to see you 
 what does he want asked mrs linton 
 i did not question him i answered 
 well close the curtains nelly she said and bring up tea be back again directly 
 she quitted the apartment mr edgar inquired carelessly who it was 
 someone mistress does not expect i replied that recollect him used to live at mr 
 what the ploughboy he cried why did you not say so to catherine 
 hush you must not call him by those names master i said be sadly grieved to hear you she was nearly heartbroken when he ran off i guess his return will make a jubilee to her 
 mr linton walked to a window on the other side of the room that overlooked the court he unfastened it and leant out i suppose they were below for he exclaimed stand there love bring the person in if it be anyone particular ere long i heard the click of the latch and catherine flew upstairs breathless and wild too excited to show gladness indeed by her face you would rather have surmised an awful calamity 
 oh edgar edgar she panted flinging her arms round his neck oh edgar darling come is and she tightened her embrace to a squeeze 
 well well cried her husband crossly strangle me for that he never struck me as such a marvellous treasure there is no need to be frantic 
 i know you like him she answered repressing a little the intensity of her delight yet for my sake you must be friends now shall i tell him to come up 
 here he said into the parlour 
 where else she asked 
 he looked vexed and suggested the kitchen as a more suitable place for him mrs linton eyed him with a droll angry half laughing at his fastidiousness 
 no she added after a while i cannot sit in the kitchen set two tables here ellen one for your master and miss isabella being gentry the other for heathcliff and myself being of the lower orders will that please you dear or must i have a fire lighted elsewhere if so give directions run down and secure my guest afraid the joy is too great to be real 
 she was about to dart off again but edgar arrested her 
 you bid him step up he said addressing me and catherine try to be glad without being absurd the whole household need not witness the sight of your welcoming a runaway servant as a brother 
 i descended and found heathcliff waiting under the porch evidently anticipating an invitation to enter he followed my guidance without waste of words and i ushered him into the presence of the master and mistress whose flushed cheeks betrayed signs of warm talking but the glowed with another feeling when her friend appeared at the door she sprang forward took both his hands and led him to linton and then she seized reluctant fingers and crushed them into his now fully revealed by the fire and candlelight i was amazed more than ever to behold the transformation of heathcliff he had grown a tall athletic man beside whom my master seemed quite slender and his upright carriage suggested the idea of his having been in the army his countenance was much older in expression and decision of feature than mr it looked intelligent and retained no marks of former degradation a ferocity lurked yet in the depressed brows and eyes full of black fire but it was subdued and his manner was even dignified quite divested of roughness though too stern for grace my surprise equalled or exceeded mine he remained for a minute at a loss how to address the ploughboy as he had called him heathcliff dropped his slight hand and stood looking at him coolly till he chose to speak 
 sit down sir he said at length mrs linton recalling old times would have me give you a cordial reception and of course i am gratified when anything occurs to please her 
 and i also answered heathcliff especially if it be anything in which i have a part i shall stay an hour or two willingly 
 he took a seat opposite catherine who kept her gaze fixed on him as if she feared he would vanish were she to remove it he did not raise his to her often a quick glance now and then sufficed but it flashed back each time more confidently the undisguised delight he drank from hers they were too much absorbed in their mutual joy to suffer embarrassment not so mr edgar he grew pale with pure annoyance a feeling that reached its climax when his lady rose and stepping across the rug seized hands again and laughed like one beside herself 
 i shall think it a dream tomorrow she cried i shall not be able to believe that i have seen and touched and spoken to you once more and yet cruel heathcliff you deserve this welcome to be absent and silent for three years and never to think of me 
 a little more than you have thought of me he murmured i heard of your marriage cathy not long since and while waiting in the yard below i meditated this to have one glimpse of your face a stare of surprise perhaps and pretended pleasure afterwards settle my score with hindley and then prevent the law by doing execution on myself your welcome has put these ideas out of my mind but beware of meeting me with another aspect next time nay not drive me off again you were really sorry for me were you well there was cause fought through a bitter life since i last heard your voice and you must forgive me for i struggled only for you 
 catherine unless we are to have cold tea please to come to the table interrupted linton striving to preserve his ordinary tone and a due measure of politeness mr heathcliff will have a long walk wherever he may lodge tonight and thirsty 
 she took her post before the urn and miss isabella came summoned by the bell then having handed their chairs forward i left the room the meal hardly endured ten minutes cup was never filled she could neither eat nor drink edgar had made a slop in his saucer and scarcely swallowed a mouthful their guest did not protract his stay that evening above an hour longer i asked as he departed if he went to gimmerton 
 no to wuthering heights he answered mr earnshaw invited me when i called this morning 
 mr earnshaw invited him and he called on mr earnshaw i pondered this sentence painfully after he was gone is he turning out a bit of a hypocrite and coming into the country to work mischief under a cloak i mused i had a presentiment in the bottom of my heart that he had better have remained away 
 about the middle of the night i was wakened from my first nap by mrs linton gliding into my chamber taking a seat on my bedside and pulling me by the hair to rouse me 
 i cannot rest ellen she said by way of apology and i want some living creature to keep me company in my happiness edgar is sulky because glad of a thing that does not interest him he refuses to open his mouth except to utter pettish silly speeches and he affirmed i was cruel and selfish for wishing to talk when he was so sick and sleepy he always contrives to be sick at the least cross i gave a few sentences of commendation to heathcliff and he either for a headache or a pang of envy began to cry so i got up and left him 
 what use is it praising heathcliff to him i answered as lads they had an aversion to each other and heathcliff would hate just as much to hear him praised human nature let mr linton alone about him unless you would like an open quarrel between them 
 but does it not show great weakness pursued she not envious i never feel hurt at the brightness of yellow hair and the whiteness of her skin at her dainty elegance and the fondness all the family exhibit for her even you nelly if we have a dispute sometimes you back isabella at once and i yield like a foolish mother i call her a darling and flatter her into a good temper it pleases her brother to see us cordial and that pleases me but they are very much alike they are spoiled children and fancy the world was made for their accommodation and though i humour both i think a smart chastisement might improve them all the same 
 mistaken mrs linton said i they humour you i know what there would be to do if they did not you can well afford to indulge their passing whims as long as their business is to anticipate all your desires you may however fall out at last over something of equal consequence to both sides and then those you term weak are very capable of being as obstinate as you 
 and then we shall fight to the death we nelly she returned laughing no i tell you i have such faith in love that i believe i might kill him and he wish to retaliate 
 i advised her to value him the more for his affection 
 i do she answered but he resort to whining for trifles it is childish and instead of melting into tears because i said that heathcliff was now worthy of regard and it would honour the first gentleman in the country to be his friend he ought to have said it for me and been delighted from sympathy he must get accustomed to him and he may as well like him considering how heathcliff has reason to object to him sure he behaved excellently 
 what do you think of his going to wuthering heights i inquired he is reformed in every respect apparently quite a christian offering the right hand of fellowship to his enemies all around 
 he explained it she replied i wondered as much as you he said he called to gather information concerning me from you supposing you resided there still and joseph told hindley who came out and fell to questioning him of what he had been doing and how he had been living and finally desired him to walk in there were some persons sitting at cards heathcliff joined them my brother lost some money to him and finding him plentifully supplied he requested that he would come again in the evening to which he consented hindley is too reckless to select his acquaintance prudently he trouble himself to reflect on the causes he might have for mistrusting one whom he has basely injured but heathcliff affirms his principal reason for resuming a connection with his ancient persecutor is a wish to install himself in quarters at walking distance from the grange and an attachment to the house where we lived together and likewise a hope that i shall have more opportunities of seeing him there than i could have if he settled in gimmerton he means to offer liberal payment for permission to lodge at the heights and doubtless my covetousness will prompt him to accept the terms he was always greedy though what he grasps with one hand he flings away with the other 
 a nice place for a young man to fix his dwelling in said i have you no fear of the consequences mrs linton 
 none for my friend she replied his strong head will keep him from danger a little for hindley but he be made morally worse than he is and i stand between him and bodily harm the event of this evening has reconciled me to god and humanity i had risen in angry rebellion against providence oh endured very very bitter misery nelly if that creature knew how bitter be ashamed to cloud its removal with idle petulance it was kindness for him which induced me to bear it alone had i expressed the agony i frequently felt he would have been taught to long for its alleviation as ardently as l however over and take no revenge on his folly i can afford to suffer anything hereafter should the meanest thing alive slap me on the cheek not only turn the other but ask pardon for provoking it and as a proof go make my peace with edgar instantly good night an angel 
 in this conviction she departed and the success of her fulfilled resolution was obvious on the morrow mr linton had not only abjured his peevishness though his spirits seemed still subdued by exuberance of vivacity but he ventured no objection to her taking isabella with her to wuthering heights in the afternoon and she rewarded him with such a summer of sweetness and affection in return as made the house a paradise for several days both master and servants profiting from the perpetual sunshine 
 heathcliff i should say in the liberty of visiting at thrushcross grange cautiously at first he seemed estimating how far its owner would bear his intrusion catherine also deemed it judicious to moderate her expressions of pleasure in receiving him and he gradually established his right to be expected he retained a great deal of the reserve for which his boyhood was remarkable and that served to repress all startling demonstrations of feeling my uneasiness experienced a lull and further circumstances diverted it into another channel for a space 
 his new source of trouble sprang from the not anticipated misfortune of isabella linton evincing a sudden and irresistible attraction towards the tolerated guest she was at that time a charming young lady of eighteen infantile in manners though possessed of keen wit keen feelings and a keen temper too if irritated her brother who loved her tenderly was appalled at this fantastic preference leaving aside the degradation of an alliance with a nameless man and the possible fact that his property in default of heirs male might pass into such a power he had sense to comprehend disposition to know that though his exterior was altered his mind was unchangeable and unchanged and he dreaded that mind it revolted him he shrank forebodingly from the idea of committing isabella to his keeping he would have recoiled still more had he been aware that her attachment rose unsolicited and was bestowed where it awakened no reciprocation of sentiment for the minute he discovered its existence he laid the blame on deliberate designing 
 we had all remarked during some time that miss linton fretted and pined over something she grew cross and wearisome snapping at and teasing catherine continually at the imminent risk of exhausting her limited patience we excused her to a certain extent on the plea of she was dwindling and fading before our eyes but one day when she had been peculiarly wayward rejecting her breakfast complaining that the servants did not do what she told them that the mistress would allow her to be nothing in the house and edgar neglected her that she had caught a cold with the doors being left open and we let the parlour fire go out on purpose to vex her with a hundred yet more frivolous accusations mrs linton peremptorily insisted that she should get to bed and having scolded her heartily threatened to send for the doctor mention of kenneth caused her to exclaim instantly that her health was perfect and it was only harshness which made her unhappy 
 how can you say i am harsh you naughty fondling cried the mistress amazed at the unreasonable assertion you are surely losing your reason when have i been harsh tell me 
 yesterday sobbed isabella and now 
 yesterday said her on what occasion 
 in our walk along the moor you told me to ramble where i pleased while you sauntered on with mr heathcliff 
 and your notion of harshness said catherine laughing it was no hint that your company was superfluous we care whether you kept with us or not i merely thought heathcliffs talk would have nothing entertaining for your ears 
 oh no wept the young lady you wished me away because you knew i liked to be there 
 is she sane asked mrs linton appealing to me repeat our conversation word for word isabella and you point out any charm it could have had for you 
 i mind the conversation she answered i wanted to be with 
 well said catherine perceiving her hesitate to complete the sentence 
 with him and i be always sent off she continued kindling up you are a dog in the manger cathy and desire no one to be loved but yourself 
 you are an impertinent little monkey exclaimed mrs linton in surprise but not believe this idiocy it is impossible that you can covet the admiration of you consider him an agreeable person i hope i have misunderstood you isabella 
 no you have not said the infatuated girl i love him more than ever you loved edgar and he might love me if you would let him 
 i be you for a kingdom then catherine declared emphatically and she seemed to speak sincerely nelly help me to convince her of her madness tell her what heathcliff is an unreclaimed creature without refinement without cultivation an arid wilderness of furze and whinstone as soon put that little canary into the park on a day as recommend you to bestow your heart on him it is deplorable ignorance of his character child and nothing else which makes that dream enter your head pray imagine that he conceals depths of benevolence and affection beneath a stern exterior not a rough oyster of a rustic a fierce pitiless wolfish man i never say to him let this or that enemy alone because it would be ungenerous or cruel to harm them i say let them alone because i should hate them to be wronged and crush you like a egg isabella if he found you a troublesome charge i know he love a linton and yet be quite capable of marrying your fortune and expectations avarice is growing with him a besetting sin my picture and his much so that had he thought seriously to catch you i should perhaps have held my tongue and let you fall into his trap 
 miss linton regarded her with indignation 
 for shame for shame she repeated angrily you are worse than twenty foes you poisonous friend 
 ah you believe me then said catherine you think i speak from wicked selfishness 
 certain you do retorted isabella and i shudder at you 
 good cried the other try for yourself if that be your spirit i have done and yield the argument to your saucy insolence 
 and i must suffer for her egotism she sobbed as mrs linton left the room all all is against me she has blighted my single consolation but she uttered falsehoods she mr heathcliff is not a fiend he has an honourable soul and a true one or how could he remember her 
 banish him from your thoughts miss i said a bird of bad omen no mate for you mrs linton spoke strongly and yet i contradict her she is better acquainted with his heart than i or anyone besides and she would never represent him as worse than he is honest people hide their deeds how has he been living how has he got rich why is he staying at wuthering heights the house of a man whom he abhors they say mr earnshaw is worse and worse since he came they sit up all night together continually and hindley has been borrowing money on his land and does nothing but play and drink i heard only a week was joseph who told met him at gimmerton nelly he said hae a quest enah at ahr folks one on getten his finger cut off wi hauding froo sticking hisseln loike a cawlf maister yah knaw soa up uh going tuh t grand sizes noan feard uh t bench uh judges norther paul nur peter nur john nur matthew nor noan on em nut he he fair langs to set his brazened face agean em and yon bonny lad heathcliff yah mind a rare un he can girn a laugh as onybody at a raight jest does he niver say nowt of his fine living amang us when he goas tuh t grange this is t way at sundahn dice brandy cloised shutters und till next day at nooin then t fooil gangs banning un raving to his makking dacent fowks dig thur fingers i thur lugs fur varry shaume un the knave wah he carn cahnt his brass un ate un sleep un off to his tuh gossip wi t wife i course he tells dame catherine hah hor goold runs intuh his pocket and her son gallops dahn t broad road while he flees afore to oppen t pikes now miss linton joseph is an old rascal but no liar and if his account of conduct be true you would never think of desiring such a husband would you 
 you are leagued with the rest ellen she replied not listen to your slanders what malevolence you must have to wish to convince me that there is no happiness in the world 
 whether she would have got over this fancy if left to herself or persevered in nursing it perpetually i cannot say she had little time to reflect the day after there was a at the next town my master was obliged to attend and mr heathcliff aware of his absence called rather earlier than usual catherine and isabella were sitting in the library on hostile terms but silent the latter alarmed at her recent indiscretion and the disclosure she had made of her secret feelings in a transient fit of passion the former on mature consideration really offended with her companion and if she laughed again at her pertness inclined to make it no laughing matter to her she did laugh as she saw heathcliff pass the window i was sweeping the hearth and i noticed a mischievous smile on her lips isabella absorbed in her meditations or a book remained till the door opened and it was too late to attempt an escape which she would gladly have done had it been practicable 
 come in right exclaimed the mistress gaily pulling a chair to the fire here are two people sadly in need of a third to thaw the ice between them and you are the very one we should both of us choose heathcliff proud to show you at last somebody that dotes on you more than myself i expect you to feel flattered nay not nelly look at her my poor little is breaking her heart by mere contemplation of your physical and moral beauty it lies in your own power to be brother no no isabella you run off she continued arresting with feigned playfulness the confounded girl who had risen indignantly we were quarrelling like cats about you heathcliff and i was fairly beaten in protestations of devotion and admiration and moreover i was informed that if i would but have the manners to stand aside my rival as she will herself to be would shoot a shaft into your soul that would fix you for ever and send my image into eternal oblivion 
 catherine said isabella calling up her dignity and disdaining to struggle from the tight grasp that held her thank you to adhere to the truth and not slander me even in joke mr heathcliff be kind enough to bid this friend of yours release me she forgets that you and i are not intimate acquaintances and what amuses her is painful to me beyond expression 
 as the guest answered nothing but took his seat and looked thoroughly indifferent what sentiments she cherished concerning him she turned and whispered an earnest appeal for liberty to her tormentor 
 by no means cried mrs linton in answer i be named a dog in the manger again you shall stay now then heathcliff why you evince satisfaction at my pleasant news isabella swears that the love edgar has for me is nothing to that she entertains for you sure she made some speech of the kind did she not ellen and she has fasted ever since the day before walk from sorrow and rage that i dispatched her out of your society under the idea of its being unacceptable 
 i think you belie her said heathcliff twisting his chair to face them she wishes to be out of my society now at any rate and he stared hard at the object of discourse as one might do at a strange repulsive animal a centipede from the indies for instance which curiosity leads one to examine in spite of the aversion it raises the poor thing bear that she grew white and red in rapid succession and while tears beaded her lashes bent the strength of her small fingers to loosen the firm clutch of catherine and perceiving that as fast as she raised one finger off her arm another closed down and she could not remove the whole together she began to make use of her nails and their sharpness presently ornamented the with crescents of red 
 a tigress exclaimed mrs linton setting her free and shaking her hand with pain begone for sake and hide your vixen face how foolish to reveal those talons to him you fancy the conclusions draw look heathcliff they are instruments that will do must beware of your eyes 
 wrench them off her fingers if they ever menaced me he answered brutally when the door had closed after her but what did you mean by teasing the creature in that manner cathy you were not speaking the truth were you 
 i assure you i was she returned she has been pining for your sake several weeks and raving about you this morning and pouring forth a deluge of abuse because i represented your failings in a plain light for the purpose of mitigating her adoration but notice it further i wished to punish her sauciness all i like her too well my dear heathcliff to let you absolutely seize and devour her up 
 and i like her too ill to attempt it said he except in a very ghoulish fashion hear of odd things if i lived alone with that mawkish waxen face the most ordinary would be painting on its white the colours of the rainbow and turning the blue eyes black every day or two they detestably resemble 
 delectably observed catherine they are 
 her heir is she not he asked after a brief silence 
 i should be sorry to think so returned his companion half a dozen nephews shall erase her title please heaven abstract your mind from the subject at present you are too prone to covet your goods remember this goods are mine 
 if they were mine they would be none the less that said heathcliff but though isabella linton may be silly she is scarcely mad and in short dismiss the matter as you advise 
 from their tongues they did dismiss it and catherine probably from her thoughts the other i felt certain recalled it often in the course of the evening i saw him smile to lapse into ominous musing whenever mrs linton had occasion to be absent from the apartment 
 i determined to watch his movements my heart invariably cleaved to the in preference to side with reason i imagined for he was kind and trustful and honourable and could not be called the opposite yet she seemed to allow herself such wide latitude that i had little faith in her principles and still less sympathy for her feelings i wanted something to happen which might have the effect of freeing both wuthering heights and the grange of mr heathcliff quietly leaving us as we had been prior to his advent his visits were a continual nightmare to me and i suspected to my master also his abode at the heights was an oppression past explaining i felt that god had forsaken the stray sheep there to its own wicked wanderings and an evil beast prowled between it and the fold waiting his time to spring and destroy

 chapter ten 
 
 as spring came on a new set of amusements became the fashion and the lengthening days gave long afternoons for work and play of all sorts the garden had to be put in order and each sister had a quarter of the little plot to do what she liked with hannah used to say know which each of them gardings belonged to ef i see em in chiny and so she might for the girls tastes differed as much as their characters had roses and heliotrope myrtle and a little orange tree in it bed was never alike two seasons for she was always trying experiments this year it was to be a plantation of sun flowers the seeds of which cheerful land aspiring plant were to feed aunt and her family of chicks beth had fragrant flowers in her garden sweet peas and mignonette larkspur pinks pansies and southernwood with chickweed for the birds and catnip for the pussies amy had a bower in hers rather small and earwiggy but very pretty to look at with honeysuckle and hanging their colored horns and bells in graceful wreaths all over it tall white lilies delicate ferns and as many brilliant picturesque plants as would consent to blossom there 
 gardening walks rows on the river and flower hunts employed the fine days and for rainy ones they had house diversions some old some new all more or less original one of these was the for as secret societies were the was thought proper to have one and as all of the girls admired dickens they called themselves the pickwick club with a few interruptions they had kept this up for a year and met every saturday evening in the big garret on which occasions the ceremonies were as follows three chairs were arranged in a row before a table on which was a lamp also four white badges with a big in different colors on each and the weekly newspaper called the pickwick portfolio to which all contributed something while jo who reveled in pens and ink was the editor at seven the four members ascended to the clubroom tied their badges round their heads and took their seats with great solemnity meg as the eldest was samuel pickwick jo being of a literary turn augustus snodgrass beth because she was round and rosy tracy tupman and amy who was always trying to do what she was nathaniel winkle pickwick the president read the paper which was filled with original tales poetry local news funny advertisements and hints in which they reminded each other of their faults and short comings on one occasion mr pickwick put on a pair of spectacles without any glass rapped upon the table hemmed and having stared hard at mr snodgrass who was tilting back in his chair till he arranged himself properly began to read

 anniversary ode 
 again we meet to celebrate 
 with badge and solemn rite 
 our anniversary 
 in pickwick hall tonight 
 we all are here in perfect health 
 none gone from our small band 
 again we see each face 
 and press each friendly hand 
 our pickwick always at his post 
 with reverence we greet 
 as spectacles on nose he reads 
 our weekly sheet 
 although he suffers from a cold 
 we joy to hear him speak 
 for words of wisdom from him fall 
 in spite of croak or squeak 
 old snodgrass looms on high 
 with elephantine grace 
 and beams upon the company 
 with brown and jovial face 
 poetic fire lights up his eye 
 he struggles gainst his lot 
 behold ambition on his brow 
 and on his nose a blot 
 next our peaceful tupman comes 
 so rosy plump and sweet 
 who chokes with laughter at the puns 
 and tumbles off his seat 
 prim little winkle too is here 
 with every hair in place 
 a model of propriety 
 though he hates to wash his face 
 the year is gone we still unite 
 to joke and laugh and read 
 and tread the path of literature 
 that doth to glory lead 
 long may our paper prosper well 
 our club unbroken be 
 and coming years their blessings pour 
 on the useful gay p c

 the masked marriage 
 a tale of venice 
 gondola after gondola swept up to the marble steps and left its lovely load to swell the brilliant throng that filled the stately halls of count adelon knights and ladies elves and pages monks and flower girls all mingled gaily in the dance 
 sweet voices and rich melody filled the air and so with mirth and music the masquerade went on has your highness seen the lady viola tonight asked a gallant troubadour of the fairy queen who floated down the hall upon his arm 
 yes is she not lovely though so sad her dress is well chosen too for in a week she weds count antonio whom she passionately hates 
 by my faith i envy him yonder he comes arrayed like a bridegroom except the black mask when that is off we shall see how he regards the fair maid whose heart he cannot win though her stern father bestows her hand returned the troubadour 
 tis whispered that she loves the young english artist who haunts her steps and is spurned by the old count said the lady as they joined the dance the revel was at its height when a priest appeared and withdrawing the young pair to an alcove hung with purple velvet he motioned them to kneel instant silence fell on the gay throng and not a sound but he dash of fountains or the rustle of orange groves sleeping in the moonlight broke the hush as count de adelon spoke thus 
 my lords and ladies pardon the ruse by which i have gathered you here to witness the marriage of my daughter father we wait your services all eyes turned toward the bridal party and a murmur of amazement went through the throng for neither bride nor groom removed their masks curiosity and wonder possessed all hearts but respect restrained all tongues till the holy rite was over then the eager spectators gathered round the count demanding an explanation 
 
 gladly would i give it if i could but i only know that it was the whim of my timid viola and i yielded to it now my children let the play end unmask and receive my blessing 
 but neither bent the knee for the young bridegroom replied in a tone that startled all listeners as the mask fell disclosing the noble face of ferdinand devereux the artist lover and leaning on the breast where now flashed the star of an english earl was the lovely viola radiant with joy and beauty 
 my lord you scornfully bade me claim your daughter when i could boast as high a name and vast a fortune as the count antonio i can do more for even your ambitious soul cannot refuse the earl of devereux and de vere when he gives his ancient name and boundless wealth in return for the beloved hand of this fair lady now my wife 
 the count stood like one changed to stone and turning to the bewildered crowd ferdinand added with a gay smile of triumph to you my gallant friends i can only wish that your wooing may prosper as mine has done and that you may all win as fair a bride as i have by this masked marriage

 a sad accident 
 
 on friday last we were startled by a violent shock in our basement followed by cries of distress on rushing in a body to the cellar we discovered our beloved president prostrate upon the floor having tripped and fallen while getting wood for domestic purposes a perfect scene of ruin met our eyes for in his fall mr pickwick had plunged his head and shoulders into a tub of water upset a keg of soft soap upon his manly form and torn his garments badly on being removed from this perilous situation it was discovered that he had suffered no injury but several bruises and we are happy to add is now doing well

 the public bereavement 
 it is our painful duty to record the sudden and mysterious disappearance of our cherished friend mrs snowball pat paw this lovely and beloved cat was the pet of a large circle of warm and admiring friends for her beauty attracted all eyes her graces and virtues endeared her to all hearts and her loss is deeply felt by the whole community 
 when last seen she was sitting at the gate watching the cart and it is feared that some villain tempted by her charms basely stole her weeks have passed but no trace of her has been discovered and we relinquish all hope tie a black ribbon to her basket set aside her dish and weep for her as one lost to us forever 
 
 a sympathizing friend sends the following gem 
 
 a lament 
 for s b pat paw 
 we mourn the loss of our little pet 
 and sigh her hapless fate 
 for never more by the fire sit 
 nor play by the old green gate 
 the little grave where her infant sleeps 
 is neath the chestnut tree 
 but her grave we may not weep 
 we know not where it may be 
 her empty bed her idle ball 
 will never see her more 
 no gentle tap no loving purr 
 is heard at the parlor door 
 another cat comes after her mice 
 a cat with a dirty face 
 but she does not hunt as our darling did 
 nor play with her airy grace 
 her stealthy paws tread the very hall 
 where snowball used to play 
 but she only spits at the dogs our pet 
 so gallantly drove away 
 she is useful and mild and does her best 
 but she is not fair to see 
 and we cannot give her your place dear 
 nor worship her as we worship thee

 as the president finished reading the paper which i beg leave to assure my readers is a bona fide copy of one written by bona fide girls once upon a time a round of applause followed and then mr snodgrass rose to make a proposition 
 mr president and gentlemen he began assuming a parliamentary attitude and tone i wish to propose the admission of a new who highly deserves the honor would be deeply grateful for it and would add immensely to the spirit of the club the literary value of the paper and be no end jolly and nice i propose mr theodore laurence as an honorary member of the p c come now do have him 
 sudden change of tone made the girls laugh but all looked rather anxious and no one said a word as snodgrass took his seat 
 put it to a vote said the president all in favor of this motion please to manifest it by saying aye 
 say no 
 meg and amy were and mr winkle rose to say with great elegance we wish any boys they only joke and bounce about this is a ladies club and we wish to be private and proper 
 afraid laugh at our paper and make fun of us afterward observed pickwick pulling the little curl on her forehead as she always did when doubtful 
 up rose snodgrass very much in earnest sir i give you my word as a gentleman laurie do anything of the sort he likes to write and give a tone to our contributions and keep us from being sentimental you see we can do so little for him and he does so much for us i think the least we can do is to offer him a place here and make him welcome if he comes 
 this artful allusion to benefits conferred brought tupman to his feet looking as if he had quite made up his mind 
 yes we ought to do it even if we are afraid i say he may come and his grandpa too if he likes 
 this spirited burst from beth electrified the club and jo left her seat to shake hands approvingly now then vote again everybody remember our laurie and say aye cried snodgrass excitedly 
 aye aye aye replied three voices at once 
 good bless you now as nothing like taking time by the fetlock as winkle characteristically observes allow me to present the new member and to the dismay of the rest of the club jo threw open the door of the closet and displayed laurie sitting on a rag bag flushed and twinkling with suppressed laughter 
 you rogue you traitor jo how could you cried the three girls as snodgrass led her friend triumphantly forth and producing both a chair and a badge installed him in a jiffy 
 the coolness of you two rascals is amazing began mr pickwick trying to get up an awful frown and only succeeding in producing an amiable smile but the new member was equal to the occasion and rising with a grateful salutation to the chair said in the most engaging manner mr president and beg pardon me to introduce myself as sam weller the very humble servant of the club 
 good good cried jo pounding with the handle of the old warming pan on which she leaned 
 my faithful friend and noble patron continued laurie with a wave of the hand who has so flatteringly presented me is not to be blamed for the base stratagem of tonight i planned it and she only gave in after lots of teasing 
 come now lay it all on yourself you know i proposed the cupboard broke in snodgrass who was enjoying the joke amazingly 
 never mind what she says the wretch that did it sir said the new member with a welleresque nod to mr pickwick but on my honor i never will do so again and henceforth devote myself to the interest of this immortal club 
 hear hear cried jo clashing the lid of the warming pan like a cymbal 
 go on go on added winkle and tupman while the president bowed benignly 
 i merely wish to say that as a slight token of my gratitude for the honor done me and as a means of promoting friendly relations between adjoining nations i have set up a post office in the hedge in the lower corner of the garden a fine spacious building with padlocks on the doors and every convenience for the mails also the females if i may be allowed the expression the old martin house but stopped up the door and made the roof open so it will hold all sorts of things and save our valuable time letters manuscripts books and bundles can be passed in there and as each nation has a key it will be uncommonly nice i fancy allow me to present the club key and with many thanks for your favor take my seat 
 great applause as mr weller deposited a little key on the table and subsided the warming pan clashed and waved wildly and it was some time before order could be restored a long discussion followed and everyone came out surprising for everyone did her best so it was an unusually lively meeting and did not adjourn till a late hour when it broke up with three shrill cheers for the new member no one ever regretted the admittance of sam weller for a more devoted and jovial member no club could have he certainly did add spirit to the meetings and a tone to the paper for his orations convulsed his hearers and his contributions were excellent being patriotic classical comical or dramatic but never sentimental jo regarded them as worthy of bacon milton or shakespeare and remodeled her own works with good effect she thought 
 the p o was a capital little institution and flourished wonderfully for nearly as many queer things passed through it as through the real post office tragedies and cravats poetry and pickles garden seeds and long letters music and gingerbread rubbers invitations scoldings and puppies the old gentleman liked the fun and amused himself by sending odd bundles mysterious messages and funny telegrams and his gardener who was smitten with charms actually sent a love letter to care how they laughed when the secret came out never dreaming how many love letters that little post office would hold in the years to come

 chapter ten 
 
 as spring came on a new set of amusements became the fashion and the lengthening days gave long afternoons for work and play of all sorts the garden had to be put in order and each sister had a quarter of the little plot to do what she liked with hannah used to say know which each of them gardings belonged to ef i see em in chiny and so she might for the girls tastes differed as much as their characters had roses and heliotrope myrtle and a little orange tree in it bed was never alike two seasons for she was always trying experiments this year it was to be a plantation of sun flowers the seeds of which cheerful land aspiring plant were to feed aunt and her family of chicks beth had fragrant flowers in her garden sweet peas and mignonette larkspur pinks pansies and southernwood with chickweed for the birds and catnip for the pussies amy had a bower in hers rather small and earwiggy but very pretty to look at with honeysuckle and hanging their colored horns and bells in graceful wreaths all over it tall white lilies delicate ferns and as many brilliant picturesque plants as would consent to blossom there 
 gardening walks rows on the river and flower hunts employed the fine days and for rainy ones they had house diversions some old some new all more or less original one of these was the for as secret societies were the was thought proper to have one and as all of the girls admired dickens they called themselves the pickwick club with a few interruptions they had kept this up for a year and met every saturday evening in the big garret on which occasions the ceremonies were as follows three chairs were arranged in a row before a table on which was a lamp also four white badges with a big in different colors on each and the weekly newspaper called the pickwick portfolio to which all contributed something while jo who reveled in pens and ink was the editor at seven the four members ascended to the clubroom tied their badges round their heads and took their seats with great solemnity meg as the eldest was samuel pickwick jo being of a literary turn augustus snodgrass beth because she was round and rosy tracy tupman and amy who was always trying to do what she was nathaniel winkle pickwick the president read the paper which was filled with original tales poetry local news funny advertisements and hints in which they reminded each other of their faults and short comings on one occasion mr pickwick put on a pair of spectacles without any glass rapped upon the table hemmed and having stared hard at mr snodgrass who was tilting back in his chair till he arranged himself properly began to read

 anniversary ode 
 again we meet to celebrate 
 with badge and solemn rite 
 our anniversary 
 in pickwick hall tonight 
 we all are here in perfect health 
 none gone from our small band 
 again we see each face 
 and press each friendly hand 
 our pickwick always at his post 
 with reverence we greet 
 as spectacles on nose he reads 
 our weekly sheet 
 although he suffers from a cold 
 we joy to hear him speak 
 for words of wisdom from him fall 
 in spite of croak or squeak 
 old snodgrass looms on high 
 with elephantine grace 
 and beams upon the company 
 with brown and jovial face 
 poetic fire lights up his eye 
 he struggles gainst his lot 
 behold ambition on his brow 
 and on his nose a blot 
 next our peaceful tupman comes 
 so rosy plump and sweet 
 who chokes with laughter at the puns 
 and tumbles off his seat 
 prim little winkle too is here 
 with every hair in place 
 a model of propriety 
 though he hates to wash his face 
 the year is gone we still unite 
 to joke and laugh and read 
 and tread the path of literature 
 that doth to glory lead 
 long may our paper prosper well 
 our club unbroken be 
 and coming years their blessings pour 
 on the useful gay p c

 the masked marriage 
 a tale of venice 
 gondola after gondola swept up to the marble steps and left its lovely load to swell the brilliant throng that filled the stately halls of count adelon knights and ladies elves and pages monks and flower girls all mingled gaily in the dance 
 sweet voices and rich melody filled the air and so with mirth and music the masquerade went on has your highness seen the lady viola tonight asked a gallant troubadour of the fairy queen who floated down the hall upon his arm 
 yes is she not lovely though so sad her dress is well chosen too for in a week she weds count antonio whom she passionately hates 
 by my faith i envy him yonder he comes arrayed like a bridegroom except the black mask when that is off we shall see how he regards the fair maid whose heart he cannot win though her stern father bestows her hand returned the troubadour 
 tis whispered that she loves the young english artist who haunts her steps and is spurned by the old count said the lady as they joined the dance the revel was at its height when a priest appeared and withdrawing the young pair to an alcove hung with purple velvet he motioned them to kneel instant silence fell on the gay throng and not a sound but he dash of fountains or the rustle of orange groves sleeping in the moonlight broke the hush as count de adelon spoke thus 
 my lords and ladies pardon the ruse by which i have gathered you here to witness the marriage of my daughter father we wait your services all eyes turned toward the bridal party and a murmur of amazement went through the throng for neither bride nor groom removed their masks curiosity and wonder possessed all hearts but respect restrained all tongues till the holy rite was over then the eager spectators gathered round the count demanding an explanation 
 
 gladly would i give it if i could but i only know that it was the whim of my timid viola and i yielded to it now my children let the play end unmask and receive my blessing 
 but neither bent the knee for the young bridegroom replied in a tone that startled all listeners as the mask fell disclosing the noble face of ferdinand devereux the artist lover and leaning on the breast where now flashed the star of an english earl was the lovely viola radiant with joy and beauty 
 my lord you scornfully bade me claim your daughter when i could boast as high a name and vast a fortune as the count antonio i can do more for even your ambitious soul cannot refuse the earl of devereux and de vere when he gives his ancient name and boundless wealth in return for the beloved hand of this fair lady now my wife 
 the count stood like one changed to stone and turning to the bewildered crowd ferdinand added with a gay smile of triumph to you my gallant friends i can only wish that your wooing may prosper as mine has done and that you may all win as fair a bride as i have by this masked marriage

 the mummy 
 part 
 
 int foyer night 
 and jonathan race into the foyer and skid to a 
 stop as they see shriveled body on the floor 
 runs up to door and rattles the knob 
 still locked he bends down and looks in through the keyhole 
 room night 
 imhotep leans down towards evelyn about to kiss her as she 
 sleeps the door starts to crash and bang from 
 imhotep ignores it and kisses evelyn his lips and mouth 
 instantly start to degenerate and decay right down to the 
 bone the door bursts open evelyn sees 
 rotted mouth kissing her she screams and shoves him away 
 putrid mouth grimaces in sadness 
 
 get your hands off my girl pal 
 sadness turns to anger as he spins around and faces 
 imhotep licks his fetid lips smirks 
 
 nice lips 
 imhotep starts to move for 
 
 i figured you might be here 
 so i brought a friend 
 he throws the white cat at imhotep imhotep instinctively 
 catches it he shrieks drops the cat and stumbles back 
 towards the window which suddenly blows open imhotep 
 spins like a dervish and bursts into a whirlwind of sand 
 everybody covers their eyes the explodes 
 out the window and vanishes over the compound 
 jonathan aims his gun at the window his hand shaking badly 
 hugs evelyn as she wipes her mouth in disgust 
 daniels walks in looks at shriveled body on 
 the floor and drops the martini glasses 
 int convertible dussenberg night 
 jonathan races his big convertible through the streets 
 honking constantly evelyn sits between him and 
 looking scared and nervous then she gives a look 
 evelyn 
 you called me your girl 
 
 what oh yeah that was just 
 um you know figure a speech 
 evelyn 
 i think you were jealous 
 
 jealous you kiddin me did 
 you see that face 
 daniels leans forward from the back seat filled with fear 
 daniels 
 just we gotta 
 do somethin we gotta do somethin 
 now before too late 
 they race into the driveway of the museum of antiquities 
 ext cairo bazaar night 
 a full moon now shines down on the bazaar still bustling 
 with activity suddenly a breeze green mist begins 
 to swirl down the street and through the stalls the people 
 begin to choke and cough and retch as if being hit by a 
 severe sickness already too late 
 imhotep strolls through the sickened mob his face half 
 rotted off his deformed mouth grinning happily beni is 
 at his side looking very nervous and then 
 the people silently begin to follow imhotep their skin 
 now covered in disgustingly hideous boils and sores 
 int museum of antiquities night 
 jonathan daniels the curator and ardeth bay 
 evelyn as she strides through the museum 
 evelyn 
 last month i came across an 
 inscription that mentioned 
 the book of the dead 
 daniels 
 that book we found at hamunaptra 
 evelyn 
 yes i dismissed it because it 
 talked about bringing people 
 back from the dead a notion 
 i was unwilling to believe 
 
 believe it sister what 
 brought our buddy back to life 
 jonathan 
 and now going to use it 
 to bring his girlfriend back 
 ardeth bay 
 and if he succeeds the two of 
 them together will bring about 
 the apocalypse 
 the curator joins evelyn at her side as she heads up the 
 stairs everyone else in hot pursuit 
 the curator 
 the plagues we have seen so far 
 are merely imhotep flexing his 
 muscles only at the moment of 
 resurrection 
 will he be truly invincible 
 they reach the display cases evelyn quickly opens them 
 evelyn 
 thinking that if the black 
 book of the dead can bring people 
 back to life 
 curator 
 then perhaps the golden book 
 of the living can return them 
 to the underworld 
 evelyn 
 exactly 
 
 so your sayin if we find the 
 book made outta gold 
 curator 
 and read the sacred incantations 
 contained inside it 
 
 you think send this guy 
 back to hell 
 curator 
 correct 
 and when loud chanting is heard coming from outside 
 they all rush over to the upper windows and look down 
 outside a large crazed mob covered in hideous boils and sores 
 comes chanting up the driveway 
 ardeth bay 
 it has begun the beginning of 
 the end 
 evelyn 
 not quite yet it 
 evelyn dashes back to the display cases everyone follows 
 ext museum night 
 the crazed mob crashes into the huge front doors which are 
 locked they pound furiously throwing themselves at it while 
 chanting constantly imhotep solemnly comes up the driveway 
 int museum of antiquities upper balcony night 
 the banging on the doors can be heard as evelyn and the 
 curator quickly sort through broken pieces of stone tablets 
 the others watch evelyn pulls out a large piece 
 evelyn 
 got it 
 
 got what 
 the banging gets louder multiple windows shatter evelyn 
 talks while quickly translating the tablet 
 evelyn 
 since the black book of the dead 
 was found inside the statue of 
 anubis then according to this 
 the golden book of the living 
 should be inside 
 evelyn finds the translation in the tablet and smiles 
 
 what 
 jonathan 
 what 
 daniels 
 what 
 evelyn 
 the golden book of the living 
 is inside the statue of 
 curator 
 which would be located not far to 
 the east of the anubis statue 
 
 tell me we gotta go back 
 out there 
 curator 
 if we want to kill the creature yes 
 two hideous boil men charge out of a doorway 
 screaming and ardeth bay grab them and chuck them 
 over the railing the men fly through the air and crash into 
 the lower display cases the front doors suddenly burst open 
 the crazed mob pours into the museum our heroes 
 across the balcony and down the staircase 
 ext museum of antiquity night 
 jonathan sneaks out of some bushes and quickly heads for his 
 convertible suddenly a splinter group of the diseased mob 
 comes around the side of the museum jonathan instantly bugs 
 his eyes out starts drooling and begins chanting 
 jonathan 
 
 the crazed group runs past him and heads into the front doors 
 of the museum jonathan leaps into the convertible fires it 
 up and s it back over to the bushes 
 evelyn daniels ardeth bay and the curator jump 
 inside the car beni steps out of the museum and sees them 
 beni 
 imhotep imhotep 
 imhotep looks out of the museum from the shattered upper 
 windows just as the convertible peels out points a 
 finger at beni as they race past him 
 
 gonna get yours pal 
 imhotep unhinges his jaw his mouth stretches to an inhuman

 room night 
 imhotep leans down towards evelyn about to kiss her as she 
 sleeps the door starts to crash and bang from 
 imhotep ignores it and kisses evelyn his lips and mouth 
 instantly start to degenerate and decay right down to the 
 bone the door bursts open evelyn sees

 he throws the white cat at imhotep imhotep instinctively 
 catches it he shrieks drops the cat and stumbles back 
 towards the window which suddenly blows open imhotep 
 spins like a dervish and bursts into a whirlwind of sand 
 everybody covers their eyes the explodes 
 out the window and vanishes over the compound 
 jonathan aims his gun at the window his hand shaking badly 
 hugs evelyn as she wipes her mouth in disgust 
 daniels walks in looks at shriveled body on 
 the floor and drops the martini glasses 
 int convertible dussenberg night 
 jonathan races his big convertible through the streets 
 honking constantly evelyn sits between him and 
 looking scared and nervous then she gives a look 
 evelyn

 what oh yeah that was just 
 um you know figure a speech 
 evelyn 
 i think you were jealous 
 
 jealous you kiddin me did 
 you see that face 
 daniels leans forward from the back seat filled with fear 
 daniels 
 just we gotta 
 do somethin we gotta do somethin 
 now before too late 
 they race into the driveway of the museum of antiquities 
 ext cairo bazaar night 
 a full moon now shines down on the bazaar still bustling 
 with activity suddenly a breeze green mist begins 
 to swirl down the street and through the stalls the people 
 begin to choke and cough and retch as if being hit by a 
 severe sickness already too late 
 imhotep strolls through the sickened mob his face half 
 rotted off his deformed mouth grinning happily beni is 
 at his side looking very nervous and then 
 the people silently begin to follow imhotep their skin 
 now covered in disgustingly hideous boils and sores 
 int museum of antiquities night 
 jonathan daniels the curator and ardeth bay 
 evelyn as she strides through the museum 
 evelyn 
 last month i came across an 
 inscription that mentioned 
 the book of the dead 
 daniels 
 that book we found at hamunaptra 
 evelyn 
 yes i dismissed it because it 
 talked about bringing people 
 back from the dead a notion 
 i was unwilling to believe 
 
 believe it sister what 
 brought our buddy back to life 
 jonathan 
 and now going to use it 
 to bring his girlfriend back 
 ardeth bay 
 and if he succeeds the two of 
 them together will bring about 
 the apocalypse 
 the curator joins evelyn at her side as she heads up the 
 stairs everyone else in hot pursuit 
 the curator 
 the plagues we have seen so far 
 are merely imhotep flexing his 
 muscles only at the moment of 
 resurrection 
 will he be truly invincible 
 they reach the display cases evelyn quickly opens them 
 evelyn 
 thinking that if the black 
 book of the dead can bring people 
 back to life 
 curator 
 then perhaps the golden book 
 of the living can return them 
 to the underworld 
 evelyn 
 exactly 
 
 so your sayin if we find the 
 book made outta gold 
 curator 
 and read the sacred incantations 
 contained inside it 
 
 you think send this guy 
 back to hell 
 curator 
 correct 
 and when loud chanting is heard coming from outside 
 they all rush over to the upper windows and look down 
 outside a large crazed mob covered in hideous boils and sores 
 comes chanting up the driveway 
 ardeth bay 
 it has begun the beginning of 
 the end 
 evelyn 
 not quite yet it 
 evelyn dashes back to the display cases everyone follows 
 ext museum night 
 the crazed mob crashes into the huge front doors which are 
 locked they pound furiously throwing themselves at it while 
 chanting constantly imhotep solemnly comes up the driveway 
 int museum of antiquities upper balcony night 
 the banging on the doors can be heard as evelyn and the 
 curator quickly sort through broken pieces of stone tablets 
 the others watch evelyn pulls out a large piece 
 evelyn 
 got it 
 
 got what 
 the banging gets louder multiple windows shatter evelyn 
 talks while quickly translating the tablet 
 evelyn 
 since the black book of the dead 
 was found inside the statue of 
 anubis then according to this 
 the golden book of the living 
 should be inside 
 evelyn finds the translation in the tablet and smiles 
 
 what 
 jonathan 
 what 
 daniels 
 what 
 evelyn 
 the golden book of the living 
 is inside the statue of 
 curator 
 which would be located not far to 
 the east of the anubis statue 
 
 tell me we gotta go back 
 out there 
 curator 
 if we want to kill the creature yes 
 two hideous boil men charge out of a doorway 
 screaming and ardeth bay grab them and chuck them 
 over the railing the men fly through the air and crash into 
 the lower display cases the front doors suddenly burst open 
 the crazed mob pours into the museum our heroes 
 across the balcony and down the staircase 
 ext museum of antiquity night 
 jonathan sneaks out of some bushes and quickly heads for his 
 convertible suddenly a splinter group of the diseased mob 
 comes around the side of the museum jonathan instantly bugs 
 his eyes out starts drooling and begins chanting 
 jonathan 
 
 the crazed group runs past him and heads into the front doors 
 of the museum jonathan leaps into the convertible fires it 
 up and s it back over to the bushes

 int room 
 neo wakes up from a deep sleep feeling better he is 
 wearing a black tank top and shorts 
 he begins to examine himself there is a futuristic iv 
 plugged into the jack in his forearm he pulls it out 
 staring at the grafted outlet 
 he feels his bald head his fingers find and explore the 
 large outlet in the base of his skull 
 just as he starts to come unglued morpheus opens the 
 door 
 neo 
 morpheus happened to me 
 what is this place 
 morpheus 
 more important than what is when 
 neo 
 when 
 morpheus 
 you believe the year is when in fact it is much closer to 
 i say for certain what year it is because we honestly do not 
 know 
 the wind is knocked from chest 
 neo 
 not possible 
 morpheus 
 i promised you the truth neo and the truth is that the world you 
 were living in was a lie 
 neo 
 how 
 morpheus 
 show you 
 
 int hovercraft 
 like a sleepwalker neo follows morpheus through the ship 
 morpheus 
 this is my ship the nebuchadnezzar a hovercraft small like a 
 submarine dark cramped and cold but home 
 they climb a ladder up to the main deck 
 
 int main deck 
 everyone is there 
 morpheus 
 this is the main deck you know most of my crew 
 trinity smiles and nods 
 morpheus 
 the ones you know mouse and switch the two big 
 guys are tank and dozer 
 the names and faces wash meaninglessly over neo 
 morpheus 
 and this this is the core this is where we broadcast our pirate 
 signal and hack into the matrix 
 it is a swamp of bizarre electronic equipment vines of 
 coaxial hang and snake to and from huge monolithic 
 battery slabs a black portable satellite dish and banks 
 of little systems and computer monitors 
 at the center of the web there are six ectoskeleton 
 chairs made of a frame and suspension harness 
 near the circle of chairs is the control console and 
 station where the network is monitored 
 morpheus 
 help him trinity 
 neo allows himself to be helped into one of the chairs 
 morpheus 
 do you remember when i asked you about an apparatus that could turn a virtual reality into reality 
 neo nods 
 morpheus 
 right here 
 he touches head 
 morpheus 
 and accessed here 
 neo feels morpheus guiding a coaxial line into the jack 
 at the back of his neck the cable has the same kind of 
 cerebellum chip we saw inside the plant 
 morpheus 
 this will feel a little weird 
 there are several disturbing noises as he works the 
 needle in 
 we move in as shoulders bunch and his face tightens 
 into a grimace until a loud click fires and his ears pop 
 like when you equalize them underwater 
 he relaxes opening his eyes as we pull back to a feeling 
 of weightlessness inside another place 
 
 int construct 
 neo is standing in an empty space 
 morpheus 
 this is the construct 
 startled neo whips around and finds morpheus now in the 
 room with him 
 morpheus 
 it is our loading program we can load anything from clothes to 
 weapons to training simulations anything we need 
 morpheus walks past neo and when neo turns he sees the 
 two leather chairs from the hotel set up in front of a 
 television 
 morpheus 
 sit down 
 neo stands at the back of the chair as morpheus sits 
 neo 
 right now inside a computer program 
 morpheus 
 wild it 
 hands run over the cracked leather 
 neo 
 this real 
 morpheus 
 what is real how do you define real if talking about 
 your senses what you feel taste smell or see then all 
 talking about are electrical signals interpreted by your brain 
 he picks up a remote control and clicks on the 
 television we drift through the windy city circa 
 morpheus 
 this is the chicago you know chicago as it was at the end of 
 the twentieth century this chicago exists only as part of a 
 simulation that we call the matrix 
 we glide at the television as he changes the channel 
 morpheus 
 you have been living inside vision inside the 
 map not the territory this is chicago as it exists today 
 the sky is an endless sea of black and green bile the 
 earth scorched and split like burnt flesh spreads out 
 beneath us as we enter the television 
 morpheus 
 the desert of the real 
 in the distance we see the ruins of a future chicago 
 protruding from the wasteland like the blackened ribs of 
 a corpse 
 morpheus 
 we are right now miles below the surface the only place 
 humans can survive outside the matrix is underground 
 still moving we turn and find neo and morpheus the 
 chairs now sitting in the middle of the black desert 
 dizzy neo holds onto the chair 
 neo 
 what happened 
 morpheus 
 it started early in the twenty first century with the birth of 
 artificial intelligence a singular consciousness that 
 spawned an entire race of machines 
 in his sunglasses we see storm clouds gather 
 morpheus 
 at first all they wanted was to be treated as equals entitled to the 
 same human inalienable rights whatever they were given it was not enough 
 in the circular window of the glasses explosions light 
 up a bloody battle field 
 morpheus 
 we know who struck first us or them but sometime at the 
 end of the century the battle was joined 
 we move into his glasses and the war surrounds us 
 morpheus 
 the war raged for generations and turned the face of our planet from green and blue to black and red 
 at last we see the sentinels killing machines that are 
 at once terrifying and beautiful they have an organic 
 architecture like a microbiotic organism that is 
 perpetually in motion 
 the sentinel cracks the body armor of a soldier 
 splitting open the soft stearing meat inside 
 morpheus 
 it scorched and burned the sky without the sun the machines 
 sought out a new energy source to survive 
 the sentinel locks up as heat lightning of black ink 
 bursts against the sky spreading into a permanent cloud 
 of stain 
 morpheus 
 they discovered a new form of fusion all that was required to 
 initiate the reaction was a small electric charge throughout human 
 history we have been dependent on machines to survive fate it 
 seems is not without a sense of irony 
 we return to the power plant that neo escaped from where 
 we see human beings looking almost blissful in their 
 gelatin cocoons 
 morpheus 
 the human body generates more bio electricity than a volt 
 battery and over of body heat 
 outside spreading all around the power plant beneath a 
 breathing greenhouse are the growing fields 
 morpheus 
 we are as an energy source easily renewable and completely 
 recyclable the dead liquified and fed intravenously to the living 
 huge reapers are harvesting the crop 
 morpheus 
 all they needed to control this new battery was something to 
 occupy our mind 
 we see inside a clear tubular husk floating in viscous 
 fluid there is a human fetus its soft skull already 
 growing around the 
 morpheus 
 and so they built a prison out of our past wired it to our brains 
 and turned us into slaves 
 we pull back to find the image is now on the television 
 and we are again inside the white space of the construct 
 neo 
 no i believe it not possible 
 morpheus 
 i say that it would be easy neo i just said that it 
 would be the truth 
 the room without walls begins to spin 
 neo

 since the disastrous episode of the pixies professor lockhart had not brought live creatures to class instead he read passages from his books to them and sometimes reenacted some of the more dramatic bits he usually picked harry to help him with these reconstructions so far harry had been forced to play a simple transylvanian villager whom lockhart had cured of a babbling curse a yeti with a head cold and a vampire who had been unable to eat anything except lettuce since lockhart had dealt with him 
 
 harry was hauled to the front of the class during their very next defense against the dark arts lesson this time acting a werewolf if he had a very good reason for keeping lockhart in a good mood he would have refused to do it 
 
 nice loud howl harry exactly and then if believe it i pounced like this slammed him to the floor thus with one hand i managed to hold him down with my other i put my wand to his throat i then screwed up my remaining strength and performed the immensely complex homorphus charm he let out a piteous moan go on harry higher than that good the fur vanished the fangs shrank and he turned back into a man simple yet effective and another village will remember me forever as the hero who delivered them from the monthly terror of werewolf attacks 
 
 the bell rang and lockhart got to his feet 
 
 homework compose a poem about my defeat of the wagga wagga werewolf signed copies of magical me to the author of the best one 
 
 the class began to leave harry returned to the back of the room where ron and hermione were waiting 
 
 ready harry muttered 
 
 wait till gone said hermione nervously all right 
 
 she approached desk a piece of paper clutched tightly in her hand harry and ron right behind her 
 
 er professor lockhart hermione stammered i wanted to to get this book out of the library just for background reading she held out the piece of paper her hand shaking slightly but the thing is in the restricted section of the library so i need a teacher to sign for it sure it would help me understand what you say in gadding with ghouls about venoms 
 
 ah gadding with ghouls said lockhart taking the note from hermione and smiling widely at her possibly my very favorite book you enjoyed it 
 
 oh yes said hermione eagerly so clever the way you trapped that last one with the 
 
 well sure no one will mind me giving the best student of the year a little extra help said lockhart warmly and he pulled out an enormous peacock quill yes nice it he said misreading the revolted look on face i usually save it for 
 
 he scrawled an enormous loopy signature on the note and handed it back to hermione 
 
 so harry said lockhart while hermione folded the note with fumbling fingers and slipped it into her bag the first quidditch match of the season i believe gryffindor against slytherin is it not i hear a useful player i was a seeker too i was asked to try for the national squad but preferred to dedicate my life to the eradication of the dark forces still if ever you feel the need for a little private training hesitate to ask always happy to pass on my expertise to less able players 
 
 harry made an indistinct noise in his throat and then hurried off after ron and hermione 
 
 i believe it he said as the three of them examined the signature on the note he even look at the book we wanted 
 
 because a brainless git said ron but who cares got what we needed 
 
 he is not a brainless git said hermione shrilly as they half ran toward the library 
 
 just because he said you were the best student of the year 
 
 they dropped their voices as they entered the muffled stillness of the library madam pince the librarian was a thin irritable woman who looked like an underfed vulture 
 
 moste potente potions she repeated suspiciously trying to take the note from hermione but hermione let go 
 
 i was wondering if i could keep it she said breathlessly 
 
 oh come on said ron wrenching it from her grasp and thrusting it at madam pince get you another autograph sign anything if it stands still long enough 
 
 madam pince held the note up to the light as though determined to detect a forgery but it passed the test she stalked away between the lofty shelves and returned several minutes later carrying a large and book hermione put it carefully into her bag and they left trying not to walk too quickly or look too guilty 
 
 five minutes later they were barricaded in moaning bathroom once again hermione had overridden objections by pointing out that it was the last place anyone in their right minds would go so they were guaranteed some privacy moaning myrtle was crying noisily in her stall but they were ignoring her and she them 
 
 hermione opened moste potente potions carefully and the three of them bent over the pages it was clear from a glance why it belonged in the restricted section some of the potions had effects almost too gruesome to think about and there were some very unpleasant illustrations which included a man who seemed to have been turned inside out and a witch sprouting several extra pairs of arms out of her head 
 
 here it is said hermione excitedly as she found the page headed the polyjuice potion it was decorated with drawings of people halfway through transforming into other people harry sincerely hoped the artist had imagined the looks of intense pain on their faces 
 
 this is the most complicated potion ever seen said hermione as they scanned the recipe lacewing flies leeches fluxweed and knotgrass she murmured running her finger down the list of ingredients well easy enough in the student we can help ourselves oooh look powdered horn of a bicorn know where going to get that shredded skin of a boomslang be tricky too and of course a bit of whoever we want to change into 
 
 excuse me said ron sharply what mean a bit of whoever changing into drinking nothing with toenails in it 
 
 hermione continued as though she heard him 
 
 we have to worry about that yet though because we add those bits last 
 
 ron turned speechless to harry who had another worry 
 
 realize how much going to have to steal hermione shredded skin of a boomslang definitely not in the we going to do break into private stores i know if this is a good idea 
 
 hermione shut the book with a snap 
 
 well if you two are going to chicken out fine she said there were bright pink patches on her cheeks and her eyes were brighter than usual i want to break rules you know i think threatening is far worse than brewing up a difficult potion but if you want to find out if malfoy go straight to madam pince now and hand the book back in 
 
 
 i never thought id see the day when be persuading us to break rules said ron all right do it but not toenails okay 
 
 how long will it take to make anyway said harry as hermione looking happier opened the book again 
 
 well since the fluxweed has got to be picked at the full moon and the lacewings have got to be stewed for days say be ready in about a month if we can get all the ingredients 
 
 a month said ron malfoy could have attacked half the in the school by then but eyes narrowed dangerously again and he added swiftly but the best plan got so full steam ahead i say 
 
 however while hermione was checking that the coast was clear for them to leave the bathroom ron muttered to harry be a lot less hassle if you can just knock malfoy off his broom tomorrow 
 
 harry woke early on saturday morning and lay for a while thinking about the coming quidditch match he was nervous mainly at the thought of what wood would say if gryffindor lost but also at the idea of facing a team mounted on the fastest racing brooms gold could buy he had never wanted to beat slytherin so badly after half an hour of lying there with his insides churning he got up dressed and went down to breakfast early where he found the rest of the gryffindor team huddled at the long empty table all looking uptight and not speaking much 
 
 as eleven approached the whole school started to make its way down to the quidditch stadium it was a muggy sort of day with a hint of thunder in the air ron and hermione came hurrying over to wish harry good luck as he entered the locker rooms the team pulled on their scarlet gryffindor robes then sat down to listen to usual pep talk 
 
 slytherin has better brooms than us he began no point denying it but got better people on our brooms trained harder than they have been flying in all weathers too true muttered george weasley i been properly dry since august and going to make them rue the day they let that little bit of slime malfoy buy his way onto their team 
 
 chest heaving with emotion wood turned to harry 
 
 be down to you harry to show them that a seeker has to have something more than a rich father get to that snitch before malfoy or die trying harry because got to win today got to 
 
 so no pressure harry said fred winking at him 
 
 as they walked out onto the pitch a roar of noise greeted them mainly cheers because ravenclaw and hufflepuff were anxious to see slytherin beaten but the slytherins in the crowd made their boos and hisses heard too madam hooch the quidditch teacher asked flint and wood to shake hands which they did giving each other threatening stares and gripping rather harder than was necessary 
 
 on my whistle said madam hooch three two one 
 
 with a roar from the crowd to speed them upward the fourteen players rose toward the leaden sky harry flew higher than any of them squinting around for the snitch 
 
 all right there scarhead yelled malfoy shooting underneath him as though to show off the speed of his broom 
 
 harry had no time to reply at that very moment a heavy black bludger came pelting toward him he avoided it so narrowly that he felt it ruffle his hair as it passed 
 
 close one harry said george streaking past him with his club in his hand ready to knock the bludger back toward a slytherin harry saw george give the bludger a powerful whack in the direction of adrian pucey but the bludger changed direction in midair and shot straight for harry again 
 
 harry dropped quickly to avoid it and george managed to hit it hard toward malfoy once again the bludger swerved like a boomerang and shot at head 
 
 harry put on a burst of speed and zoomed toward the other end of the pitch he could hear the bludger whistling along behind him what was going on bludgers never concentrated on one player like this it was their job to try and unseat as many people as possible 
 
 fred weasley was waiting for the bludger at the other end harry ducked as fred swung at the bludger with all his might the bludger was knocked off course 
 
 gotcha fred yelled happily but he was wrong as though it was magnetically attracted to harry the bludger pelted after him once more and harry was forced to fly off at full speed 
 
 it had started to rain harry felt heavy drops fall onto his face splattering onto his glasses he have a clue what was going on in the rest of the game until he heard lee jordan who was commentating say slytherin lead sixty points to zero 
 
 
 the brooms were clearly doing their jobs and meanwhile the mad bludger was doing all it could to knock harry out of the air fred and george were now flying so close to him on either side that harry could see nothing at all except their flailing arms and had no chance to look for the snitch let alone catch it 
 
 tampered with this bludger fred grunted swinging his bat with all his might at it as it launched a new attack on harry 
 
 we need time out said george trying to signal to wood and stop the bludger breaking nose at the same time 
 
 wood had obviously got the message madam whistle rang out and harry fred and george dived for the ground still trying to avoid the mad bludger 
 
 going on said wood as the gryffindor team huddled together while slytherins in the crowd jeered being flattened fred george where were you when that bludger stopped angelina scoring 
 
 we were twenty feet above her stopping the other bludger from murdering harry oliver said george angrily fixed it it leave harry alone it gone for anyone else all game the slytherins must have done something to it 
 
 but the bludgers have been locked in madam office since our last practice and there was nothing wrong with them then said wood anxiously madam hooch was walking toward them over her shoulder harry could see the slytherin team jeering and pointing in his direction 
 
 listen said harry as she came nearer and nearer with you two flying around me all the time the only way going to catch the snitch is if it flies up my sleeve go back to the rest of the team and let me deal with the rogue one 
 
 be thick said fred take your head off 
 
 wood was looking from harry to the weasleys 
 
 oliver this is insane said alicia spinner angrily you let harry deal with that thing on his own ask for an inquiry 
 
 if we stop now have to forfeit the match said harry and not losing to slytherin just because of a crazy bludger come on oliver tell them to leave me alone 
 
 this is all your fault george said angrily to wood get the snitch or die a stupid thing to tell him 
 
 madam hooch had joined them 
 
 ready to resume play she asked wood 
 
 wood looked at the determined look on face 
 
 all right he said fred george you heard harry leave him alone and let him deal with the bludger on his own 
 
 the rain was falling more heavily now on madam whistle harry kicked hard into the air and heard the telltale whoosh of the bludger behind him higher and higher harry climbed he looped and swooped spiraled zigzagged and rolled slightly dizzy he nevertheless kept his eyes wide open rain was speckling his glasses and ran up his nostrils as he hung upside down avoiding another fierce dive from the bludger he could hear laughter from the crowd he knew he must look very stupid but the rogue bludger was heavy and change direction as quickly as harry could he began a kind of ride around the edges of the stadium squinting through the silver sheets of rain to the gryffindor goal posts where adrian pucey was trying to get past wood 
 
 a whistling in ear told him the bludger had just missed him again he turned right over and sped in the opposite direction 
 
 training for the ballet potter yelled malfoy as harry was forced to do a stupid kind of twirl in midair to dodge the bludger and he fled the bludger trailing a few feet behind him and then glaring back at malfoy in hatred he saw it the golden snitch it was hovering inches above left ear and malfoy busy laughing at harry seen it 
 
 for an agonizing moment harry hung in midair not daring to speed toward malfoy in case he looked up and saw the snitch 
 
 wham 
 
 he had stayed still a second too long the bludger had hit him at last smashed into his elbow and harry felt his arm break dimly dazed by the searing pain in his arm he slid sideways on his broom one knee still crooked over it his right arm dangling useless at his side the bludger came pelting back for a second attack this time zooming at his face harry swerved out of the way one idea firmly lodged in his numb brain get to malfoy 
 
 through a haze of rain and pain he dived for the shimmering sneering face below him and saw its eyes widen with fear malfoy thought harry was attacking him 
 
 what the he gasped careening out of way 
 
 harry took his remaining hand off his broom and made a wild snatch he felt his fingers close on the cold snitch but was now only gripping the broom with his legs and there was a yell from the crowd below as he headed straight for the ground trying hard not to pass out 
 
 with a splattering thud he hit the mud and rolled off his broom his arm was hanging at a very strange angle riddled with pain he heard as though from a distance a good deal of whistling and shouting he focused on the snitch clutched in his good hand 
 
 aha he said vaguely won 
 
 and he fainted 
 
 he came around rain falling on his face still lying on the field with someone leaning over him he saw a glitter of teeth 
 
 oh no not you he moaned 
 
 know what saying said lockhart loudly to the anxious crowd of gryffindors pressing around them not to worry harry about to fix your arm 
 
 no said harry keep it like this thanks 
 
 he tried to sit up but the pain was terrible he heard a familiar clicking noise nearby 
 
 i want a photo of this colin he said loudly 
 
 lie back harry said lockhart soothingly a simple charm used countless times 
 
 why i just go to the hospital wing said harry through clenched teeth 
 
 he should really professor said a muddy wood who help grinning even though his seeker was injured great capture harry really spectacular your best yet say 
 
 through the thicket of legs around him harry spotted fred and george weasley wrestling the rogue bludger into a box it was still putting up a terrific fight 
 
 stand back said lockhart who was rolling up his sleeves 
 
 no said harry weakly but lockhart was twirling his wand and a second later had directed it straight at arm 
 
 a strange and unpleasant sensation started at shoulder and spread all the way down to his fingertips it felt as though his arm was being deflated he dare look at what was happening he had shut his eyes his face turned away from his arm but his worst fears were realized as the people above him gasped and colin creevey began clicking away madly his arm hurt anymore nor did it feel remotely like an arm 
 
 ah said lockhart yes well that can sometimes happen but the point is the bones are no longer broken the thing to bear in mind so harry just toddle up to the hospital wing ah mr weasley miss granger would you escort him and madam pomfrey will be able to er tidy you up a bit 
 
 as harry got to his feet he felt strangely lopsided taking a deep breath he looked down at his right side what he saw nearly made him pass out again 
 
 poking out of the end of his robes was what looked like a thick rubber glove he tried to move his fingers nothing happened 
 
 lockhart mended bones he had removed them 
 
 madam pomfrey at all pleased 
 
 you should have come straight to me she raged holding up the sad limp remainder of what half an hour before had been a working arm i can mend bones in a second but growing them back 
 
 you will be able to you said harry desperately 
 
 be able to certainly but it will be painful said madam pomfrey grimly throwing harry a pair of pajamas have to stay the night 
 
 hermione waited outside the curtain drawn around bed while ron helped him into his pajamas it took a while to stuff the rubbery boneless arm into a sleeve 
 
 how can you stick up for lockhart now hermione eh ron called through the curtain as he pulled limp fingers through the cuff if harry had wanted deboning he would have asked 
 
 anyone can make a mistake said hermione and it hurt anymore does it harry 
 
 no said harry getting into bed but it do anything else either 
 
 as he swung himself onto the bed his arm flapped pointlessly 
 
 hermione and madam pomfrey came around the curtain madam pomfrey was holding a large bottle of something labeled 
 
 in for a rough night she said pouring out a steaming beakerful and handing it to him regrowing bones is a nasty business 
 
 so was taking the it burned mouth and throat as it went down making him cough and splutter still about dangerous sports and inept teachers madam pomfrey retreated leaving ron and hermione to help harry gulp down some water we won though said ron a grin breaking across his face that was some catch you made face he looked ready to kill 
 
 i want to know how he fixed that bludger said hermione darkly we can add that to the list of questions ask him when taken the polyjuice potion said harry sinking back onto his pillows i hope it tastes better than this stuff 
 
 if got bits of slytherins in it got to be joking said ron 
 
 the door of the hospital wing burst open at that moment filthy and soaking wet the rest of the gryffindor team had arrived to see harry unbelievable flying harry said george just seen marcus flint yelling at malfoy something about having the snitch on top of his head and not noticing malfoy seem too happy they had brought cakes sweets and bottles of pumpkin juice they gathered around bed and were just getting started on what promised to be a good party when madam pomfrey came storming over shouting this boy needs rest got bones to regrow out out and harry was left alone with nothing to distract him from the stabbing pains in his limp arm 
 
 hours and hours later harry woke quite suddenly in the pitch blackness and gave a small yelp of pain his arm now felt full of large splinters for a second he thought that was what had woken him then with a thrill of horror he realized that someone was sponging his forehead in the dark 
 
 get off he said loudly and then dobby 
 
 the goggling tennis ball eyes were peering at harry through the darkness a single tear was running down his long pointed nose 
 
 harry potter came back to school he whispered miserably dobby warned and warned harry potter ah sir why you heed dobby why harry potter go back home when he missed the train 
 
 harry heaved himself up on his pillows and pushed sponge away 
 
 you doing here he said and how did you know i missed the train 
 
 lip trembled and harry was seized by a sudden suspicion 
 
 it was you he said slowly you stopped the barrier from letting us through 
 
 indeed yes sir said dobby nodding his head vigorously ears flapping dobby hid and watched for harry potter and sealed the gateway and dobby had to iron his hands afterward he showed harry ten long bandaged fingers but dobby care sir for he thought harry potter was safe and never did dobby dream that harry potter would get to school another way 
 
 he was rocking backward and forward shaking his ugly head 
 
 dobby was so shocked when he heard harry potter was back at hogwarts he let his dinner burn such a flogging dobby never had sir 
 
 harry slumped back onto his pillows 
 
 you nearly got ron and me expelled he said fiercely better get lost before my bones come back dobby or i might strangle you 
 
 dobby smiled weakly 
 
 dobby is used to death threats sir dobby gets them five times a day at home 
 
 he blew his nose on a corner of the filthy pillowcase he wore looking so pathetic that harry felt his anger ebb away in spite of himself 
 
 why wear that thing dobby he asked curiously 
 
 this sir said dobby plucking at the pillowcase tis a mark of the enslavement sir dobby can only be freed if his masters present him with clothes sir the family is careful not to pass dobby even a sock sir for then he would be free to leave their house forever 
 
 dobby mopped his bulging eyes and said suddenly harry potter must go home dobby thought his bludger would be enough to make 
 
 your bludger said harry anger rising once more what mean your bludger you made that bludger try and kill me 
 
 not kill you sir never kill you said dobby shocked dobby wants to save harry life better sent home grievously injured than remain here sir dobby only wanted harry potter hurt enough to be sent home 
 
 oh is that all said harry angrily i suppose going to tell me why you wanted me sent home in pieces 
 
 ah if harry potter only knew dobby groaned more tears dripping onto his ragged pillowcase if he knew what he means to us to the lowly the enslaved we dregs of the magical world dobby remembers how it was when was at the height of his powers sir we were treated like vermin sir of course dobby is still treated like that sir he admitted drying his face on the pillowcase but mostly sir life has improved for my kind since you triumphed over harry potter survived and the dark power was broken and it was a new dawn sir and harry potter shone like a beacon of hope for those of us who thought the dark days would never end sit and now at hogwarts terrible things are to happen are perhaps happening already and dobby cannot let harry potter stay here now that history is to repeat itself now that the chamber of secrets is open once more 
 
 dobby froze horrorstruck then grabbed water jug from his bedside table and cracked it over his own head toppling out of sight a second later he crawled back onto the bed muttering bad dobby very bad dobby 
 
 so there is a chamber of secrets harry whispered and did you say been opened before tell me dobby 
 
 he seized the bony wrist as hand inched toward the water jug but not how can i be in danger from the chamber 
 
 ah sir ask no more ask no more of poor dobby stammered the elf his eyes huge in the dark dark deeds are planned in this place but harry potter must not be here when they happen go home harry potter go home harry potter must not meddle in this sir tis too dangerous 
 
 who is it dobby harry said keeping a firm hold on wrist to stop him from hitting himself with the water jug again opened it who opened it last time 
 
 dobby sir dobby dobby tell squealed the elf go home harry potter go home 
 
 not going anywhere said harry fiercely one of my best friends is be first in line if the chamber really has been opened 
 
 harry potter risks his own life for his friends moaned dobby in a kind of miserable ecstasy so noble so valiant but he must save himself he must harry potter must not 
 
 dobby suddenly froze his bat ears quivering harry heard it too there were footsteps coming down the passageway outside 
 
 dobby must go breathed the elf terrified there was a loud crack and fist was suddenly clenched on thin air he slumped back into bed his eyes on the dark doorway to the hospital wing as the footsteps drew nearer 
 
 next moment dumbledore was backing into the dormitory wearing a long woolly dressing gown and a nightcap he was carrying one end of what looked like a statue professor mcgonagall appeared a second later carrying its feet together they heaved it onto a bed 
 
 get madam pomfrey whispered dumbledore and professor mcgonagall hurried past the end of bed out of sight harry lay quite still pretending to be asleep he heard urgent voices and then professor mcgonagall swept back into view closely followed by madam pomfrey who was pulling a cardigan on over her nightdress he heard a sharp intake of breath 
 
 what happened madam pomfrey whispered to dumbledore bending over the statue on the bed 
 
 another attack said dumbledore minerva found him on the stairs 
 
 there was a bunch of grapes next to him said professor mcgonagall we think he was trying to sneak up here to visit potter 
 
 stomach gave a horrible lurch slowly and carefully he raised himself a few inches so he could look at the statue on the bed a ray of moonlight lay across its staring face 
 
 it was colin creevey his eyes were wide and his hands were stuck up in front of him holding his camera 
 
 petrified whispered madam pomfrey 
 
 yes said professor mcgonagall but i shudder to think if albus been on the way downstairs for hot chocolate who knows what might have 
 
 the three of them stared down at colin then dumbledore leaned forward and wrenched the camera out of rigid grip 
 
 you think he managed to get a picture of his attacker said professor mcgonagall eagerly 
 
 dumbledore answer he opened the back of the camera 
 
 good gracious said madam pomfrey 
 
 a jet of steam had hissed out of the camera harry three beds away caught the acrid smell of burnt plastic 
 
 melted said madam pomfrey wonderingly all melted 
 
 what does this mean albus professor mcgonagall asked urgently 
 
 it means said dumbledore that the chamber of secrets is indeed open again 
 
 madam pomfrey clapped a hand to her mouth professor mcgonagall stared at dumbledore 
 
 but albus surely who 
 
 the question is not who said dumbledore his eyes on colin the question is how and from what harry could see of professor shadowy face she understand this any better than he did 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the chamber of secrets

 harry woke early on saturday morning and lay for a while thinking about the coming quidditch match he was nervous mainly at the thought of what wood would say if gryffindor lost but also at the idea of facing a team mounted on the fastest racing brooms gold could buy he had never wanted to beat slytherin so badly after half an hour of lying there with his insides churning he got up dressed and went down to breakfast early where he found the rest of the gryffindor team huddled at the long empty table all looking uptight and not speaking much 
 
 as eleven approached the whole school started to make its way down to the quidditch stadium it was a muggy sort of day with a hint of thunder in the air ron and hermione came hurrying over to wish harry good luck as he entered the locker rooms the team pulled on their scarlet gryffindor robes then sat down to listen to usual pep talk 
 
 slytherin has better brooms than us he began no point denying it but got better people on our brooms trained harder than they have been flying in all weathers too true muttered george weasley i been properly dry since august and going to make them rue the day they let that little bit of slime malfoy buy his way onto their team 
 
 chest heaving with emotion wood turned to harry 
 
 be down to you harry to show them that a seeker has to have something more than a rich father get to that snitch before malfoy or die trying harry because got to win today got to 
 
 so no pressure harry said fred winking at him 
 
 as they walked out onto the pitch a roar of noise greeted them mainly cheers because ravenclaw and hufflepuff were anxious to see slytherin beaten but the slytherins in the crowd made their boos and hisses heard too madam hooch the quidditch teacher asked flint and wood to shake hands which they did giving each other threatening stares and gripping rather harder than was necessary 
 
 on my whistle said madam hooch three two one 
 
 with a roar from the crowd to speed them upward the fourteen players rose toward the leaden sky harry flew higher than any of them squinting around for the snitch 
 
 all right there scarhead yelled malfoy shooting underneath him as though to show off the speed of his broom 
 
 harry had no time to reply at that very moment a heavy black bludger came pelting toward him he avoided it so narrowly that he felt it ruffle his hair as it passed 
 
 close one harry said george streaking past him with his club in his hand ready to knock the bludger back toward a slytherin harry saw george give the bludger a powerful whack in the direction of adrian pucey but the bludger changed direction in midair and shot straight for harry again 
 
 harry dropped quickly to avoid it and george managed to hit it hard toward malfoy once again the bludger swerved like a boomerang and shot at head 
 
 harry put on a burst of speed and zoomed toward the other end of the pitch he could hear the bludger whistling along behind him what was going on bludgers never concentrated on one player like this it was their job to try and unseat as many people as possible 
 
 fred weasley was waiting for the bludger at the other end harry ducked as fred swung at the bludger with all his might the bludger was knocked off course 
 
 gotcha fred yelled happily but he was wrong as though it was magnetically attracted to harry the bludger pelted after him once more and harry was forced to fly off at full speed 
 
 it had started to rain harry felt heavy drops fall onto his face splattering onto his glasses he have a clue what was going on in the rest of the game until he heard lee jordan who was commentating say slytherin lead sixty points to zero 
 
 
 the brooms were clearly doing their jobs and meanwhile the mad bludger was doing all it could to knock harry out of the air fred and george were now flying so close to him on either side that harry could see nothing at all except their flailing arms and had no chance to look for the snitch let alone catch it 
 
 tampered with this bludger fred grunted swinging his bat with all his might at it as it launched a new attack on harry 
 
 we need time out said george trying to signal to wood and stop the bludger breaking nose at the same time 
 
 wood had obviously got the message madam whistle rang out and harry fred and george dived for the ground still trying to avoid the mad bludger 
 
 going on said wood as the gryffindor team huddled together while slytherins in the crowd jeered being flattened fred george where were you when that bludger stopped angelina scoring 
 
 we were twenty feet above her stopping the other bludger from murdering harry oliver said george angrily fixed it it leave harry alone it gone for anyone else all game the slytherins must have done something to it 
 
 but the bludgers have been locked in madam office since our last practice and there was nothing wrong with them then said wood anxiously madam hooch was walking toward them over her shoulder harry could see the slytherin team jeering and pointing in his direction 
 
 listen said harry as she came nearer and nearer with you two flying around me all the time the only way going to catch the snitch is if it flies up my sleeve go back to the rest of the team and let me deal with the rogue one 
 
 be thick said fred take your head off 
 
 wood was looking from harry to the weasleys 
 
 oliver this is insane said alicia spinner angrily you let harry deal with that thing on his own ask for an inquiry 
 
 if we stop now have to forfeit the match said harry and not losing to slytherin just because of a crazy bludger come on oliver tell them to leave me alone 
 
 this is all your fault george said angrily to wood get the snitch or die a stupid thing to tell him 
 
 madam hooch had joined them 
 
 ready to resume play she asked wood 
 
 wood looked at the determined look on face 
 
 all right he said fred george you heard harry leave him alone and let him deal with the bludger on his own 
 
 the rain was falling more heavily now on madam whistle harry kicked hard into the air and heard the telltale whoosh of the bludger behind him higher and higher harry climbed he looped and swooped spiraled zigzagged and rolled slightly dizzy he nevertheless kept his eyes wide open rain was speckling his glasses and ran up his nostrils as he hung upside down avoiding another fierce dive from the bludger he could hear laughter from the crowd he knew he must look very stupid but the rogue bludger was heavy and change direction as quickly as harry could he began a kind of ride around the edges of the stadium squinting through the silver sheets of rain to the gryffindor goal posts where adrian pucey was trying to get past wood 
 
 a whistling in ear told him the bludger had just missed him again he turned right over and sped in the opposite direction 
 
 training for the ballet potter yelled malfoy as harry was forced to do a stupid kind of twirl in midair to dodge the bludger and he fled the bludger trailing a few feet behind him and then glaring back at malfoy in hatred he saw it the golden snitch it was hovering inches above left ear and malfoy busy laughing at harry seen it 
 
 for an agonizing moment harry hung in midair not daring to speed toward malfoy in case he looked up and saw the snitch 
 
 wham 
 
 he had stayed still a second too long the bludger had hit him at last smashed into his elbow and harry felt his arm break dimly dazed by the searing pain in his arm he slid sideways on his broom one knee still crooked over it his right arm dangling useless at his side the bludger came pelting back for a second attack this time zooming at his face harry swerved out of the way one idea firmly lodged in his numb brain get to malfoy 
 
 through a haze of rain and pain he dived for the shimmering sneering face below him and saw its eyes widen with fear malfoy thought harry was attacking him 
 
 what the he gasped careening out of way 
 
 harry took his remaining hand off his broom and made a wild snatch he felt his fingers close on the cold snitch but was now only gripping the broom with his legs and there was a yell from the crowd below as he headed straight for the ground trying hard not to pass out 
 
 with a splattering thud he hit the mud and rolled off his broom his arm was hanging at a very strange angle riddled with pain he heard as though from a distance a good deal of whistling and shouting he focused on the snitch clutched in his good hand 
 
 aha he said vaguely won 
 
 and he fainted 
 
 he came around rain falling on his face still lying on the field with someone leaning over him he saw a glitter of teeth 
 
 oh no not you he moaned 
 
 know what saying said lockhart loudly to the anxious crowd of gryffindors pressing around them not to worry harry about to fix your arm 
 
 no said harry keep it like this thanks 
 
 he tried to sit up but the pain was terrible he heard a familiar clicking noise nearby 
 
 i want a photo of this colin he said loudly 
 
 lie back harry said lockhart soothingly a simple charm used countless times 
 
 why i just go to the hospital wing said harry through clenched teeth 
 
 he should really professor said a muddy wood who help grinning even though his seeker was injured great capture harry really spectacular your best yet say 
 
 through the thicket of legs around him harry spotted fred and george weasley wrestling the rogue bludger into a box it was still putting up a terrific fight 
 
 stand back said lockhart who was rolling up his sleeves 
 
 no said harry weakly but lockhart was twirling his wand and a second later had directed it straight at arm 
 
 a strange and unpleasant sensation started at shoulder and spread all the way down to his fingertips it felt as though his arm was being deflated he dare look at what was happening he had shut his eyes his face turned away from his arm but his worst fears were realized as the people above him gasped and colin creevey began clicking away madly his arm hurt anymore nor did it feel remotely like an arm 
 
 ah said lockhart yes well that can sometimes happen but the point is the bones are no longer broken the thing to bear in mind so harry just toddle up to the hospital wing ah mr weasley miss granger would you escort him and madam pomfrey will be able to er tidy you up a bit 
 
 as harry got to his feet he felt strangely lopsided taking a deep breath he looked down at his right side what he saw nearly made him pass out again 
 
 poking out of the end of his robes was what looked like a thick rubber glove he tried to move his fingers nothing happened 
 
 lockhart mended bones he had removed them 
 
 madam pomfrey at all pleased 
 
 you should have come straight to me she raged holding up the sad limp remainder of what half an hour before had been a working arm i can mend bones in a second but growing them back 
 
 you will be able to you said harry desperately 
 
 be able to certainly but it will be painful said madam pomfrey grimly throwing harry a pair of pajamas have to stay the night 
 
 hermione waited outside the curtain drawn around bed while ron helped him into his pajamas it took a while to stuff the rubbery boneless arm into a sleeve 
 
 how can you stick up for lockhart now hermione eh ron called through the curtain as he pulled limp fingers through the cuff if harry had wanted deboning he would have asked 
 
 anyone can make a mistake said hermione and it hurt anymore does it harry 
 
 no said harry getting into bed but it do anything else either 
 
 as he swung himself onto the bed his arm flapped pointlessly 
 
 hermione and madam pomfrey came around the curtain madam pomfrey was holding a large bottle of something labeled 
 
 in for a rough night she said pouring out a steaming beakerful and handing it to him regrowing bones is a nasty business 
 
 so was taking the it burned mouth and throat as it went down making him cough and splutter still about dangerous sports and inept teachers madam pomfrey retreated leaving ron and hermione to help harry gulp down some water we won though said ron a grin breaking across his face that was some catch you made face he looked ready to kill 
 
 i want to know how he fixed that bludger said hermione darkly we can add that to the list of questions ask him when taken the polyjuice potion said harry sinking back onto his pillows i hope it tastes better than this stuff 
 
 if got bits of slytherins in it got to be joking said ron 
 
 the door of the hospital wing burst open at that moment filthy and soaking wet the rest of the gryffindor team had arrived to see harry unbelievable flying harry said george just seen marcus flint yelling at malfoy something about having the snitch on top of his head and not noticing malfoy seem too happy they had brought cakes sweets and bottles of pumpkin juice they gathered around bed and were just getting started on what promised to be a good party when madam pomfrey came storming over shouting this boy needs rest got bones to regrow out out and harry was left alone with nothing to distract him from the stabbing pains in his limp arm 
 
 hours and hours later harry woke quite suddenly in the pitch blackness and gave a small yelp of pain his arm now felt full of large splinters for a second he thought that was what had woken him then with a thrill of horror he realized that someone was sponging his forehead in the dark 
 
 get off he said loudly and then dobby 
 
 the goggling tennis ball eyes were peering at harry through the darkness a single tear was running down his long pointed nose 
 
 harry potter came back to school he whispered miserably dobby warned and warned harry potter ah sir why you heed dobby why harry potter go back home when he missed the train 
 
 harry heaved himself up on his pillows and pushed sponge away 
 
 you doing here he said and how did you know i missed the train 
 
 lip trembled and harry was seized by a sudden suspicion 
 
 it was you he said slowly you stopped the barrier from letting us through 
 
 indeed yes sir said dobby nodding his head vigorously ears flapping dobby hid and watched for harry potter and sealed the gateway and dobby had to iron his hands afterward he showed harry ten long bandaged fingers but dobby care sir for he thought harry potter was safe and never did dobby dream that harry potter would get to school another way 
 
 he was rocking backward and forward shaking his ugly head 
 
 dobby was so shocked when he heard harry potter was back at hogwarts he let his dinner burn such a flogging dobby never had sir 
 
 harry slumped back onto his pillows 
 
 you nearly got ron and me expelled he said fiercely better get lost before my bones come back dobby or i might strangle you 
 
 dobby smiled weakly 
 
 dobby is used to death threats sir dobby gets them five times a day at home 
 
 he blew his nose on a corner of the filthy pillowcase he wore looking so pathetic that harry felt his anger ebb away in spite of himself 
 
 why wear that thing dobby he asked curiously 
 
 this sir said dobby plucking at the pillowcase tis a mark of the enslavement sir dobby can only be freed if his masters present him with clothes sir the family is careful not to pass dobby even a sock sir for then he would be free to leave their house forever 
 
 dobby mopped his bulging eyes and said suddenly harry potter must go home dobby thought his bludger would be enough to make 
 
 your bludger said harry anger rising once more what mean your bludger you made that bludger try and kill me 
 
 not kill you sir never kill you said dobby shocked dobby wants to save harry life better sent home grievously injured than remain here sir dobby only wanted harry potter hurt enough to be sent home 
 
 oh is that all said harry angrily i suppose going to tell me why you wanted me sent home in pieces 
 
 ah if harry potter only knew dobby groaned more tears dripping onto his ragged pillowcase if he knew what he means to us to the lowly the enslaved we dregs of the magical world dobby remembers how it was when was at the height of his powers sir we were treated like vermin sir of course dobby is still treated like that sir he admitted drying his face on the pillowcase but mostly sir life has improved for my kind since you triumphed over harry potter survived and the dark power was broken and it was a new dawn sir and harry potter shone like a beacon of hope for those of us who thought the dark days would never end sit and now at hogwarts terrible things are to happen are perhaps happening already and dobby cannot let harry potter stay here now that history is to repeat itself now that the chamber of secrets is open once more 
 
 dobby froze horrorstruck then grabbed water jug from his bedside table and cracked it over his own head toppling out of sight a second later he crawled back onto the bed muttering bad dobby very bad dobby 
 
 so there is a chamber of secrets harry whispered and did you say been opened before tell me dobby 
 
 he seized the bony wrist as hand inched toward the water jug but not how can i be in danger from the chamber 
 
 ah sir ask no more ask no more of poor dobby stammered the elf his eyes huge in the dark dark deeds are planned in this place but harry potter must not be here when they happen go home harry potter go home harry potter must not meddle in this sir tis too dangerous 
 
 who is it dobby harry said keeping a firm hold on wrist to stop him from hitting himself with the water jug again opened it who opened it last time 
 
 dobby sir dobby dobby tell squealed the elf go home harry potter go home 
 
 not going anywhere said harry fiercely one of my best friends is be first in line if the chamber really has been opened 
 
 harry potter risks his own life for his friends moaned dobby in a kind of miserable ecstasy so noble so valiant but he must save himself he must harry potter must not 
 
 dobby suddenly froze his bat ears quivering harry heard it too there were footsteps coming down the passageway outside 
 
 dobby must go breathed the elf terrified there was a loud crack and fist was suddenly clenched on thin air he slumped back into bed his eyes on the dark doorway to the hospital wing as the footsteps drew nearer 
 
 next moment dumbledore was backing into the dormitory wearing a long woolly dressing gown and a nightcap he was carrying one end of what looked like a statue professor mcgonagall appeared a second later carrying its feet together they heaved it onto a bed 
 
 get madam pomfrey whispered dumbledore and professor mcgonagall hurried past the end of bed out of sight harry lay quite still pretending to be asleep he heard urgent voices and then professor mcgonagall swept back into view closely followed by madam pomfrey who was pulling a cardigan on over her nightdress he heard a sharp intake of breath 
 
 what happened madam pomfrey whispered to dumbledore bending over the statue on the bed 
 
 another attack said dumbledore minerva found him on the stairs 
 
 there was a bunch of grapes next to him said professor mcgonagall we think he was trying to sneak up here to visit potter 
 
 stomach gave a horrible lurch slowly and carefully he raised himself a few inches so he could look at the statue on the bed a ray of moonlight lay across its staring face 
 
 it was colin creevey his eyes were wide and his hands were stuck up in front of him holding his camera 
 
 petrified whispered madam pomfrey 
 
 yes said professor mcgonagall but i shudder to think if albus been on the way downstairs for hot chocolate who knows what might have 
 
 the three of them stared down at colin then dumbledore leaned forward and wrenched the camera out of rigid grip 
 
 you think he managed to get a picture of his attacker said professor mcgonagall eagerly 
 
 dumbledore answer he opened the back of the camera 
 
 good gracious said madam pomfrey 
 
 a jet of steam had hissed out of the camera harry three beds away caught the acrid smell of burnt plastic 
 
 melted said madam pomfrey wonderingly all melted 
 
 what does this mean albus professor mcgonagall asked urgently 
 
 it means said dumbledore that the chamber of secrets is indeed open again 
 
 madam pomfrey clapped a hand to her mouth professor mcgonagall stared at dumbledore 
 
 but albus surely who 
 
 the question is not who said dumbledore his eyes on colin the question is how and from what harry could see of professor shadowy face she understand this any better than he did 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the chamber of secrets 
 

lionfish nov chapter ten the mapcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 madam pomfrey insisted on keeping harry in the hospital wing for the rest of the weekend he argue or complain but he let her throw away the shattered remnants of his nimbus two thousand he knew he was being stupid knew that the nimbus was beyond repair but harry help it he felt as though lost one of his best friends 
 
 he had a stream of visitors all intent on cheering him up hagrid sent him a bunch of earwiggy flowers that looked like yellow cabbages and ginny weasley blushing furiously turned up with a card she had made herself which sang shrilly unless harry kept it shut under his bowl of fruit the gryffindor team visited again on sunday morning this time accompanied by wood who told harry in a hollow dead sort of voice that he blame him in the slightest ron and hermione left bedside only at night but nothing anyone said or did could make harry feel any better because they knew only half of what was troubling him 
 
 he told anyone about the grim not even ron and hermione because he knew ron would panic and hermione would scoff the fact remained however that it had now appeared twice and both appearances had been followed by accidents the first time he had nearly been run over by the knight bus the second fallen fifty feet from his broomstick was the grim going to haunt him until he actually died was he going to spend the rest of his life looking over his shoulder for the beast 
 
 and then there were the dementors harry felt sick and humiliated every time he thought of them everyone said the dementors were horrible but no one else collapsed every time they went near one no one else heard echoes in their head of their dying parents 
 
 because harry knew who that screaming voice belonged to now he had heard her words heard them over and over again during the night hours in the hospital wing while he lay awake staring at the strips of moonlight on the ceiling when the dementors approached him he heard the last moments of his life her attempts to protect him harry from lord voldemort and laughter before he murdered herharry dozed fitfully sinking into dreams full of clammy rotted hands and petrified pleading jerking awake to dwell again on his voice 
 
 
 
 it was a relief to return to the noise and bustle of the main school on monday where he was forced to think about other things even if he had to endure draco taunting malfoy was almost beside himself with glee at defeat he had finally taken off his bandages and celebrated having the full use of both arms again by doing spirited imitations of harry falling off his broom malfoy spent much of their next potions class doing dementor imitations across the dungeon ron finally cracked and flung a large slippery crocodile heart at malfoy which hit him in the face and caused snape to take fifty points from gryffindor 
 
 if teaching defense against the dark arts again skiving off said ron as they headed toward classroom after lunch check in there hermione 
 
 hermione peered around the classroom door 
 
 okay 
 
 professor lupin was back at work it certainly looked as though he had been ill his old robes were hanging more loosely on him and there were dark shadows beneath his eyes nevertheless he smiled at the class as they took their seats and they burst at once into an explosion of complaints about behavior while lupin had been ill 
 
 not fair he was only filling in why should he give us homework 
 
 we know anything about werewolves 
 
 two rolls of parchment 
 
 did you tell professor snape we covered them yet lupin asked frowning slightly 
 
 the babble broke out again 
 
 yes but he said we were really behind 
 
 he listen 
 
 two rolls of parchment 
 
 professor lupin smiled at the look of indignation on every face 
 
 worry speak to professor snape you have to do the essay 
 
 oh no said hermione looking very disappointed already finished it 
 
 they had a very enjoyable lesson professor lupin had brought along a glass box containing a hinkypunk a little creature who looked as though he were made of wisps of smoke rather frail and harmless looking 
 
 lures travelers into bogs said professor lupin as they took notes you notice the lantern dangling from his hand hops ahead people follow the light then 
 
 the hinkypunk made a horrible squelching noise against the glass 
 
 when the bell rang everyone gathered up their things and headed for the door harry among them but 
 
 wait a moment harry lupin called like a word 
 
 harry doubled back and watched professor lupin covering the box with a cloth 
 
 i heard about the match said lupin turning back to his desk and starting to pile books into his briefcase and sorry about your broomstick is there any chance of fixing it 
 
 no said harry the tree smashed it to bits 
 
 lupin sighed 
 
 they planted the whomping willow the same year that i arrived at hogwarts people used to play a game trying to get near enough to touch the trunk in the end a boy called davey gudgeon nearly lost an eye and we were forbidden to go near it no broomstick would have a chance 
 
 did you hear about the dementors too said harry with difficulty 
 
 lupin looked at him quickly 
 
 yes i did i think any of us have seen professor dumbledore that angry they have been growing restless for some timefurious at his refusal to let them inside the groundsi suppose they were the reason you fell 
 
 yes said harry he hesitated and then the question he had to ask burst from him before he could stop himself why why do they affect me like that am i just 
 
 it has nothing to do with weakness said professor lupin sharply as though he had read mind the dementors affect you worse than the others because there are horrors in your past that the others have 
 
 a ray of wintry sunlight fell across the classroom illuminating gray hairs and the lines on his young face 
 
 dementors are among the foulest creatures that walk this earth they infest the darkest filthiest places they glory in decay and despair they drain peace hope and happiness out of the air around them even muggles feel their presence though they see them get too near a dementor and every good feeling every happy memory will be sucked out of you if it can the dementor will feed on you long enough to reduce you to something like itself and evil be left with nothing but the worst experiences of your life and the worst that happened to you harry is enough to make anyone fall off their broom you have nothing to feel ashamed of 
 
 when they get near me harry stared at desk his throat tight i can hear voldemort murdering my mum 
 
 lupin made a sudden motion with his arm as though to grip shoulder but thought better of it there was a silence then 
 
 why did they have to come to the match said harry bitterly 
 
 getting hungry said lupin coolly shutting his briefcase with a snap dumbledore let them into the school so their supply of human prey has dried upi think they could resist the large crowd around the quidditch field all that excitementemotions running highit was their idea of a feast 
 
 azkaban must be terrible harry muttered lupin nodded grimly 
 
 the fortress is set on a tiny island way out to sea but they need walls and water to keep the prisoners in not when all trapped inside their own heads incapable of a single cheery thought most of them go mad within weeks 
 
 but sirius black escaped from them harry said slowly he got away 
 
 briefcase slipped from the desk he had to stoop quickly to catch it 
 
 yes he said straightening up black must have found a way to fight them i have believed it possibledementors are supposed to drain a wizard of his powers if he is left with them too long 
 
 you made that dementor on the train back off said harry suddenly 
 
 there are certain defenses one can use said lupin but there was only one dementor on the train the more there are the more difficult it becomes to resist 
 
 what defenses said harry at once can you teach me 
 
 i pretend to be an expert at fighting dementors harry quite the contrary 
 
 but if the dementors come to another quidditch match i need to be able to fight them 
 
 lupin looked into determined face hesitated then said wellall right try and help but have to wait until next term afraid i have a lot to do before the holidays i chose a very inconvenient time to fall ill 
 
 
 
 what with the promise of lessons from lupin the thought that he might never have to hear his death again and the fact that ravenclaw flattened hufflepuff in their quidditch match at the end of november mood took a definite upturn gryffindor were not out of the running after all although they could not afford to lose another match wood became repossessed of his manic energy and worked his team as hard as ever in the chilly haze of rain that persisted into december harry saw no hint of a dementor within the grounds anger seemed to be keeping them at their stations at the entrances 
 
 two weeks before the end of the term the sky lightened suddenly to a dazzling opaline white and the muddy grounds were revealed one morning covered in glittering frost inside the castle there was a buzz of christmas in the air professor flitwick the charms teacher had already decorated his classroom with shimmering lights that turned out to be real fluttering fairies the students were all happily discussing their plans for the holidays both ron and hermione had decided to remain at hogwarts and though ron said it was because he stand two weeks with percy and hermione insisted she needed to use the library harry fooled they were doing it to keep him company and he was very grateful 
 
 to delight except there was to be another hogsmeade trip on the very last weekend of the term 
 
 we can do all our christmas shopping there said hermione mum and dad would really love those toothflossing stringmints from honeydukes 
 
 resigned to the fact that he would be the only third year staying behind again harry borrowed a copy of which broomstick from wood and decided to spend the day reading up on the different makes he had been riding one of the school brooms at team practice an ancient shooting star which was very slow and jerky he definitely needed a new broom of his own 
 
 on the saturday morning of the hogsmeade trip harry bid to ron and hermione who were wrapped in cloaks and scarves then turned up the marble staircase alone and headed back toward gryffindor tower snow had started to fall outside the windows and the castle was very still and quiet 
 
 psst harry 
 
 he turned halfway along the corridor to see fred and george peering out at him from behind a statue of a humpbacked witch 
 
 what are you doing said harry curiously how come not going to hogsmeade 
 
 come to give you a bit of festive cheer before we go said fred with a mysterious wink come in here 
 
 he nodded toward an empty classroom to the left of the statue harry followed fred and george inside george closed the door quietly and then turned beaming to look at harry 
 
 early christmas present for you harry he said 
 
 fred pulled something from inside his cloak with a flourish and laid it on one of the desks it was a large square very worn piece of parchment with nothing written on it harry suspecting one of fred and jokes stared at it 
 
 that supposed to be 
 
 this harry is the secret of our success said george patting the parchment fondly 
 
 a wrench giving it to you said fred but we decided last night your greater than ours 
 
 anyway we know it by heart said george we bequeath it to you we really need it anymore 
 
 and what do i need with a bit of old parchment said harry 
 
 a bit of old parchment said fred closing his eyes with a grimace as though harry had mortally offended him explain george 
 
 wellwhen we were in our first year harry young carefree and innocent 
 
 harry snorted he doubted whether fred and george had ever been innocent 
 
 c well more innocent than we are now we got into a spot of bother with filch 
 
 we let off a dungbomb in the corridor and it upset him for some reason 
 
 so he hauled us off to his office and started threatening us with the usual 
 
 detention 
 
 disembowelment 
 
 and we help noticing a drawer in one of his filing cabinets marked confiscated and highly dangerous 
 
 tell me said harry starting to grin 
 
 well what would done said fred george caused a diversion by dropping another dungbomb i whipped the drawer open and grabbed this 
 
 not as bad as it sounds you know said george we reckon filch ever found out how to work it he probably suspected what it was though or he have confiscated it 
 
 and you know how to work it 
 
 oh yes said fred smirking this little taught us more than all the teachers in this school 
 
 winding me up said harry looking at the ragged old bit of parchment 
 
 oh are we said george 
 
 he took out his wand touched the parchment lightly and said i solemnly swear that i am up to no good 
 
 and at once thin ink lines began to spread like a web from the point that wand had touched they joined each other they crisscrossed they fanned into every corner of the parchment then words began to blossom across the top great curly green words that proclaimed 
 
 messrs moony wormtail padfoot and prongs 
 purveyors of aids to magical 
 are proud to present 
 the map 
 it was a map showing every detail of the hogwarts castle and grounds but the truly remarkable thing were the tiny ink dots moving around it each labeled with a name in minuscule writing astounded harry bent over it a labeled dot in the top left corner showed that professor dumbledore was pacing his study the cat mrs norris was prowling the second floor and peeves the poltergeist was currently bouncing around the trophy room and as eyes traveled up and down the familiar corridors he noticed something else 
 
 this map showed a set of passages he had never entered and many of them seemed to lead 
 
 right into hogsmeade said fred tracing one of them with his finger there are seven in all now filch knows about these four he pointed them out but sure the only ones who know about these bother with the one behind the mirror on the fourth floor we used it until last winter but caved in completely blocked and we reckon ever used this one because the whomping planted right over the entrance but this one here this one leads right into the cellar of honeydukes used it loads of times and as you noticed the entrance is right outside this room through that old hump 
 
 moony wormtail padfoot and prongs sighed george patting the heading of the map we owe them so much 
 
 noble men working tirelessly to help a new generation of lawbreakers said fred solemnly 
 
 right said george briskly forget to wipe it after used it 
 
 or anyone can read it fred said warningly 
 
 just tap it again and say mischief managed and go blank 
 
 so young harry said fred in an uncanny impersonation of percy mind you behave yourself 
 
 see you in honeydukes said george winking 
 
 they left the room both smirking in a satisfied sort of way 
 
 harry stood there gazing at the miraculous map he watched the tiny ink mrs norris turn left and pause to sniff at something on the floor if filch really knowhe have to pass the dementors at all 
 
 but even as he stood there flooded with excitement something harry had once heard mr weasley say came floating out of his memory 
 
 never trust anything that can think for itself if you see where it keeps its brain 
 
 this map was one of those dangerous magical objects mr weasley had been warning againstaids for magical mischief makersbut then harry reasoned he only wanted to use it to get into hogsmeade it as though he wanted to steal anything or attack anyoneand fred and george had been using it for years without anything horrible happening 
 
 harry traced the secret passage to honeydukes with his finger 
 
 then quite suddenly as though following orders he rolled up the map stuffed it inside his robes and hurried to the door of the classroom he opened it a couple of inches there was no one outside very carefully he edged out of the room and behind the statue of the witch 
 
 what did he have to do he pulled out the map again and saw to his astonishment that a new ink figure had appeared upon it labeled harry potter this figure was standing exactly where the real harry was standing about halfway down the corridor harry watched carefully his little ink self appeared to be tapping the witch with his minute wand harry quickly took out his real wand and tapped the statue nothing happened he looked back at the map the tiniest speech bubble had appeared next to his figure the word inside said dissendium 
 
 dissendium harry whispered tapping the stone witch again 
 
 at once the hump opened wide enough to admit a fairly thin person harry glanced quickly up and down the corridor then tucked the map away again hoisted himself into the hole headfirst and pushed himself forward 
 
 he slid a considerable way down what felt like a stone slide then landed on cold damp earth he stood up looking around it was pitch dark he held up his wand muttered lumos and saw that he was in a very narrow low earthy passageway he raised the map tapped it with the tip of his wand and muttered mischief managed the map went blank at once he folded it carefully tucked it inside his robes then heart beating fast both excited and apprehensive he set off 
 
 the passage twisted and turned more like the burrow of a giant rabbit than anything else harry hurried along it stumbling now and then on the uneven floor holding his wand out in front of him 
 
 it took ages but harry had the thought of honeydukes to sustain him after what felt like an hour the passage began to rise panting harry sped up his face hot his feet very cold 
 
 ten minutes later he came to the foot of some worn stone steps which rose out of sight above him careful not to make any noise harry began to climb a hundred steps two hundred steps he lost count as he climbed watching his feetthen without warning his head hit something hard 
 
 it seemed to be a trapdoor harry stood there massaging the top of his head listening he hear any sounds above him very slowly he pushed the trapdoor open and peered over the edge 
 
 he was in a cellar which was full of wooden crates and boxes harry climbed out of the trapdoor and replaced it it blended so perfectly with the dusty floor that it was impossible to tell it was there harry crept slowly toward the wooden staircase that led upstairs now he could definitely hear voices not to mention the tinkle of a bell and the opening and shutting of a door 
 
 wondering what he ought to do he suddenly heard a door open much closer at hand somebody was about to come downstairs 
 
 and get another box of jelly slugs dear nearly cleaned us out said a voice 
 
 a pair of feet was coming down the staircase harry leapt behind an enormous crate and waited for the footsteps to pass he heard the man shifting boxes against the opposite wall he might not get another chance 
 
 quickly and silently harry dodged out from his hiding place and climbed the stairs looking back he saw an enormous backside and shiny bald head buried in a box harry reached the door at the top of the stairs slipped through it and found himself behind the counter of honeydukes he ducked crept sideways and then straightened up 
 
 honeydukes was so crowded with hogwarts students that no one looked twice at harry he edged among them looking around and suppressed a laugh as he imagined the look that would spread over piggy face if he could see where harry was now 
 
 there were shelves upon shelves of the most sweets imaginable creamy chunks of nougat shimmering pink squares of coconut ice fat toffees hundreds of different kinds of chocolate in neat rows there was a large barrel of every flavor beans and another of fizzing whizbees the levitating sherbet balls that ron had mentioned along yet another wall were special effects sweets droobles best blowing gum which filled a room with bubbles that refused to pop for days the strange splintery toothflossing stringmints tiny black pepper imps breathe fire for your friends ice mice hear your teeth chatter and squeak peppermint creams shaped like toads hop realistically in the stomach fragile quills and exploding bonbons 
 
 harry squeezed himself through a crowd of sixth years and saw a sign hanging in the farthest corner of the shop unusual tastes ron and hermione were standing underneath it examining a tray of lollipops harry sneaked up behind them 
 
 ugh no harry want one of those for vampires i expect hermione was saying 
 
 how about these said ron shoving a jar of cockroach clusters under nose 
 
 definitely not said harry 
 
 ron nearly dropped the jar 
 
 harry squealed hermione what are you doing here how how did you 
 
 wow said ron looking very impressed learned to apparate 
 
 course i said harry he dropped his voice so that none of the sixth years could hear him and told them all about the map 
 
 how come fred and george never gave it to me said ron outraged their brother 
 
 but harry going to keep it said hermione as though the idea were ludicrous going to hand it in to professor mcgonagall you harry 
 
 no not said harry 
 
 are you mad said ron goggling at hermione hand in something that good 
 
 if i hand it in have to say where i got it filch would know fred and george had nicked it 
 
 but what about sirius black hermione hissed he could be using one of the passages on that map to get into the castle the teachers have got to know 
 
 he be getting in through a passage said harry quickly there are seven secret tunnels on the map right fred and george reckon filch already knows about four of them and of the other three one of caved in so no one can get through it one of got the whomping willow planted over the entrance so you get out of it and the one i just came through well really hard to see the entrance to it down in the cellar so unless he knew it was there 
 
 harry hesitated what if black did know the passage was there ron however cleared his throat significantly and pointed to a notice pasted on the inside of the sweetshop door 
 
 by order of the ministry of magic 
 customers are reminded that until further notice dementors will be patrolling the streets of hogsmeade every night after sundown this measure has been put in place for the safety of hogsmeade residents and will be lifted upon the recapture of sirius black it is therefore advisable that you complete your shopping well before nightfall 
 merry christmas 
 see said ron quietly like to see black try and break into honeydukes with dementors swarming all over the village anyway hermione the honeydukes owners would hear a they they live over the shop 
 
 yes but but heroine seemed to be struggling to find another problem look harry still be coming into hogsmeade he got a signed form if anyone finds out be in so much trouble and not nightfall yet what if sirius black turns up today now 
 
 have a job spotting harry in this said ron nodding through the mullioned windows at the thick swirling snow come on hermione christmas harry deserves a break 
 
 hermione bit her lip looking extremely worried 
 
 are you going to report me harry asked her grinning 
 
 oh of course not but honestly harry 
 
 seen the fizzing whizbees harry said ron grabbing him and leading him over to their barrel and the jelly slugs and the acid pops fred gave me one of those when i was seven it burnt a hole right through my tongue i remember mum walloping him with her broomstick ron stared broodingly into the acid pop box reckon take a bite of cockroach cluster if i told him they were peanuts 
 
 when ron and hermione had paid for all their sweets the three of them left honeydukes for the blizzard outside 
 
 hogsmeade looked like a christmas card the little thatched cottages and shops were all covered in a layer of crisp snow there were holly wreaths on the doors and strings of enchanted candles hanging in the trees 
 
 harry shivered unlike the other two he have his cloak they headed up the street heads bowed against the wind ron and hermione shouting through their scarves 
 
 the post office 
 
 is up there 
 
 we could go up to the shrieking shack 
 
 tell you what said ron his teeth chattering shall we go for a butterbeer in the three broomsticks 
 
 harry was more than willing the wind was fierce and his hands were freezing so they crossed the road and in a few minutes were entering the tiny inn 
 
 it was extremely crowded noisy warm and smoky a curvy sort of woman with a pretty face was serving a bunch of rowdy warlocks up at the bar 
 
 madam rosmerta said ron get the drinks shall i he added going slightly red 
 
 harry and hermione made their way to the back of the room where there was a small vacant table between the window and a handsome christmas tree which stood next to the fireplace ron came back five minutes later carrying three foaming tankards of hot butterbeer 
 
 merry christmas he said happily raising his tankard 
 
 harry drank deeply it was the most delicious thing ever tasted and seemed to heat every bit of him from the inside 
 
 a sudden breeze ruffled his hair the door of the three broomsticks had opened again harry looked over the rim of his tankard and choked 
 
 professors mcgonagall and flitwick had just entered the pub with a flurry of snowflakes shortly followed by hagrid who was deep in conversation with a portly man in a bowler hat and a pinstriped cloak cornelius fudge minister of magic 
 
 in an instant ron and hermione had both placed hands on the top of head and forced him off his stool and under the table dripping with butterbeer and crouching out of sight harry clutched his empty tankard and watched the teachers and feet move toward the bar pause then turn and walk right toward him 
 
 somewhere above him hermione whispered mobiliarbus 
 
 the christmas tree beside their table rose a few inches off the ground drifted sideways and landed with a soft thump right in front of their table hiding them from view staring through the dense lower branches harry saw four sets of chair legs move back from the table right beside theirs then heard the grunts and sighs of the teachers and minister as they sat down 
 
 next he saw another pair of feet wearing sparkly turquoise high heels and heard a voice 
 
 a small gillywater 
 
 mine said professor voice 
 
 four pints of mulled mead 
 
 ta rosmerta said hagrid 
 
 a cherry syrup and soda with ice and umbrella 
 
 mmm said professor flitwick smacking his lips 
 
 so be the red currant rum minister 
 
 thank you rosmerta said voice lovely to see you again i must say have one yourself you come and join us 
 
 well thank you very much minister 
 
 harry watched the glittering heels march away and back again his heart was pounding uncomfortably in his throat why it occurred to him that this was the last weekend of term for the teachers too and how long were they going to sit there he needed time to sneak back into honeydukes if he wanted to return to school tonight leg gave a nervous twitch next to him 
 
 so what brings you to this neck of the woods minister came madam voice 
 
 harry saw the lower part of thick body twist in his chair as though he were checking for eavesdroppers then he said in a quiet voice what else but sirius black i daresay you heard what happened up at the school at halloween 
 
 i did hear a rumor admitted madam rosmerta 
 
 did you tell the whole pub hagrid said professor mcgonagall exasperatedly 
 
 do you think still in the area minister whispered madam rosmerta 
 
 sure of it said fudge shortly 
 
 you know that the dementors have searched the whole village twice said madam rosmerta a slight edge to her voice scared all my customers very bad for business minister 
 
 rosmerta dear i like them any more than you do said fudge uncomfortably necessary precaution unfortunate but there you just met some of them in a fury against dumbledore he let them inside the castle grounds 
 
 i should think not said professor mcgonagall sharply how are we supposed to teach with those horrors floating around 
 
 hear hear squeaked tiny professor flitwick whose feet were dangling a foot from the ground 
 
 all the same demurred fudge they are here to protect you all from something much worsewe all know what capable of 
 
 do you know i still have trouble believing it said madam rosmerta thoughtfully of all the people to go over to the dark side sirius black was the last have thoughti mean i remember him when he was a boy at hogwarts if told me then what he was going to become have said had too much mead 
 
 you know the half of it rosmerta said fudge gruffly the worst he did widely known 
 
 the worst said madam rosmerta her voice alive with curiosity worse than murdering all those poor people you mean 
 
 i certainly do said fudge 
 
 i believe that what could possibly be worse 
 
 you say you remember him at hogwarts rosmerta murmured professor mcgonagall do you remember who his best friend was 
 
 naturally said madam rosmerta with a small laugh never saw one without the other did you the number of times i had them in here ooh they used to make me laugh quite the double act sirius black and james potter 
 
 harry dropped his tankard with a loud clunk ron kicked him 
 
 precisely said professor mcgonagall black and potter ringleaders of their little gang both very bright of course exceptionally bright in fact but i think ever had such a pair of troublemakers 
 
 i dunno chuckled hagrid fred and george weasley could give em a run fer their money 
 
 have thought black and potter were brothers chimed in professor flitwick inseparable 
 
 of course they were said fudge potter trusted black beyond all his other friends nothing changed when they left school black was best man when james married lily then they named him godfather to harry harry has no idea of course you can imagine how the idea would torment him 
 
 because black turned out to be in league with whispered madam rosmerta 
 
 worse even than that fudge dropped his voice and proceeded in a sort of low rumble not many people are aware that the potters knew was after them dumbledore who was of course working tirelessly against had a number of useful spies one of them tipped him off and he alerted james and lily at once he advised them to go into hiding well of course an easy person to hide from dumbledore told them that their best chance was the fidelius charm 
 
 how does that work said madam rosmerta breathless with interest professor flitwick cleared his throat 
 
 an immensely complex spell he said squeakily involving the magical concealment of a secret inside a single living soul the information is hidden inside the chosen person or and is henceforth impossible to find unless of course the chooses to divulge it as long as the refused to speak could search the village where lily and james were staying for years and never find them not even if he had his nose pressed against their sitting room window 
 
 so black was the potters whispered madam rosmerta 
 
 naturally said professor mcgonagall james potter told dumbledore that black would die rather than tell where they were that black was planning to go into hiding himselfand yet dumbledore remained worried i remember him offering to be the potters himself 
 
 he suspected black gasped madam rosmerta 
 
 he was sure that somebody close to the potters had been keeping informed of their movements said professor mcgonagall darkly indeed he had suspected for some time that someone on our side had turned traitor and was passing a lot of information to 
 
 but james potter insisted on using black 
 
 he did said fudge heavily and then barely a week after the fidelius charm had been performed 
 
 black betrayed them breathed madam rosmerta 
 
 he did indeed black was tired of his role he was ready to declare his support openly for and he seems to have planned this for the moment of the potters death but as we all know met his downfall in little harry potter powers gone horribly weakened he fled and this left black in a very nasty position indeed his master had fallen at the very moment when he black had shown his true colors as a traitor he had no choice but to run for it 
 
 filthy stinkin turncoat hagrid said so loudly that half the bar went quiet 
 
 shh said professor mcgonagall 
 
 i met him growled hagrid i musta bin the last ter see him before he killed all them people it was me what rescued harry from lily an house after they was killed jus got him outta the ruins poor little thing with a great slash across his forehead an his parents deadan sirius black turns up on that flyin motorbike he used ter ride never occurred ter me what he was doin there i didn know bin lily an thought jus heard the news o attack an come ter see what he could do white an shakin he was an yeh know what i did i comforted the murderin traitor hagrid roared 
 
 hagrid please said professor mcgonagall keep your voice down 
 
 how was i ter know he wasn upset abou lily an james it was he cared abou an then he says give harry ter me hagrid his godfather look after him ha but had me orders from dumbledore an i told black no dumbledore said harry was ter go ter his aunt an black argued but in the end he gave in told me ter take his motorbike ter get harry there i need it anymore he says 
 
 i shoulda known there was somethin fishy goin on then he loved that motorbike what was he givin it ter me for why wouldn he need it anymore fact was it was too easy ter trace dumbledore knew bin the potters black knew he was goin ter have ter run fer it that night knew it was a matter o hours before the ministry was after him 
 
 but what if given harry to him eh i bet pitched him off the bike halfway out ter sea his bes friends son but when a wizard goes over ter the dark side nothin and no one that matters to em anymore 
 
 a long silence followed story then madam rosmerta said with some satisfaction but he manage to disappear did he the ministry of magic caught up with him next day 
 
 alas if only we had said fudge bitterly it was not we who found him it was little peter pettigrew another of the potters friends maddened by grief no doubt and knowing that black had been the potters he went after black himself 
 
 pettigrewthat fat little boy who was always tagging around after them at hogwarts said madam rosmerta 
 
 black and potter said professor mcgonagall never quite in their league i was often rather sharp with him you can imagine how i how i regret that now she sounded as though she had a sudden head cold 
 
 there now minerva said fudge kindly pettigrew died a death eyewitnesses muggles of course we wiped their memories later told us how pettigrew cornered black they say he was sobbing lily and james sirius how could you and then he went for his wand well of course black was quicker blew pettigrew to smithereens 
 
 professor mcgonagall blew her nose and said thickly stupid boyfoolish boyhe was always hopeless at duelingshould have left it to the ministry 
 
 i tell yeh if got ter black before little pettigrew did i messed around with wands ve ripped him limb from limb hagrid growled 
 
 you know what talking about hagrid said fudge sharply nobody but trained hit wizards from the magical law enforcement squad would have stood a chance against black once he was cornered i was junior minister in the department of magical catastrophes at the time and i was one of the first on the scene after black murdered all those people i i will never forget it i still dream about it sometimes a crater in the middle of the street so deep it had cracked the sewer below bodies everywhere muggles screaming and black standing there laughing with what was left of pettigrew in front of hima heap of bloodstained robes and a few a few fragments 
 
 voice stopped abruptly there was the sound of five noses being blown 
 
 well there you have it rosmerta said fudge thickly black was taken away by twenty members of the magical law enforcement squad and pettigrew received the order of merlin first class which i think was some comfort to his poor mother been in azkaban ever since 
 
 madam rosmerta let out a long sigh 
 
 is it true mad minister 
 
 i wish i could say that he was said fudge slowly i certainly believe his defeat unhinged him for a while the murder of pettigrew and all those muggles was the action of a cornered and desperate man cruel pointless yet i met black on my last inspection of azkaban you know most of the prisoners in there sit muttering to themselves in the dark no sense in thembut i was shocked at how normal black seemed he spoke quite rationally to me it was unnerving have thought he was merely bored asked if finished with my newspaper cool as you please said he missed doing the crossword yes i was astounded at how little effect the dementors seemed to be having on him and he was one of the most heavily guarded in the place you know dementors outside his door day and night 
 
 but what do you think broken out to do said madam rosmerta good gracious minister he trying to rejoin is he 
 
 i daresay that is his er eventual plan said fudge evasively but we hope to catch black long before that i must say alone and friendless is one thingbut give him back his most devoted servant and i shudder to think how quickly rise again 
 
 there was a small chink of glass on wood someone had set down their glass 
 
 you know cornelius if dining with the headmaster better head back up to the castle said professor mcgonagall 
 
 one by one the pairs of feet in front of harry took the weight of their owners once more hems of cloaks swung into sight and madam glittering heels disappeared behind the bar the door of the three broomsticks opened again there was another flurry of snow and the teachers had disappeared 
 
 harry 
 
 and faces appeared under the table they were both staring at him lost for words 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the prisoner of azkaban 
 

lionfish nov chapter ten the mapcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 madam pomfrey insisted on keeping harry in the hospital wing for the rest of the weekend he argue or complain but he let her throw away the shattered remnants of his nimbus two thousand he knew he was being stupid knew that the nimbus was beyond repair but harry help it he felt as though lost one of his best friends 
 
 he had a stream of visitors all intent on cheering him up hagrid sent him a bunch of earwiggy flowers that looked like yellow cabbages and ginny weasley blushing furiously turned up with a card she had made herself which sang shrilly unless harry kept it shut under his bowl of fruit the gryffindor team visited again on sunday morning this time accompanied by wood who told harry in a hollow dead sort of voice that he blame him in the slightest ron and hermione left bedside only at night but nothing anyone said or did could make harry feel any better because they knew only half of what was troubling him 
 
 he told anyone about the grim not even ron and hermione because he knew ron would panic and hermione would scoff the fact remained however that it had now appeared twice and both appearances had been followed by accidents the first time he had nearly been run over by the knight bus the second fallen fifty feet from his broomstick was the grim going to haunt him until he actually died was he going to spend the rest of his life looking over his shoulder for the beast 
 
 and then there were the dementors harry felt sick and humiliated every time he thought of them everyone said the dementors were horrible but no one else collapsed every time they went near one no one else heard echoes in their head of their dying parents 
 
 because harry knew who that screaming voice belonged to now he had heard her words heard them over and over again during the night hours in the hospital wing while he lay awake staring at the strips of moonlight on the ceiling when the dementors approached him he heard the last moments of his life her attempts to protect him harry from lord voldemort and laughter before he murdered herharry dozed fitfully sinking into dreams full of clammy rotted hands and petrified pleading jerking awake to dwell again on his voice 
 
 
 
 it was a relief to return to the noise and bustle of the main school on monday where he was forced to think about other things even if he had to endure draco taunting malfoy was almost beside himself with glee at defeat he had finally taken off his bandages and celebrated having the full use of both arms again by doing spirited imitations of harry falling off his broom malfoy spent much of their next potions class doing dementor imitations across the dungeon ron finally cracked and flung a large slippery crocodile heart at malfoy which hit him in the face and caused snape to take fifty points from gryffindor 
 
 if teaching defense against the dark arts again skiving off said ron as they headed toward classroom after lunch check in there hermione 
 
 hermione peered around the classroom door 
 
 okay 
 
 professor lupin was back at work it certainly looked as though he had been ill his old robes were hanging more loosely on him and there were dark shadows beneath his eyes nevertheless he smiled at the class as they took their seats and they burst at once into an explosion of complaints about behavior while lupin had been ill 
 
 not fair he was only filling in why should he give us homework 
 
 we know anything about werewolves 
 
 two rolls of parchment 
 
 did you tell professor snape we covered them yet lupin asked frowning slightly 
 
 the babble broke out again 
 
 yes but he said we were really behind 
 
 he listen 
 
 two rolls of parchment 
 
 professor lupin smiled at the look of indignation on every face 
 
 worry speak to professor snape you have to do the essay 
 
 oh no said hermione looking very disappointed already finished it 
 
 they had a very enjoyable lesson professor lupin had brought along a glass box containing a hinkypunk a little creature who looked as though he were made of wisps of smoke rather frail and harmless looking 
 
 lures travelers into bogs said professor lupin as they took notes you notice the lantern dangling from his hand hops ahead people follow the light then 
 
 the hinkypunk made a horrible squelching noise against the glass 
 
 when the bell rang everyone gathered up their things and headed for the door harry among them but 
 
 wait a moment harry lupin called like a word 
 
 harry doubled back and watched professor lupin covering the box with a cloth 
 
 i heard about the match said lupin turning back to his desk and starting to pile books into his briefcase and sorry about your broomstick is there any chance of fixing it 
 
 no said harry the tree smashed it to bits 
 
 lupin sighed 
 
 they planted the whomping willow the same year that i arrived at hogwarts people used to play a game trying to get near enough to touch the trunk in the end a boy called davey gudgeon nearly lost an eye and we were forbidden to go near it no broomstick would have a chance 
 
 did you hear about the dementors too said harry with difficulty 
 
 lupin looked at him quickly 
 
 yes i did i think any of us have seen professor dumbledore that angry they have been growing restless for some timefurious at his refusal to let them inside the groundsi suppose they were the reason you fell 
 
 yes said harry he hesitated and then the question he had to ask burst from him before he could stop himself why why do they affect me like that am i just 
 
 it has nothing to do with weakness said professor lupin sharply as though he had read mind the dementors affect you worse than the others because there are horrors in your past that the others have 
 
 a ray of wintry sunlight fell across the classroom illuminating gray hairs and the lines on his young face 
 
 dementors are among the foulest creatures that walk this earth they infest the darkest filthiest places they glory in decay and despair they drain peace hope and happiness out of the air around them even muggles feel their presence though they see them get too near a dementor and every good feeling every happy memory will be sucked out of you if it can the dementor will feed on you long enough to reduce you to something like itself and evil be left with nothing but the worst experiences of your life and the worst that happened to you harry is enough to make anyone fall off their broom you have nothing to feel ashamed of 
 
 when they get near me harry stared at desk his throat tight i can hear voldemort murdering my mum 
 
 lupin made a sudden motion with his arm as though to grip shoulder but thought better of it there was a silence then 
 
 why did they have to come to the match said harry bitterly 
 
 getting hungry said lupin coolly shutting his briefcase with a snap dumbledore let them into the school so their supply of human prey has dried upi think they could resist the large crowd around the quidditch field all that excitementemotions running highit was their idea of a feast 
 
 azkaban must be terrible harry muttered lupin nodded grimly 
 
 the fortress is set on a tiny island way out to sea but they need walls and water to keep the prisoners in not when all trapped inside their own heads incapable of a single cheery thought most of them go mad within weeks 
 
 but sirius black escaped from them harry said slowly he got away 
 
 briefcase slipped from the desk he had to stoop quickly to catch it 
 
 yes he said straightening up black must have found a way to fight them i have believed it possibledementors are supposed to drain a wizard of his powers if he is left with them too long 
 
 you made that dementor on the train back off said harry suddenly 
 
 there are certain defenses one can use said lupin but there was only one dementor on the train the more there are the more difficult it becomes to resist 
 
 what defenses said harry at once can you teach me 
 
 i pretend to be an expert at fighting dementors harry quite the contrary 
 
 but if the dementors come to another quidditch match i need to be able to fight them 
 
 lupin looked into determined face hesitated then said wellall right try and help but have to wait until next term afraid i have a lot to do before the holidays i chose a very inconvenient time to fall ill 
 
 
 
 what with the promise of lessons from lupin the thought that he might never have to hear his death again and the fact that ravenclaw flattened hufflepuff in their quidditch match at the end of november mood took a definite upturn gryffindor were not out of the running after all although they could not afford to lose another match wood became repossessed of his manic energy and worked his team as hard as ever in the chilly haze of rain that persisted into december harry saw no hint of a dementor within the grounds anger seemed to be keeping them at their stations at the entrances 
 
 two weeks before the end of the term the sky lightened suddenly to a dazzling opaline white and the muddy grounds were revealed one morning covered in glittering frost inside the castle there was a buzz of christmas in the air professor flitwick the charms teacher had already decorated his classroom with shimmering lights that turned out to be real fluttering fairies the students were all happily discussing their plans for the holidays both ron and hermione had decided to remain at hogwarts and though ron said it was because he stand two weeks with percy and hermione insisted she needed to use the library harry fooled they were doing it to keep him company and he was very grateful 
 
 to delight except there was to be another hogsmeade trip on the very last weekend of the term 
 
 we can do all our christmas shopping there said hermione mum and dad would really love those toothflossing stringmints from honeydukes 
 
 resigned to the fact that he would be the only third year staying behind again harry borrowed a copy of which broomstick from wood and decided to spend the day reading up on the different makes he had been riding one of the school brooms at team practice an ancient shooting star which was very slow and jerky he definitely needed a new broom of his own 
 
 on the saturday morning of the hogsmeade trip harry bid to ron and hermione who were wrapped in cloaks and scarves then turned up the marble staircase alone and headed back toward gryffindor tower snow had started to fall outside the windows and the castle was very still and quiet 
 
 psst harry 
 
 he turned halfway along the corridor to see fred and george peering out at him from behind a statue of a humpbacked witch 
 
 what are you doing said harry curiously how come not going to hogsmeade 
 
 come to give you a bit of festive cheer before we go said fred with a mysterious wink come in here 
 
 he nodded toward an empty classroom to the left of the statue harry followed fred and george inside george closed the door quietly and then turned beaming to look at harry 
 
 early christmas present for you harry he said 
 
 fred pulled something from inside his cloak with a flourish and laid it on one of the desks it was a large square very worn piece of parchment with nothing written on it harry suspecting one of fred and jokes stared at it 
 
 that supposed to be 
 
 this harry is the secret of our success said george patting the parchment fondly 
 
 a wrench giving it to you said fred but we decided last night your greater than ours 
 
 anyway we know it by heart said george we bequeath it to you we really need it anymore 
 
 and what do i need with a bit of old parchment said harry 
 
 a bit of old parchment said fred closing his eyes with a grimace as though harry had mortally offended him explain george 
 
 wellwhen we were in our first year harry young carefree and innocent 
 
 harry snorted he doubted whether fred and george had ever been innocent 
 
 c well more innocent than we are now we got into a spot of bother with filch 
 
 we let off a dungbomb in the corridor and it upset him for some reason 
 
 so he hauled us off to his office and started threatening us with the usual 
 
 detention 
 
 disembowelment 
 
 and we help noticing a drawer in one of his filing cabinets marked confiscated and highly dangerous 
 
 tell me said harry starting to grin 
 
 well what would done said fred george caused a diversion by dropping another dungbomb i whipped the drawer open and grabbed this 
 
 not as bad as it sounds you know said george we reckon filch ever found out how to work it he probably suspected what it was though or he have confiscated it 
 
 and you know how to work it 
 
 oh yes said fred smirking this little taught us more than all the teachers in this school 
 
 winding me up said harry looking at the ragged old bit of parchment 
 
 oh are we said george 
 
 he took out his wand touched the parchment lightly and said i solemnly swear that i am up to no good 
 
 and at once thin ink lines began to spread like a web from the point that wand had touched they joined each other they crisscrossed they fanned into every corner of the parchment then words began to blossom across the top great curly green words that proclaimed 
 
 messrs moony wormtail padfoot and prongs 
 purveyors of aids to magical 
 are proud to present 
 the map 
 it was a map showing every detail of the hogwarts castle and grounds but the truly remarkable thing were the tiny ink dots moving around it each labeled with a name in minuscule writing astounded harry bent over it a labeled dot in the top left corner showed that professor dumbledore was pacing his study the cat mrs norris was prowling the second floor and peeves the poltergeist was currently bouncing around the trophy room and as eyes traveled up and down the familiar corridors he noticed something else 
 
 this map showed a set of passages he had never entered and many of them seemed to lead 
 
 right into hogsmeade said fred tracing one of them with his finger there are seven in all now filch knows about these four he pointed them out but sure the only ones who know about these bother with the one behind the mirror on the fourth floor we used it until last winter but caved in completely blocked and we reckon ever used this one because the whomping planted right over the entrance but this one here this one leads right into the cellar of honeydukes used it loads of times and as you noticed the entrance is right outside this room through that old hump 
 
 moony wormtail padfoot and prongs sighed george patting the heading of the map we owe them so much 
 
 noble men working tirelessly to help a new generation of lawbreakers said fred solemnly 
 
 right said george briskly forget to wipe it after used it 
 
 or anyone can read it fred said warningly 
 
 just tap it again and say mischief managed and go blank 
 
 so young harry said fred in an uncanny impersonation of percy mind you behave yourself 
 
 see you in honeydukes said george winking 
 
 they left the room both smirking in a satisfied sort of way 
 
 harry stood there gazing at the miraculous map he watched the tiny ink mrs norris turn left and pause to sniff at something on the floor if filch really knowhe have to pass the dementors at all 
 
 but even as he stood there flooded with excitement something harry had once heard mr weasley say came floating out of his memory 
 
 never trust anything that can think for itself if you see where it keeps its brain 
 
 this map was one of those dangerous magical objects mr weasley had been warning againstaids for magical mischief makersbut then harry reasoned he only wanted to use it to get into hogsmeade it as though he wanted to steal anything or attack anyoneand fred and george had been using it for years without anything horrible happening 
 
 harry traced the secret passage to honeydukes with his finger 
 
 then quite suddenly as though following orders he rolled up the map stuffed it inside his robes and hurried to the door of the classroom he opened it a couple of inches there was no one outside very carefully he edged out of the room and behind the statue of the witch 
 
 what did he have to do he pulled out the map again and saw to his astonishment that a new ink figure had appeared upon it labeled harry potter this figure was standing exactly where the real harry was standing about halfway down the corridor harry watched carefully his little ink self appeared to be tapping the witch with his minute wand harry quickly took out his real wand and tapped the statue nothing happened he looked back at the map the tiniest speech bubble had appeared next to his figure the word inside said dissendium 
 
 dissendium harry whispered tapping the stone witch again 
 
 at once the hump opened wide enough to admit a fairly thin person harry glanced quickly up and down the corridor then tucked the map away again hoisted himself into the hole headfirst and pushed himself forward 
 
 he slid a considerable way down what felt like a stone slide then landed on cold damp earth he stood up looking around it was pitch dark he held up his wand muttered lumos and saw that he was in a very narrow low earthy passageway he raised the map tapped it with the tip of his wand and muttered mischief managed the map went blank at once he folded it carefully tucked it inside his robes then heart beating fast both excited and apprehensive he set off 
 
 the passage twisted and turned more like the burrow of a giant rabbit than anything else harry hurried along it stumbling now and then on the uneven floor holding his wand out in front of him 
 
 it took ages but harry had the thought of honeydukes to sustain him after what felt like an hour the passage began to rise panting harry sped up his face hot his feet very cold 
 
 ten minutes later he came to the foot of some worn stone steps which rose out of sight above him careful not to make any noise harry began to climb a hundred steps two hundred steps he lost count as he climbed watching his feetthen without warning his head hit something hard 
 
 it seemed to be a trapdoor harry stood there massaging the top of his head listening he hear any sounds above him very slowly he pushed the trapdoor open and peered over the edge 
 
 he was in a cellar which was full of wooden crates and boxes harry climbed out of the trapdoor and replaced it it blended so perfectly with the dusty floor that it was impossible to tell it was there harry crept slowly toward the wooden staircase that led upstairs now he could definitely hear voices not to mention the tinkle of a bell and the opening and shutting of a door 
 
 wondering what he ought to do he suddenly heard a door open much closer at hand somebody was about to come downstairs 
 
 and get another box of jelly slugs dear nearly cleaned us out said a voice 
 
 a pair of feet was coming down the staircase harry leapt behind an enormous crate and waited for the footsteps to pass he heard the man shifting boxes against the opposite wall he might not get another chance 
 
 quickly and silently harry dodged out from his hiding place and climbed the stairs looking back he saw an enormous backside and shiny bald head buried in a box harry reached the door at the top of the stairs slipped through it and found himself behind the counter of honeydukes he ducked crept sideways and then straightened up 
 
 honeydukes was so crowded with hogwarts students that no one looked twice at harry he edged among them looking around and suppressed a laugh as he imagined the look that would spread over piggy face if he could see where harry was now 
 
 there were shelves upon shelves of the most sweets imaginable creamy chunks of nougat shimmering pink squares of coconut ice fat toffees hundreds of different kinds of chocolate in neat rows there was a large barrel of every flavor beans and another of fizzing whizbees the levitating sherbet balls that ron had mentioned along yet another wall were special effects sweets droobles best blowing gum which filled a room with bubbles that refused to pop for days the strange splintery toothflossing stringmints tiny black pepper imps breathe fire for your friends ice mice hear your teeth chatter and squeak peppermint creams shaped like toads hop realistically in the stomach fragile quills and exploding bonbons 
 
 harry squeezed himself through a crowd of sixth years and saw a sign hanging in the farthest corner of the shop unusual tastes ron and hermione were standing underneath it examining a tray of lollipops harry sneaked up behind them 
 
 ugh no harry want one of those for vampires i expect hermione was saying 
 
 how about these said ron shoving a jar of cockroach clusters under nose 
 
 definitely not said harry 
 
 ron nearly dropped the jar 
 
 harry squealed hermione what are you doing here how how did you 
 
 wow said ron looking very impressed learned to apparate 
 
 course i said harry he dropped his voice so that none of the sixth years could hear him and told them all about the map 
 
 how come fred and george never gave it to me said ron outraged their brother 
 
 but harry going to keep it said hermione as though the idea were ludicrous going to hand it in to professor mcgonagall you harry 
 
 no not said harry 
 
 are you mad said ron goggling at hermione hand in something that good 
 
 if i hand it in have to say where i got it filch would know fred and george had nicked it 
 
 but what about sirius black hermione hissed he could be using one of the passages on that map to get into the castle the teachers have got to know 
 
 he be getting in through a passage said harry quickly there are seven secret tunnels on the map right fred and george reckon filch already knows about four of them and of the other three one of caved in so no one can get through it one of got the whomping willow planted over the entrance so you get out of it and the one i just came through well really hard to see the entrance to it down in the cellar so unless he knew it was there 
 
 harry hesitated what if black did know the passage was there ron however cleared his throat significantly and pointed to a notice pasted on the inside of the sweetshop door 
 
 by order of the ministry of magic 
 customers are reminded that until further notice dementors will be patrolling the streets of hogsmeade every night after sundown this measure has been put in place for the safety of hogsmeade residents and will be lifted upon the recapture of sirius black it is therefore advisable that you complete your shopping well before nightfall 
 merry christmas 
 see said ron quietly like to see black try and break into honeydukes with dementors swarming all over the village anyway hermione the honeydukes owners would hear a they they live over the shop 
 
 yes but but heroine seemed to be struggling to find another problem look harry still be coming into hogsmeade he got a signed form if anyone finds out be in so much trouble and not nightfall yet what if sirius black turns up today now 
 
 have a job spotting harry in this said ron nodding through the mullioned windows at the thick swirling snow come on hermione christmas harry deserves a break 
 
 hermione bit her lip looking extremely worried 
 
 are you going to report me harry asked her grinning 
 
 oh of course not but honestly harry 
 
 seen the fizzing whizbees harry said ron grabbing him and leading him over to their barrel and the jelly slugs and the acid pops fred gave me one of those when i was seven it burnt a hole right through my tongue i remember mum walloping him with her broomstick ron stared broodingly into the acid pop box reckon take a bite of cockroach cluster if i told him they were peanuts 
 
 when ron and hermione had paid for all their sweets the three of them left honeydukes for the blizzard outside 
 
 hogsmeade looked like a christmas card the little thatched cottages and shops were all covered in a layer of crisp snow there were holly wreaths on the doors and strings of enchanted candles hanging in the trees 
 
 harry shivered unlike the other two he have his cloak they headed up the street heads bowed against the wind ron and hermione shouting through their scarves 
 
 the post office 
 
 is up there 
 
 we could go up to the shrieking shack 
 
 tell you what said ron his teeth chattering shall we go for a butterbeer in the three broomsticks 
 
 harry was more than willing the wind was fierce and his hands were freezing so they crossed the road and in a few minutes were entering the tiny inn 
 
 it was extremely crowded noisy warm and smoky a curvy sort of woman with a pretty face was serving a bunch of rowdy warlocks up at the bar 
 
 madam rosmerta said ron get the drinks shall i he added going slightly red 
 
 harry and hermione made their way to the back of the room where there was a small vacant table between the window and a handsome christmas tree which stood next to the fireplace ron came back five minutes later carrying three foaming tankards of hot butterbeer 
 
 merry christmas he said happily raising his tankard 
 
 harry drank deeply it was the most delicious thing ever tasted and seemed to heat every bit of him from the inside 
 
 a sudden breeze ruffled his hair the door of the three broomsticks had opened again harry looked over the rim of his tankard and choked 
 
 professors mcgonagall and flitwick had just entered the pub with a flurry of snowflakes shortly followed by hagrid who was deep in conversation with a portly man in a bowler hat and a pinstriped cloak cornelius fudge minister of magic 
 
 in an instant ron and hermione had both placed hands on the top of head and forced him off his stool and under the table dripping with butterbeer and crouching out of sight harry clutched his empty tankard and watched the teachers and feet move toward the bar pause then turn and walk right toward him 
 
 somewhere above him hermione whispered mobiliarbus 
 
 the christmas tree beside their table rose a few inches off the ground drifted sideways and landed with a soft thump right in front of their table hiding them from view staring through the dense lower branches harry saw four sets of chair legs move back from the table right beside theirs then heard the grunts and sighs of the teachers and minister as they sat down 
 
 next he saw another pair of feet wearing sparkly turquoise high heels and heard a voice 
 
 a small gillywater 
 
 mine said professor voice 
 
 four pints of mulled mead 
 
 ta rosmerta said hagrid 
 
 a cherry syrup and soda with ice and umbrella 
 
 mmm said professor flitwick smacking his lips 
 
 so be the red currant rum minister 
 
 thank you rosmerta said voice lovely to see you again i must say have one yourself you come and join us 
 
 well thank you very much minister 
 
 harry watched the glittering heels march away and back again his heart was pounding uncomfortably in his throat why it occurred to him that this was the last weekend of term for the teachers too and how long were they going to sit there he needed time to sneak back into honeydukes if he wanted to return to school tonight leg gave a nervous twitch next to him 
 
 so what brings you to this neck of the woods minister came madam voice 
 
 harry saw the lower part of thick body twist in his chair as though he were checking for eavesdroppers then he said in a quiet voice what else but sirius black i daresay you heard what happened up at the school at halloween 
 
 i did hear a rumor admitted madam rosmerta 
 
 did you tell the whole pub hagrid said professor mcgonagall exasperatedly 
 
 do you think still in the area minister whispered madam rosmerta 
 
 sure of it said fudge shortly 
 
 you know that the dementors have searched the whole village twice said madam rosmerta a slight edge to her voice scared all my customers very bad for business minister 
 
 rosmerta dear i like them any more than you do said fudge uncomfortably necessary precaution unfortunate but there you just met some of them in a fury against dumbledore he let them inside the castle grounds 
 
 i should think not said professor mcgonagall sharply how are we supposed to teach with those horrors floating around 
 
 hear hear squeaked tiny professor flitwick whose feet were dangling a foot from the ground 
 
 all the same demurred fudge they are here to protect you all from something much worsewe all know what capable of 
 
 do you know i still have trouble believing it said madam rosmerta thoughtfully of all the people to go over to the dark side sirius black was the last have thoughti mean i remember him when he was a boy at hogwarts if told me then what he was going to become have said had too much mead 
 
 you know the half of it rosmerta said fudge gruffly the worst he did widely known 
 
 the worst said madam rosmerta her voice alive with curiosity worse than murdering all those poor people you mean 
 
 i certainly do said fudge 
 
 i believe that what could possibly be worse 
 
 you say you remember him at hogwarts rosmerta murmured professor mcgonagall do you remember who his best friend was 
 
 naturally said madam rosmerta with a small laugh never saw one without the other did you the number of times i had them in here ooh they used to make me laugh quite the double act sirius black and james potter 
 
 harry dropped his tankard with a loud clunk ron kicked him 
 
 precisely said professor mcgonagall black and potter ringleaders of their little gang both very bright of course exceptionally bright in fact but i think ever had such a pair of troublemakers 
 
 i dunno chuckled hagrid fred and george weasley could give em a run fer their money 
 
 have thought black and potter were brothers chimed in professor flitwick inseparable 
 
 of course they were said fudge potter trusted black beyond all his other friends nothing changed when they left school black was best man when james married lily then they named him godfather to harry harry has no idea of course you can imagine how the idea would torment him 
 
 because black turned out to be in league with whispered madam rosmerta 
 
 worse even than that fudge dropped his voice and proceeded in a sort of low rumble not many people are aware that the potters knew was after them dumbledore who was of course working tirelessly against had a number of useful spies one of them tipped him off and he alerted james and lily at once he advised them to go into hiding well of course an easy person to hide from dumbledore told them that their best chance was the fidelius charm 
 
 how does that work said madam rosmerta breathless with interest professor flitwick cleared his throat 
 
 an immensely complex spell he said squeakily involving the magical concealment of a secret inside a single living soul the information is hidden inside the chosen person or and is henceforth impossible to find unless of course the chooses to divulge it as long as the refused to speak could search the village where lily and james were staying for years and never find them not even if he had his nose pressed against their sitting room window 
 
 so black was the potters whispered madam rosmerta 
 
 naturally said professor mcgonagall james potter told dumbledore that black would die rather than tell where they were that black was planning to go into hiding himselfand yet dumbledore remained worried i remember him offering to be the potters himself 
 
 he suspected black gasped madam rosmerta 
 
 he was sure that somebody close to the potters had been keeping informed of their movements said professor mcgonagall darkly indeed he had suspected for some time that someone on our side had turned traitor and was passing a lot of information to 
 
 but james potter insisted on using black 
 
 he did said fudge heavily and then barely a week after the fidelius charm had been performed 
 
 black betrayed them breathed madam rosmerta 
 
 he did indeed black was tired of his role he was ready to declare his support openly for and he seems to have planned this for the moment of the potters death but as we all know met his downfall in little harry potter powers gone horribly weakened he fled and this left black in a very nasty position indeed his master had fallen at the very moment when he black had shown his true colors as a traitor he had no choice but to run for it 
 
 filthy stinkin turncoat hagrid said so loudly that half the bar went quiet 
 
 shh said professor mcgonagall 
 
 i met him growled hagrid i musta bin the last ter see him before he killed all them people it was me what rescued harry from lily an house after they was killed jus got him outta the ruins poor little thing with a great slash across his forehead an his parents deadan sirius black turns up on that flyin motorbike he used ter ride never occurred ter me what he was doin there i didn know bin lily an thought jus heard the news o attack an come ter see what he could do white an shakin he was an yeh know what i did i comforted the murderin traitor hagrid roared 
 
 hagrid please said professor mcgonagall keep your voice down 
 
 how was i ter know he wasn upset abou lily an james it was he cared abou an then he says give harry ter me hagrid his godfather look after him ha but had me orders from dumbledore an i told black no dumbledore said harry was ter go ter his aunt an black argued but in the end he gave in told me ter take his motorbike ter get harry there i need it anymore he says 
 
 i shoulda known there was somethin fishy goin on then he loved that motorbike what was he givin it ter me for why wouldn he need it anymore fact was it was too easy ter trace dumbledore knew bin the potters black knew he was goin ter have ter run fer it that night knew it was a matter o hours before the ministry was after him 
 
 but what if given harry to him eh i bet pitched him off the bike halfway out ter sea his bes friends son but when a wizard goes over ter the dark side nothin and no one that matters to em anymore 
 
 a long silence followed story then madam rosmerta said with some satisfaction but he manage to disappear did he the ministry of magic caught up with him next day 
 
 alas if only we had said fudge bitterly it was not we who found him it was little peter pettigrew another of the potters friends maddened by grief no doubt and knowing that black had been the potters he went after black himself 
 
 pettigrewthat fat little boy who was always tagging around after them at hogwarts said madam rosmerta 
 
 black and potter said professor mcgonagall never quite in their league i was often rather sharp with him you can imagine how i how i regret that now she sounded as though she had a sudden head cold 
 
 there now minerva said fudge kindly pettigrew died a death eyewitnesses muggles of course we wiped their memories later told us how pettigrew cornered black they say he was sobbing lily and james sirius how could you and then he went for his wand well of course black was quicker blew pettigrew to smithereens 
 
 professor mcgonagall blew her nose and said thickly stupid boyfoolish boyhe was always hopeless at duelingshould have left it to the ministry 
 
 i tell yeh if got ter black before little pettigrew did i messed around with wands ve ripped him limb from limb hagrid growled 
 
 you know what talking about hagrid said fudge sharply nobody but trained hit wizards from the magical law enforcement squad would have stood a chance against black once he was cornered i was junior minister in the department of magical catastrophes at the time and i was one of the first on the scene after black murdered all those people i i will never forget it i still dream about it sometimes a crater in the middle of the street so deep it had cracked the sewer below bodies everywhere muggles screaming and black standing there laughing with what was left of pettigrew in front of hima heap of bloodstained robes and a few a few fragments 
 
 voice stopped abruptly there was the sound of five noses being blown 
 
 well there you have it rosmerta said fudge thickly black was taken away by twenty members of the magical law enforcement squad and pettigrew received the order of merlin first class which i think was some comfort to his poor mother been in azkaban ever since 
 
 madam rosmerta let out a long sigh 
 
 is it true mad minister 
 
 i wish i could say that he was said fudge slowly i certainly believe his defeat unhinged him for a while the murder of pettigrew and all those muggles was the action of a cornered and desperate man cruel pointless yet i met black on my last inspection of azkaban you know most of the prisoners in there sit muttering to themselves in the dark no sense in thembut i was shocked at how normal black seemed he spoke quite rationally to me it was unnerving have thought he was merely bored asked if finished with my newspaper cool as you please said he missed doing the crossword yes i was astounded at how little effect the dementors seemed to be having on him and he was one of the most heavily guarded in the place you know dementors outside his door day and night 
 
 but what do you think broken out to do said madam rosmerta good gracious minister he trying to rejoin is he 
 
 i daresay that is his er eventual plan said fudge evasively but we hope to catch black long before that i must say alone and friendless is one thingbut give him back his most devoted servant and i shudder to think how quickly rise again 
 
 there was a small chink of glass on wood someone had set down their glass 
 
 you know cornelius if dining with the headmaster better head back up to the castle said professor mcgonagall 
 
 one by one the pairs of feet in front of harry took the weight of their owners once more hems of cloaks swung into sight and madam glittering heels disappeared behind the bar the door of the three broomsticks opened again there was another flurry of snow and the teachers had disappeared 
 
 harry 
 
 and faces appeared under the table they were both staring at him lost for words 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the prisoner of azkaban 
 

lionfish nov chapter ten mayhem at the ministrycontents prev chapter next chapter 
 mr weasley woke them after only a few hours sleep he used magic to pack up the tents and they left the campsite as quickly as possible passing mr roberts at the door of his cottage mr roberts had a strange dazed look about him and he waved them off with a vague merry christmas 
 
 be all right said mr weasley quietly as they marched off onto the moor sometimes when a modified it makes him a bit disorientated for a whileand that was a big thing they had to make him forget 
 
 they heard urgent voices as they approached the spot where the portkeys lay and when they reached it they found a great number of witches and wizards gathered around basil the keeper of the portkeys all clamoring to get away from the campsite as quickly as possible mr weasley had a hurried discussion with basil they joined the queue and were able to take an old rubber tire back to stoatshead hill before the sun had really risen they walked back through ottery st catchpole and up the damp lane toward the burrow in the dawn light talking very little because they were so exhausted and thinking longingly of their breakfast as they rounded the corner and the burrow came into view a cry echoed along the lane 
 
 oh thank goodness thank goodness 
 
 mrs weasley who had evidently been waiting for them in the front yard came running toward them still wearing her bedroom slippers her face pale and strained a copy of the daily prophet clutched in her hand 
 
 arthur been so worried so worried 
 
 she flung her arms around mr neck and the daily prophet fell out of her limp hand onto the ground looking down harry saw the headline scenes of terror at the quidditch world cup complete with a twinkling photograph of the dark mark over the treetops 
 
 all right mrs weasley muttered distractedly releasing mr weasley and staring around at them all with red eyes boys 
 
 and to surprise she seized fred and george and pulled them both into such a tight hug that their heads banged together 
 
 ouch mum strangling us 
 
 i shouted at you before you left mrs weasley said starting to sob all been thinking about what if had got you and the last thing i ever said to you was that you get enough oh fredgeorge 
 
 come on now molly all perfectly okay said mr weasley soothingly prising her off the twins and leading her back toward the house bill he added in an undertone pick up that paper i want to see what it says 
 
 when they were all crammed into the tiny kitchen and hermione had made mrs weasley a cup of very strong tea into which mr weasley insisted on pouring a shot of ogdens old firewhiskey bill handed his father the newspaper mr weasley scanned the front page while percy looked over his shoulder 
 
 i knew it said mr weasley heavily ministry blundersculprits not apprehendedlax securitydark wizards running uncheckednational wrote this ahof courserita skeeter 
 
 that got it in for the ministry of magic said percy furiously last week she was saying wasting our time quibbling about cauldron thickness when we should be stamping out vampires as if it specifically stated in paragraph twelve of the guidelines for the treatment of 
 
 do us a favor perce said bill yawning and shut up 
 
 mentioned said mr weasley his eyes widening behind his glasses as he reached the bottom of the daily prophet article 
 
 where spluttered mrs weasley choking on her tea and whiskey if seen that have known you were alive 
 
 not by name said mr weasley listen to this if the terrified wizards and witches who waited breathlessly for news at the edge of the wood expected reassurance from the ministry of magic they were sadly disappointed a ministry official emerged some time after the appearance of the dark mark alleging that nobody had been hurt but refusing to give any more information whether this statement will be enough to quash the rumors that several bodies were removed from the woods an hour later remains to be really said mr weasley in exasperation handing the paper to percy nobody was hurt what was i supposed to say rumors that several bodies were removed from the woodswell there certainly will be rumors now printed that 
 
 he heaved a deep sigh molly going to have to go into the office this is going to take some smoothing over 
 
 come with you father said percy importantly mr crouch will need all hands on deck and i can give him my cauldron report in person 
 
 he bustled out of the kitchen mrs weasley looked most upset 
 
 arthur supposed to be on holiday this got anything to do with your office surely they can handle this without you 
 
 got to go molly said mr weasley made things worse just change into my robes and be off 
 
 mrs weasley said harry suddenly unable to contain himself hedwig arrived with a letter for me has she 
 
 hedwig dear said mrs weasley distractedly nono there been any post at all 
 
 ron and hermione looked curiously at harry with a meaningful look at both of them he said all right if i go and dump my stuff in your room ron 
 
 yeahthink i will too said ron at once hermione 
 
 yes she said quickly and the three of them marched out of the kitchen and up the stairs 
 
 up harry said ron the moment they had closed the door of the attic room behind them 
 
 something i told you harry said on saturday morning i woke up with my scar hurting again 
 
 and reactions were almost exactly as harry had imagined them back in his bedroom on privet drive hermione gasped and started making suggestions at once mentioning a number of reference books and everybody from albus dumbledore to madam pomfrey the hogwarts nurse ron simply looked dumbstruck 
 
 but he there was he i mean last time your scar kept hurting he was at hogwarts he 
 
 sure he on privet drive said harry but i was dreaming about himhim and peter you know wormtail i remember all of it now but they were plotting to killsomeone 
 
 he had teetered for a moment on the verge of saying me but bring himself to make hermione look any more horrified than she already did 
 
 it was only a dream said ron bracingly just a nightmare 
 
 yeah but was it though said harry turning to look out of the window at the brightening sky weird scar hurts and three days later the death eaters are on the march and up in the sky again 
 
 say his name ron hissed through gritted teeth 
 
 and remember what professor trelawney said harry went on ignoring ron at the end of last year 
 
 professor trelawney was their divination teacher at hogwarts terrified look vanished as she let out a derisive snort 
 
 oh harry you going to pay attention to anything that old fraud says 
 
 you there said harry you hear her this time was different i told you she went into a trance a real one and she said the dark lord would rise againgreater and more terrible than ever beforeand manage it because his servant was going to go back to himand that night wormtail escaped 
 
 there was a silence in which ron fidgeted absentmindedly with a hole in his chudley cannons bedspread 
 
 why were you asking if hedwig had come harry hermione asked are you expecting a letter 
 
 i told sirius about my scar said harry shrugging waiting for his answer 
 
 good thinking said ron his expression clearing i bet know what to do 
 
 i hoped get back to me quickly said harry 
 
 but we know where sirius ishe could be in africa or somewhere he said hermione reasonably not going to manage that journey in a few days 
 
 yeah i know said harry but there was a leaden feeling in his stomach as he looked out of the window at the sky 
 
 come and have a game of quidditch in the orchard harry said ron come on three on three bill and charlie and fred and george will can try out the wronski feint 
 
 ron said hermione in an sort of voice harry want to play quidditch right worried and all need to go to bed 
 
 yeah i want to play quidditch said harry suddenly hang on get my firebolt 
 
 hermione left the room muttering something that sounded very much like boys 
 
 
 
 neither mr weasley nor percy was at home much over the following week both left the house each morning before the rest of the family got up and returned well after dinner every night 
 
 been an absolute uproar percy told them importantly the sunday evening before they were due to return to hogwarts been putting out fires all week people keep sending howlers and of course if you open a howler straight away it explodes scorch marks all over my desk and my best quill reduced to cinders 
 
 why are they all sending howlers asked ginny who was mending her copy of one thousand magical herbs and fungi with spellotape on the rug in front of the living room fire 
 
 complaining about security at the world cup said percy they want compensation for their ruined property mundungus put in a claim for a tent with jacuzzi but got his number i know for a fact he was sleeping under a cloak propped on sticks 
 
 mrs weasley glanced at the grandfather clock in the corner harry liked this clock it was completely useless if you wanted to know the time but otherwise very informative it had nine golden hands and each of them was engraved with one of the weasley names there were no numerals around the face but descriptions of where each family member might be home school and work were there but there was also traveling lost hospital prison and in the position where the number twelve would be on a normal clock mortal peril 
 
 eight of the hands were currently pointing to the home position but mr which was the longest was still pointing to work mrs weasley sighed 
 
 your father had to go into the office on weekends since the days of she said working him far too hard his going to be ruined if he come home soon 
 
 well father feels got to make up for his mistake at the match he said percy if truth be told he was a tad unwise to make a public statement without clearing it with his head of department first 
 
 you dare blame your father for what that wretched skeeter woman wrote said mrs weasley flaring up at once 
 
 if dad said anything old rita would just have said it was disgraceful that nobody from the ministry had commented said bill who was playing chess with ron rita skeeter never makes anyone look good remember she interviewed all the gringotts charm breakers once and called me a pillock 
 
 well it is a bit long dear said mrs weasley gently if just let me 
 
 no mum 
 
 rain lashed against the living room window hermione was immersed in the standard book of spells grade copies of which mrs weasley had bought for her harry and ron in diagon alley charlie was darning a fireproof balaclava harry was polishing his firebolt the broomstick servicing kit hermione had given him for his thirteenth birthday open at his feet fred and george were sitting in a far corner quills out talking in whispers their heads bent over a piece of parchment

 everyone laughed even mrs weasley 
 
 oh your coming she said suddenly looking up at the clock again 
 
 mr hand had suddenly spun from work to traveling a second later it had shuddered to a halt on home with the others and they heard him calling from the kitchen 
 
 coming arthur called mrs weasley hurrying out of the room 
 
 a few moments later mr weasley came into the warm living room carrying his dinner on a tray he looked completely exhausted 
 
 well the really in the fire now he told mrs weasley as he sat down in an armchair near the hearth and toyed unenthusiastically with his somewhat shriveled cauliflower rita been ferreting around all week looking for more ministry to report and now found out about poor old bertha going missing so be the headline in the prophet tomorrow i told bagman he should have sent someone to look for her ages ago 
 
 mr crouch has been saying it for weeks and weeks said percy swiftly 
 
 crouch is very lucky rita found out about winky said mr weasley irritably be a worth of headlines in his being caught holding the wand that conjured the dark mark 
 
 i thought we were all agreed that that elf while irresponsible did not conjure the mark said percy hotly 
 
 if you ask me mr crouch is very lucky no one at the daily prophet knows how mean he is to elves said hermione angrily 
 
 now look here hermione said percy a ministry official like mr crouch deserves unswerving obedience from his servants 
 
 his slave you mean said hermione her voice rising passionately because he pay winky did he 
 
 i think all better go upstairs and check that packed properly said mrs weasley breaking up the argument come on now all of you 
 
 harry repacked his broomstick servicing kit put his firebolt over his shoulder and went back upstairs with ron the rain sounded even louder at the top of the house accompanied by loud whistlings and moans from the wind not to mention sporadic howls from the ghoul who lived in the attic pigwidgeon began twittering and zooming around his cage when they entered the sight of the trunks seemed to have sent him into a frenzy of excitement 
 
 bung him some owl treats said ron throwing a packet across to harry it might shut him up 
 
 harry poked a few owl treats through the bars of cage then turned to his trunk cage stood next to it still empty 
 
 been over a week harry said looking at deserted perch ron you reckon sirius has been caught do you 
 
 nah it been in the daily prophet said ron the ministry would want to show caught someone they 
 
 yeah i suppose 
 
 look the stuff mum got for you in diagon alley and got some gold out of your vault for youand washed all your socks 
 
 he heaved a pile of parcels onto camp bed and dropped the money bag and a load of socks next to it harry started unwrapping the shopping apart from the standard book of spells grade by miranda goshawk he had a handful of new quills a dozen rolls of parchment and refills for his kit he had been running low on spine of lionfish and essence of belladonna he was just piling underwear into his cauldron when ron made a loud noise of disgust behind him 
 
 what is that supposed to be 
 
 he was holding up something that looked to harry like a long maroon velvet dress it had a lace frill at the collar and matching lace cuffs 
 
 there was a knock on the door and mrs weasley entered carrying an armful of freshly laundered hogwarts robes 
 
 here you are she said sorting them into two piles now mind you pack them properly so they crease 
 
 mum given me new dress said ron handing it out to her 
 
 of course i said mrs weasley for you dress robes

 go starkers before i put that on said ron stubbornly 
 
 be so silly said mrs weasley got to have dress robes on your list i got some for harry tooshow him harry 
 
 in some trepidation harry opened the last parcel on his camp bed it as bad as he had expected however his dress robes have any lace on them at all in fact they were more or less the same as his school ones except that they were bottle green instead of black 
 
 i thought bring out the color of your eyes dear said mrs weasley fondly 
 
 well okay said ron angrily looking at robes why i have some like that 
 
 becausewell i had to get yours secondhand and there a lot of choice said mrs weasley flushing 
 
 harry looked away he would willingly have split all the money in his gringotts vault with the weasleys but he knew they would never take it 
 
 never wearing them ron was saying stubbornly never 
 
 fine snapped mrs weasley go naked and harry make sure you get a picture of him goodness knows i could do with a laugh 
 
 she left the room slamming the door behind her there was a funny spluttering noise from behind them pigwidgeon was choking on an overlarge owl treat 
 
 why is everything i own rubbish said ron furiously striding across the room to unstick beak 
 
 rowling

lionfish nov chapter ten mayhem at the ministrycontents prev chapter next chapter 
 mr weasley woke them after only a few hours sleep he used magic to pack up the tents and they left the campsite as quickly as possible passing mr roberts at the door of his cottage mr roberts had a strange dazed look about him and he waved them off with a vague merry christmas 
 
 be all right said mr weasley quietly as they marched off onto the moor sometimes when a modified it makes him a bit disorientated for a whileand that was a big thing they had to make him forget 
 
 they heard urgent voices as they approached the spot where the portkeys lay and when they reached it they found a great number of witches and wizards gathered around basil the keeper of the portkeys all clamoring to get away from the campsite as quickly as possible mr weasley had a hurried discussion with basil they joined the queue and were able to take an old rubber tire back to stoatshead hill before the sun had really risen they walked back through ottery st catchpole and up the damp lane toward the burrow in the dawn light talking very little because they were so exhausted and thinking longingly of their breakfast as they rounded the corner and the burrow came into view a cry echoed along the lane 
 
 oh thank goodness thank goodness 
 
 mrs weasley who had evidently been waiting for them in the front yard came running toward them still wearing her bedroom slippers her face pale and strained a copy of the daily prophet clutched in her hand 
 
 arthur been so worried so worried 
 
 she flung her arms around mr neck and the daily prophet fell out of her limp hand onto the ground looking down harry saw the headline scenes of terror at the quidditch world cup complete with a twinkling photograph of the dark mark over the treetops 
 
 all right mrs weasley muttered distractedly releasing mr weasley and staring around at them all with red eyes boys 
 
 and to surprise she seized fred and george and pulled them both into such a tight hug that their heads banged together 
 
 ouch mum strangling us 
 
 i shouted at you before you left mrs weasley said starting to sob all been thinking about what if had got you and the last thing i ever said to you was that you get enough oh fredgeorge 
 
 come on now molly all perfectly okay said mr weasley soothingly prising her off the twins and leading her back toward the house bill he added in an undertone pick up that paper i want to see what it says 
 
 when they were all crammed into the tiny kitchen and hermione had made mrs weasley a cup of very strong tea into which mr weasley insisted on pouring a shot of ogdens old firewhiskey bill handed his father the newspaper mr weasley scanned the front page while percy looked over his shoulder 
 
 i knew it said mr weasley heavily ministry blundersculprits not apprehendedlax securitydark wizards running uncheckednational wrote this ahof courserita skeeter 
 
 that got it in for the ministry of magic said percy furiously last week she was saying wasting our time quibbling about cauldron thickness when we should be stamping out vampires as if it specifically stated in paragraph twelve of the guidelines for the treatment of 
 
 do us a favor perce said bill yawning and shut up 
 
 mentioned said mr weasley his eyes widening behind his glasses as he reached the bottom of the daily prophet article 
 
 where spluttered mrs weasley choking on her tea and whiskey if seen that have known you were alive 
 
 not by name said mr weasley listen to this if the terrified wizards and witches who waited breathlessly for news at the edge of the wood expected reassurance from the ministry of magic they were sadly disappointed a ministry official emerged some time after the appearance of the dark mark alleging that nobody had been hurt but refusing to give any more information whether this statement will be enough to quash the rumors that several bodies were removed from the woods an hour later remains to be really said mr weasley in exasperation handing the paper to percy nobody was hurt what was i supposed to say rumors that several bodies were removed from the woodswell there certainly will be rumors now printed that 
 
 he heaved a deep sigh molly going to have to go into the office this is going to take some smoothing over 
 
 come with you father said percy importantly mr crouch will need all hands on deck and i can give him my cauldron report in person 
 
 he bustled out of the kitchen mrs weasley looked most upset 
 
 arthur supposed to be on holiday this got anything to do with your office surely they can handle this without you 
 
 got to go molly said mr weasley made things worse just change into my robes and be off 
 
 mrs weasley said harry suddenly unable to contain himself hedwig arrived with a letter for me has she 
 
 hedwig dear said mrs weasley distractedly nono there been any post at all 
 
 ron and hermione looked curiously at harry with a meaningful look at both of them he said all right if i go and dump my stuff in your room ron 
 
 yeahthink i will too said ron at once hermione 
 
 yes she said quickly and the three of them marched out of the kitchen and up the stairs 
 
 up harry said ron the moment they had closed the door of the attic room behind them 
 
 something i told you harry said on saturday morning i woke up with my scar hurting again 
 
 and reactions were almost exactly as harry had imagined them back in his bedroom on privet drive hermione gasped and started making suggestions at once mentioning a number of reference books and everybody from albus dumbledore to madam pomfrey the hogwarts nurse ron simply looked dumbstruck 
 
 but he there was he i mean last time your scar kept hurting he was at hogwarts he 
 
 sure he on privet drive said harry but i was dreaming about himhim and peter you know wormtail i remember all of it now but they were plotting to killsomeone 
 
 he had teetered for a moment on the verge of saying me but bring himself to make hermione look any more horrified than she already did 
 
 it was only a dream said ron bracingly just a nightmare 
 
 yeah but was it though said harry turning to look out of the window at the brightening sky weird scar hurts and three days later the death eaters are on the march and up in the sky again 
 
 say his name ron hissed through gritted teeth 
 
 and remember what professor trelawney said harry went on ignoring ron at the end of last year 
 
 professor trelawney was their divination teacher at hogwarts terrified look vanished as she let out a derisive snort 
 
 oh harry you going to pay attention to anything that old fraud says 
 
 you there said harry you hear her this time was different i told you she went into a trance a real one and she said the dark lord would rise againgreater and more terrible than ever beforeand manage it because his servant was going to go back to himand that night wormtail escaped 
 
 there was a silence in which ron fidgeted absentmindedly with a hole in his chudley cannons bedspread 
 
 why were you asking if hedwig had come harry hermione asked are you expecting a letter 
 
 i told sirius about my scar said harry shrugging waiting for his answer 
 
 good thinking said ron his expression clearing i bet know what to do 
 
 i hoped get back to me quickly said harry 
 
 but we know where sirius ishe could be in africa or somewhere he said hermione reasonably not going to manage that journey in a few days 
 
 yeah i know said harry but there was a leaden feeling in his stomach as he looked out of the window at the sky 
 
 come and have a game of quidditch in the orchard harry said ron come on three on three bill and charlie and fred and george will can try out the wronski feint 
 
 ron said hermione in an sort of voice harry want to play quidditch right worried and all need to go to bed 
 
 yeah i want to play quidditch said harry suddenly hang on get my firebolt 
 
 hermione left the room muttering something that sounded very much like boys 
 
 
 
 neither mr weasley nor percy was at home much over the following week both left the house each morning before the rest of the family got up and returned well after dinner every night 
 
 been an absolute uproar percy told them importantly the sunday evening before they were due to return to hogwarts been putting out fires all week people keep sending howlers and of course if you open a howler straight away it explodes scorch marks all over my desk and my best quill reduced to cinders 
 
 why are they all sending howlers asked ginny who was mending her copy of one thousand magical herbs and fungi with spellotape on the rug in front of the living room fire 
 
 complaining about security at the world cup said percy they want compensation for their ruined property mundungus put in a claim for a tent with jacuzzi but got his number i know for a fact he was sleeping under a cloak propped on sticks 
 
 mrs weasley glanced at the grandfather clock in the corner harry liked this clock it was completely useless if you wanted to know the time but otherwise very informative it had nine golden hands and each of them was engraved with one of the weasley names there were no numerals around the face but descriptions of where each family member might be home school and work were there but there was also traveling lost hospital prison and in the position where the number twelve would be on a normal clock mortal peril 
 
 eight of the hands were currently pointing to the home position but mr which was the longest was still pointing to work mrs weasley sighed 
 
 your father had to go into the office on weekends since the days of she said working him far too hard his going to be ruined if he come home soon 
 
 well father feels got to make up for his mistake at the match he said percy if truth be told he was a tad unwise to make a public statement without clearing it with his head of department first 
 
 you dare blame your father for what that wretched skeeter woman wrote said mrs weasley flaring up at once 
 
 if dad said anything old rita would just have said it was disgraceful that nobody from the ministry had commented said bill who was playing chess with ron rita skeeter never makes anyone look good remember she interviewed all the gringotts charm breakers once and called me a pillock 
 
 well it is a bit long dear said mrs weasley gently if just let me 
 
 no mum 
 
 rain lashed against the living room window hermione was immersed in the standard book of spells grade copies of which mrs weasley had bought for her harry and ron in diagon alley charlie was darning a fireproof balaclava harry was polishing his firebolt the broomstick servicing kit hermione had given him for his thirteenth birthday open at his feet fred and george were sitting in a far corner quills out talking in whispers their heads bent over a piece of parchment

 mr hand had suddenly spun from work to traveling a second later it had shuddered to a halt on home with the others and they heard him calling from the kitchen

lionfish nov chapter ten luna lovegoodcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 harry had a troubled sleep his parents wove in and out of his dreams never speaking mrs weasley sobbed over dead body watched by ron and hermione who were wearing crowns and yet again harry found himself walking down a corridor ending in a locked door he awoke abruptly with his scar prickling to find ron already dressed and talking to him 
 
 better hurry up mums going ballistic she says going to miss the train 
 
 there was a lot of commotion in the house from what he heard as he dressed at top speed harry gathered that fred and george had bewitched their trunks to fly downstairs to save the bother of carrying them with the result that they had hurtled straight into ginny and knocked her down two flights of stairs into the hall mrs black and mrs weasley were both screaming at the top of their voices 
 
 could have done her a serious injury you idiots 
 
 filthy besmirching the house of my fathers 
 
 hermione came hurrying into the room looking flustered just as harry was putting on his trainers hedwig was swaying on her shoulder and she was carrying a squirming crookshanks in her arms 
 
 mum and dad just sent hedwig owl fluttered obligingly over and perched on top of her you ready yet 
 
 nearlyginny all right harry asked shoving on his glasses 
 
 mrs patched her up said hermione but now complaining that we leave unless sturgis here otherwise the guard will be one short 
 
 guard said harry we have to go to cross with a guard 
 
 you have to go to cross with a guard hermione corrected him 
 
 why said harry irritably i thought voldemort was supposed to be lying low or are you telling me going to jump out from behind a dustbin to try and do me in 
 
 i know just what says said hermione distractedly looking at her watch but if we leave soon definitely going to miss the train 
 
 will you lot get down here now please mrs weasley bellowed and hermione jumped as though scalded and hurried out of the room harry seized hedwig stuffed her unceremoniously into her cage and set off downstairs after hermione dragging his trunk 
 
 mrs portrait was howling with rage but nobody was bothering to close the curtains over her all the noise in the hall was bound to rouse her again anyway 
 
 harry to come with me and tonks shouted mrs weasley over the repeated screeches of mudbloods scum creatures of dirt leave your trunk and your owl going to deal with the luggage oh for heavens sake sirius dumbledore said no 
 
 a bearlike black dog had appeared at side as he was clambering over the various trunks cluttering the hall to get to mrs weasley 
 
 oh honestly said mrs weasley despairingly well on your own head be it 
 
 she wrenched open the front door and stepped out into the weak september sunlight harry and the dog followed her the door slammed behind them and mrs screeches were cut off instantly 
 
 tonks harry said looking round as they went down the stone steps of number twelve which vanished the moment they reached the pavement 
 
 waiting for us just up here said mrs weasley stiffly averting her eyes from the lolloping black dog beside harry 
 
 an old woman greeted them on the corner she had tightly curled grey hair and wore a purple hat shaped like a pork pie 
 
 wotcher harry she said winking better hurry up we molly she added checking her watch 
 
 i know i know moaned mrs weasley lengthening her stride but wanted to wait for sturgis if only arthur could have got us cars from the ministry again but fudge let him borrow so much as an empty ink bottle these days how muggles can stand travelling without magic 
 
 but the great black dog gave a joyful bark and gambolled around them snapping at pigeons and chasing its own tail harry help laughing sirius had been trapped inside for a very long time mrs weasley pursed her lips in an almost aunt way 
 
 it took them twenty minutes to reach cross on foot and nothing more eventful happened during that time than sirius scaring a couple of cats for entertainment once inside the station they lingered casually beside the barrier between platforms nine and ten until the coast was clear then each of them leaned against it in turn and fell easily through on to platform nine and where the hogwarts express stood belching sooty steam over a platform packed with departing students and their families harry inhaled the familiar smell and felt his spirits soar he was really going back 
 
 i hope the others make it in time said mrs weasley anxiously staring behind her at the arch spanning the platform through which new arrivals would come 
 
 nice dog harry called a tall boy with dreadlocks 
 
 thanks lee said harry grinning as sirius wagged his tail frantically 
 
 oh good said mrs weasley sounding relieved alastor with the luggage look 
 
 a cap pulled low over his mismatched eyes moody came limping through the archway pushing a trolley loaded with their trunks 
 
 all okay he muttered to mrs weasley and tonks think we were followed 
 
 seconds later mr weasley emerged on to the platform with ron and hermione they had almost unloaded luggage trolley when fred george and ginny turned up with lupin 
 
 no trouble growled moody 
 
 nothing said lupin 
 
 still be reporting sturgis to dumbledore said moody the second time not turned up in a week getting as unreliable as mundungus 
 
 well look after yourselves said lupin shaking hands all round he reached harry last and gave him a clap on the shoulder you too harry be careful 
 
 yeah keep your head down and your eyes peeled said moody shaking hand too and forget all of youcareful what you put in writing if in doubt put it in a letter at all 
 
 been great meeting all of you said tonks hugging hermione and ginny see you soon i expect 
 
 a warning whistle sounded the students still on the platform started hurrying on to the train 
 
 quick quick said mrs weasley distractedly hugging them at random and catching harry twice write be good if forgotten anything send it on onto the train now hurry 
 
 for one brief moment the great black dog reared on to its hind legs and placed its front paws on shoulders but mrs weasley shoved harry away towards the train door hissing for sake act more like a dog sirius 
 
 see you harry called out of the open window as the train began to move while ron hermione and ginny waved beside him the figures of tonks lupin moody and mr and mrs weasley shrank rapidly but the black dog was bounding alongside the window wagging its tail blurred people on the platform were laughing to see it chasing the train then they rounded a bend and sirius was gone 
 
 he have come with us said hermione in a worried voice 
 
 oh lighten up said ron he seen daylight for months poor bloke 
 
 well said fred clapping his hands together stand around chatting all day got business to discuss with lee see you later and he and george disappeared down the corridor to the right 
 
 the train was gathering still more speed so that the houses outside the window flashed past and they swayed where they stood 
 
 shall we go and find a compartment then harry asked 
 
 ron and hermione exchanged looks 
 
 er said ron 
 
 and i are supposed to go into the prefect carriage hermione said awkwardly 
 
 ron looking at harry he seemed to have become intensely interested in the fingernails on his left hand 
 
 oh said harry right fine 
 
 i think have to stay there all journey said hermione quickly our letters said we just get instructions from the head boy and girl and then patrol the corridors from time to time 
 
 fine said harry again well ii might see you later then 
 
 yeah definitely said ron casting a shifty anxious look at harry a pain having to go down there ratherbut we have toi mean not enjoying it not percy he finished defiantly 
 
 i know not said harry and he grinned but as hermione and ron dragged their trunks crookshanks and a caged pigwidgeon off towards the engine end of the train harry felt an odd sense of loss he had never travelled on the hogwarts express without ron 
 
 come on ginny told him if we get a move on be able to save them places 
 
 right said harry picking up cage in one hand and the handle of his trunk in the other they struggled off down the corridor peering through the doors into the compartments they passed which were already full harry could not help noticing that a lot of people stared back at him with great interest and that several of them nudged their neighbours and pointed him out after he had met this behaviour in five consecutive carriages he remembered that the daily prophet had been telling its readers all summer what a lying he was he wondered dully whether the people now staring and whispering believed the stories 
 
 in the very last carriage they met neville longbottom fellow gryffindor his round face shining with the effort of pulling his trunk along and maintaining a grip on his struggling toad trevor 
 
 hi harry he panted hi ginny full i find a seat 
 
 what are you talking about said ginny who had squeezed past neville to peer into the compartment behind him room in this one only loony lovegood in here 
 
 neville mumbled something about not wanting to disturb anyone 
 
 be silly said ginny laughing all right 
 
 she slid the door open and pulled her trunk inside harry and neville followed 
 
 hi luna said ginny is it okay if we take these seats 
 
 the girl beside the window looked up she had straggly hair very pale eyebrows and protuberant eyes that gave her a permanently surprised look harry knew at once why neville had chosen to pass this compartment by the girl gave off an aura of distinct dottiness perhaps it was the fact that she had stuck her wand behind her left ear for safekeeping or that she had chosen to wear a necklace of butterbeer corks or that she was reading a magazine her eyes ranged over neville and came to rest on harry she nodded 
 
 thanks said ginny smiling at her 
 
 harry and neville stowed the three trunks and cage in the luggage rack and sat down luna watched them over her magazine which was called the quibbler she did not seem to need to blink as much as normal humans she stared and stared at harry who had taken the seat opposite her and now wished he 
 
 had a good summer luna ginny asked 
 
 yes said luna dreamily without taking her eyes off harry yes it was quite enjoyable you know harry potter she added 
 
 i know i am said harry 
 
 neville chuckled luna turned her pale eyes on him instead 
 
 and i know who you are 
 
 nobody said neville hurriedly 
 
 no not said ginny sharply neville longbottomluna lovegood in my year but in ravenclaw 
 
 wit beyond measure is greatest treasure said luna in a singsong voice 
 
 she raised her magazine high enough to hide her face and fell silent harry and neville looked at each other with their eyebrows raised ginny suppressed a giggle 
 
 the train rattled onwards speeding them out into open country it was an odd unsettled sort of day one moment the carriage was full of sunlight and the next they were passing beneath ominously grey clouds 
 
 guess what i got for my birthday said neville 
 
 another remembrall said harry remembering the device grandmother had sent him in an effort to improve his abysmal memory 
 
 no said neville i could do with one though i lost the old one ages ago no look at this 
 
 he dug the hand that was not keeping a firm grip on trevor into his schoolbag and after a little bit of rummaging pulled out what appeared to be a small grey cactus in a pot except that it was covered with what looked like boils rather than spines 
 
 mimbulus mimbletonia he said proudly 
 
 harry stared at the thing it was pulsating slightly giving it the rather sinister look of some diseased internal organ 
 
 really really rare said neville beaming i know if one in the greenhouse at hogwarts even i wait to show it to professor sprout my great uncle algie got it for me in assyria going to see if i can breed from it 
 
 harry knew that favourite subject was herbology but for the life of him he could not see what he would want with this stunted little plant 
 
 does iterdo anything he asked 
 
 loads of stuff said neville proudly got an amazing defensive mechanism here hold trevor for me 
 
 he dumped the toad into lap and took a quill from his schoolbag luna popping eyes appeared over the top of her magazine again watching what neville was doing neville held the mimbulus mimbletonia up to his eyes his tongue between his teeth chose his spot and gave the plant a sharp prod with the tip of his quill 
 
 liquid squirted from every boil on the plant thick stinking dark green jets of it they hit the ceiling the windows and spattered luna magazine ginny who had flung her arms up in front of her face just in time merely looked as though she was wearing a slimy green hat but harry whose hands had been busy preventing escape received a faceful it smelled like rancid manure 
 
 neville whose face and torso were also drenched shook his head to get the worst out of his eyes 
 
 sosorry he gasped i tried that before realise it would be quite so worry though not poisonous he added nervously as harry spat a mouthful on to the floor 
 
 at that precise moment the door of their compartment slid open 
 
 oh hello harry said a nervous voice um bad time 
 
 harry wiped the lenses of his glasses with his hand a very pretty girl with long shiny black hair was standing in the doorway smiling at him cho chang the seeker on the ravenclaw quidditch team 
 
 oh hi said harry blankly 
 
 um said cho well just thought say hello bye then 
 
 rather pink in the face she closed the door and departed harry slumped back in his seat and groaned he would have liked cho to discover him sitting with a group of very cool people laughing their heads off at a joke he had just told he would not have chosen to be sitting with neville and loony lovegood clutching a toad and dripping in stinksap 
 
 never mind said ginny bracingly look we can easily get rid of all this she pulled out her wand scourgify 
 
 the stinksap vanished 
 
 sorry said neville again in a small voice 
 
 ron and hermione did not turn up for nearly an hour by which time the food trolley had already gone by harry ginny and neville had finished their pumpkin pasties and were busy swapping chocolate frog cards when the compartment door slid open and they walked in accompanied by crookshanks and a shrilly hooting pigwidgeon in his cage 
 
 starving said ron stowing pigwidgeon next to hedwig grabbing a chocolate frog from harry and throwing himself into the seat next to him he ripped open the wrapper bit off the head and leaned back with his eyes closed as though he had had a very exhausting morning 
 
 well there are two prefects from each house said hermione looking thoroughly disgruntled as she took her seat boy and girl from each 
 
 and guess a slytherin prefect said ron still with his eyes closed 
 
 malfoy replied harry at once certain his worst fear would be confirmed 
 
 course said ron bitterly stuffing the rest of the frog into his mouth and taking another 
 
 and that complete cow pansy parkinson said hermione viciously how she got to be a prefect when thicker than a concussed troll 
 
 who are harry asked 
 
 ernie macmillan and hannah abbott said ron thickly 
 
 and anthony goldstein and padma patil for ravenclaw said hermione 
 
 you went to the yule ball with padma patil said a vague voice 
 
 everyone turned to look at luna lovegood who was gazing unblinkingly at ron over the top of the quibbler he swallowed his mouthful of frog 
 
 yeah i know i did he said looking mildly surprised 
 
 she enjoy it very much luna informed him she think you treated her very well because you dance with her i think have minded she added thoughtfully i like dancing very much 
 
 she retreated behind the quibbler again ron stared at the cover with his mouth hanging open for a few seconds then looked around at ginny for some kind of explanation but ginny had stuffed her knuckles in her mouth to stop herself giggling ron shook his head bemused then checked his watch 
 
 supposed to patrol the corridors every so often he told harry and neville and we can give out punishments if people are misbehaving i wait to get crabbe and goyle for something 
 
 not supposed to abuse your position ron said hermione sharply 
 
 yeah right because malfoy abuse it at all said ron sarcastically 
 
 so going to descend to his level 
 
 no just going to make sure i get his mates before he gets mine 
 
 for heavens sake ron 
 
 make goyle do lines kill him he hates writing said ron happily he lowered his voice to low grunt and screwing up his face in a look of pained concentration mimed writing in midair i must not look like a backside 
 
 everyone laughed but nobody laughed harder than luna lovegood she let out a scream of mirth that caused hedwig to wake up and flap her wings indignantly and crookshanks to leap up into the luggage rack hissing luna laughed so hard her magazine slipped out of her grasp slid down her legs and onto the floor 
 
 that was funny 
 
 her prominent eyes swam with tears as she gasped for breath staring at ron utterly nonplussed he looked around at the others who were now laughing at the expression on face and at the ludicrously prolonged laughter of luna lovegood who was rocking backwards and forwards clutching her sides 
 
 are you taking the mickey said ron frowning at her 
 
 backside she choked holding her ribs 
 
 everyone else was watching luna laughing but harry glancing at the magazine on the floor noticed something that made him dive for it it had been hard to tell what the picture on the front was but harry now realised it was a fairly bad cartoon of cornelius fudge harry only recognised him because of the bowler hat one of fudges hands was clenched around a bag of gold the other hand was throttling a goblin the cartoon was captioned how far will fudge go to gain gringotts 
 
 beneath this were listed the titles of other articles inside the magazine 
 
 corruption in the quidditch the tornados are taking control 
 
 secrets of the ancient ruins revealed 
 
 sirius black villain or victim 
 
 can i have a look at this harry asked luna eagerly 
 
 she nodded still gazing at ron breathless with laughter 
 
 harry opened the magazine and scanned the index until this moment he had completely forgotten the magazine kingsley had handed mr weasley to give to sirius but it must have been this edition of the quibbler 
 
 he found the page and turned excitedly to the article 
 
 this too was illustrated by a rather bad cartoon in fact harry would not have known it was supposed to be sirius if it been captioned sirius was standing on a pile of human bones with his wand out the headline on the article said 
 
 siriusblack as painted notorious mass murderer or innocent singing sensation 
 
 harry had to read this first sentence several times before he was convinced that he had not misunderstood it since when had sirius been a singing sensation 
 
 for fourteen years sirius black has been believed guilty of the mass murder of twelve innocent muggles and one wizard audacious escape from azkaban two years ago has led to the widest manhunt ever conducted by the ministry of magic none of us has ever questioned that he deserves to be recaptured and handed back to the dementors 
 
 but does he 
 
 startling new evidence has recently come to light that sirius black may not have committed the crimes for which he was sent to azhaban in fact says doris purkiss of acanthia way little norton black may not even have been present at the killings 
 
 what people realise is that sirius black is a false name says mrs purkiss the man people believe to be sirius black is actually stubby boardman lead singer of popular singing group the hobgoblins who retired from public life after being struck on the ear by a turnip at a concert in little norton church hall nearly fifteen years ago i recognised him the moment i saw his picture in the paper now stubby possibly have committed those crimes because on the day in question he happened to be enjoying a romantic candlelit dinner with me i have written to the minister for magic and am expecting him to give stubby alias sirius a full pardon any day now 
 
 harry finished reading and stared at the page in disbelief perhaps it was a joke he thought perhaps the magazine often printed spoof items he flicked back a few pages and found the piece on fudge 
 
 cornelius fudge the minister for magic denied that he had any plans to take over the running of the wizarding bank gringotts when he was elected minister for magic jive years ago fudge has always insisted that he wants nothing more than to cooperate peacefully with the guardians of our gold 
 
 but does he 
 
 sources close to the minister have recently disclosed that dearest ambition is to seize control of the goblin gold supplies and that he will not hesitate to use force if need be 
 
 it be the first time either said a ministry insider cornelius fudge what his friends call him if you could hear him when he thinks no listening oh always talking about the goblins had done in had them drowned had them dropped off buildings had them poisoned had them cooked in pies 
 
 harry did not read any further fudge might have many faults but harry found it extremely hard to imagine him ordering goblins to be cooked in pies he flicked through the rest of the magazine pausing every few pages he read an accusation that the tutshill tornados were winning the quidditch league by a combination of blackmail illegal and torture an interview with a wizard who claimed to have flown to the moon on a cleansweep six and brought back a bag of moon frogs to prove it and an article on ancient runes which at least explained why luna had been reading the quibbler according to the magazine if you turned the runes on their heads they revealed a spell to make your ears turn into kumquats in fact compared to the rest of the articles in the quibbler the suggestion that sirius might really be the lead singer of the hobgoblins was quite sensible 
 
 anything good in there asked ron as harry closed the magazine 
 
 of course not said hermione scathingly before harry could answer the rubbish everyone knows that 
 
 excuse me said luna her voice had suddenly lost its dreamy quality my the editor 
 
 ioh said hermione looking embarrassed well got some interesting i mean quite 
 
 have it back thank you said luna coldly and leaning forwards she snatched it out of hands riffling through it to page she turned it resolutely again and disappeared behind it just as the compartment door opened for the third time 
 
 harry looked around he had expected this but that did not make the sight of draco malfoy smirking at him from between his cronies crabbe and goyle any more enjoyable 
 
 what he said aggressively before malfoy could open his mouth 
 
 manners potter or have to give you a detention drawled malfoy whose sleek blond hair and pointed chin were just like his you see i unlike you have been made a prefect which means that i unlike you have the power to hand out punishments 
 
 yeah said harry but you unlike me are a git so get out and leave us alone 
 
 ron hermione ginny and neville laughed lip curled 
 
 tell me how does it feel being to weasley potter he asked 
 
 shut up malfoy said hermione sharply 
 
 i seem to have touched a nerve said malfoy smirking well just watch yourself potter because be dogging your footsteps in case you step out of line 
 
 get out said hermione standing up 
 
 sniggering malfoy gave harry a last malicious look and departed with crabbe and goyle lumbering along in his wake hermione slammed the compartment door behind them and turned to look at harry who knew at once that she like him had registered what malfoy had said and been just as unnerved by it 
 
 chuck us another frog said ron who had clearly noticed nothing 
 
 harry could not talk freely in front of neville and luna he exchanged another nervous look with hermione then stared out of the window 
 
 he had thought sirius coming with him to the station was a bit of a laugh but suddenly it seemed reckless if not downright dangerous hermione had been right sirius should not have come what if mr malfoy had noticed the black dog and told draco what if he had deduced that the weasleys lupin tonks and moody knew where sirius was hiding or had use of the word dogging been a coincidence 
 
 the weather remained undecided as they travelled farther and farther north rain spattered the windows in a way then the sun put in a feeble appearance before clouds drifted over it once more when darkness fell and lamps came on inside the carriages luna rolled up the quibbler put it carefully away in her bag and took to staring at everyone in the compartment instead 
 
 harry was sitting with his forehead pressed against the train window trying to get a first distant glimpse of hogwarts but it was a moonless night and the window was grimy 
 
 better change said hermione at last and all of them opened their trunks with difficulty and pulled on their school robes she and ron pinned their prefect badges carefully to their chests harry saw ron checking his reflection in the black window 
 
 at last the train began to slow down and they heard the usual racket up and down it as everybody scrambled to get their luggage and pets assembled ready for departure ron and hermione were supposed to supervise all this they disappeared from the carriage again leaving harry and the others to look after crookshanks and pigwidgeon 
 
 carry that owl if you like said luna to harry reaching out for pigwidgeon as neville stowed trevor carefully in an inside pocket 
 
 oherthanks said harry handing her the cage and hoisting more securely into his arms 
 
 they shuffled out of the compartment feeling the first sting of the night air on their faces as they joined the crowd in the corridor slowly they moved towards the doors harry could smell the pine trees that lined the path down to the lake he stepped down on to the platform and looked around listening for the familiar call of firs years over ere firs years 
 
 but it did not come instead a quite different voice a brisk female one was calling out first years line up over here please all first years to me 
 
 a lantern came swinging towards harry and by its light he saw the prominent chin and severe haircut of professor the witch who had taken over care of magical creatures lessons for a while the previous year 
 
 hagrid he said out loud 
 
 i know said ginny but better get out of the way blocking the door 
 
 oh yeah 
 
 harry and ginny became separated as they moved off along the platform and out through the station jostled by the crowd harry squinted through the darkness for a glimpse of hagrid he had to be here harry had been relying on itseeing hagrid again was one of the things been looking forward to most but there was no sign of him 
 
 he have left harry told himself as he shuffled slowly through a narrow doorway on to the road outside with the rest of the crowd just got a cold or something 
 
 he looked around for ron or hermione wanting to know what they thought about the reappearance of professor but neither of them was anywhere near him so he allowed himself to be shunted forward onto the dark road outside hogsmeade station 
 
 here stood the hundred or so horseless stagecoaches that always took the students above first year up to the castle harry glanced quickly at them turned away to keep a lookout for ron and hermione then did a 
 
 the coaches were no longer horseless there were creatures standing between the carriage shafts if he had had to give them a name he supposed he would have called them horses though there was something reptilian about them too they were completely fleshless their black coats clinging to their skeletons of which every bone was visible their heads were dragonish and their eyes white and staring wings sprouted from each withervast black leathery wings that looked as though they ought to belong to giant bats standing still and quiet in the gathering gloom the creatures looked eerie and sinister harry could not understand why the coaches were being pulled by these horrible horses when they were quite capable of moving along by themselves 
 
 pig said voice right behind harry 
 
 that luna girl was carrying him said harry turning quickly eager to consult ron about hagrid where reckon 
 
 hagrid is i dunno said ron sounding worried better be okay 
 
 a short distance away draco malfoy followed by a small gang of cronies including crabbe goyle and pansy parkinson was pushing some out of the way so that he and his friends could get a coach to themselves seconds later hermione emerged panting from the crowd 
 
 malfoy was being absolutely foul to a back there i swear going to report him only had his badge three minutes and using it to bully people worse than ever crookshanks 
 
 got him said harry there she is 
 
 ginny had just emerged from the crowd clutching a squirming crookshanks 
 
 thanks said hermione relieving ginny of the cat come on get a carriage together before they all fill up 
 
 i got pig yet ron said but hermione was already heading off towards the nearest unoccupied coach harry remained behind with ron 
 
 what are those things reckon he asked ron nodding at the horrible horses as the other students surged past them 
 
 what things 
 
 those horse 
 
 luna appeared holding cage in her arms the tiny owl was twittering excitedly as usual 
 
 here you are she said a sweet little owl he 
 
 er yeah all right said ron gruffly well come on then get in what were you saying harry 
 
 i was saying what are those horse things harry said as he ron and luna made for the carriage in which hermione and ginny were already sitting 
 
 what horse things 
 
 the horse things pulling the carriages said harry impatiently they were after all about three feet from the nearest one it was watching them with empty white eyes ron however gave harry a perplexed look 
 
 what are you talking about 
 
 talking aboutlook 
 
 harry grabbed arm and wheeled him about so that he was face to face with the winged horse ron stared straight at it for a second then looked back at harry 
 
 what am i supposed to be looking at 
 
 at thethere between the shafts harnessed to the coach right there in front 
 
 but as ron continued to look bemused a strange thought occurred to harry 
 
 you see them 
 
 see what 
 
 you see pulling the carriages 
 
 ron looked seriously alarmed now 
 
 are you feeling all right harry 
 
 i yeah 
 
 harry felt utterly bewildered the horse was there in front of him gleaming solidly in the dim light issuing from the station windows behind them vapour rising from its nostrils in the chilly night air yet unless ron was fakingand it was a very feeble joke if he wasron could not see it at all 
 
 shall we get in then said ron uncertainly looking at harry as though worried about him 
 
 yeah said harry yeah go on 
 
 all right said a dreamy voice from beside harry as ron vanished into the dark interior not going mad or anything i can see them too 
 
 can you said harry desperately turning to luna he could see the horses reflected in her wide silvery eyes 
 
 oh yes said luna been able to see them ever since my first day here always pulled the carriages worry just as sane as i am 
 
 smiling faintly she climbed into the musty interior of the carriage after ron not altogether reassured harry followed her 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the order of the phoenix 
 

lionfish nov chapter ten luna lovegoodcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 harry had a troubled sleep his parents wove in and out of his dreams never speaking mrs weasley sobbed over dead body watched by ron and hermione who were wearing crowns and yet again harry found himself walking down a corridor ending in a locked door he awoke abruptly with his scar prickling to find ron already dressed and talking to him 
 
 better hurry up mums going ballistic she says going to miss the train 
 
 there was a lot of commotion in the house from what he heard as he dressed at top speed harry gathered that fred and george had bewitched their trunks to fly downstairs to save the bother of carrying them with the result that they had hurtled straight into ginny and knocked her down two flights of stairs into the hall mrs black and mrs weasley were both screaming at the top of their voices 
 
 could have done her a serious injury you idiots 
 
 filthy besmirching the house of my fathers 
 
 hermione came hurrying into the room looking flustered just as harry was putting on his trainers hedwig was swaying on her shoulder and she was carrying a squirming crookshanks in her arms 
 
 mum and dad just sent hedwig owl fluttered obligingly over and perched on top of her you ready yet 
 
 nearlyginny all right harry asked shoving on his glasses 
 
 mrs patched her up said hermione but now complaining that we leave unless sturgis here otherwise the guard will be one short 
 
 guard said harry we have to go to cross with a guard 
 
 you have to go to cross with a guard hermione corrected him 
 
 why said harry irritably i thought voldemort was supposed to be lying low or are you telling me going to jump out from behind a dustbin to try and do me in 
 
 i know just what says said hermione distractedly looking at her watch but if we leave soon definitely going to miss the train 
 
 will you lot get down here now please mrs weasley bellowed and hermione jumped as though scalded and hurried out of the room harry seized hedwig stuffed her unceremoniously into her cage and set off downstairs after hermione dragging his trunk 
 
 mrs portrait was howling with rage but nobody was bothering to close the curtains over her all the noise in the hall was bound to rouse her again anyway 
 
 harry to come with me and tonks shouted mrs weasley over the repeated screeches of mudbloods scum creatures of dirt leave your trunk and your owl going to deal with the luggage oh for heavens sake sirius dumbledore said no 
 
 a bearlike black dog had appeared at side as he was clambering over the various trunks cluttering the hall to get to mrs weasley 
 
 oh honestly said mrs weasley despairingly well on your own head be it 
 
 she wrenched open the front door and stepped out into the weak september sunlight harry and the dog followed her the door slammed behind them and mrs screeches were cut off instantly 
 
 tonks harry said looking round as they went down the stone steps of number twelve which vanished the moment they reached the pavement 
 
 waiting for us just up here said mrs weasley stiffly averting her eyes from the lolloping black dog beside harry 
 
 an old woman greeted them on the corner she had tightly curled grey hair and wore a purple hat shaped like a pork pie 
 
 wotcher harry she said winking better hurry up we molly she added checking her watch 
 
 i know i know moaned mrs weasley lengthening her stride but wanted to wait for sturgis if only arthur could have got us cars from the ministry again but fudge let him borrow so much as an empty ink bottle these days how muggles can stand travelling without magic 
 
 but the great black dog gave a joyful bark and gambolled around them snapping at pigeons and chasing its own tail harry help laughing sirius had been trapped inside for a very long time mrs weasley pursed her lips in an almost aunt way 
 
 it took them twenty minutes to reach cross on foot and nothing more eventful happened during that time than sirius scaring a couple of cats for entertainment once inside the station they lingered casually beside the barrier between platforms nine and ten until the coast was clear then each of them leaned against it in turn and fell easily through on to platform nine and where the hogwarts express stood belching sooty steam over a platform packed with departing students and their families harry inhaled the familiar smell and felt his spirits soar he was really going back 
 
 i hope the others make it in time said mrs weasley anxiously staring behind her at the arch spanning the platform through which new arrivals would come 
 
 nice dog harry called a tall boy with dreadlocks 
 
 thanks lee said harry grinning as sirius wagged his tail frantically 
 
 oh good said mrs weasley sounding relieved alastor with the luggage look 
 
 a cap pulled low over his mismatched eyes moody came limping through the archway pushing a trolley loaded with their trunks 
 
 all okay he muttered to mrs weasley and tonks think we were followed 
 
 seconds later mr weasley emerged on to the platform with ron and hermione they had almost unloaded luggage trolley when fred george and ginny turned up with lupin 
 
 no trouble growled moody 
 
 nothing said lupin 
 
 still be reporting sturgis to dumbledore said moody the second time not turned up in a week getting as unreliable as mundungus 
 
 well look after yourselves said lupin shaking hands all round he reached harry last and gave him a clap on the shoulder you too harry be careful 
 
 yeah keep your head down and your eyes peeled said moody shaking hand too and forget all of youcareful what you put in writing if in doubt put it in a letter at all 
 
 been great meeting all of you said tonks hugging hermione and ginny see you soon i expect 
 
 a warning whistle sounded the students still on the platform started hurrying on to the train 
 
 quick quick said mrs weasley distractedly hugging them at random and catching harry twice write be good if forgotten anything send it on onto the train now hurry 
 
 for one brief moment the great black dog reared on to its hind legs and placed its front paws on shoulders but mrs weasley shoved harry away towards the train door hissing for sake act more like a dog sirius 
 
 see you harry called out of the open window as the train began to move while ron hermione and ginny waved beside him the figures of tonks lupin moody and mr and mrs weasley shrank rapidly but the black dog was bounding alongside the window wagging its tail blurred people on the platform were laughing to see it chasing the train then they rounded a bend and sirius was gone 
 
 he have come with us said hermione in a worried voice 
 
 oh lighten up said ron he seen daylight for months poor bloke 
 
 well said fred clapping his hands together stand around chatting all day got business to discuss with lee see you later and he and george disappeared down the corridor to the right 
 
 the train was gathering still more speed so that the houses outside the window flashed past and they swayed where they stood 
 
 shall we go and find a compartment then harry asked 
 
 ron and hermione exchanged looks 
 
 er said ron 
 
 and i are supposed to go into the prefect carriage hermione said awkwardly 
 
 ron looking at harry he seemed to have become intensely interested in the fingernails on his left hand 
 
 oh said harry right fine 
 
 i think have to stay there all journey said hermione quickly our letters said we just get instructions from the head boy and girl and then patrol the corridors from time to time 
 
 fine said harry again well ii might see you later then 
 
 yeah definitely said ron casting a shifty anxious look at harry a pain having to go down there ratherbut we have toi mean not enjoying it not percy he finished defiantly 
 
 i know not said harry and he grinned but as hermione and ron dragged their trunks crookshanks and a caged pigwidgeon off towards the engine end of the train harry felt an odd sense of loss he had never travelled on the hogwarts express without ron 
 
 come on ginny told him if we get a move on be able to save them places 
 
 right said harry picking up cage in one hand and the handle of his trunk in the other they struggled off down the corridor peering through the doors into the compartments they passed which were already full harry could not help noticing that a lot of people stared back at him with great interest and that several of them nudged their neighbours and pointed him out after he had met this behaviour in five consecutive carriages he remembered that the daily prophet had been telling its readers all summer what a lying he was he wondered dully whether the people now staring and whispering believed the stories 
 
 in the very last carriage they met neville longbottom fellow gryffindor his round face shining with the effort of pulling his trunk along and maintaining a grip on his struggling toad trevor 
 
 hi harry he panted hi ginny full i find a seat 
 
 what are you talking about said ginny who had squeezed past neville to peer into the compartment behind him room in this one only loony lovegood in here 
 
 neville mumbled something about not wanting to disturb anyone 
 
 be silly said ginny laughing all right 
 
 she slid the door open and pulled her trunk inside harry and neville followed 
 
 hi luna said ginny is it okay if we take these seats 
 
 the girl beside the window looked up she had straggly hair very pale eyebrows and protuberant eyes that gave her a permanently surprised look harry knew at once why neville had chosen to pass this compartment by the girl gave off an aura of distinct dottiness perhaps it was the fact that she had stuck her wand behind her left ear for safekeeping or that she had chosen to wear a necklace of butterbeer corks or that she was reading a magazine her eyes ranged over neville and came to rest on harry she nodded 
 
 thanks said ginny smiling at her 
 
 harry and neville stowed the three trunks and cage in the luggage rack and sat down luna watched them over her magazine which was called the quibbler she did not seem to need to blink as much as normal humans she stared and stared at harry who had taken the seat opposite her and now wished he 
 
 had a good summer luna ginny asked 
 
 yes said luna dreamily without taking her eyes off harry yes it was quite enjoyable you know harry potter she added 
 
 i know i am said harry 
 
 neville chuckled luna turned her pale eyes on him instead 
 
 and i know who you are 
 
 nobody said neville hurriedly 
 
 no not said ginny sharply neville longbottomluna lovegood in my year but in ravenclaw 
 
 wit beyond measure is greatest treasure said luna in a singsong voice 
 
 she raised her magazine high enough to hide her face and fell silent harry and neville looked at each other with their eyebrows raised ginny suppressed a giggle 
 
 the train rattled onwards speeding them out into open country it was an odd unsettled sort of day one moment the carriage was full of sunlight and the next they were passing beneath ominously grey clouds 
 
 guess what i got for my birthday said neville 
 
 another remembrall said harry remembering the device grandmother had sent him in an effort to improve his abysmal memory 
 
 no said neville i could do with one though i lost the old one ages ago no look at this 
 
 he dug the hand that was not keeping a firm grip on trevor into his schoolbag and after a little bit of rummaging pulled out what appeared to be a small grey cactus in a pot except that it was covered with what looked like boils rather than spines 
 
 mimbulus mimbletonia he said proudly 
 
 harry stared at the thing it was pulsating slightly giving it the rather sinister look of some diseased internal organ 
 
 really really rare said neville beaming i know if one in the greenhouse at hogwarts even i wait to show it to professor sprout my great uncle algie got it for me in assyria going to see if i can breed from it 
 
 harry knew that favourite subject was herbology but for the life of him he could not see what he would want with this stunted little plant 
 
 does iterdo anything he asked 
 
 loads of stuff said neville proudly got an amazing defensive mechanism here hold trevor for me 
 
 he dumped the toad into lap and took a quill from his schoolbag luna popping eyes appeared over the top of her magazine again watching what neville was doing neville held the mimbulus mimbletonia up to his eyes his tongue between his teeth chose his spot and gave the plant a sharp prod with the tip of his quill 
 
 liquid squirted from every boil on the plant thick stinking dark green jets of it they hit the ceiling the windows and spattered luna magazine ginny who had flung her arms up in front of her face just in time merely looked as though she was wearing a slimy green hat but harry whose hands had been busy preventing escape received a faceful it smelled like rancid manure 
 
 neville whose face and torso were also drenched shook his head to get the worst out of his eyes 
 
 sosorry he gasped i tried that before realise it would be quite so worry though not poisonous he added nervously as harry spat a mouthful on to the floor 
 
 at that precise moment the door of their compartment slid open 
 
 oh hello harry said a nervous voice um bad time 
 
 harry wiped the lenses of his glasses with his hand a very pretty girl with long shiny black hair was standing in the doorway smiling at him cho chang the seeker on the ravenclaw quidditch team 
 
 oh hi said harry blankly 
 
 um said cho well just thought say hello bye then 
 
 rather pink in the face she closed the door and departed harry slumped back in his seat and groaned he would have liked cho to discover him sitting with a group of very cool people laughing their heads off at a joke he had just told he would not have chosen to be sitting with neville and loony lovegood clutching a toad and dripping in stinksap 
 
 never mind said ginny bracingly look we can easily get rid of all this she pulled out her wand scourgify 
 
 the stinksap vanished 
 
 sorry said neville again in a small voice 
 
 ron and hermione did not turn up for nearly an hour by which time the food trolley had already gone by harry ginny and neville had finished their pumpkin pasties and were busy swapping chocolate frog cards when the compartment door slid open and they walked in accompanied by crookshanks and a shrilly hooting pigwidgeon in his cage 
 
 starving said ron stowing pigwidgeon next to hedwig grabbing a chocolate frog from harry and throwing himself into the seat next to him he ripped open the wrapper bit off the head and leaned back with his eyes closed as though he had had a very exhausting morning 
 
 well there are two prefects from each house said hermione looking thoroughly disgruntled as she took her seat boy and girl from each 
 
 and guess a slytherin prefect said ron still with his eyes closed 
 
 malfoy replied harry at once certain his worst fear would be confirmed 
 
 course said ron bitterly stuffing the rest of the frog into his mouth and taking another 
 
 and that complete cow pansy parkinson said hermione viciously how she got to be a prefect when thicker than a concussed troll 
 
 who are harry asked 
 
 ernie macmillan and hannah abbott said ron thickly 
 
 and anthony goldstein and padma patil for ravenclaw said hermione 
 
 you went to the yule ball with padma patil said a vague voice 
 
 everyone turned to look at luna lovegood who was gazing unblinkingly at ron over the top of the quibbler he swallowed his mouthful of frog 
 
 yeah i know i did he said looking mildly surprised 
 
 she enjoy it very much luna informed him she think you treated her very well because you dance with her i think have minded she added thoughtfully i like dancing very much 
 
 she retreated behind the quibbler again ron stared at the cover with his mouth hanging open for a few seconds then looked around at ginny for some kind of explanation but ginny had stuffed her knuckles in her mouth to stop herself giggling ron shook his head bemused then checked his watch 
 
 supposed to patrol the corridors every so often he told harry and neville and we can give out punishments if people are misbehaving i wait to get crabbe and goyle for something 
 
 not supposed to abuse your position ron said hermione sharply 
 
 yeah right because malfoy abuse it at all said ron sarcastically 
 
 so going to descend to his level 
 
 no just going to make sure i get his mates before he gets mine 
 
 for heavens sake ron 
 
 make goyle do lines kill him he hates writing said ron happily he lowered his voice to low grunt and screwing up his face in a look of pained concentration mimed writing in midair i must not look like a backside 
 
 everyone laughed but nobody laughed harder than luna lovegood she let out a scream of mirth that caused hedwig to wake up and flap her wings indignantly and crookshanks to leap up into the luggage rack hissing luna laughed so hard her magazine slipped out of her grasp slid down her legs and onto the floor 
 
 that was funny 
 
 her prominent eyes swam with tears as she gasped for breath staring at ron utterly nonplussed he looked around at the others who were now laughing at the expression on face and at the ludicrously prolonged laughter of luna lovegood who was rocking backwards and forwards clutching her sides 
 
 are you taking the mickey said ron frowning at her 
 
 backside she choked holding her ribs 
 
 everyone else was watching luna laughing but harry glancing at the magazine on the floor noticed something that made him dive for it it had been hard to tell what the picture on the front was but harry now realised it was a fairly bad cartoon of cornelius fudge harry only recognised him because of the bowler hat one of fudges hands was clenched around a bag of gold the other hand was throttling a goblin the cartoon was captioned how far will fudge go to gain gringotts 
 
 beneath this were listed the titles of other articles inside the magazine 
 
 corruption in the quidditch the tornados are taking control 
 
 secrets of the ancient ruins revealed 
 
 sirius black villain or victim 
 
 can i have a look at this harry asked luna eagerly 
 
 she nodded still gazing at ron breathless with laughter 
 
 harry opened the magazine and scanned the index until this moment he had completely forgotten the magazine kingsley had handed mr weasley to give to sirius but it must have been this edition of the quibbler 
 
 he found the page and turned excitedly to the article 
 
 this too was illustrated by a rather bad cartoon in fact harry would not have known it was supposed to be sirius if it been captioned sirius was standing on a pile of human bones with his wand out the headline on the article said 
 
 siriusblack as painted notorious mass murderer or innocent singing sensation 
 
 harry had to read this first sentence several times before he was convinced that he had not misunderstood it since when had sirius been a singing sensation 
 
 for fourteen years sirius black has been believed guilty of the mass murder of twelve innocent muggles and one wizard audacious escape from azkaban two years ago has led to the widest manhunt ever conducted by the ministry of magic none of us has ever questioned that he deserves to be recaptured and handed back to the dementors 
 
 but does he 
 
 startling new evidence has recently come to light that sirius black may not have committed the crimes for which he was sent to azhaban in fact says doris purkiss of acanthia way little norton black may not even have been present at the killings 
 
 what people realise is that sirius black is a false name says mrs purkiss the man people believe to be sirius black is actually stubby boardman lead singer of popular singing group the hobgoblins who retired from public life after being struck on the ear by a turnip at a concert in little norton church hall nearly fifteen years ago i recognised him the moment i saw his picture in the paper now stubby possibly have committed those crimes because on the day in question he happened to be enjoying a romantic candlelit dinner with me i have written to the minister for magic and am expecting him to give stubby alias sirius a full pardon any day now 
 
 harry finished reading and stared at the page in disbelief perhaps it was a joke he thought perhaps the magazine often printed spoof items he flicked back a few pages and found the piece on fudge 
 
 cornelius fudge the minister for magic denied that he had any plans to take over the running of the wizarding bank gringotts when he was elected minister for magic jive years ago fudge has always insisted that he wants nothing more than to cooperate peacefully with the guardians of our gold 
 
 but does he 
 
 sources close to the minister have recently disclosed that dearest ambition is to seize control of the goblin gold supplies and that he will not hesitate to use force if need be 
 
 it be the first time either said a ministry insider cornelius fudge what his friends call him if you could hear him when he thinks no listening oh always talking about the goblins had done in had them drowned had them dropped off buildings had them poisoned had them cooked in pies 
 
 harry did not read any further fudge might have many faults but harry found it extremely hard to imagine him ordering goblins to be cooked in pies he flicked through the rest of the magazine pausing every few pages he read an accusation that the tutshill tornados were winning the quidditch league by a combination of blackmail illegal and torture an interview with a wizard who claimed to have flown to the moon on a cleansweep six and brought back a bag of moon frogs to prove it and an article on ancient runes which at least explained why luna had been reading the quibbler according to the magazine if you turned the runes on their heads they revealed a spell to make your ears turn into kumquats in fact compared to the rest of the articles in the quibbler the suggestion that sirius might really be the lead singer of the hobgoblins was quite sensible 
 
 anything good in there asked ron as harry closed the magazine 
 
 of course not said hermione scathingly before harry could answer the rubbish everyone knows that 
 
 excuse me said luna her voice had suddenly lost its dreamy quality my the editor 
 
 ioh said hermione looking embarrassed well got some interesting i mean quite 
 
 have it back thank you said luna coldly and leaning forwards she snatched it out of hands riffling through it to page she turned it resolutely again and disappeared behind it just as the compartment door opened for the third time 
 
 harry looked around he had expected this but that did not make the sight of draco malfoy smirking at him from between his cronies crabbe and goyle any more enjoyable 
 
 what he said aggressively before malfoy could open his mouth 
 
 manners potter or have to give you a detention drawled malfoy whose sleek blond hair and pointed chin were just like his you see i unlike you have been made a prefect which means that i unlike you have the power to hand out punishments 
 
 yeah said harry but you unlike me are a git so get out and leave us alone 
 
 ron hermione ginny and neville laughed lip curled 
 
 tell me how does it feel being to weasley potter he asked 
 
 shut up malfoy said hermione sharply 
 
 i seem to have touched a nerve said malfoy smirking well just watch yourself potter because be dogging your footsteps in case you step out of line 
 
 get out said hermione standing up 
 
 sniggering malfoy gave harry a last malicious look and departed with crabbe and goyle lumbering along in his wake hermione slammed the compartment door behind them and turned to look at harry who knew at once that she like him had registered what malfoy had said and been just as unnerved by it 
 
 chuck us another frog said ron who had clearly noticed nothing 
 
 harry could not talk freely in front of neville and luna he exchanged another nervous look with hermione then stared out of the window 
 
 he had thought sirius coming with him to the station was a bit of a laugh but suddenly it seemed reckless if not downright dangerous hermione had been right sirius should not have come what if mr malfoy had noticed the black dog and told draco what if he had deduced that the weasleys lupin tonks and moody knew where sirius was hiding or had use of the word dogging been a coincidence 
 
 the weather remained undecided as they travelled farther and farther north rain spattered the windows in a way then the sun put in a feeble appearance before clouds drifted over it once more when darkness fell and lamps came on inside the carriages luna rolled up the quibbler put it carefully away in her bag and took to staring at everyone in the compartment instead 
 
 harry was sitting with his forehead pressed against the train window trying to get a first distant glimpse of hogwarts but it was a moonless night and the window was grimy 
 
 better change said hermione at last and all of them opened their trunks with difficulty and pulled on their school robes she and ron pinned their prefect badges carefully to their chests harry saw ron checking his reflection in the black window 
 
 at last the train began to slow down and they heard the usual racket up and down it as everybody scrambled to get their luggage and pets assembled ready for departure ron and hermione were supposed to supervise all this they disappeared from the carriage again leaving harry and the others to look after crookshanks and pigwidgeon 
 
 carry that owl if you like said luna to harry reaching out for pigwidgeon as neville stowed trevor carefully in an inside pocket 
 
 oherthanks said harry handing her the cage and hoisting more securely into his arms 
 
 they shuffled out of the compartment feeling the first sting of the night air on their faces as they joined the crowd in the corridor slowly they moved towards the doors harry could smell the pine trees that lined the path down to the lake he stepped down on to the platform and looked around listening for the familiar call of firs years over ere firs years 
 
 but it did not come instead a quite different voice a brisk female one was calling out first years line up over here please all first years to me 
 
 a lantern came swinging towards harry and by its light he saw the prominent chin and severe haircut of professor the witch who had taken over care of magical creatures lessons for a while the previous year 
 
 hagrid he said out loud 
 
 i know said ginny but better get out of the way blocking the door 
 
 oh yeah 
 
 harry and ginny became separated as they moved off along the platform and out through the station jostled by the crowd harry squinted through the darkness for a glimpse of hagrid he had to be here harry had been relying on itseeing hagrid again was one of the things been looking forward to most but there was no sign of him 
 
 he have left harry told himself as he shuffled slowly through a narrow doorway on to the road outside with the rest of the crowd just got a cold or something 
 
 he looked around for ron or hermione wanting to know what they thought about the reappearance of professor but neither of them was anywhere near him so he allowed himself to be shunted forward onto the dark road outside hogsmeade station 
 
 here stood the hundred or so horseless stagecoaches that always took the students above first year up to the castle harry glanced quickly at them turned away to keep a lookout for ron and hermione then did a 
 
 the coaches were no longer horseless there were creatures standing between the carriage shafts if he had had to give them a name he supposed he would have called them horses though there was something reptilian about them too they were completely fleshless their black coats clinging to their skeletons of which every bone was visible their heads were dragonish and their eyes white and staring wings sprouted from each withervast black leathery wings that looked as though they ought to belong to giant bats standing still and quiet in the gathering gloom the creatures looked eerie and sinister harry could not understand why the coaches were being pulled by these horrible horses when they were quite capable of moving along by themselves 
 
 pig said voice right behind harry 
 
 that luna girl was carrying him said harry turning quickly eager to consult ron about hagrid where reckon 
 
 hagrid is i dunno said ron sounding worried better be okay 
 
 a short distance away draco malfoy followed by a small gang of cronies including crabbe goyle and pansy parkinson was pushing some out of the way so that he and his friends could get a coach to themselves seconds later hermione emerged panting from the crowd 
 
 malfoy was being absolutely foul to a back there i swear going to report him only had his badge three minutes and using it to bully people worse than ever crookshanks 
 
 got him said harry there she is 
 
 ginny had just emerged from the crowd clutching a squirming crookshanks 
 
 thanks said hermione relieving ginny of the cat come on get a carriage together before they all fill up 
 
 i got pig yet ron said but hermione was already heading off towards the nearest unoccupied coach harry remained behind with ron 
 
 what are those things reckon he asked ron nodding at the horrible horses as the other students surged past them 
 
 what things 
 
 those horse 
 
 luna appeared holding cage in her arms the tiny owl was twittering excitedly as usual 
 
 here you are she said a sweet little owl he 
 
 er yeah all right said ron gruffly well come on then get in what were you saying harry 
 
 i was saying what are those horse things harry said as he ron and luna made for the carriage in which hermione and ginny were already sitting 
 
 what horse things 
 
 the horse things pulling the carriages said harry impatiently they were after all about three feet from the nearest one it was watching them with empty white eyes ron however gave harry a perplexed look 
 
 what are you talking about 
 
 talking aboutlook 
 
 harry grabbed arm and wheeled him about so that he was face to face with the winged horse ron stared straight at it for a second then looked back at harry 
 
 what am i supposed to be looking at 
 
 at thethere between the shafts harnessed to the coach right there in front 
 
 but as ron continued to look bemused a strange thought occurred to harry 
 
 you see them 
 
 see what 
 
 you see pulling the carriages 
 
 ron looked seriously alarmed now 
 
 are you feeling all right harry 
 
 i yeah 
 
 harry felt utterly bewildered the horse was there in front of him gleaming solidly in the dim light issuing from the station windows behind them vapour rising from its nostrils in the chilly night air yet unless ron was fakingand it was a very feeble joke if he wasron could not see it at all 
 
 shall we get in then said ron uncertainly looking at harry as though worried about him 
 
 yeah said harry yeah go on 
 
 all right said a dreamy voice from beside harry as ron vanished into the dark interior not going mad or anything i can see them too 
 
 can you said harry desperately turning to luna he could see the horses reflected in her wide silvery eyes 
 
 oh yes said luna been able to see them ever since my first day here always pulled the carriages worry just as sane as i am 
 
 smiling faintly she climbed into the musty interior of the carriage after ron not altogether reassured harry followed her 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the order of the phoenix 
 

lionfish nov chapter ten the house of gauntcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 for or the rest of the potions lessons harry continued to follow the instructions wherever they deviated from libatius with the result that by their fourth lesson slughorn was raving about abilities saying that he had rarely taught anyone so talented neither ron nor hermione was delighted by this although harry had offered to share his book with both of them ron had more difficulty deciphering the handwriting than harry did and could not keep asking harry to read aloud or it might look suspicious hermione meanwhile was resolutely plowing on with what she called the official instructions but becoming increasingly as they yielded poorer results than the 
 
 harry wondered vaguely who the prince had been although the amount of homework they had been given prevented him from reading the whole of his copy of advanced he had skimmed through it sufficiently to see that there was barely a page on which the prince had not made additional notes not all of them concerned with here and there were directions for what looked like spells that the prince had made up himself 
 
 or herself said hermione irritably overhearing harry pointing some of these out to ron in the common room on saturday evening it might have been a girl i think the handwriting looks more like a than a 
 
 the prince he was called harry said how many girls have been princes 
 
 hermione seemed to have no answer to this she merely scowled and twitched her essay on the principles of rematerialization away from ron who was trying to read it upside down 
 
 harry looked at his watch and hurriedly put the old copy of advanced back into his bag 
 
 five to eight better go be late for dumbledore 
 
 ooooh gasped hermione looking up at once good luck wait up we want to hear what he teaches you 
 
 hope it goes okay said ron and the pair of them watched harry leave through the portrait hole 
 
 harry proceeded through deserted corridors though he had to step hastily behind a statue when professor trelawney appeared around a corner muttering to herself as she shuffled a pack of playing cards reading them as she walked 
 
 two of spades conflict she murmured as she passed the place where harry crouched hidden seven of spades an ill omen ten of spades violence knave of spades a dark young man possibly troubled one who dislikes the questioner 
 
 she stopped dead right on the other side of statue 
 
 well that be right she said annoyed and harry heard her reshuffling vigorously as she set off again leaving nothing but a whiff of cooking sherry behind her harry waited until he was quite sure she had gone then hurried off again until he reached the spot in the corridor where a single gargoyle stood against the wall 
 
 acid pops said harry and the gargoyle leapt aside the wall behind it slid apart and a moving spiral stone staircase was revealed onto which harry stepped so that he was carried in smooth circles up to the door with the brass knocker that led to office 
 
 harry knocked 
 
 come in said dumbledore s voice 
 
 good evening sir said harry walking into the office 
 
 ah good evening harry sit down said dumbledore smiling i hope had an enjoyable first week back at school 
 
 yes thanks sir said harry 
 
 you must have been busy a detention under your belt already 
 
 er began harry awkwardly but dumbledore did not look too stern 
 
 i have arranged with professor snape that you will do your detention next saturday instead 
 
 right said harry who had more pressing matters on his mind than detention and now looked around surreptitiously for some indication of what dumbledore was planning to do with him this evening the circular office looked just as it always did the delicate silver instruments stood on tables puffing smoke and whirring portraits of previous headmasters and headmistresses dozed in their frames and magnificent phoenix fawkes stood on his perch behind the door watching harry with bright interest it did not even look as though dumbledore had cleared a space for dueling practice 
 
 so harry said dumbledore in a businesslike voice you have been wondering i am sure what i have planned for you during thesefor want of a better word lessons 
 
 yes sir 
 
 well i have decided that it is time now that you know what prompted lord voldemort to try and kill you fifteen years ago for you to be given certain information there was a pause 
 
 you said at the end of last term you were going to tell me everything said harry it was hard to keep a note of accusation from his voice sir he added 
 
 and so i did said dumbledore placidly i told you everything i know from this point forth we shall be leaving the firm foundation of fact and journeying together through the murky marshes of memory into thickets of wildest guesswork from here on in harry i may be as woefully wrong as humphrey belcher who believed the time was ripe for a cheese cauldron 
 
 but you think right said harry 
 
 naturally i do but as i have already proven to you i make mistakes like the next man in fact being forgive merather cleverer than most men my mistakes tend to be correspondingly huger 
 
 sir said harry tentatively does what going to tell me have anything to do with the prophecy will it help me survive 
 
 it has a very great deal to do with the prophecy said dumbledore as casually as if harry had asked him about the next weather and i certainly hope that it will help you to survive 
 
 dumbledore got to his feet and walked around the desk past harry who turned eagerly in his seat to watch dumbledore bending over the cabinet beside the door when dumbledore straightened up he was holding a familiar shallow stone basin etched with odd markings around its rim he placed the pensieve on the desk in front of harry 
 
 you look worried 
 
 harry had indeed been eyeing the pensieve with some apprehension his previous experiences with the odd device that stored and revealed thoughts and memories though highly instructive had also been uncomfortable the last time he had disturbed its contents he had seen much more than he would have wished but dumbledore was smiling 
 
 this time you enter the pensieve with me and even more unusually with permission 
 
 where are we going sir 
 
 for a trip down bob memory lane said dumbledore pulling from his pocket a crystal bottle containing a swirling substance 
 
 who was bob ogden 
 
 he was employed by the department of magical law enforcement said dumbledore he died some time ago but not before i had tracked him down and persuaded him to confide these recollections to me we are about to accompany him on a visit he made in the course of his duties if you will stand harry 
 
 but dumbledore was having difficulty pulling out the stopper of the crystal bottle his injured hand seemed stiff and painful 
 
 shall shall i sir 
 
 no matter harry 
 
 dumbledore pointed his wand at the bottle and the cork flew out 
 
 sirhow did you injure your hand harry asked again looking at the blackened fingers with a mixture of revulsion and pity 
 
 now is not the moment for that story harry not yet we have an appointment with bob ogden 
 
 dumbledore tipped the silvery contents of the bottle into the pensieve where they swirled and shimmered neither liquid nor gas after you said dumbledore gesturing toward the bowl 
 
 harry bent forward took a deep breath and plunged his face into the silvery substance he felt his feet leave the office floor he was falling falling through whirling darkness and then quite suddenly he was blinking in dazzling sunlight before his eyes had adjusted dumbledore landed beside him 
 
 they were standing in a country lane bordered by high tangled hedgerows beneath a summer sky as bright and blue as a some ten feet in front of them stood a short plump man wearing enormously thick glasses that reduced his eyes to molelike specks he was reading a wooden signpost that was sticking out of the brambles on the side of the road harry knew this must be ogden he was the only person in sight and he was also wearing the strange assortment of clothes so often chosen by inexperienced wizards trying to look like muggles in this case a frock coat and spats over a striped bathing costume before harry had time to do more than register his bizarre appearance however ogden had set off at a brisk walk down the lane 
 
 dumbledore and harry followed as they passed the wooden sign harry looked up at its two arms the one pointing back the way they had come read great hangleton miles the arm pointing after ogden said little hangleton mile 
 
 they walked a short way with nothing to see but the hedgerows the wide blue sky overhead and the swishing figure ahead then the lane curved to the left and fell away sloping steeply down a hillside so that they had a sudden unexpected view of a whole valley laid out in front of them harry could see a village undoubtedly little hangleton nestled between two steep hills its church and graveyard clearly visible across the valley set on the opposite hillside was a handsome manor house surrounded by a wide expanse of velvety green lawn 
 
 ogden had broken into a reluctant trot due to the steep downward slope dumbledore lengthened his stride and harry hurried to keep up he thought little hangleton must be their final destination and wondered as he had done on the night they had found slughorn why they had to approach it from such a distance he soon discovered that he was mistaken in thinking that they were going to the village however the lane curved to the right and when they rounded the corner it was to see the very edge of frock coat vanishing through a gap in the hedge 
 
 dumbledore and harry followed him onto a narrow dirt track bordered by higher and wilder hedgerows than those they had left behind the path was crooked rocky and potholed sloping downhill like the last one and it seemed to be heading for a patch of dark trees a little below them sure enough the track soon opened up at the copse and dumbledore and harry came to a halt behind ogden who had stopped and drawn his wand 
 
 despite the cloudless sky the old trees ahead cast deep dark cool shadows and it was a few seconds before eyes discerned the building amongst the tangle of trunks it seemed to him a very strange location to choose for a house or else an odd decision to leave the trees growing nearby blocking all light and the view of the valley below he wondered whether it was inhabited its walls were mossy and so many tiles had fallen off the roof that the rafters were visible in places nettles grew all around it their tips reaching the windows which were tiny and thick with grime just as he had concluded that nobody could possibly live there however one of the windows was thrown open with a clatter and a thin trickle of steam or smoke issued from it as though somebody was cooking 
 
 ogden moved forward quietly and it seemed to harry rather cautiously as the dark shadows of the trees slid over him he stopped again staring at the front door to which somebody had nailed a dead snake 
 
 then there was a rustle and a crack and a man in rags dropped from the nearest tree landing on his feet right in front of ogden who leapt backward so fast he stood on the tails of his frock coat and stumbled 
 
 not welcome 
 
 the man standing before them had thick hair so matted with dirt it could have been any color several of his teeth were missing his eyes were small and dark and stared in opposite directions he might have looked comical but he did not the effect was frightening and harry could not blame ogden for backing away several more paces before he spoke 
 
 ergood morning from the ministry of magic 
 
 not welcome 
 
 sorry i understand you said ogden nervously 
 
 harry thought ogden was being extremely dim the stranger was making himself very clear in opinion particularly as he was brandishing a wand in one hand and a short and rather bloody knife in the other 
 
 you understand him sure harry said dumbledore quietly 
 
 yes of course said harry slightly nonplussed why ogden 
 
 but as his eyes found the dead snake on the door again he suddenly understood 
 
 speaking parseltongue 
 
 very good said dumbledore nodding and smiling 
 
 the man in rags was now advancing on ogden knife in one hand wand in the other 
 
 now look ogden began but too late there was a bang and ogden was on the ground clutching his nose while a nasty yellowish goo squirted from between his fingers 
 
 morfin said a loud voice 
 
 an elderly man had come hurrying out of the cottage banging the door behind him so that the dead snake swung pathetically this man was shorter than the first and oddly proportioned his shoulders were very broad and his arms overlong which with his bright brown eyes short scrubby hair and wrinkled face gave him the look of a powerful aged monkey he came to a halt beside the man with the knife who was now cackling with laughter at the sight of ogden on the ground 
 
 ministry is it said the older man looking down at ogden 
 
 correct said ogden angrily dabbing his face and you i take it are mr gaunt 
 
 s right said gaunt got you in the face did he 
 
 yes he did snapped ogden 
 
 made your presence known you said gaunt aggressively this is private property just walk in here and not expect my son to defend himself 
 
 defend himself against what man said ogden clambering back to his feet 
 
 busybodies intruders muggles and filth 
 
 ogden pointed his wand at his own nose which was still issuing large amounts of what looked like yellow pus and the flow stopped at once mr gaunt spoke out of the corner of his mouth to morfin 
 
 get in the house argue 
 
 this time ready for it harry recognized parseltongue even while he could understand what was being said he distinguished the weird hissing noise that was all ogden could hear morfin seemed to be on the point of disagreeing but when his father cast him a threatening look he changed his mind lumbering away to the cottage with an odd rolling gait and slamming the front door behind him so that the snake swung sadly again 
 
 your son here to see mr gaunt said ogden as he mopped the last of the pus from the front of his coat that was morfin it 
 
 ar that was morfin said the old man indifferently are you he asked suddenly aggressive 
 
 neither here nor there said ogden coldly and harry felt his respect for ogden rise 
 
 apparently gaunt felt rather differently he squinted into face and muttered in what was clearly supposed to be an offensive tone now i come to think about it seen noses like yours down in the village 
 
 i doubt it if your been let loose on them said ogden perhaps we could continue this discussion inside 
 
 inside 
 
 yes mr gaunt already told you here about morfin we sent an owl 
 
 no use for owls said gaunt i open letters 
 
 then you can hardly complain that you get no warning of visitors said ogden tartly i am here following a serious breach of wizarding law which occurred here in the early hours of this morning 
 
 all right all right all right bellowed gaunt come in the bleeding house then and much good do you 
 
 the house seemed to contain three tiny rooms two doors led off the main room which served as kitchen and living room combined morfin was sitting in a filthy armchair beside the smoking fire twisting a live adder between his thick fingers and crooning softly at it in parseltongue 
 
 hissy hissy little snakey 
 
 slither on the floor 
 
 you be good to morfin 
 
 or nail you to the door 
 
 there was a scuffling noise in the corner beside the open window and harry realized that there was somebody else in the room a girl whose ragged gray dress was the exact color of the dirty stone wall behind her she was standing beside a steaming pot on a grimy black stove and was fiddling around with the shelf of pots and pans above it her hair was lank and dull and she had a plain pale rather heavy face her eyes like her stared in opposite directions she looked a little cleaner than the two men but harry thought he had never seen a more person 
 
 merope said gaunt grudgingly as ogden looked inquiringly toward her 
 
 good morning said ogden 
 
 she did not answer but with a frightened glance at her father turned her back on the room and continued shifting the pots on the shelf behind her 
 
 well mr gaunt said ogden to get straight to the point we have reason to believe that your son morfin performed magic in front of a muggle late last night 
 
 there was a deafening clang merope had dropped one of the pots 
 
 pick it up gaunt bellowed at her it grub on the floor like some filthy muggle your wand for you useless sack of muck 
 
 mr gaunt please said ogden in a shocked voice as merope who had already picked up the pot flushed blotchily scarlet lost her grip on the pot again drew her wand shakily from her pocket pointed it at the pot and muttered a hasty inaudible spell that caused the pot to shoot across the floor away from her hit the opposite wall and crack in two 
 
 morfin let out a mad cackle of laughter gaunt screamed mend it you pointless lump mend it 
 
 merope stumbled across the room but before she had time to raise her wand ogden had lifted his own and said firmly reparo the pot mended itself instantly 
 
 gaunt looked for a moment as though he was going to shout at ogden but seemed to think better of it instead he jeered at his daughter lucky the nice man from the here it perhaps take you off my hands perhaps he mind dirty squibs 
 
 without looking at anybody or thanking ogden merope picked up the pot and returned it hands trembling to its shelf she then stood quite still her back against the wall between the filthy window and the stove as though she wished for nothing more than to sink into the stone and vanish 
 
 mr gaunt ogden began again as said the reason for my visit 
 
 i heard you the first time snapped gaunt and so what morfin gave a muggle a bit of what was coming to himwhat about it then 
 
 morfin has broken wizarding law said ogden sternly 
 
 morfin has broken wizarding law gaunt imitated voice making it pompous and singsong morfin cackled again he taught a filthy muggle a lesson illegal now is it 
 
 yes said ogden afraid it is 
 
 he pulled from an inside pocket a small scroll of parchment and unrolled it 
 
 that then his sentence said gaunt his voice rising angrily 
 
 it is a summons to the ministry for a hearing 
 
 summons summons who do you think you are summoning my son anywhere 
 
 head of the magical law enforcement squad said ogden 
 
 and you think scum do you screamed gaunt advancing on ogden now with a dirty finger pointing at his chest scum come running when the ministry tells em to do you know who talking to you filthy little mudblood do you 
 
 i was under the impression that i was speaking to mr gaunt said ogden looking wary but standing his ground 
 
 right roared gaunt for a moment harry thought gaunt was making an obscene hand gesture but then realized that he was showing ogden the ugly ring he was wearing on his middle finger waving it before eyes see this see this know what it is know where it came from centuries been in our family how far back we go and all the way know how much been offered for this with the peverell coat of arms engraved on the stone 
 
 really no idea said ogden blinking as the ring sailed within an inch of his nose and quite beside the point mr gaunt your son has committed 
 
 with a howl of rage gaunt ran toward his daughter for a split second harry thought he was going to throttle her as his hand flew to her throat next moment he was dragging her toward ogden by a gold chain around her neck 
 
 see this he bellowed at ogden shaking a heavy gold locket at him while merope spluttered and gasped for breath 
 
 i see it i see it said ogden hastily 
 
 slytherins yelled gaunt salazar his last living descendants what do you say to that eh 
 
 mr gaunt your daughter said ogden in alarm but gaunt had already released merope she staggered away from him back to her corner massaging her neck and gulping for air 
 
 so said gaunt triumphantly as though he had just proved a complicated point beyond all possible dispute you go talking to us as if dirt on your shoes generations of wizards allmore than you can say i doubt 
 
 and he spat on the floor at feet morfin cackled again merope huddled beside the window her head bowed and her face hidden by her lank hair said nothing 
 
 mr gaunt said ogden doggedly i am afraid that neither your ancestors nor mine have anything to do with the matter in hand i am here because of morfin morfin and the muggle he accosted late last night our glanced down at his scroll of that morfin performed a jinx or hex on the said muggle causing him to erupt in highly painful hives 
 
 morfin giggled 
 
 be quiet boy snarled gaunt in parseltongue and morfin fell silent again 
 
 and so what if he did then gaunt said defiantly to ogden i expect wiped the filthy face clean for him and his memory to boot 
 
 hardly the point is it mr gaunt said ogden this was an unprovoked attack on a defenseless 
 
 ar i had you marked out as a the moment i saw you sneered gaunt and he spat on the floor again 
 
 this discussion is getting us nowhere said ogden firmly it is clear from your attitude that he feels no remorse for his actions he glanced down at his scroll of parchment again morfin will attend a hearing on the fourteenth of september to answer the charges of using magic in front of a muggle and causing harm and distress to that same mugg 
 
 ogden broke off the jingling clopping sounds of horses and loud laughing voices were drifting in through the open window apparently the winding lane to the village passed very close to the copse where the house stood gaunt froze listening his eyes wide morfin hissed and turned his face toward the sounds his expression hungry merope raised her head her face harry saw was starkly white 
 
 my god what an eyesore rang out a voice as clearly audible through the open window as if she had stood in the room beside them your father have that hovel cleared away tom 
 
 not ours said a young voice everything on the other side of the valley belongs to us but that cottage belongs to an old tramp called gaunt and his children the quite mad you should hear some of the stories they tell in the village 
 
 the girl laughed the jingling clopping noises were growing louder and louder morfin made to get out of his armchair 
 
 keep your seat said his father warningly in parseltongue 
 
 tom said the voice again now so close they were clearly right beside the house i might be wrongbut has somebody nailed a snake to that door 
 
 good lord right said the voice be the son i told you not right in the head look at it cecilia darling 
 
 the jingling and clopping sounds were now growing fainter again 
 
 darling whispered morfin in parseltongue looking at his sister darling he called her so he have you anyway 
 
 merope was so white harry felt sure she was going to faint 
 
 that said gaunt sharply also in parseltongue looking from his son to his daughter what did you say morfin 
 
 she likes looking at that muggle said morfin a vicious expression on his face as he stared at his sister who now looked terrified always in the garden when he passes peering through the hedge at him she and last night 
 
 merope shook her head jerkily imploringly but morfin went on ruthlessly hanging out of the window waiting for him to ride home she 
 
 hanging out of the window to look at a muggle said gaunt quietly 
 
 all three of the gaunts seemed to have forgotten ogden who was looking both bewildered and irritated at this renewed outbreak of incomprehensible hissing and rasping 
 
 is it true said gaunt in a deadly voice advancing a step or two toward the terrified girl my descendant of salazar slytherinhankering after a filthy muggle 
 
 merope shook her head frantically pressing herself into the wall apparently unable to speak 
 
 but i got him father cackled morfin i got him as he went by and he look so pretty with hives all over him did he merope 
 
 you disgusting little squib you filthy little blood traitor roared gaunt losing control and his hands closed around his throat 
 
 both harry and ogden yelled no at the same time ogden raised his wand and cried relaskio 
 
 gaunt was thrown backward away from his daughter he tripped over a chair and fell flat on his back with a roar of rage morfin leapt out of his chair and ran at ogden brandishing his bloody knife and firing hexes indiscriminately from his wand 
 
 ogden ran for his life dumbledore indicated that they ought to follow and harry obeyed screams echoing in his ears 
 
 ogden hurtled up the path and erupted onto the main lane his arms over his head where he collided with the glossy chestnut horse ridden by a very handsome young man both he and the pretty girl riding beside him on a gray horse roared with laughter at the sight of ogden who bounced off the flank and set off again his frock coat flying covered from head to foot in dust running up the lane 
 
 i think that will do harry said dumbledore he took harry by the elbow and tugged next moment they were both soaring weightlessly through darkness until they landed squarely on their feet back in now twilit office 
 
 what happened to the girl in the cottage said harry at once as dumbledore lit extra lamps with a flick of his wand merope or whatever her name was 
 
 oh she survived said dumbledore reseating himself behind his desk and indicating that harry should sit down too ogden apparated back to the ministry and returned with reinforcements within fifteen minutes morfin and his father attempted to fight but both were overpowered removed from the cottage and subsequently convicted by the wizengamot morfin who already had a record of muggle attacks was sentenced to three years in azkaban marvolo who had injured several ministry employees in addition to ogden received six months 
 
 marvolo harry repeated wonderingly 
 
 right said dumbledore smiling in approval i am glad to see keeping up 
 
 that old man was 
 
 grandfather yes said dumbledore marvolo his son morfin and his daughter merope were the last of the gaunts a very ancient wizarding family noted for a vein of instability and violence that flourished through the generations due to their habit of marrying their own cousins lack of sense coupled with a great liking for grandeur meant that the family gold was squandered several generations before marvolo was born he as you saw was left in squalor and poverty with a very nasty temper a fantastic amount of arrogance and pride and a couple of family heirlooms that he treasured just as much as his son and rather more than his daughter 
 
 so merope said harry leaning forward in his chair and staring at dumbledore so merope was sir does that mean she was mother 
 
 it does said dumbledore and it so happens that we also had a glimpse of father i wonder whether you noticed 
 
 the muggle morfin attacked the man on the horse 
 
 very good indeed said dumbledore beaming yes that was tom riddle senior the handsome muggle who used to go riding past the gaunt cottage and for whom merope gaunt cherished a secret burning passion 
 
 and they ended up married harry said in disbelief unable to imagine two people less likely to fall in love 
 
 i think you are forgetting said dumbledore that merope was a witch i do not believe that her magical powers appeared to their best advantage when she was being terrorized by her father once marvolo and morfin were safely in azkaban once she was alone and free for the first time in her life then i am sure she was able to give full rein to her abilities and to plot her escape from the desperate life she had led for eighteen years 
 
 can you not think of any measure merope could have taken to make tom riddle forget his muggle companion and fall in love with her instead 
 
 the imperius curse harry suggested or a love potion 
 
 very good personally i am inclined to think that she used a love potion i am sure it would have seemed more romantic to her and i do not think it would have been very difficult some hot day when riddle was riding alone to persuade him to take a drink of water in any case within a few months of the scene we have just witnessed the village of little hangleton enjoyed a tremendous scandal you can imagine the gossip it caused when the son ran off with the daughter merope 
 
 but the villagers shock was nothing to he returned from azkaban expecting to find his daughter dutifully awaiting his return with a hot meal ready on his table instead he found a clear inch of dust and her note of farewell explaining what she had done 
 
 from all that i have been able to discover he never mentioned her name or existence from that time forth the shock of her desertion may have contributed to his early deathor perhaps he had simply never learned to feed himself azkaban had greatly weakened marvolo and he did not live to see morfin return to the cottage 
 
 and merope she she died she voldemort brought up in an orphanage 
 
 yes indeed said dumbledore we must do a certain amount of guessing here although i do not think it is difficult to deduce what happened you see within a few months of their runaway marriage tom riddle reappeared at the manor house in little hangleton without his wife the rumor flew around the neighborhood that he was talking of being hoodwinked and taken in what he meant i am sure is that he had been under an enchantment that had now lifted though i daresay he did not dare use those precise words for fear of being thought insane when they heard what he was saying however the villagers guessed that merope had lied to tom riddle pretending that she was going to have his baby and that he had married her for this reason 
 
 but she did have his baby 
 
 but not until a year after they were married tom riddle left her while she was still pregnant 
 
 what went wrong asked harry why did the love potion stop working 
 
 again this is guesswork said dumbledore but i believe that merope who was deeply in love with her husband could not bear to continue enslaving him by magical means i believe that she made the choice to stop giving him the potion perhaps besotted as she was she had convinced herself that he would by now have fallen in love with her in return perhaps she thought he would stay for the sake if so she was wrong on both counts he left her never saw her again and never troubled to discover what became of his son 
 
 the sky outside was inky black and the lamps in office seemed to glow more brightly than before 
 
 i think that will do for tonight harry said dumbledore after a moment or two 
 
 yes sir said harry 
 
 he got to his feet but did not leave 
 
 sir is it important to know all this about past 
 
 very important i think said dumbledore 
 
 and it got something to do with the prophecy 
 
 it has everything to do with the prophecy 
 
 right said harry a little confused but reassured all the same 
 
 he turned to go then another question occurred to him and he turned back again sir am i allowed to tell ron and hermione everything told me 
 
 dumbledore considered him for a moment then said yes i think mr weasley and miss granger have proved themselves trustworthy but harry i am going to ask you to ask them not to repeat any of this to anybody else it would not be a good idea if word got around how much i know or suspect about lord secrets 
 
 no sir make sure just ron and hermione good night 
 
 he turned away again and was almost at the door when he saw it sitting on one of the little tables that supported so many silver instruments was an ugly gold ring set with a large cracked black stone 
 
 sir said harry staring at it that ring 
 
 yes said dumbledore 
 
 you were wearing it when we visited professor slughorn that night 
 
 so i was dumbledore agreed 
 
 but it sir it the same ring marvolo gaunt showed ogden 
 
 dumbledore bowed his head the very same 
 
 but how come have you always had it 
 
 no i acquired it very recently said dumbledore a few days before i came to fetch you from your aunt and in fact 
 
 that would be around the time you injured your hand then sir 
 
 around that time yes harry 
 
 harry hesitated dumbledore was smiling 
 
 sir how exactly 
 
 too late harry you shall hear the story another time goodnight 
 
 goodnight sir 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the half blood prince 
 

lionfish nov chapter ten the house of gauntcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 for or the rest of the potions lessons harry continued to follow the instructions wherever they deviated from libatius with the result that by their fourth lesson slughorn was raving about abilities saying that he had rarely taught anyone so talented neither ron nor hermione was delighted by this although harry had offered to share his book with both of them ron had more difficulty deciphering the handwriting than harry did and could not keep asking harry to read aloud or it might look suspicious hermione meanwhile was resolutely plowing on with what she called the official instructions but becoming increasingly as they yielded poorer results than the 
 
 harry wondered vaguely who the prince had been although the amount of homework they had been given prevented him from reading the whole of his copy of advanced he had skimmed through it sufficiently to see that there was barely a page on which the prince had not made additional notes not all of them concerned with here and there were directions for what looked like spells that the prince had made up himself 
 
 or herself said hermione irritably overhearing harry pointing some of these out to ron in the common room on saturday evening it might have been a girl i think the handwriting looks more like a than a 
 
 the prince he was called harry said how many girls have been princes 
 
 hermione seemed to have no answer to this she merely scowled and twitched her essay on the principles of rematerialization away from ron who was trying to read it upside down 
 
 harry looked at his watch and hurriedly put the old copy of advanced back into his bag 
 
 five to eight better go be late for dumbledore 
 
 ooooh gasped hermione looking up at once good luck wait up we want to hear what he teaches you 
 
 hope it goes okay said ron and the pair of them watched harry leave through the portrait hole 
 
 harry proceeded through deserted corridors though he had to step hastily behind a statue when professor trelawney appeared around a corner muttering to herself as she shuffled a pack of playing cards reading them as she walked 
 
 two of spades conflict she murmured as she passed the place where harry crouched hidden seven of spades an ill omen ten of spades violence knave of spades a dark young man possibly troubled one who dislikes the questioner 
 
 she stopped dead right on the other side of statue 
 
 well that be right she said annoyed and harry heard her reshuffling vigorously as she set off again leaving nothing but a whiff of cooking sherry behind her harry waited until he was quite sure she had gone then hurried off again until he reached the spot in the corridor where a single gargoyle stood against the wall 
 
 acid pops said harry and the gargoyle leapt aside the wall behind it slid apart and a moving spiral stone staircase was revealed onto which harry stepped so that he was carried in smooth circles up to the door with the brass knocker that led to office 
 
 harry knocked 
 
 come in said dumbledore s voice 
 
 good evening sir said harry walking into the office 
 
 ah good evening harry sit down said dumbledore smiling i hope had an enjoyable first week back at school 
 
 yes thanks sir said harry 
 
 you must have been busy a detention under your belt already 
 
 er began harry awkwardly but dumbledore did not look too stern 
 
 i have arranged with professor snape that you will do your detention next saturday instead 
 
 right said harry who had more pressing matters on his mind than detention and now looked around surreptitiously for some indication of what dumbledore was planning to do with him this evening the circular office looked just as it always did the delicate silver instruments stood on tables puffing smoke and whirring portraits of previous headmasters and headmistresses dozed in their frames and magnificent phoenix fawkes stood on his perch behind the door watching harry with bright interest it did not even look as though dumbledore had cleared a space for dueling practice 
 
 so harry said dumbledore in a businesslike voice you have been wondering i am sure what i have planned for you during thesefor want of a better word lessons 
 
 yes sir 
 
 well i have decided that it is time now that you know what prompted lord voldemort to try and kill you fifteen years ago for you to be given certain information there was a pause 
 
 you said at the end of last term you were going to tell me everything said harry it was hard to keep a note of accusation from his voice sir he added 
 
 and so i did said dumbledore placidly i told you everything i know from this point forth we shall be leaving the firm foundation of fact and journeying together through the murky marshes of memory into thickets of wildest guesswork from here on in harry i may be as woefully wrong as humphrey belcher who believed the time was ripe for a cheese cauldron 
 
 but you think right said harry 
 
 naturally i do but as i have already proven to you i make mistakes like the next man in fact being forgive merather cleverer than most men my mistakes tend to be correspondingly huger 
 
 sir said harry tentatively does what going to tell me have anything to do with the prophecy will it help me survive 
 
 it has a very great deal to do with the prophecy said dumbledore as casually as if harry had asked him about the next weather and i certainly hope that it will help you to survive 
 
 dumbledore got to his feet and walked around the desk past harry who turned eagerly in his seat to watch dumbledore bending over the cabinet beside the door when dumbledore straightened up he was holding a familiar shallow stone basin etched with odd markings around its rim he placed the pensieve on the desk in front of harry 
 
 you look worried 
 
 harry had indeed been eyeing the pensieve with some apprehension his previous experiences with the odd device that stored and revealed thoughts and memories though highly instructive had also been uncomfortable the last time he had disturbed its contents he had seen much more than he would have wished but dumbledore was smiling 
 
 this time you enter the pensieve with me and even more unusually with permission 
 
 where are we going sir 
 
 for a trip down bob memory lane said dumbledore pulling from his pocket a crystal bottle containing a swirling substance 
 
 who was bob ogden 
 
 he was employed by the department of magical law enforcement said dumbledore he died some time ago but not before i had tracked him down and persuaded him to confide these recollections to me we are about to accompany him on a visit he made in the course of his duties if you will stand harry 
 
 but dumbledore was having difficulty pulling out the stopper of the crystal bottle his injured hand seemed stiff and painful 
 
 shall shall i sir 
 
 no matter harry 
 
 dumbledore pointed his wand at the bottle and the cork flew out 
 
 sirhow did you injure your hand harry asked again looking at the blackened fingers with a mixture of revulsion and pity 
 
 now is not the moment for that story harry not yet we have an appointment with bob ogden 
 
 dumbledore tipped the silvery contents of the bottle into the pensieve where they swirled and shimmered neither liquid nor gas after you said dumbledore gesturing toward the bowl 
 
 harry bent forward took a deep breath and plunged his face into the silvery substance he felt his feet leave the office floor he was falling falling through whirling darkness and then quite suddenly he was blinking in dazzling sunlight before his eyes had adjusted dumbledore landed beside him 
 
 they were standing in a country lane bordered by high tangled hedgerows beneath a summer sky as bright and blue as a some ten feet in front of them stood a short plump man wearing enormously thick glasses that reduced his eyes to molelike specks he was reading a wooden signpost that was sticking out of the brambles on the side of the road harry knew this must be ogden he was the only person in sight and he was also wearing the strange assortment of clothes so often chosen by inexperienced wizards trying to look like muggles in this case a frock coat and spats over a striped bathing costume before harry had time to do more than register his bizarre appearance however ogden had set off at a brisk walk down the lane 
 
 dumbledore and harry followed as they passed the wooden sign harry looked up at its two arms the one pointing back the way they had come read great hangleton miles the arm pointing after ogden said little hangleton mile 
 
 they walked a short way with nothing to see but the hedgerows the wide blue sky overhead and the swishing figure ahead then the lane curved to the left and fell away sloping steeply down a hillside so that they had a sudden unexpected view of a whole valley laid out in front of them harry could see a village undoubtedly little hangleton nestled between two steep hills its church and graveyard clearly visible across the valley set on the opposite hillside was a handsome manor house surrounded by a wide expanse of velvety green lawn 
 
 ogden had broken into a reluctant trot due to the steep downward slope dumbledore lengthened his stride and harry hurried to keep up he thought little hangleton must be their final destination and wondered as he had done on the night they had found slughorn why they had to approach it from such a distance he soon discovered that he was mistaken in thinking that they were going to the village however the lane curved to the right and when they rounded the corner it was to see the very edge of frock coat vanishing through a gap in the hedge 
 
 dumbledore and harry followed him onto a narrow dirt track bordered by higher and wilder hedgerows than those they had left behind the path was crooked rocky and potholed sloping downhill like the last one and it seemed to be heading for a patch of dark trees a little below them sure enough the track soon opened up at the copse and dumbledore and harry came to a halt behind ogden who had stopped and drawn his wand 
 
 despite the cloudless sky the old trees ahead cast deep dark cool shadows and it was a few seconds before eyes discerned the building amongst the tangle of trunks it seemed to him a very strange location to choose for a house or else an odd decision to leave the trees growing nearby blocking all light and the view of the valley below he wondered whether it was inhabited its walls were mossy and so many tiles had fallen off the roof that the rafters were visible in places nettles grew all around it their tips reaching the windows which were tiny and thick with grime just as he had concluded that nobody could possibly live there however one of the windows was thrown open with a clatter and a thin trickle of steam or smoke issued from it as though somebody was cooking 
 
 ogden moved forward quietly and it seemed to harry rather cautiously as the dark shadows of the trees slid over him he stopped again staring at the front door to which somebody had nailed a dead snake 
 
 then there was a rustle and a crack and a man in rags dropped from the nearest tree landing on his feet right in front of ogden who leapt backward so fast he stood on the tails of his frock coat and stumbled 
 
 not welcome 
 
 the man standing before them had thick hair so matted with dirt it could have been any color several of his teeth were missing his eyes were small and dark and stared in opposite directions he might have looked comical but he did not the effect was frightening and harry could not blame ogden for backing away several more paces before he spoke 
 
 ergood morning from the ministry of magic 
 
 not welcome 
 
 sorry i understand you said ogden nervously 
 
 harry thought ogden was being extremely dim the stranger was making himself very clear in opinion particularly as he was brandishing a wand in one hand and a short and rather bloody knife in the other 
 
 you understand him sure harry said dumbledore quietly 
 
 yes of course said harry slightly nonplussed why ogden 
 
 but as his eyes found the dead snake on the door again he suddenly understood 
 
 speaking parseltongue 
 
 very good said dumbledore nodding and smiling 
 
 the man in rags was now advancing on ogden knife in one hand wand in the other 
 
 now look ogden began but too late there was a bang and ogden was on the ground clutching his nose while a nasty yellowish goo squirted from between his fingers 
 
 morfin said a loud voice 
 
 an elderly man had come hurrying out of the cottage banging the door behind him so that the dead snake swung pathetically this man was shorter than the first and oddly proportioned his shoulders were very broad and his arms overlong which with his bright brown eyes short scrubby hair and wrinkled face gave him the look of a powerful aged monkey he came to a halt beside the man with the knife who was now cackling with laughter at the sight of ogden on the ground 
 
 ministry is it said the older man looking down at ogden 
 
 correct said ogden angrily dabbing his face and you i take it are mr gaunt 
 
 s right said gaunt got you in the face did he 
 
 yes he did snapped ogden 
 
 made your presence known you said gaunt aggressively this is private property just walk in here and not expect my son to defend himself 
 
 defend himself against what man said ogden clambering back to his feet 
 
 busybodies intruders muggles and filth 
 
 ogden pointed his wand at his own nose which was still issuing large amounts of what looked like yellow pus and the flow stopped at once mr gaunt spoke out of the corner of his mouth to morfin 
 
 get in the house argue 
 
 this time ready for it harry recognized parseltongue even while he could understand what was being said he distinguished the weird hissing noise that was all ogden could hear morfin seemed to be on the point of disagreeing but when his father cast him a threatening look he changed his mind lumbering away to the cottage with an odd rolling gait and slamming the front door behind him so that the snake swung sadly again 
 
 your son here to see mr gaunt said ogden as he mopped the last of the pus from the front of his coat that was morfin it 
 
 ar that was morfin said the old man indifferently are you he asked suddenly aggressive 
 
 neither here nor there said ogden coldly and harry felt his respect for ogden rise 
 
 apparently gaunt felt rather differently he squinted into face and muttered in what was clearly supposed to be an offensive tone now i come to think about it seen noses like yours down in the village 
 
 i doubt it if your been let loose on them said ogden perhaps we could continue this discussion inside 
 
 inside 
 
 yes mr gaunt already told you here about morfin we sent an owl 
 
 no use for owls said gaunt i open letters 
 
 then you can hardly complain that you get no warning of visitors said ogden tartly i am here following a serious breach of wizarding law which occurred here in the early hours of this morning 
 
 all right all right all right bellowed gaunt come in the bleeding house then and much good do you 
 
 the house seemed to contain three tiny rooms two doors led off the main room which served as kitchen and living room combined morfin was sitting in a filthy armchair beside the smoking fire twisting a live adder between his thick fingers and crooning softly at it in parseltongue 
 
 hissy hissy little snakey 
 
 slither on the floor 
 
 you be good to morfin 
 
 or nail you to the door 
 
 there was a scuffling noise in the corner beside the open window and harry realized that there was somebody else in the room a girl whose ragged gray dress was the exact color of the dirty stone wall behind her she was standing beside a steaming pot on a grimy black stove and was fiddling around with the shelf of pots and pans above it her hair was lank and dull and she had a plain pale rather heavy face her eyes like her stared in opposite directions she looked a little cleaner than the two men but harry thought he had never seen a more person 
 
 merope said gaunt grudgingly as ogden looked inquiringly toward her 
 
 good morning said ogden 
 
 she did not answer but with a frightened glance at her father turned her back on the room and continued shifting the pots on the shelf behind her 
 
 well mr gaunt said ogden to get straight to the point we have reason to believe that your son morfin performed magic in front of a muggle late last night 
 
 there was a deafening clang merope had dropped one of the pots 
 
 pick it up gaunt bellowed at her it grub on the floor like some filthy muggle your wand for you useless sack of muck 
 
 mr gaunt please said ogden in a shocked voice as merope who had already picked up the pot flushed blotchily scarlet lost her grip on the pot again drew her wand shakily from her pocket pointed it at the pot and muttered a hasty inaudible spell that caused the pot to shoot across the floor away from her hit the opposite wall and crack in two 
 
 morfin let out a mad cackle of laughter gaunt screamed mend it you pointless lump mend it 
 
 merope stumbled across the room but before she had time to raise her wand ogden had lifted his own and said firmly reparo the pot mended itself instantly 
 
 gaunt looked for a moment as though he was going to shout at ogden but seemed to think better of it instead he jeered at his daughter lucky the nice man from the here it perhaps take you off my hands perhaps he mind dirty squibs 
 
 without looking at anybody or thanking ogden merope picked up the pot and returned it hands trembling to its shelf she then stood quite still her back against the wall between the filthy window and the stove as though she wished for nothing more than to sink into the stone and vanish 
 
 mr gaunt ogden began again as said the reason for my visit 
 
 i heard you the first time snapped gaunt and so what morfin gave a muggle a bit of what was coming to himwhat about it then 
 
 morfin has broken wizarding law said ogden sternly 
 
 morfin has broken wizarding law gaunt imitated voice making it pompous and singsong morfin cackled again he taught a filthy muggle a lesson illegal now is it 
 
 yes said ogden afraid it is 
 
 he pulled from an inside pocket a small scroll of parchment and unrolled it 
 
 that then his sentence said gaunt his voice rising angrily 
 
 it is a summons to the ministry for a hearing 
 
 summons summons who do you think you are summoning my son anywhere 
 
 head of the magical law enforcement squad said ogden 
 
 and you think scum do you screamed gaunt advancing on ogden now with a dirty finger pointing at his chest scum come running when the ministry tells em to do you know who talking to you filthy little mudblood do you 
 
 i was under the impression that i was speaking to mr gaunt said ogden looking wary but standing his ground 
 
 right roared gaunt for a moment harry thought gaunt was making an obscene hand gesture but then realized that he was showing ogden the ugly ring he was wearing on his middle finger waving it before eyes see this see this know what it is know where it came from centuries been in our family how far back we go and all the way know how much been offered for this with the peverell coat of arms engraved on the stone 
 
 really no idea said ogden blinking as the ring sailed within an inch of his nose and quite beside the point mr gaunt your son has committed 
 
 with a howl of rage gaunt ran toward his daughter for a split second harry thought he was going to throttle her as his hand flew to her throat next moment he was dragging her toward ogden by a gold chain around her neck 
 
 see this he bellowed at ogden shaking a heavy gold locket at him while merope spluttered and gasped for breath 
 
 i see it i see it said ogden hastily 
 
 slytherins yelled gaunt salazar his last living descendants what do you say to that eh 
 
 mr gaunt your daughter said ogden in alarm but gaunt had already released merope she staggered away from him back to her corner massaging her neck and gulping for air 
 
 so said gaunt triumphantly as though he had just proved a complicated point beyond all possible dispute you go talking to us as if dirt on your shoes generations of wizards allmore than you can say i doubt 
 
 and he spat on the floor at feet morfin cackled again merope huddled beside the window her head bowed and her face hidden by her lank hair said nothing 
 
 mr gaunt said ogden doggedly i am afraid that neither your ancestors nor mine have anything to do with the matter in hand i am here because of morfin morfin and the muggle he accosted late last night our glanced down at his scroll of that morfin performed a jinx or hex on the said muggle causing him to erupt in highly painful hives 
 
 morfin giggled 
 
 be quiet boy snarled gaunt in parseltongue and morfin fell silent again 
 
 and so what if he did then gaunt said defiantly to ogden i expect wiped the filthy face clean for him and his memory to boot 
 
 hardly the point is it mr gaunt said ogden this was an unprovoked attack on a defenseless 
 
 ar i had you marked out as a the moment i saw you sneered gaunt and he spat on the floor again 
 
 this discussion is getting us nowhere said ogden firmly it is clear from your attitude that he feels no remorse for his actions he glanced down at his scroll of parchment again morfin will attend a hearing on the fourteenth of september to answer the charges of using magic in front of a muggle and causing harm and distress to that same mugg 
 
 ogden broke off the jingling clopping sounds of horses and loud laughing voices were drifting in through the open window apparently the winding lane to the village passed very close to the copse where the house stood gaunt froze listening his eyes wide morfin hissed and turned his face toward the sounds his expression hungry merope raised her head her face harry saw was starkly white 
 
 my god what an eyesore rang out a voice as clearly audible through the open window as if she had stood in the room beside them your father have that hovel cleared away tom 
 
 not ours said a young voice everything on the other side of the valley belongs to us but that cottage belongs to an old tramp called gaunt and his children the quite mad you should hear some of the stories they tell in the village 
 
 the girl laughed the jingling clopping noises were growing louder and louder morfin made to get out of his armchair 
 
 keep your seat said his father warningly in parseltongue 
 
 tom said the voice again now so close they were clearly right beside the house i might be wrongbut has somebody nailed a snake to that door 
 
 good lord right said the voice be the son i told you not right in the head look at it cecilia darling 
 
 the jingling and clopping sounds were now growing fainter again 
 
 darling whispered morfin in parseltongue looking at his sister darling he called her so he have you anyway 
 
 merope was so white harry felt sure she was going to faint 
 
 that said gaunt sharply also in parseltongue looking from his son to his daughter what did you say morfin 
 
 she likes looking at that muggle said morfin a vicious expression on his face as he stared at his sister who now looked terrified always in the garden when he passes peering through the hedge at him she and last night 
 
 merope shook her head jerkily imploringly but morfin went on ruthlessly hanging out of the window waiting for him to ride home she 
 
 hanging out of the window to look at a muggle said gaunt quietly 
 
 all three of the gaunts seemed to have forgotten ogden who was looking both bewildered and irritated at this renewed outbreak of incomprehensible hissing and rasping 
 
 is it true said gaunt in a deadly voice advancing a step or two toward the terrified girl my descendant of salazar slytherinhankering after a filthy muggle 
 
 merope shook her head frantically pressing herself into the wall apparently unable to speak 
 
 but i got him father cackled morfin i got him as he went by and he look so pretty with hives all over him did he merope 
 
 you disgusting little squib you filthy little blood traitor roared gaunt losing control and his hands closed around his throat 
 
 both harry and ogden yelled no at the same time ogden raised his wand and cried relaskio 
 
 gaunt was thrown backward away from his daughter he tripped over a chair and fell flat on his back with a roar of rage morfin leapt out of his chair and ran at ogden brandishing his bloody knife and firing hexes indiscriminately from his wand 
 
 ogden ran for his life dumbledore indicated that they ought to follow and harry obeyed screams echoing in his ears 
 
 ogden hurtled up the path and erupted onto the main lane his arms over his head where he collided with the glossy chestnut horse ridden by a very handsome young man both he and the pretty girl riding beside him on a gray horse roared with laughter at the sight of ogden who bounced off the flank and set off again his frock coat flying covered from head to foot in dust running up the lane 
 
 i think that will do harry said dumbledore he took harry by the elbow and tugged next moment they were both soaring weightlessly through darkness until they landed squarely on their feet back in now twilit office 
 
 what happened to the girl in the cottage said harry at once as dumbledore lit extra lamps with a flick of his wand merope or whatever her name was 
 
 oh she survived said dumbledore reseating himself behind his desk and indicating that harry should sit down too ogden apparated back to the ministry and returned with reinforcements within fifteen minutes morfin and his father attempted to fight but both were overpowered removed from the cottage and subsequently convicted by the wizengamot morfin who already had a record of muggle attacks was sentenced to three years in azkaban marvolo who had injured several ministry employees in addition to ogden received six months 
 
 marvolo harry repeated wonderingly 
 
 right said dumbledore smiling in approval i am glad to see keeping up 
 
 that old man was 
 
 grandfather yes said dumbledore marvolo his son morfin and his daughter merope were the last of the gaunts a very ancient wizarding family noted for a vein of instability and violence that flourished through the generations due to their habit of marrying their own cousins lack of sense coupled with a great liking for grandeur meant that the family gold was squandered several generations before marvolo was born he as you saw was left in squalor and poverty with a very nasty temper a fantastic amount of arrogance and pride and a couple of family heirlooms that he treasured just as much as his son and rather more than his daughter 
 
 so merope said harry leaning forward in his chair and staring at dumbledore so merope was sir does that mean she was mother 
 
 it does said dumbledore and it so happens that we also had a glimpse of father i wonder whether you noticed 
 
 the muggle morfin attacked the man on the horse 
 
 very good indeed said dumbledore beaming yes that was tom riddle senior the handsome muggle who used to go riding past the gaunt cottage and for whom merope gaunt cherished a secret burning passion 
 
 and they ended up married harry said in disbelief unable to imagine two people less likely to fall in love 
 
 i think you are forgetting said dumbledore that merope was a witch i do not believe that her magical powers appeared to their best advantage when she was being terrorized by her father once marvolo and morfin were safely in azkaban once she was alone and free for the first time in her life then i am sure she was able to give full rein to her abilities and to plot her escape from the desperate life she had led for eighteen years 
 
 can you not think of any measure merope could have taken to make tom riddle forget his muggle companion and fall in love with her instead 
 
 the imperius curse harry suggested or a love potion 
 
 very good personally i am inclined to think that she used a love potion i am sure it would have seemed more romantic to her and i do not think it would have been very difficult some hot day when riddle was riding alone to persuade him to take a drink of water in any case within a few months of the scene we have just witnessed the village of little hangleton enjoyed a tremendous scandal you can imagine the gossip it caused when the son ran off with the daughter merope 
 
 but the villagers shock was nothing to he returned from azkaban expecting to find his daughter dutifully awaiting his return with a hot meal ready on his table instead he found a clear inch of dust and her note of farewell explaining what she had done 
 
 from all that i have been able to discover he never mentioned her name or existence from that time forth the shock of her desertion may have contributed to his early deathor perhaps he had simply never learned to feed himself azkaban had greatly weakened marvolo and he did not live to see morfin return to the cottage 
 
 and merope she she died she voldemort brought up in an orphanage 
 
 yes indeed said dumbledore we must do a certain amount of guessing here although i do not think it is difficult to deduce what happened you see within a few months of their runaway marriage tom riddle reappeared at the manor house in little hangleton without his wife the rumor flew around the neighborhood that he was talking of being hoodwinked and taken in what he meant i am sure is that he had been under an enchantment that had now lifted though i daresay he did not dare use those precise words for fear of being thought insane when they heard what he was saying however the villagers guessed that merope had lied to tom riddle pretending that she was going to have his baby and that he had married her for this reason 
 
 but she did have his baby 
 
 but not until a year after they were married tom riddle left her while she was still pregnant 
 
 what went wrong asked harry why did the love potion stop working 
 
 again this is guesswork said dumbledore but i believe that merope who was deeply in love with her husband could not bear to continue enslaving him by magical means i believe that she made the choice to stop giving him the potion perhaps besotted as she was she had convinced herself that he would by now have fallen in love with her in return perhaps she thought he would stay for the sake if so she was wrong on both counts he left her never saw her again and never troubled to discover what became of his son 
 
 the sky outside was inky black and the lamps in office seemed to glow more brightly than before 
 
 i think that will do for tonight harry said dumbledore after a moment or two 
 
 yes sir said harry 
 
 he got to his feet but did not leave 
 
 sir is it important to know all this about past 
 
 very important i think said dumbledore 
 
 and it got something to do with the prophecy 
 
 it has everything to do with the prophecy 
 
 right said harry a little confused but reassured all the same 
 
 he turned to go then another question occurred to him and he turned back again sir am i allowed to tell ron and hermione everything told me 
 
 dumbledore considered him for a moment then said yes i think mr weasley and miss granger have proved themselves trustworthy but harry i am going to ask you to ask them not to repeat any of this to anybody else it would not be a good idea if word got around how much i know or suspect about lord secrets 
 
 no sir make sure just ron and hermione good night 
 
 he turned away again and was almost at the door when he saw it sitting on one of the little tables that supported so many silver instruments was an ugly gold ring set with a large cracked black stone 
 
 sir said harry staring at it that ring 
 
 yes said dumbledore 
 
 you were wearing it when we visited professor slughorn that night 
 
 so i was dumbledore agreed 
 
 but it sir it the same ring marvolo gaunt showed ogden 
 
 dumbledore bowed his head the very same 
 
 but how come have you always had it 
 
 no i acquired it very recently said dumbledore a few days before i came to fetch you from your aunt and in fact 
 
 that would be around the time you injured your hand then sir 
 
 around that time yes harry 
 
 harry hesitated dumbledore was smiling 
 
 sir how exactly 
 
 too late harry you shall hear the story another time goodnight 
 
 goodnight sir 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the half blood prince 
 

lionfish nov chapter ten kreachers talecontents prev chapter next chapter 
 
 harry woke early next morning wrapped in a sleeping bag on the drawing room floor a chink of sky was visible between the heavy curtains it was the cool clear blue of watered ink somewhere between night and dawn and everything was quiet except for ron and hermiones slow deep breathing harry glanced over at the dark shapes they made on the floor beside him ron had had a fit of gallantry and insisted that hermione sleep on the cushions from the sofa so that her silhouette was raised above his her arm curved to the floor her fingers inches from rons harry wondered whether they had fallen asleep holding hands the idea made him feel strangely lonely 
 
 he looked up at the shadowy ceiling the cobwebbed chandelier less than house ago he had been standing in the sunlight at the entrance to the marquee waiting to show in wedding guests it seemed a lifetime away what was going to happen now he lay on the floor and he thought of the horcruxes of the daunting complex mission dumbledore had left him dumbledore 
 
 the grief that had possessed him since dumbledores death felt different now the accusations he had heard from muriel at the wedding seemed to have nested in his brain like diseased things infecting his memories of the wizard he had idolized could dumbledore have let such things happen had he been like dudley content to watch neglect and abuse as long as it did not affect him could he have turned his back on a sister who was being imprisoned and hidden 
 
 harry thought of godrics hollow of graves dumbledore had never mentioned there he thought of mysterious objects left without explanation in dumbledores will and resentment swelled in the darkness why hadnt dumbledore told him why hadnt he explained had dumbledore actually cared about harry at all or had harry been nothing more than a tool to be polished and honed but not trusted never confided in 
 
 harry could not stand lying there with nothing but bitter thoughts for company desperate for something to do for distraction he slipped out of his sleeping bad picked up his wand and crept out of the room on the landing he whispered lumos and started to climb the stairs by wandlight 
 
 on the second landing was the bedroom in which he and ron had slept last time they had been here he glanced into it the wardrobe doors stood open and the bedclothes had been ripped back harry remembered the overturned troll leg downstairs somebody had searched the house since the order had left snape or perhaps mundungus who had pilfered plenty from this house both before and after sirius died harrys gaze wandered to the portrait that sometimes contained phineas nigellus black siriuss grandfather but it was empty showing nothing but a stretch of muddy backdrop phineas nigellus was evidently spending the night in the headmasters study at hogwarts 
 
 harry continued up the stairs until he reached the topmost landing where there were only two doors the one facing him bore a nameplate reading sirius harry had never entered his godfathers bedroom before he pushed open the door holding his wand high to cast light as widely as possible the room was spacious and must once have been handsome there was a large bed with a carved wooden headboard a tall window obscured by long velvet curtains and a chandelier thickly coated in dust with candle scrubs still resting in its sockets solid wax banging in frostlike drips a fine film of dust covered the pictures on the walls and the beds headboard a spiders web stretched between the chandelier and the top of the large wooden wardrobe and as harry moved deeper into the room he head a scurrying of disturbed mice 
 
 the teenage sirius had plastered the walls with so many posters and pictures that little of the walls silk was visible harry could only assume that siriuss parents had been unable to remove the permanent sticking charm that kept them on the wall because he was sure they would not have appreciated their eldest sons taste in decoration sirius seemed to have long gone out of his way to annoy his parents there were several large gryffindor banners faded scarlet and gold just to underline his difference from all the rest of the slytherin family there were many pictures of muggle motorcycles and also harry had to admire siriuss nerve several posters of muggle girls harry could tell that they were muggles because they remained quite stationary within their pictures faded smiles and glazed eyes frozen on the paper this was in contrast the only wizarding photograph on the walls which was a picture of four hogwarts students standing arm in arm laughing at the camera 
 
 with a leap of pleasure harry recognized his father his untidy black hair stuck up at the back like harrys and he too wore glasses beside him was sirius carelessly handsome his slightly arrogant face so much younger and happier than harry had ever seen it alive to siriuss right stood pettigrew more than a head shorter plump and flushed with pleasure at his inclusion in this coolest of gangs with the rebels that james and sirius had been on jamess left was lupin even then a little but he had the same air of delighted surprise at finding himself liked and included or was it simply because harry knew how it had been that he saw these things in the picture he tried to take it from the wall it was his now after all sirius had left him everything but it would not budge sirius had taken no chances in preventing his parents from redecorating his room 
 
 harry looked around at the floor the sky outside was growing brightest a shaft of light revealed bits of paper books and small objects scattered over the carpet evidently siriuss bedroom had been reached too although its contents seemed to have been judged mostly if not entirely worthless a few of the books had been shaken roughly enough to part company with the covers and sundry pages littered the floor 
 
 harry bent down picked up a few of the pieces of paper and examined them he recognized one as a part of an old edition of a history of magic by bathilda bagshot and another as belonging to a motorcycle maintenance manual the third was handwritten and crumpled he smoothed it out 
 
 
 
 
 dear padfoot 
 thank you thank you for harrys birthday present it was his favorite by far one year old and already zooming along on a toy broomstick he looked so pleased with himself im enclosing a picture so you can see you know it only rises about two feet off the ground but he nearly killed the cat and he smashed a horrible vase petunia sent me for christmas no complaints there of course james thought it was so funny says hes going to be a great quidditch player but weve had to pack away all the ornaments and make sure we dont take our eyes off him when he gets going 
 we had a very quiet birthday tea just us and old bathilda who has always been sweet to us and who dotes on harry we were so sorry you couldnt come but the orders got to come first and harrys not old enough to know its his birthday anyway james is getting a bit frustrated shut up here he tries not to show it but i can tell c also dumbledores still got his invisibility cloak so no chance of little excursions if you could visit it would cheer him up so much wormy was here last weekend i thought he seemed down but that was probably the next about the mckinnons i cried all evening when i heard 
 bathilda drops in most days shes a fascinating old thing with the most amazing stories about dumbledore im not sure hed be pleased if he knew i dont know how much to believe actually because it seems incredible that dumbledore 
 harrys extremities seemed to have gone numb he stood quite still holding the miraculous paper in his nerveless fingers while inside him a kind of quiet eruptions sent joy and grief thundering its equal measure through his veins lurching to the bed he sat down 
 
 he read the letter again but could not take in any more meaning than he had done the first time and was reduced to staring at the handwriting itself she had made her gs the same way he did he searched through the letter for every one of them and each felt like a friendly little wave glimpsed from behind a veil the letter was an incredible treasure proof that lily potter had lived really lived that her warm hand had once moved across this parchment tracing ink into these letters these words words about him harry her son 
 
 impatiently brushing away the wetness in his eyes he reread the letter this time concentrating on the meaning it was like listening to a voice 
 
 they had a cat perhaps it had perished like his parents at godrics hollow or else fled when there was nobody left to feed it sirius had bought him his first broomstick his parents had known bathilda bagshot had dumbledore introduced them dumbledores still got his invisibility cloak there was something funny there 
 
 harry paused pondering his mothers words why had dumbledore taken jamess invisibility cloak harry distinctly remembered his headmaster telling him years before i dont need a cloak to become invisible perhaps some less gifted order member had needed its assistance and dumbledore had acted as a carrier harry passed on 
 
 wormy was here pettigrew the traitor had seemed down had he was he aware that he was seeing james and lily alive for the last time 
 
 and finally bathilda again who told incredible stories about dumbledore it seems incredible that dumbledore c 
 
 that dumbledore what but there were any number of things that would seem incredible about dumbledore that he had once received bottom marks in a transfiguration test for instance or had taken up goat charming like aberforth 
 
 harry got to his feet and scanned the floor perhaps the rest of the letter was here somewhere he seized papers treating them in his eagerness with as little consideration as the original searcher he pulled open drawers shook out books stood on a chair to run his hand over the top of the wardrobe and crawled under the bed and armchair 
 
 at last lying facedown on the floor he spotted what looked like a torn piece of paper under the chest of drawers when he pulled it out it proved to be most of the photograph that lily had described in her letter a baby was zooming in and out of the picture on a tiny broom roaring with laughter and a pair of legs that must have belonged to james was chasing after him harry tucked the photograph into his pocket with lilys letter and continued to look for the second sheet 
 
 after another quarter of an hour however he was forced to conclude that the rest of his mothers letter was gone had it simply been lost in the sixteen years that had elapsed since it had been written or had it been taken by whoever had searched the room harry read the first sheet again this time looking for clues as to what might have made the second sheet valuable his toy broomstick could hardly be considered interesting to the death eaters the only potentially useful thing he could see her was possible information on dumbledore it seems incredible that dumbledore c what 
 
 harry harry harry 
 
 im here he called whats happened 
 
 there was a clatter of footsteps outside the door and hermione burst inside 
 
 we woke up and didnt know where you were she said breathlessly she turned and shouted over her shoulder ron ive found him 
 
 rons annoyed voice echoed distantly from several floors below 
 
 good tell him from me hes a git 
 
 harry dont just disappear please we were terrified why did you come up here anyway she gazed around the ransacked room what have you been doing 
 
 look what ive just found 
 
 he held out his mothers letter hermione took it out and read it while harry watched her when she reached the end of the page she looked up at him 
 
 oh harry 
 
 and theres this too 
 
 he handed her the torn photograph and hermione smiled at the baby zooming in and out of sight on the toy broom 
 
 ive been looking for the rest of the letter harry said but its not here 
 
 hermione glanced around 
 
 did you make all this mess or was some of it done when you got here 
 
 someone had searched before me said harry 
 
 i thought so every room i looked into on the way up had been disturbed what were they after do you think 
 
 information on the order if it was snape 
 
 but youd think hed already have all he needed i mean was in the order wasnt he 
 
 well then said harry keen to discuss his theory what about information on dumbledore the second page of the letter for instance you know this bathilda my mum mentions you know who she is 
 
 who 
 
 bathilda bagshot the author of c 
 
 a history of magic said hermione looking interested so your parents knew her she was an incredible magic historian 
 
 and shes still alive said harry and she lives in godrics hollow rons auntie muriel was talking about her at the wedding she knew dumbledores family too be pretty interesting to talk to wouldnt she there was a little too much understanding in the smile hermione gave him for harrys liking he took back the letter and the photograph and tucked them inside the pouch around his neck so as not to have to look at her and give himself away i understand why youd love to talk to her about your mum and dad and dumbledore too said hermione but that wouldnt really help us in our search for the horcruxes would it harry did not answer and she rushed on harry i know you really want to go to godrics hollow but im scared im scared at how easily those death eaters found us yesterday it just makes me feel more than ever that we ought to avoid the place where your parents are buried im sure theyd be expecting you to visit it 
 
 its not just that harry said still avoiding looking at her muriel said stuff about dumbledore at the wedding i want to know the truth 
 
 he told hermione everything that muriel had told him when he had finished hermione said of course i can see why thats upset you harry c 
 
 im not upset he lied id just like to know whether or not its true or c 
 
 harry do you really think youll get the truth from a malicious old woman like muriel or from rita skeeter how can you believe them you knew dumbledore 
 
 i thought i did he muttered 
 
 but you know how much truth there was in everything rita wrote about you doge is right how can you let these people tarnish your memories of dumbledore 
 
 he looked away trying not to betray the resentment he felt there it was again choose what to believe he wanted the truth why was everybody so determined that he should not get it 
 
 shall we go down to the kitchen hermione suggested after a little pause find something for breakfast 
 
 do not enter without the express permission of regulus arcturus black 
 excitement trickled through harry but he was not immediately sure why he read the sign again hermione was already a flight of stairs below him 
 
 hermione he said and he was surprised that his voice was so calm come back up here 
 
 whats the matter 
 
 i think ive found him 
 
 there was a gasp and then hermione ran back up the stairs 
 
 in your mums letter but i didnt see c 
 
 harry shook his head pointing at reguluss sign she read it then clutched harrys arm so tightly that he winced 
 
 siriuss brother she whispered 
 
 he was a death eater said harry sirius told me about him he joined up when he was really young and then got cold feet and tried to leave c so they killed him 
 
 that fits gasped hermione if he was a death eater he had access to voldemort and if he became disenchanted then he would have wanted to bring voldemort down 
 
 she released harry leaned over the banister and screamed ron ron get up here quick 
 
 ron appeared panting a minute later his wand ready in his hand 
 
 whats up if its massive spiders again i want breakfast before i c 
 
 he frowned at the sign on reguluss door in which hermione was silently pointing 
 
 what that was siriuss brother wasnt it regulus arcturus regulus the locket c you dont reckon c 
 
 lets find out said harry he pushed the door it was locked hermione pointed her wand at the handle and said alohamora there was a click and the door swung open 
 
 they moved over the threshold together gazing around reguluss bedroom was slightly smaller than siriuss though it had the same sense of former grandeur whereas sirius had sought to advertise his diffidence from the rest of the family regulus had striven to emphasize the opposite the slytherin colors of emerald and silver were everywhere draping the bed the walls and the windows the black family crest was painstakingly painted over the bed along with its motto toujours pur beneath this was a collection of yellow newspaper cuttings all stuck together to make a ragged collage hermione crossed the room to examine them 
 
 theyre all about voldemort she said regulus seems to have been a fan for a few years before he joined the death eaters 
 
 a little puff of dust rose from the bedcovers as she sat down to read the clippings harry meanwhile had noticed another photograph a hogwarts quidditch team was smiling and waving out of the frame he moved closer and saw the snakes emblazoned on their chests slytherins regulus was instantly recognizable as the boy sitting in the middle of the front row he had the same dark hair and slightly haughty look of his brother though he was smaller slighter and rather less handsome than sirius had been 
 
 he played seeker said harry 
 
 what said hermione vaguely she was still immersed in voldemorts press clippings 
 
 hes sitting in the middle of the front row thats where the seeker never mind said harry realizing that nobody was listening ron was on his hands and knees searching under the wardrobe harry looked around the room for likely hiding places and approached the desk yet again somebody had searched before them the drawers contents had been turned over recently the dust disturbed but there was nothing of value there old quills textbooks that bore evidence of being roughly handled a recently smashed ink bottle its sticky residue covering the contents of the drawer 
 
 theres an easier way said hermione as harry wiped his inky fingers on his jeans she raised her wand and said accio locket 
 
 nothing happened ron who had been searching the folds of the faded curtains looked disappointed 
 
 is that it then its not here 
 
 oh it could still be here but under said hermione charms to prevent it from being summoned magically you know 
 
 like voldemort put on the stone basin in the cave said harry remembering how he had been unable to summon the fake locket 
 
 how are we supposed to find it then asked ron 
 
 we search manually said hermione 
 
 thats a good idea said ron rolling his eyes and he resumed his examination of the curtains 
 
 they combed every inch of the room for more than an hour but were forced finally to conclude that the locket was not there 
 
 the sun had risen now its light dazzled them even through the grimy landing windows 
 
 it could be somewhere else in the house though said hermione in a rallying tone as they walked back downstairs as harry and ron had become more discouraged she seemed to have become more determined whether hed manage to destroy it or not hed want to keep it hidden from voldemort wouldnt he remember all those awful things we had to get rid of when we were here last time that clock that shot bolts at everyone and those old robes that tried to strangle ron regulus might have put them there to protect the lockets hiding place even though we didnt realize it at at 
 
 harry and ron looked at her she was standing with one foot in midair with the dumbstruck look of one who had just been obliviated her eyes had even drifted out of focus 
 
 at the time she finished in a whisper 
 
 something wrong asked ron 
 
 there was a locket 
 
 what said harry and ron together 
 
 in the cabinet in the drawing room nobody could open it and we we 
 
 harry felt as though a brick had slid down through his chest into his stomach he remembered he had even handled the thing as they passed it around each trying in turn to pry it open it had been tossed into a sack of rubbish along with the snuffbox of wartcap powder and the music box that had made everyone sleepy 
 
 kreacher nicked loads of things back from us said harry it was the only chance the only slender hope left to them and he was going to cling to it until forced to let go he had a whole stash of stuff in his cupboard in the kitchen cmon 
 
 he ran down the stairs taking two steps at a time the other two thundering along in his wake they made so much noise that they woke the portrait of siriuss mother as they passed through the hall 
 
 filth mudbloods scum she screamed after them as they dashed down into the basement kitchen and slammed the door behind them harry ran the length of the room skidded to a halt at the door of kreachers cupboard and wrenched it open there was the nest of dirty old blankets in which the had once slept but they were not longer glittering with the trinkets kreacher had salvaged the only thing there was an old copy of natures nobility a wizarding genealogy refusing to believe his eyes harry snatched up the blankets and shook them a dead mouse fell out and rolled dismally across the floor ron groaned as he threw himself into a kitchen chair hermione closed her eyes 
 
 its not over yet said harry and he raised his voice and called kreacher 
 
 there was a loud crack and the house elf that harry had so reluctantly inherited from sirius appeared out of nowhere in front of the cold and empty fireplace tiny half his pale skin hanging off him in folds white hair sprouting copiously from his batlike ears he was still wearing the filthy rag in which they had first met him and the contemptuous look he bent upon harry showed that his attitude to his change of ownership had altered no more than his outfit 
 
 master croaked kreacher in his bullfrogs voice and he bowed low muttering to his knees back in my mistresss old house with the weasley and the mudblood c 
 
 i forbid you to call anyone blood traitor or mudblood growled harry he would have found kreacher with his snoutlike nose and bloodshot eyes a distinctively unlovable object even if the elf had not betrayed sirius to voldemort 
 
 ive got a question for you said harry his heart beating rather fast as he looked down at the elf and i order you to answer it truthfully understand 
 
 yes master said kreacher bowing low again harry saw his lips moving soundlessly undoubtedly framing the insults he was now forbidden to utter 
 
 two years ago said harry his heart now hammering against his ribs there was a big gold locket in the drawing room upstairs we threw it out did you steal it back 
 
 there was a moments silence during which kreacher straightened up to look harry full in the face then he said yes 
 
 where is it now asked harry jubilantly as ron and hermione looked gleeful 
 
 kreacher closed his eyes as though he could not bear to see their reactions to his next word 
 
 gone 
 
 gone echoed harry elation floating out of him what do you mean its gone 
 
 the elf shivered he swayed 
 
 kreacher said harry fiercely i order you c 
 
 mundungus fletcher croaked the elf his eyes still tight shut mundungus fletcher stole it all miss bellas and miss cissys pictures my mistresss gloves the order of merlin first class the goblets with the family crest and c and c 
 
 kreacher was gulping for air his hollow chest was rising and falling rapidly then his eyes flew open and he uttered a bloodcurdling scream 
 
 c and the locket master reguluss locket kreacher did wrong kreacher failed in his orders 
 
 harry reacted instinctively as kreacher lunged for the poker standing in the grate he launched himself upon the elf flattening him hermiones scream mingled with kreachers but harry bellowed louder than both of them kreacher i order you to stay still 
 
 he felt the elf freeze and released him kreacher lay flat on the cold stone floor tears gushing from his sagging eyes 
 
 harry let him up hermione whispered 
 
 so he can beat himself up with the poker snorted harry kneeling beside the elf i dont think so right kreacher i want the truth how do you know mundungus fletcher stole the locket 
 
 kreacher saw him gasped the elf as tears poured over his snout and into his mouth full of graying teeth kreacher saw him coming out of kreachers cupboard with his hands full of kreachers treasures kreacher told the sneak thief to stop but mundungus fletcher laughed and 
 
 you called the locket master reguluss said harry why where did it come from what did regulus have to do with it kreacher sit up and tell me everything you know about that locket and everything regulus had to do with it 
 
 the elf sat up curled into a ball placed his wet face between his knees and began to rock backward and forward when he spoke his voice was muffled but quite distinct in the silent echoing kitchen 
 
 master sirius ran away good riddance for he was a bad boy and broke my mistresss heart with his lawless ways but master regulus had proper order he knew what was due to the name of black and the dignity of his pure blood for years he talked of the dark lord who was going to bring the wizards out of hiding to rule the muggles and the and when he was sixteen years old master regulus joined the dark lord so proud so proud so happy to serve 
 
 and one day a year after he joined master regulus came down to the kitchen to see kreacher master regulus always liked kreacher and master regulus said he said 
 
 the old elf rocked faster than ever 
 
 he said that the dark lord required an elf 
 
 voldemort needed an elf harry repeated looking around at ron and hermione who looked just as puzzled as he did 
 
 oh yes moaned kreacher and master regulus had volunteered kreacher it was an honor said master regulus an honor for him and for kreacher who must be sure to do whatever the dark lord ordered him to do and then to home 
 
 kreacher rocked still faster his breath coming in sobs 
 
 so kreacher went to the dark lord the dark lord did not tell kreacher what they were to do but took kreacher with him to a cave beside the sea and beyond the cave was a cavern and in the cavern was a great black lake 
 
 the hairs on the back of harrys neck stood up kreachers croaking voice seemed to come to him from across the dark water he saw what had happened as clearly as though he had been present 
 
 there was a boat 
 
 of course there had been a boat harry knew the boat ghostly green and tiny bewitched so as to carry one wizard and one victim toward the island in the center this then was how voldemort had tested the defenses surrounding the horcrux by borrowing a disposable creature a 
 
 there was a full of potion on the island the lord made kreacher drink it 
 
 the elf quaked from head to foot 
 
 kreacher drank and as he drank he saw terrible thing kreachers insides burned kreacher cried for master regulus to save him he cried for his mistress black but the dark lord only laughed he made kreacher drink all the potion he dropped a locket into the empty basin he filled it with more potion 
 
 and then the dark lord sailed away leaving kreacher on the island 
 
 harry could see it happening he watched voldemorts white snakelike face vanishing into darkness those red eyes fixed pitilessly on the thrashing elf whose death would occur within minutes whenever he succumbed to the desperate thirst that the burning poison caused its victim but here harrys imagination could go no further for he could not see how kreacher had escaped 
 
 kreacher needed water he crawled to the islands edge and he drank from the black lake and hands dead hands came out of the water and dragged kreacher under the surface 
 
 how did you get away harry asked and he was not surprised to hear himself whispering 
 
 kreacher raised his ugly head and looked harry with his great bloodshot eyes 
 
 master regulus told kreacher to come back he said 
 
 i know c but how did you escape the inferi 
 
 kreacher did not seem to understand 
 
 master regulus told kreacher to come back he repeated 
 
 i know but c 
 
 well its obvious isnt it harry said ron he disapparated 
 
 but you couldnt apparate in and out of that cave said harry otherwise dumbledore c 
 
 elf magic isnt like wizards magic is it said ron i mean they can apparate and disapparate in and out of hogwarts when we cant 
 
 there was a silence as harry digested this how could voldemort have made such a mistake but even as he thought this hermione spoke and her voice was icy 
 
 of course voldemort would have considered the ways of far beneath his notice it would never have occurred to him that they might have magic that he didnt 
 
 the highest law is his masters bidding intoned kreacher kreacher was told to come home so kreacher came home 
 
 well then you did what you were told didnt you said hermione kindly you didnt disobey orders at all 
 
 kreacher shook his head rocking as fast as ever 
 
 so what happened when you got back harry asked what did regulus say when you told him what happened 
 
 master regulus was very worried very worried croaked kreacher master regulus told kreacher to stay hidden and not to leave the house and then it was a little while later master regulus came to find kreacher in his cupboard one night and master regulus was strange not as he usually was disturbed in his mind kreacher could tell and he asked kreacher to take him to the cave the cave where kreacher had gone with the dark lord 
 
 and so they had set off harry could visualize them quite clearly the frightened old elf and the thin dark seeker who had so resembled sirius kreacher knew how to open the concealed entrance to the underground cavern knew how to raise the tiny boat this time it was his beloved regulus who sailed with him to the island with its basin of poison 
 
 and he made you drink the poison said harry disgusted 
 
 but kreacher shook his head and wept hermiones hands leapt to her mouth she seemed to have understood something 
 
 regulus took from his pocket a locket like the one the dark lord had said kreacher tears pouring down either side of his snoutlike nose and he told kreacher to take it and when the basin was empty to switch the lockets 
 
 kreachers sobs came in great rasps now harry had to concentrate hard to understand him 
 
 and he order c kreacher to leave c without him and he told kreacher c to go home c and never to tell my mistress c what he had done c but to destroy c the first locket and he drank c all the potion c and kreacher swapped the lockets c and watched as master regulus was dragged beneath the water and 
 
 oh kreacher wailed hermione who was crying she dropped to her knees beside the elf and tried to hug him at once he was on his feet cringing away from her quite obviously repulsed 
 
 the mudblood touched kreacher he will not allow it what would his mistress say 
 
 i told you not to call her mudblood snarled harry but the elf was already punishing himself he fell to the ground and banged his forehead on the floor 
 
 stop him c stop him hermione cried oh dont you see now how sick it is the way theyve got to obey 
 
 kreacher c stop stop shouted harry 
 
 the elf lay on the floor panting and shivering green mucus glistening around his snot a bruise already blooming on his pallid forehead where he had struck himself his eyes swollen and bloodshot and swimming in tears harry had never seen anything so pitiful 
 
 so you brought the locket home he said relentlessly for he was determined to know the full story and you tried to destroy it 
 
 nothing kreacher did made any mark upon it moaned the elf kreacher tried everything everything he knew but nothing nothing would work so many powerful spells upon the casing kreacher was sure the way to destroy it was to get inside it but it would not open kreacher punished himself he tried again he punished himself he tried again kreacher failed to obey orders kreacher could not destroy the locket and his mistress was mad with grief because master regulus had disappeared and kreacher could not tell her what had happened no because master regulus had him to tell any of the what happened in the 
 
 kreacher began to sob so hard that there were no more coherent words tears flowed down hermiones cheeks as she watched kreacher but she did not dare touch him again even ron who was no fan of kreachers looked troubled harry sat back on his heels and shook his head trying to clear it 
 
 i dont understand you kreacher he said finally voldemort tried to kill you regulus died to bring voldemort down but you were still happy to betray sirius to voldemort you were happy to go to narcissa and bellatrix and pass information to voldemort through them 
 
 harry kreacher doesnt think like that said hermione wiping her eyes on the back of her hand hes a slave are used to bad even brutal treatment what voldemort did to kreacher wasnt that far out of the common way what do wizard wars mean to an elf like kreacher hes loyal to people who are kind to him and mrs black must have been and regulus certainly was so he served them willingly and parroted their beliefs i know what youre going to say she went on as harry began to protest that regulus changed his mind but he doesnt seem to have explained that to kreacher does he and i think i know why kreacher and reguluss family were all safest if they kept to the old line regulus was trying to protect them all 
 
 sirius c 
 
 sirius was horrible to kreacher harry and its no good looking like that you know its true kreacher had been alone for such a long time when sirius came to live here and he was probably starving for a bit of affection im sure miss cissy and miss bella were perfectly lovely to kreacher when he turned up so he did them a favor and told them everything they wanted to know ive said all along that wizards would pay for how they treat well voldemort did and so did sirius 
 
 harry had no retort as he watched kreacher sobbing on the floor he remembered what dumbledore had said to him mere hours after siriuss death i do not think sirius ever saw kreacher as a being with feelings as acute as a humans 
 
 kreacher said harry after a while when you feel up to it er please sit up 
 
 it was several minutes before kreacher hiccupped himself into silence then he pushed himself into a sitting position again rubbing his knuckles into his eyes like a small child 
 
 kreacher i am going to ask you to do something said harry he glanced at hermione for assistance he wanted to give the order kindly but at the same time he could not pretend that it was not an order however the change in his tone seemed to have gained her approval she smiled encouragingly 
 
 kreacher i want you please to go and find mundungus fletcher we need to find out where the locket c where master reguluss locket it its really important we want to finish the work master regulus started we want to c er c ensure that he didnt die in vain 
 
 kreacher dropped his fists and looked up at harry 
 
 find mundungus fletcher he croaked 
 
 and bring him here to grimmauld place said harry do you think you could do that for us 
 
 as kreacher nodded and got to his feet harry had a sudden inspiration he pulled out hagrids purse and took out the fake horcrux the substitute locket in which regulus had placed the note to voldemort 
 
 kreacher id er like you to have this he said pressing the locket into the elfs hand this belonged to regulus and im sure hed want you to have it as a token of gratitude for what you c 
 
 overkill mate said ron as the elf took one look at the locket let out a howl of shock and misery and threw himself back onto the ground 
 
 it took them nearly half an hour to calm down kreacher who was so overcome to be presented with a black family heirloom for his very own that he was too weak at the knees to stand properly when finally he was able to totter a few steps they all accompanied him to his cupboard watched him tuck up the locket safely in his dirty blankets and assured him that they would make its protection their first priority while he was away he then made two low bows to harry and ron and even gave a funny little spasm in hermiones direction that might have been an attempt at a respectful salute before disapparating with the usual loud crack

lionfish nov chapter ten kreachers talecontents prev chapter next chapter 
 
 harry woke early next morning wrapped in a sleeping bag on the drawing room floor a chink of sky was visible between the heavy curtains it was the cool clear blue of watered ink somewhere between night and dawn and everything was quiet except for ron and hermiones slow deep breathing harry glanced over at the dark shapes they made on the floor beside him ron had had a fit of gallantry and insisted that hermione sleep on the cushions from the sofa so that her silhouette was raised above his her arm curved to the floor her fingers inches from rons harry wondered whether they had fallen asleep holding hands the idea made him feel strangely lonely 
 
 he looked up at the shadowy ceiling the cobwebbed chandelier less than house ago he had been standing in the sunlight at the entrance to the marquee waiting to show in wedding guests it seemed a lifetime away what was going to happen now he lay on the floor and he thought of the horcruxes of the daunting complex mission dumbledore had left him dumbledore 
 
 the grief that had possessed him since dumbledores death felt different now the accusations he had heard from muriel at the wedding seemed to have nested in his brain like diseased things infecting his memories of the wizard he had idolized could dumbledore have let such things happen had he been like dudley content to watch neglect and abuse as long as it did not affect him could he have turned his back on a sister who was being imprisoned and hidden 
 
 harry thought of godrics hollow of graves dumbledore had never mentioned there he thought of mysterious objects left without explanation in dumbledores will and resentment swelled in the darkness why hadnt dumbledore told him why hadnt he explained had dumbledore actually cared about harry at all or had harry been nothing more than a tool to be polished and honed but not trusted never confided in 
 
 harry could not stand lying there with nothing but bitter thoughts for company desperate for something to do for distraction he slipped out of his sleeping bad picked up his wand and crept out of the room on the landing he whispered lumos and started to climb the stairs by wandlight 
 
 on the second landing was the bedroom in which he and ron had slept last time they had been here he glanced into it the wardrobe doors stood open and the bedclothes had been ripped back harry remembered the overturned troll leg downstairs somebody had searched the house since the order had left snape or perhaps mundungus who had pilfered plenty from this house both before and after sirius died harrys gaze wandered to the portrait that sometimes contained phineas nigellus black siriuss grandfather but it was empty showing nothing but a stretch of muddy backdrop phineas nigellus was evidently spending the night in the headmasters study at hogwarts 
 
 harry continued up the stairs until he reached the topmost landing where there were only two doors the one facing him bore a nameplate reading sirius harry had never entered his godfathers bedroom before he pushed open the door holding his wand high to cast light as widely as possible the room was spacious and must once have been handsome there was a large bed with a carved wooden headboard a tall window obscured by long velvet curtains and a chandelier thickly coated in dust with candle scrubs still resting in its sockets solid wax banging in frostlike drips a fine film of dust covered the pictures on the walls and the beds headboard a spiders web stretched between the chandelier and the top of the large wooden wardrobe and as harry moved deeper into the room he head a scurrying of disturbed mice 
 
 the teenage sirius had plastered the walls with so many posters and pictures that little of the walls silk was visible harry could only assume that siriuss parents had been unable to remove the permanent sticking charm that kept them on the wall because he was sure they would not have appreciated their eldest sons taste in decoration sirius seemed to have long gone out of his way to annoy his parents there were several large gryffindor banners faded scarlet and gold just to underline his difference from all the rest of the slytherin family there were many pictures of muggle motorcycles and also harry had to admire siriuss nerve several posters of muggle girls harry could tell that they were muggles because they remained quite stationary within their pictures faded smiles and glazed eyes frozen on the paper this was in contrast the only wizarding photograph on the walls which was a picture of four hogwarts students standing arm in arm laughing at the camera 
 
 with a leap of pleasure harry recognized his father his untidy black hair stuck up at the back like harrys and he too wore glasses beside him was sirius carelessly handsome his slightly arrogant face so much younger and happier than harry had ever seen it alive to siriuss right stood pettigrew more than a head shorter plump and flushed with pleasure at his inclusion in this coolest of gangs with the rebels that james and sirius had been on jamess left was lupin even then a little but he had the same air of delighted surprise at finding himself liked and included or was it simply because harry knew how it had been that he saw these things in the picture he tried to take it from the wall it was his now after all sirius had left him everything but it would not budge sirius had taken no chances in preventing his parents from redecorating his room 
 
 harry looked around at the floor the sky outside was growing brightest a shaft of light revealed bits of paper books and small objects scattered over the carpet evidently siriuss bedroom had been reached too although its contents seemed to have been judged mostly if not entirely worthless a few of the books had been shaken roughly enough to part company with the covers and sundry pages littered the floor 
 
 harry bent down picked up a few of the pieces of paper and examined them he recognized one as a part of an old edition of a history of magic by bathilda bagshot and another as belonging to a motorcycle maintenance manual the third was handwritten and crumpled he smoothed it out 
 
 
 
 
 dear padfoot 
 thank you thank you for harrys birthday present it was his favorite by far one year old and already zooming along on a toy broomstick he looked so pleased with himself im enclosing a picture so you can see you know it only rises about two feet off the ground but he nearly killed the cat and he smashed a horrible vase petunia sent me for christmas no complaints there of course james thought it was so funny says hes going to be a great quidditch player but weve had to pack away all the ornaments and make sure we dont take our eyes off him when he gets going 
 we had a very quiet birthday tea just us and old bathilda who has always been sweet to us and who dotes on harry we were so sorry you couldnt come but the orders got to come first and harrys not old enough to know its his birthday anyway james is getting a bit frustrated shut up here he tries not to show it but i can tell c also dumbledores still got his invisibility cloak so no chance of little excursions if you could visit it would cheer him up so much wormy was here last weekend i thought he seemed down but that was probably the next about the mckinnons i cried all evening when i heard 
 bathilda drops in most days shes a fascinating old thing with the most amazing stories about dumbledore im not sure hed be pleased if he knew i dont know how much to believe actually because it seems incredible that dumbledore 
 harrys extremities seemed to have gone numb he stood quite still holding the miraculous paper in his nerveless fingers while inside him a kind of quiet eruptions sent joy and grief thundering its equal measure through his veins lurching to the bed he sat down 
 
 he read the letter again but could not take in any more meaning than he had done the first time and was reduced to staring at the handwriting itself she had made her gs the same way he did he searched through the letter for every one of them and each felt like a friendly little wave glimpsed from behind a veil the letter was an incredible treasure proof that lily potter had lived really lived that her warm hand had once moved across this parchment tracing ink into these letters these words words about him harry her son 
 
 impatiently brushing away the wetness in his eyes he reread the letter this time concentrating on the meaning it was like listening to a voice 
 
 they had a cat perhaps it had perished like his parents at godrics hollow or else fled when there was nobody left to feed it sirius had bought him his first broomstick his parents had known bathilda bagshot had dumbledore introduced them dumbledores still got his invisibility cloak there was something funny there 
 
 harry paused pondering his mothers words why had dumbledore taken jamess invisibility cloak harry distinctly remembered his headmaster telling him years before i dont need a cloak to become invisible perhaps some less gifted order member had needed its assistance and dumbledore had acted as a carrier harry passed on 
 
 wormy was here pettigrew the traitor had seemed down had he was he aware that he was seeing james and lily alive for the last time 
 
 and finally bathilda again who told incredible stories about dumbledore it seems incredible that dumbledore c 
 
 that dumbledore what but there were any number of things that would seem incredible about dumbledore that he had once received bottom marks in a transfiguration test for instance or had taken up goat charming like aberforth 
 
 harry got to his feet and scanned the floor perhaps the rest of the letter was here somewhere he seized papers treating them in his eagerness with as little consideration as the original searcher he pulled open drawers shook out books stood on a chair to run his hand over the top of the wardrobe and crawled under the bed and armchair 
 
 at last lying facedown on the floor he spotted what looked like a torn piece of paper under the chest of drawers when he pulled it out it proved to be most of the photograph that lily had described in her letter a baby was zooming in and out of the picture on a tiny broom roaring with laughter and a pair of legs that must have belonged to james was chasing after him harry tucked the photograph into his pocket with lilys letter and continued to look for the second sheet 
 
 after another quarter of an hour however he was forced to conclude that the rest of his mothers letter was gone had it simply been lost in the sixteen years that had elapsed since it had been written or had it been taken by whoever had searched the room harry read the first sheet again this time looking for clues as to what might have made the second sheet valuable his toy broomstick could hardly be considered interesting to the death eaters the only potentially useful thing he could see her was possible information on dumbledore it seems incredible that dumbledore c what 
 
 harry harry harry 
 
 im here he called whats happened 
 
 there was a clatter of footsteps outside the door and hermione burst inside 
 
 we woke up and didnt know where you were she said breathlessly she turned and shouted over her shoulder ron ive found him 
 
 rons annoyed voice echoed distantly from several floors below 
 
 good tell him from me hes a git 
 
 harry dont just disappear please we were terrified why did you come up here anyway she gazed around the ransacked room what have you been doing 
 
 look what ive just found 
 
 he held out his mothers letter hermione took it out and read it while harry watched her when she reached the end of the page she looked up at him 
 
 oh harry 
 
 and theres this too 
 
 he handed her the torn photograph and hermione smiled at the baby zooming in and out of sight on the toy broom 
 
 ive been looking for the rest of the letter harry said but its not here 
 
 hermione glanced around 
 
 did you make all this mess or was some of it done when you got here 
 
 someone had searched before me said harry 
 
 i thought so every room i looked into on the way up had been disturbed what were they after do you think 
 
 information on the order if it was snape 
 
 but youd think hed already have all he needed i mean was in the order wasnt he 
 
 well then said harry keen to discuss his theory what about information on dumbledore the second page of the letter for instance you know this bathilda my mum mentions you know who she is 
 
 who 
 
 bathilda bagshot the author of c 
 
 a history of magic said hermione looking interested so your parents knew her she was an incredible magic historian 
 
 and shes still alive said harry and she lives in godrics hollow rons auntie muriel was talking about her at the wedding she knew dumbledores family too be pretty interesting to talk to wouldnt she there was a little too much understanding in the smile hermione gave him for harrys liking he took back the letter and the photograph and tucked them inside the pouch around his neck so as not to have to look at her and give himself away i understand why youd love to talk to her about your mum and dad and dumbledore too said hermione but that wouldnt really help us in our search for the horcruxes would it harry did not answer and she rushed on harry i know you really want to go to godrics hollow but im scared im scared at how easily those death eaters found us yesterday it just makes me feel more than ever that we ought to avoid the place where your parents are buried im sure theyd be expecting you to visit it 
 
 its not just that harry said still avoiding looking at her muriel said stuff about dumbledore at the wedding i want to know the truth 
 
 he told hermione everything that muriel had told him when he had finished hermione said of course i can see why thats upset you harry c 
 
 im not upset he lied id just like to know whether or not its true or c 
 
 harry do you really think youll get the truth from a malicious old woman like muriel or from rita skeeter how can you believe them you knew dumbledore 
 
 i thought i did he muttered 
 
 but you know how much truth there was in everything rita wrote about you doge is right how can you let these people tarnish your memories of dumbledore 
 
 he looked away trying not to betray the resentment he felt there it was again choose what to believe he wanted the truth why was everybody so determined that he should not get it 
 
 shall we go down to the kitchen hermione suggested after a little pause find something for breakfast 
 
 do not enter without the express permission of regulus arcturus black 
 excitement trickled through harry but he was not immediately sure why he read the sign again hermione was already a flight of stairs below him 
 
 hermione he said and he was surprised that his voice was so calm come back up here 
 
 whats the matter 
 
 i think ive found him 
 
 there was a gasp and then hermione ran back up the stairs 
 
 in your mums letter but i didnt see c 
 
 harry shook his head pointing at reguluss sign she read it then clutched harrys arm so tightly that he winced 
 
 siriuss brother she whispered 
 
 he was a death eater said harry sirius told me about him he joined up when he was really young and then got cold feet and tried to leave c so they killed him 
 
 that fits gasped hermione if he was a death eater he had access to voldemort and if he became disenchanted then he would have wanted to bring voldemort down 
 
 she released harry leaned over the banister and screamed ron ron get up here quick 
 
 ron appeared panting a minute later his wand ready in his hand 
 
 whats up if its massive spiders again i want breakfast before i c 
 
 he frowned at the sign on reguluss door in which hermione was silently pointing 
 
 what that was siriuss brother wasnt it regulus arcturus regulus the locket c you dont reckon c 
 
 lets find out said harry he pushed the door it was locked hermione pointed her wand at the handle and said alohamora there was a click and the door swung open 
 
 they moved over the threshold together gazing around reguluss bedroom was slightly smaller than siriuss though it had the same sense of former grandeur whereas sirius had sought to advertise his diffidence from the rest of the family regulus had striven to emphasize the opposite the slytherin colors of emerald and silver were everywhere draping the bed the walls and the windows the black family crest was painstakingly painted over the bed along with its motto toujours pur beneath this was a collection of yellow newspaper cuttings all stuck together to make a ragged collage hermione crossed the room to examine them 
 
 theyre all about voldemort she said regulus seems to have been a fan for a few years before he joined the death eaters 
 
 a little puff of dust rose from the bedcovers as she sat down to read the clippings harry meanwhile had noticed another photograph a hogwarts quidditch team was smiling and waving out of the frame he moved closer and saw the snakes emblazoned on their chests slytherins regulus was instantly recognizable as the boy sitting in the middle of the front row he had the same dark hair and slightly haughty look of his brother though he was smaller slighter and rather less handsome than sirius had been 
 
 he played seeker said harry 
 
 what said hermione vaguely she was still immersed in voldemorts press clippings 
 
 hes sitting in the middle of the front row thats where the seeker never mind said harry realizing that nobody was listening ron was on his hands and knees searching under the wardrobe harry looked around the room for likely hiding places and approached the desk yet again somebody had searched before them the drawers contents had been turned over recently the dust disturbed but there was nothing of value there old quills textbooks that bore evidence of being roughly handled a recently smashed ink bottle its sticky residue covering the contents of the drawer 
 
 theres an easier way said hermione as harry wiped his inky fingers on his jeans she raised her wand and said accio locket 
 
 nothing happened ron who had been searching the folds of the faded curtains looked disappointed 
 
 is that it then its not here 
 
 oh it could still be here but under said hermione charms to prevent it from being summoned magically you know 
 
 like voldemort put on the stone basin in the cave said harry remembering how he had been unable to summon the fake locket 
 
 how are we supposed to find it then asked ron 
 
 we search manually said hermione 
 
 thats a good idea said ron rolling his eyes and he resumed his examination of the curtains 
 
 they combed every inch of the room for more than an hour but were forced finally to conclude that the locket was not there 
 
 the sun had risen now its light dazzled them even through the grimy landing windows 
 
 it could be somewhere else in the house though said hermione in a rallying tone as they walked back downstairs as harry and ron had become more discouraged she seemed to have become more determined whether hed manage to destroy it or not hed want to keep it hidden from voldemort wouldnt he remember all those awful things we had to get rid of when we were here last time that clock that shot bolts at everyone and those old robes that tried to strangle ron regulus might have put them there to protect the lockets hiding place even though we didnt realize it at at 
 
 harry and ron looked at her she was standing with one foot in midair with the dumbstruck look of one who had just been obliviated her eyes had even drifted out of focus 
 
 at the time she finished in a whisper 
 
 something wrong asked ron 
 
 there was a locket 
 
 what said harry and ron together 
 
 in the cabinet in the drawing room nobody could open it and we we 
 
 harry felt as though a brick had slid down through his chest into his stomach he remembered he had even handled the thing as they passed it around each trying in turn to pry it open it had been tossed into a sack of rubbish along with the snuffbox of wartcap powder and the music box that had made everyone sleepy 
 
 kreacher nicked loads of things back from us said harry it was the only chance the only slender hope left to them and he was going to cling to it until forced to let go he had a whole stash of stuff in his cupboard in the kitchen cmon 
 
 he ran down the stairs taking two steps at a time the other two thundering along in his wake they made so much noise that they woke the portrait of siriuss mother as they passed through the hall 
 
 filth mudbloods scum she screamed after them as they dashed down into the basement kitchen and slammed the door behind them harry ran the length of the room skidded to a halt at the door of kreachers cupboard and wrenched it open there was the nest of dirty old blankets in which the had once slept but they were not longer glittering with the trinkets kreacher had salvaged the only thing there was an old copy of natures nobility a wizarding genealogy refusing to believe his eyes harry snatched up the blankets and shook them a dead mouse fell out and rolled dismally across the floor ron groaned as he threw himself into a kitchen chair hermione closed her eyes 
 
 its not over yet said harry and he raised his voice and called kreacher 
 
 there was a loud crack and the house elf that harry had so reluctantly inherited from sirius appeared out of nowhere in front of the cold and empty fireplace tiny half his pale skin hanging off him in folds white hair sprouting copiously from his batlike ears he was still wearing the filthy rag in which they had first met him and the contemptuous look he bent upon harry showed that his attitude to his change of ownership had altered no more than his outfit 
 
 master croaked kreacher in his bullfrogs voice and he bowed low muttering to his knees back in my mistresss old house with the weasley and the mudblood c 
 
 i forbid you to call anyone blood traitor or mudblood growled harry he would have found kreacher with his snoutlike nose and bloodshot eyes a distinctively unlovable object even if the elf had not betrayed sirius to voldemort 
 
 ive got a question for you said harry his heart beating rather fast as he looked down at the elf and i order you to answer it truthfully understand 
 
 yes master said kreacher bowing low again harry saw his lips moving soundlessly undoubtedly framing the insults he was now forbidden to utter 
 
 two years ago said harry his heart now hammering against his ribs there was a big gold locket in the drawing room upstairs we threw it out did you steal it back 
 
 there was a moments silence during which kreacher straightened up to look harry full in the face then he said yes 
 
 where is it now asked harry jubilantly as ron and hermione looked gleeful 
 
 kreacher closed his eyes as though he could not bear to see their reactions to his next word 
 
 gone 
 
 gone echoed harry elation floating out of him what do you mean its gone 
 
 the elf shivered he swayed 
 
 kreacher said harry fiercely i order you c 
 
 mundungus fletcher croaked the elf his eyes still tight shut mundungus fletcher stole it all miss bellas and miss cissys pictures my mistresss gloves the order of merlin first class the goblets with the family crest and c and c 
 
 kreacher was gulping for air his hollow chest was rising and falling rapidly then his eyes flew open and he uttered a bloodcurdling scream 
 
 c and the locket master reguluss locket kreacher did wrong kreacher failed in his orders 
 
 harry reacted instinctively as kreacher lunged for the poker standing in the grate he launched himself upon the elf flattening him hermiones scream mingled with kreachers but harry bellowed louder than both of them kreacher i order you to stay still 
 
 he felt the elf freeze and released him kreacher lay flat on the cold stone floor tears gushing from his sagging eyes 
 
 harry let him up hermione whispered 
 
 so he can beat himself up with the poker snorted harry kneeling beside the elf i dont think so right kreacher i want the truth how do you know mundungus fletcher stole the locket 
 
 kreacher saw him gasped the elf as tears poured over his snout and into his mouth full of graying teeth kreacher saw him coming out of kreachers cupboard with his hands full of kreachers treasures kreacher told the sneak thief to stop but mundungus fletcher laughed and 
 
 you called the locket master reguluss said harry why where did it come from what did regulus have to do with it kreacher sit up and tell me everything you know about that locket and everything regulus had to do with it 
 
 the elf sat up curled into a ball placed his wet face between his knees and began to rock backward and forward when he spoke his voice was muffled but quite distinct in the silent echoing kitchen 
 
 master sirius ran away good riddance for he was a bad boy and broke my mistresss heart with his lawless ways but master regulus had proper order he knew what was due to the name of black and the dignity of his pure blood for years he talked of the dark lord who was going to bring the wizards out of hiding to rule the muggles and the and when he was sixteen years old master regulus joined the dark lord so proud so proud so happy to serve 
 
 and one day a year after he joined master regulus came down to the kitchen to see kreacher master regulus always liked kreacher and master regulus said he said 
 
 the old elf rocked faster than ever 
 
 he said that the dark lord required an elf 
 
 voldemort needed an elf harry repeated looking around at ron and hermione who looked just as puzzled as he did 
 
 oh yes moaned kreacher and master regulus had volunteered kreacher it was an honor said master regulus an honor for him and for kreacher who must be sure to do whatever the dark lord ordered him to do and then to home 
 
 kreacher rocked still faster his breath coming in sobs 
 
 so kreacher went to the dark lord the dark lord did not tell kreacher what they were to do but took kreacher with him to a cave beside the sea and beyond the cave was a cavern and in the cavern was a great black lake 
 
 the hairs on the back of harrys neck stood up kreachers croaking voice seemed to come to him from across the dark water he saw what had happened as clearly as though he had been present 
 
 there was a boat 
 
 of course there had been a boat harry knew the boat ghostly green and tiny bewitched so as to carry one wizard and one victim toward the island in the center this then was how voldemort had tested the defenses surrounding the horcrux by borrowing a disposable creature a 
 
 there was a full of potion on the island the lord made kreacher drink it 
 
 the elf quaked from head to foot 
 
 kreacher drank and as he drank he saw terrible thing kreachers insides burned kreacher cried for master regulus to save him he cried for his mistress black but the dark lord only laughed he made kreacher drink all the potion he dropped a locket into the empty basin he filled it with more potion 
 
 and then the dark lord sailed away leaving kreacher on the island 
 
 harry could see it happening he watched voldemorts white snakelike face vanishing into darkness those red eyes fixed pitilessly on the thrashing elf whose death would occur within minutes whenever he succumbed to the desperate thirst that the burning poison caused its victim but here harrys imagination could go no further for he could not see how kreacher had escaped 
 
 kreacher needed water he crawled to the islands edge and he drank from the black lake and hands dead hands came out of the water and dragged kreacher under the surface 
 
 how did you get away harry asked and he was not surprised to hear himself whispering 
 
 kreacher raised his ugly head and looked harry with his great bloodshot eyes 
 
 master regulus told kreacher to come back he said 
 
 i know c but how did you escape the inferi 
 
 kreacher did not seem to understand 
 
 master regulus told kreacher to come back he repeated 
 
 i know but c 
 
 well its obvious isnt it harry said ron he disapparated 
 
 but you couldnt apparate in and out of that cave said harry otherwise dumbledore c 
 
 elf magic isnt like wizards magic is it said ron i mean they can apparate and disapparate in and out of hogwarts when we cant 
 
 there was a silence as harry digested this how could voldemort have made such a mistake but even as he thought this hermione spoke and her voice was icy 
 
 of course voldemort would have considered the ways of far beneath his notice it would never have occurred to him that they might have magic that he didnt 
 
 the highest law is his masters bidding intoned kreacher kreacher was told to come home so kreacher came home 
 
 well then you did what you were told didnt you said hermione kindly you didnt disobey orders at all 
 
 kreacher shook his head rocking as fast as ever 
 
 so what happened when you got back harry asked what did regulus say when you told him what happened 
 
 master regulus was very worried very worried croaked kreacher master regulus told kreacher to stay hidden and not to leave the house and then it was a little while later master regulus came to find kreacher in his cupboard one night and master regulus was strange not as he usually was disturbed in his mind kreacher could tell and he asked kreacher to take him to the cave the cave where kreacher had gone with the dark lord 
 
 and so they had set off harry could visualize them quite clearly the frightened old elf and the thin dark seeker who had so resembled sirius kreacher knew how to open the concealed entrance to the underground cavern knew how to raise the tiny boat this time it was his beloved regulus who sailed with him to the island with its basin of poison 
 
 and he made you drink the poison said harry disgusted 
 
 but kreacher shook his head and wept hermiones hands leapt to her mouth she seemed to have understood something 
 
 regulus took from his pocket a locket like the one the dark lord had said kreacher tears pouring down either side of his snoutlike nose and he told kreacher to take it and when the basin was empty to switch the lockets 
 
 kreachers sobs came in great rasps now harry had to concentrate hard to understand him 
 
 and he order c kreacher to leave c without him and he told kreacher c to go home c and never to tell my mistress c what he had done c but to destroy c the first locket and he drank c all the potion c and kreacher swapped the lockets c and watched as master regulus was dragged beneath the water and 
 
 oh kreacher wailed hermione who was crying she dropped to her knees beside the elf and tried to hug him at once he was on his feet cringing away from her quite obviously repulsed 
 
 the mudblood touched kreacher he will not allow it what would his mistress say 
 
 i told you not to call her mudblood snarled harry but the elf was already punishing himself he fell to the ground and banged his forehead on the floor 
 
 stop him c stop him hermione cried oh dont you see now how sick it is the way theyve got to obey 
 
 kreacher c stop stop shouted harry 
 
 the elf lay on the floor panting and shivering green mucus glistening around his snot a bruise already blooming on his pallid forehead where he had struck himself his eyes swollen and bloodshot and swimming in tears harry had never seen anything so pitiful 
 
 so you brought the locket home he said relentlessly for he was determined to know the full story and you tried to destroy it 
 
 nothing kreacher did made any mark upon it moaned the elf kreacher tried everything everything he knew but nothing nothing would work so many powerful spells upon the casing kreacher was sure the way to destroy it was to get inside it but it would not open kreacher punished himself he tried again he punished himself he tried again kreacher failed to obey orders kreacher could not destroy the locket and his mistress was mad with grief because master regulus had disappeared and kreacher could not tell her what had happened no because master regulus had him to tell any of the what happened in the 
 
 kreacher began to sob so hard that there were no more coherent words tears flowed down hermiones cheeks as she watched kreacher but she did not dare touch him again even ron who was no fan of kreachers looked troubled harry sat back on his heels and shook his head trying to clear it 
 
 i dont understand you kreacher he said finally voldemort tried to kill you regulus died to bring voldemort down but you were still happy to betray sirius to voldemort you were happy to go to narcissa and bellatrix and pass information to voldemort through them 
 
 harry kreacher doesnt think like that said hermione wiping her eyes on the back of her hand hes a slave are used to bad even brutal treatment what voldemort did to kreacher wasnt that far out of the common way what do wizard wars mean to an elf like kreacher hes loyal to people who are kind to him and mrs black must have been and regulus certainly was so he served them willingly and parroted their beliefs i know what youre going to say she went on as harry began to protest that regulus changed his mind but he doesnt seem to have explained that to kreacher does he and i think i know why kreacher and reguluss family were all safest if they kept to the old line regulus was trying to protect them all 
 
 sirius c 
 
 sirius was horrible to kreacher harry and its no good looking like that you know its true kreacher had been alone for such a long time when sirius came to live here and he was probably starving for a bit of affection im sure miss cissy and miss bella were perfectly lovely to kreacher when he turned up so he did them a favor and told them everything they wanted to know ive said all along that wizards would pay for how they treat well voldemort did and so did sirius 
 
 harry had no retort as he watched kreacher sobbing on the floor he remembered what dumbledore had said to him mere hours after siriuss death i do not think sirius ever saw kreacher as a being with feelings as acute as a humans 
 
 kreacher said harry after a while when you feel up to it er please sit up 
 
 it was several minutes before kreacher hiccupped himself into silence then he pushed himself into a sitting position again rubbing his knuckles into his eyes like a small child 
 
 kreacher i am going to ask you to do something said harry he glanced at hermione for assistance he wanted to give the order kindly but at the same time he could not pretend that it was not an order however the change in his tone seemed to have gained her approval she smiled encouragingly 
 
 kreacher i want you please to go and find mundungus fletcher we need to find out where the locket c where master reguluss locket it its really important we want to finish the work master regulus started we want to c er c ensure that he didnt die in vain 
 
 kreacher dropped his fists and looked up at harry 
 
 find mundungus fletcher he croaked 
 
 and bring him here to grimmauld place said harry do you think you could do that for us 
 
 as kreacher nodded and got to his feet harry had a sudden inspiration he pulled out hagrids purse and took out the fake horcrux the substitute locket in which regulus had placed the note to voldemort 
 
 kreacher id er like you to have this he said pressing the locket into the elfs hand this belonged to regulus and im sure hed want you to have it as a token of gratitude for what you c 
 
 overkill mate said ron as the elf took one look at the locket let out a howl of shock and misery and threw himself back onto the ground 
 
 it took them nearly half an hour to calm down kreacher who was so overcome to be presented with a black family heirloom for his very own that he was too weak at the knees to stand properly when finally he was able to totter a few steps they all accompanied him to his cupboard watched him tuck up the locket safely in his dirty blankets and assured him that they would make its protection their first priority while he was away he then made two low bows to harry and ron and even gave a funny little spasm in hermiones direction that might have been an attempt at a respectful salute before disapparating with the usual loud crack

 fairy tales of hans christian andersen 
 prattle 
 by hans christian andersen 
 
 at a rich house there was a party and the 
 children of rich and great people were there the merchant was a 
 learned man for his father had sent him to college and he had passed 
 his examination his father had been at first only a cattle dealer 
 but always honest and industrious so that he had made money and 
 his son the merchant had managed to increase his store clever as he 
 was he had also a heart but there was less said of his heart than of 
 his money all descriptions of people visited at the house 
 well born as well as intellectual and some who possessed neither 
 of these recommendations 
 
 now it was a party and there was prattle 
 which always is spoken freely from the heart among them was a 
 beautiful little girl who was terribly proud but this had been 
 taught her by the servants and not by her parents who were far too 
 sensible people 
 
 her father was groom of the chambers which is a high office at 
 court and she knew it i am a child of the court she said now she 
 might just as well have been a child of the cellar for no one can 
 help his birth and then she told the other children that she was 
 and said that no one who was not could rise in 
 the world it was no use to read and be industrious for if a person 
 was not he could never achieve anything and those whose names end with sen said she can never be anything at all we must put our arms akimbo and make the elbow quite pointed so as to keep these sen people at a great distance and then she stuck out her pretty little arms and made the elbows quite pointed to show how it was to be done and her little arms were very pretty for she was a child 
 
 but the little daughter of the merchant became very angry at 
 this speech for her name was petersen and she knew that the 
 name ended in sen and therefore she said as proudly as she could 
 but my papa can buy a hundred dollars worth of bonbons and give 
 them away to children can your papa do that 
 
 yes and my papa said the little daughter of the editor of a 
 paper my papa can put your papa and papa into the 
 newspaper all sorts of people are afraid of him my mamma says for he can do as he likes with the paper and the little maiden looked 
 exceedingly proud as if she had been a real princess who may be 
 expected to look proud 
 
 but outside the door which stood ajar was a poor boy peeping 
 through the crack of the door he was of such a lowly station that 
 he had not been allowed even to enter the room he had been turning 
 the spit for the cook and she had given him permission to stand 
 behind the door and peep in at the children who were 
 having such a merry time within and for him that was a great deal 
 
 oh if i could be one of them thought he and then he heard what 
 was said about names which was quite enough to make him more unhappy 
 
 his parents at home had not even a penny to spare to buy a 
 newspaper much less could they write in one and worse than all 
 his name and of course his own ended in sen and 
 therefore he could never turn out well which was a very sad 
 thought but after all he had been born into the world and the 
 station of life had been chosen for him therefore he must be content 
 
 and this is what happened on that evening 
 many years passed and most of the children became 
 persons 
 
 there stood a splendid house in the town filled with all kinds of 
 beautiful and valuable objects everybody wished to see it and people even came in from the country round to be permitted to view the treasures it contained 
 
 which of the children whose prattle we have described could 
 call this house his own one would suppose it very easy to guess 
 no no it is not so very easy the house belonged to the poor 
 little boy who had stood on that night behind the door he had 
 really become something great although his name ended in sen 
 for it was thorwaldsen 
 
 and the three other children the children of good birth of 
 money and of intellectual pride well they were respected and 
 honored in the world for they had been well provided for by birth and position and they had no cause to reproach themselves with what they had thought and spoken on that evening long ago for after 
 all it was mere prattle

 the new poster the famous shot from the seven year itch on the subway grate with skirt billowing up andy sits gazing at her as commences 
 int cell night 
 and we find red gazing blankly as darkness takes the cellblock adding up the months weeks days 
 he regards the harmonica like a man confronted with a martian artifact he considers trying it out even holds it briefly to his lips almost embarrassed but puts it back in its box untested and there the harmonica will stay 
 fade to black 
 we hold in blackness as thumping sounds grow louder 
 red 
 andy was as good as his word he kept writing to the state senate 
 two letters a week instead of one 
 and the blackness disintegrates as a wall tumbles before our eyes revealing a work crew with picks and sledgehammers 
 faces obscured with kerchiefs against the dust behind them are guards overseeing the work 
 andy yanks his kerchief down grinning in exhilaration red and the others follow suit they step through the hole in the wall exploring what used to be a storage room 
 red 
 in the folks up augusta way finally clued in to the fact they 
 buy him off with just a dollar check appropriations 
 committee voted an annual payment of dollars just to shut him up

 red nods solemn they settle in on the bleachers andy pulls a small box from his sweater hands it to red

 men line the tiers as the evening count is completed the convicts step into their cells the master switch is thrown and all the doors slam shut andy finds a cardboard tube on his bunk the note reads a new girl for your year anniversary from your pal red 
 int cell later 
 marilyn face fills the screen slow pull back reveals 
 the new poster the famous shot from the seven year itch on the subway grate with skirt billowing up andy sits gazing at her as commences 
 int cell night 
 and we find red gazing blankly as darkness takes the cellblock adding up the months weeks days 
 he regards the harmonica like a man confronted with a martian artifact he considers trying it out even holds it briefly to his lips almost embarrassed but puts it back in its box untested and there the harmonica will stay 
 fade to black 
 we hold in blackness as thumping sounds grow louder 
 red 
 andy was as good as his word he kept writing to the state senate 
 two letters a week instead of one 
 and the blackness disintegrates as a wall tumbles before our eyes revealing a work crew with picks and sledgehammers 
 faces obscured with kerchiefs against the dust behind them are guards overseeing the work 
 andy yanks his kerchief down grinning in exhilaration red and the others follow suit they step through the hole in the wall exploring what used to be a storage room 
 red

 buy him off with just a dollar check appropriations

 chapter v 
 
 a piece falls on the ground and produces a tumult 
 near church there was a poor man who was in the habit of crouching on the brink of a public well which had been condemned and on whom jean valjean was fond of bestowing charity 
 he never passed this man without giving him a few sous 
 sometimes he spoke to him those who envied this mendicant said that he belonged to the police he was an of who was constantly mumbling his prayers 
 one evening as jean valjean was passing by when he had not cosette with him he saw the beggar in his usual place beneath the lantern which had just been lighted 
 the man seemed engaged in prayer according to his custom and was much bent over 
 jean valjean stepped up to him and placed his customary alms in his hand the mendicant raised his eyes suddenly stared intently at jean valjean then dropped his head quickly 
 this movement was like a flash of lightning 
 jean valjean was seized with a shudder it seemed to him that he had just caught sight by the light of the street lantern not of the placid and beaming visage of the old beadle but of a and startling face he experienced the same impression that one would have on finding self all of a sudden face to face in the dark with a tiger he recoiled terrified petrified daring neither to breathe to speak to remain nor to flee staring at the beggar who had dropped his head which was enveloped in a rag and no longer appeared to know that he was there 
 at this strange moment an instinct possibly the mysterious instinct of jean valjean from uttering a word 
 the beggar had the same figure the same rags the same appearance as he had every day 
 bah said jean valjean i am mad 
 i am dreaming 
 impossible 
 and he returned profoundly troubled 
 he hardly dared to confess even to himself that the face which he thought he had seen was the face of javert 
 that night on thinking the matter over he regretted not having questioned the man in order to force him to raise his head a second time 
 on the following day at nightfall he went back 
 the beggar was at his post 
 good day my good man said jean valjean resolutely handing him a sou 
 the beggar raised his head and replied in a whining voice thanks my good sir 
 it was unmistakably the 
 jean valjean felt completely reassured 
 he began to laugh how the deuce could i have thought that i saw javert there he thought 
 am i going to lose my eyesight now 
 and he thought no more about it 
 a few days might have been at eight in the was in his room and engaged in making cosette spell aloud when he heard the house door open and then shut again this struck him as singular 
 the old woman who was the only inhabitant of the house except himself always went to bed at nightfall so that she might not burn out her candles 
 jean valjean made a sign to cosette to be quiet 
 he heard some one ascending the stairs it might possibly be the old woman who might have fallen ill and have been out to the jean valjean listened 
 the step was heavy and sounded like that of a man but the old woman wore stout shoes and there is nothing which so strongly resembles the step of a man as that of an old woman 
 nevertheless jean valjean blew out his candle 
 he had sent cosette to bed saying to her in a low voice get into bed very softly and as he kissed her brow the steps paused 
 jean valjean remained silent motionless with his back towards the door seated on the chair from which he had not stirred and holding his breath in the dark 
 after the expiration of a rather long interval he turned round as he heard nothing more and as he raised his eyes towards the door of his chamber he saw a light through the keyhole 
 this light formed a sort of sinister star in the blackness of the door and the wall there was evidently some one there who was holding a candle in his hand and listening 
 several minutes elapsed thus and the light retreated 
 but he heard no sound of footsteps which seemed to indicate that the person who had been listening at the door had removed his shoes 
 jean valjean threw himself all dressed as he was on his bed and could not close his eyes all night 
 at daybreak just as he was falling into a doze through fatigue he was awakened by the creaking of a door which opened on some attic at the end of the corridor then he heard the same masculine footstep which had ascended the stairs on the preceding evening the step was approaching 
 he sprang off the bed and applied his eye to the keyhole which was tolerably large hoping to see the person who had made his way by night into the house and had listened at his door as he passed 
 it was a man in fact who passed this time without pausing in front of jean chamber 
 the corridor was too dark to allow of the face being distinguished but when the man reached the staircase a ray of light from without made it stand out like a silhouette and jean valjean had a complete view of his back 
 the man was of lofty stature clad in a long with a cudgel under his arm 
 the formidable neck and shoulders belonged to javert 
 jean valjean might have attempted to catch another glimpse of him through his window opening on the boulevard but he would have been obliged to open the window 
 he dared not 
 it was evident that this man had entered with a key and like himself who had given him that key 
 what was the meaning of this 
 when the old woman came to do the work at seven in the morning jean valjean cast a penetrating glance on her but he did not question her 
 the good woman appeared as usual 
 as she swept up she remarked to him 
 possibly monsieur may have heard some one come in last night 
 at that age and on that boulevard eight in the evening was the dead of the night 
 that is true by the way he replied in the most natural tone possible 
 who was it 
 it was a new lodger who has come into the house said the old woman 
 and what is his name 
 i know exactly dumont or daumont or some name of that sort 
 and who is this monsieur dumont 
 the old woman gazed at him with her little polecat eyes and answered 
 a gentleman of property like yourself 
 perhaps she had no ulterior meaning 
 jean valjean thought he perceived one 
 when the old woman had taken her departure he did up a hundred francs which he had in a cupboard into a roll and put it in his pocket in spite of all the precautions which he took in this operation so that he might not be heard rattling silver a piece escaped from his hands and rolled noisily on the floor 
 when darkness came on he descended and carefully scrutinized both sides of the boulevard 
 he saw no one 
 the boulevard appeared to be absolutely deserted 
 it is true that a person can conceal himself behind trees 
 he went up stairs again 
 come 
 he said to cosette 
 he took her by the hand and they both went out

 prince andrew arrived in petersburg in august it was the time when the youthful speranski was at the zenith of his fame and his reforms were being pushed forward with the greatest energy that same august the emperor was thrown from his caleche injured his leg and remained three weeks at peterhof receiving speranski every day and no one else at that time the two famous decrees were being prepared that so agitated society abolishing court ranks and introducing examinations to qualify for the grades of collegiate assessor and state councilor and not merely these but a whole state constitution intended to change the existing order of government in russia legal administrative and financial from the council of state down to the district tribunals now those vague liberal dreams with which the emperor alexander had ascended the throne and which he had tried to put into effect with the aid of his associates czartoryski novosiltsev kochubey and strogonov whom he himself in jest had called his comite de salut public were taking shape and being realized 
 now all these men were replaced by speranski on the civil side and arakcheev on the military soon after his arrival prince andrew as a gentleman of the chamber presented himself at court and at a levee the emperor though he met him twice did not favor him with a single word it had always seemed to prince andrew before that he was antipathetic to the emperor and that the latter disliked his face and personality generally and in the cold repellent glance the emperor gave him he now found further confirmation of this surmise the courtiers explained the neglect of him by his displeasure at not having served since 
 i know myself that one cannot help sympathies and antipathies thought prince andrew so it will not do to present my proposal for the reform of the army regulations to the emperor personally but the project will speak for itself 
 he mentioned what he had written to an old field marshal a friend of his the field marshal made an appointment to see him received him graciously and promised to inform the emperor a few days later prince andrew received notice that he was to go to see the minister of war count arakcheev 
 on the appointed day prince andrew entered count waiting room at nine in the morning 
 he did not know arakcheev personally had never seen him and all he had heard of him inspired him with but little respect for the man 
 he is minister of war a man trusted by the emperor and i need not concern myself about his personal qualities he has been commissioned to consider my project so he alone can get it adopted thought prince andrew as he waited among a number of important and unimportant people in count waiting room 
 during his service chiefly as an adjutant prince andrew had seen the anterooms of many important men and the different types of such rooms were well known to him count anteroom had quite a special character the faces of the unimportant people awaiting their turn for an audience showed embarrassment and servility the faces of those of higher rank expressed a common feeling of awkwardness covered by a mask of unconcern and ridicule of themselves their situation and the person for whom they were waiting some walked thoughtfully up and down others whispered and laughed prince andrew heard the nickname sila andreevich and the words uncle will give it to us hot in reference to count arakcheev one general an important personage evidently feeling offended at having to wait so long sat crossing and uncrossing his legs and smiling contemptuously to himself 
 but the moment the door opened one feeling alone appeared on all faces that of fear prince andrew for the second time asked the adjutant on duty to take in his name but received an ironical look and was told that his turn would come in due course after some others had been shown in and out of the room by the adjutant on duty an officer who struck prince andrew by his humiliated and frightened air was admitted at that terrible door this audience lasted a long time then suddenly the grating sound of a harsh voice was heard from the other side of the door and the officer with pale face and trembling lips came out and passed through the waiting room clutching his head 
 after this prince andrew was conducted to the door and the officer on duty said in a whisper to the right at the window 
 prince andrew entered a plain tidy room and saw at the table a man of forty with a long waist a long closely cropped head deep wrinkles scowling brows above dull eyes and an overhanging red nose arakcheev turned his head toward him without looking at him 
 what is your petition asked arakcheev 
 i am not petitioning your excellency returned prince andrew quietly 
 eyes turned toward him 
 sit down said he prince bolkonski 
 i am not petitioning about anything his majesty the emperor has deigned to send your excellency a project submitted by me 
 you see my dear sir i have read your project interrupted arakcheev uttering only the first words amiably and then again without looking at prince andrew relapsing gradually into a tone of grumbling contempt you are proposing new military laws there are many laws but no one to carry out the old ones nowadays everybody designs laws it is easier writing than doing 
 i came at his majesty the wish to learn from your excellency how you propose to deal with the memorandum i have presented said prince andrew politely 
 i have endorsed a resolution on your memorandum and sent it to the committee i do not approve of it said arakcheev rising and taking a paper from his writing table here and he handed it to prince andrew 
 across the paper was scrawled in pencil without capital letters misspelled and without punctuation unsoundly constructed because resembles an imitation of the french military code and from the articles of war needlessly deviating 
 to what committee has the memorandum been referred inquired prince andrew 
 to the committee on army regulations and i have recommended that your honor should be appointed a member but without a salary 
 prince andrew smiled 
 i want one 
 a member without salary repeated arakcheev i have the honor eh call the next one who else is there he shouted bowing to prince andrew

 book a black hunt a mute pack 
 chapter i 
 
 the zigzags of strategy 
 an observation here becomes necessary in view of the pages which the reader is about to peruse and of others which will be met with further on 
 the author of this book who regrets the necessity of mentioning himself has been absent from paris for many years 
 paris has been transformed since he quitted it 
 a new city has arisen which is after a fashion unknown to him 
 there is no need for him to say that he loves paris paris is his natal city 
 in consequence of demolitions and reconstructions the paris of his youth that paris which he bore away religiously in his memory is now a paris of days gone by he must be permitted to speak of that paris as though it still existed it is possible that when the author conducts his readers to a spot and says in such a street there stands such and such a house neither street nor house will any longer exist in that locality readers may verify the facts if they care to take the trouble for his own part he is unacquainted with the new paris and he writes with the old paris before his eyes in an illusion which is precious to him 
 it is a delight to him to dream that there still lingers behind him something of that which he beheld when he was in his own country and that all has not vanished 
 so long as you go and come in your native land you imagine that those streets are a matter of indifference to you that those windows those roofs and those doors are nothing to you that those walls are strangers to you that those trees are merely the first encountered haphazard that those houses which you do not enter are useless to you that the pavements which you tread are merely stones 
 later on when you are no longer there you perceive that the streets are dear to you that you miss those roofs those doors and that those walls are necessary to you those trees are well beloved by you that you entered those houses which you never entered every day and that you have left a part of your heart of your blood of your soul in those pavements 
 all those places which you no longer behold which you may never behold again perchance and whose memory you have cherished take on a melancholy charm recur to your mind with the melancholy of an apparition make the holy land visible to you and are so to speak the very form of france and you love them and you call them up as they are as they were and you persist in this and you will submit to no change for you are attached to the figure of your fatherland as to the face of your mother 
 may we then be permitted to speak of the past in the present that said we beg the reader to take note of it and we continue 
 jean valjean instantly quitted the boulevard and plunged into the streets taking the most intricate lines which he could devise returning on his track at times to make sure that he was not being followed 
 this manoeuvre is peculiar to the hunted stag 
 on soil where an imprint of the track may be left this manoeuvre possesses among other advantages that of deceiving the huntsmen and the dogs by throwing them on the wrong scent 
 in venery this is called false 
 the moon was full that night 
 jean valjean was not sorry for this the moon still very close to the horizon cast great masses of light and shadow in the streets 
 jean valjean could glide along close to the houses on the dark side and yet keep watch on the light side he did not perhaps take sufficiently into consideration the fact that the dark side escaped him 
 still in the deserted lanes which lie near the rue poliveau he thought he felt certain that no one was following him 
 cosette walked on without asking any questions 
 the sufferings of the first six years of her life had instilled something passive into her nature 
 this is a remark to which we shall frequently have occasion to had grown used without being herself aware of it to the peculiarities of this good man and to the freaks of destiny 
 and then she was with him and she felt safe 
 jean valjean knew no more where he was going than did cosette he trusted in god as she trusted in him 
 it seemed as though he also were clinging to the hand of some one greater than himself he thought he felt a being leading him though invisible however he had no settled idea no plan no project 
 he was not even absolutely sure that it was javert and then it might have been javert without javert knowing that he was jean valjean 
 was not he disguised 
 was not he believed to be dead 
 still queer things had been going on for several days 
 he wanted no more of them he was determined not to return to the gorbeau house 
 like the wild animal chased from its lair he was seeking a hole in which he might hide until he could find one where he might dwell 
 jean valjean described many and varied labyrinths in the mouffetard quarter which was already asleep as though the discipline of the middle ages and the yoke of the curfew still existed he combined in various manners with cunning strategy the rue censier and the rue copeau the rue du and the rue du puits there are lodging houses in this locality but he did not even enter one finding nothing which suited him he had no doubt that if any one had chanced to be upon his track they would have lost it 
 as eleven struck from he was traversing the rue de pontoise in front of the office of the commissary of police situated at no 
 a few moments later the instinct of which we have spoken above made him turn round at that moment he saw distinctly thanks to the lantern which betrayed them three men who were following him closely pass one after the other under that lantern on the dark side of the street one of the three entered the alley leading to the house the one who marched at their head struck him as decidedly suspicious 
 come child he said to cosette and he made haste to quit the rue pontoise 
 he took a circuit turned into the passage des patriarches which was closed on account of the hour strode along the rue de and the rue de and plunged into the rue des postes 
 at that time there was a square formed by the intersection of streets where the college rollin stands and where the rue turns off 
 it is understood of course that the rue is an old street and that a does not pass through the rue des postes once in ten years 
 in the thirteenth century this rue des postes was inhabited by potters and its real name is rue des pots 
 the moon cast a livid light into this open space 
 jean valjean went into ambush in a doorway calculating that if the men were still following him he could not fail to get a good look at them as they traversed this illuminated space 
 in point of fact three minutes had not elapsed when the men made their appearance 
 there were four of them now 
 all were tall dressed in long brown coats with round hats and huge cudgels in their hands 
 their great stature and their vast fists rendered them no less alarming than did their sinister stride through the darkness one would have pronounced them four spectres disguised as bourgeois

 chapter i 
 
 the zigzags of strategy 
 an observation here becomes necessary in view of the pages which the reader is about to peruse and of others which will be met with further on 
 the author of this book who regrets the necessity of mentioning himself has been absent from paris for many years 
 paris has been transformed since he quitted it 
 a new city has arisen which is after a fashion unknown to him 
 there is no need for him to say that he loves paris paris is his natal city 
 in consequence of demolitions and reconstructions the paris of his youth that paris which he bore away religiously in his memory is now a paris of days gone by he must be permitted to speak of that paris as though it still existed it is possible that when the author conducts his readers to a spot and says in such a street there stands such and such a house neither street nor house will any longer exist in that locality readers may verify the facts if they care to take the trouble for his own part he is unacquainted with the new paris and he writes with the old paris before his eyes in an illusion which is precious to him 
 it is a delight to him to dream that there still lingers behind him something of that which he beheld when he was in his own country and that all has not vanished 
 so long as you go and come in your native land you imagine that those streets are a matter of indifference to you that those windows those roofs and those doors are nothing to you that those walls are strangers to you that those trees are merely the first encountered haphazard that those houses which you do not enter are useless to you that the pavements which you tread are merely stones 
 later on when you are no longer there you perceive that the streets are dear to you that you miss those roofs those doors and that those walls are necessary to you those trees are well beloved by you that you entered those houses which you never entered every day and that you have left a part of your heart of your blood of your soul in those pavements 
 all those places which you no longer behold which you may never behold again perchance and whose memory you have cherished take on a melancholy charm recur to your mind with the melancholy of an apparition make the holy land visible to you and are so to speak the very form of france and you love them and you call them up as they are as they were and you persist in this and you will submit to no change for you are attached to the figure of your fatherland as to the face of your mother 
 may we then be permitted to speak of the past in the present that said we beg the reader to take note of it and we continue 
 jean valjean instantly quitted the boulevard and plunged into the streets taking the most intricate lines which he could devise returning on his track at times to make sure that he was not being followed 
 this manoeuvre is peculiar to the hunted stag 
 on soil where an imprint of the track may be left this manoeuvre possesses among other advantages that of deceiving the huntsmen and the dogs by throwing them on the wrong scent 
 in venery this is called false 
 the moon was full that night 
 jean valjean was not sorry for this the moon still very close to the horizon cast great masses of light and shadow in the streets 
 jean valjean could glide along close to the houses on the dark side and yet keep watch on the light side he did not perhaps take sufficiently into consideration the fact that the dark side escaped him 
 still in the deserted lanes which lie near the rue poliveau he thought he felt certain that no one was following him 
 cosette walked on without asking any questions 
 the sufferings of the first six years of her life had instilled something passive into her nature 
 this is a remark to which we shall frequently have occasion to had grown used without being herself aware of it to the peculiarities of this good man and to the freaks of destiny 
 and then she was with him and she felt safe 
 jean valjean knew no more where he was going than did cosette he trusted in god as she trusted in him 
 it seemed as though he also were clinging to the hand of some one greater than himself he thought he felt a being leading him though invisible however he had no settled idea no plan no project 
 he was not even absolutely sure that it was javert and then it might have been javert without javert knowing that he was jean valjean 
 was not he disguised 
 was not he believed to be dead 
 still queer things had been going on for several days 
 he wanted no more of them he was determined not to return to the gorbeau house 
 like the wild animal chased from its lair he was seeking a hole in which he might hide until he could find one where he might dwell 
 jean valjean described many and varied labyrinths in the mouffetard quarter which was already asleep as though the discipline of the middle ages and the yoke of the curfew still existed he combined in various manners with cunning strategy the rue censier and the rue copeau the rue du and the rue du puits there are lodging houses in this locality but he did not even enter one finding nothing which suited him he had no doubt that if any one had chanced to be upon his track they would have lost it 
 as eleven struck from he was traversing the rue de pontoise in front of the office of the commissary of police situated at no 
 a few moments later the instinct of which we have spoken above made him turn round at that moment he saw distinctly thanks to the lantern which betrayed them three men who were following him closely pass one after the other under that lantern on the dark side of the street one of the three entered the alley leading to the house the one who marched at their head struck him as decidedly suspicious 
 come child he said to cosette and he made haste to quit the rue pontoise 
 he took a circuit turned into the passage des patriarches which was closed on account of the hour strode along the rue de and the rue de and plunged into the rue des postes 
 at that time there was a square formed by the intersection of streets where the college rollin stands and where the rue turns off 
 it is understood of course that the rue is an old street and that a does not pass through the rue des postes once in ten years 
 in the thirteenth century this rue des postes was inhabited by potters and its real name is rue des pots 
 the moon cast a livid light into this open space 
 jean valjean went into ambush in a doorway calculating that if the men were still following him he could not fail to get a good look at them as they traversed this illuminated space 
 in point of fact three minutes had not elapsed when the men made their appearance 
 there were four of them now 
 all were tall dressed in long brown coats with round hats and huge cudgels in their hands 
 their great stature and their vast fists rendered them no less alarming than did their sinister stride through the darkness one would have pronounced them four spectres disguised as bourgeois 
 they halted in the middle of the space and formed a group like men in consultation 
 they had an air of indecision 
 the one who appeared to be their leader turned round and pointed hastily with his right hand in the direction which jean valjean had taken another seemed to indicate the contrary direction with considerable obstinacy at the moment when the first man wheeled round the moon fell full in his face 
 jean valjean recognized javert perfectly

 book six 
 chapter v 
 
 while waiting for the announcement of his appointment to the committee prince andrew looked up his former acquaintances particularly those he knew to be in power and whose aid he might need in petersburg he now experienced the same feeling he had had on the eve of a battle when troubled by anxious curiosity and irresistibly attracted to the ruling circles where the future on which the fate of millions depended was being shaped from the irritation of the older men the curiosity of the uninitiated the reserve of the initiated the hurry and preoccupation of everyone and the innumerable committees and commissions of whose existence he learned every day he felt that now in here in petersburg a vast civil conflict was in preparation the commander in chief of which was a mysterious person he did not know but who was supposed to be a man of genius speranski and this movement of reconstruction of which prince andrew had a vague idea and speranski its chief promoter began to interest him so keenly that the question of the army regulations quickly receded to a secondary place in his consciousness 
 prince andrew was most favorably placed to secure good reception in the highest and most diverse petersburg circles of the day the reforming party cordially welcomed and courted him the first place because he was reputed to be clever and very well read and secondly because by liberating his serfs he had obtained the reputation of being a liberal the party of the old and dissatisfied who censured the innovations turned to him expecting his sympathy in their disapproval of the reforms simply because he was the son of his father the feminine society world welcomed him gladly because he was rich distinguished a good match and almost a newcomer with a halo of romance on account of his supposed death and the tragic loss of his wife besides this the general opinion of all who had known him previously was that he had greatly improved during these last five years having softened and grown more manly lost his former affectation pride and contemptuous irony and acquired the serenity that comes with years people talked about him were interested in him and wanted to meet him 
 the day after his interview with count arakcheev prince andrew spent the evening at count he told the count of his interview with sila andreevich kochubey spoke of arakcheev by that nickname with the same vague irony prince andrew had noticed in the minister of anteroom 
 mon cher even in this case you do without michael mikhaylovich speranski he manages everything speak to him he has promised to come this evening 
 what has speranski to do with the army regulations asked prince andrew 
 kochubey shook his head smilingly as if surprised at simplicity 
 we were talking to him about you a few days ago kochubey continued and about your freed plowmen 
 oh is it you prince who have freed your serfs said an old man of day turning contemptuously toward bolkonski 
 it was a small estate that brought in no profit replied prince andrew trying to extenuate his action so as not to irritate the old man uselessly 
 afraid of being late said the old man looking at kochubey 
 one thing i understand he continued who will plow the land if they are set free it is easy to write laws but difficult to rule just the same as now i ask you count who will be heads of the departments when everybody has to pass examinations 
 those who pass the examinations i suppose replied kochubey crossing his legs and glancing round 
 well i have pryanichnikov serving under me a splendid man a priceless man but sixty is he to go up for examination 
 yes a difficulty as education is not at all general but 
 count kochubey did not finish he rose took prince andrew by the arm and went to meet a tall bald fair man of about forty with a large open forehead and a long face of unusual and peculiar whiteness who was just entering the newcomer wore a blue coat with a cross suspended from his neck and a star on his left breast it was speranski prince andrew recognized him at once and felt a throb within him as happens at critical moments of life whether it was from respect envy or anticipation he did not know whole figure was of a peculiar type that made him easily recognizable in the society in which prince andrew lived he had never seen anyone who together with awkward and clumsy gestures possessed such calmness and he had never seen so resolute yet gentle an expression as that in those rather humid eyes or so firm a smile that expressed nothing nor had he heard such a refined smooth soft voice above all he had never seen such delicate whiteness of face or hands hands which were broad but very plump soft and white such whiteness and softness prince andrew had only seen on the faces of soldiers who had been long in hospital this was speranski secretary of state reporter to the emperor and his companion at erfurt where he had more than once met and talked with napoleon 
 speranski did not shift his eyes from one face to another as people involuntarily do on entering a large company and was in no hurry to speak he spoke slowly with assurance that he would be listened to and he looked only at the person with whom he was conversing 
 prince andrew followed every word and movement with particular attention as happens to some people especially to men who judge those near to them severely he always on meeting anyone new especially anyone whom like speranski he knew by reputation expected to discover in him the perfection of human qualities 
 speranski told kochubey he was sorry he had been unable to come sooner as he had been detained at the palace he did not say that the emperor had kept him and prince andrew noticed this affectation of modesty when kochubey introduced prince andrew speranski slowly turned his eyes to bolkonski with his customary smile and looked at him in silence 
 i am very glad to make your acquaintance i had heard of you as everyone has he said after a pause 
 kochubey said a few words about the reception arakcheev had given bolkonski speranski smiled more markedly 
 the chairman of the committee on army regulations is my good friend monsieur magnitski he said fully articulating every word and syllable and if you like i can put you in touch with him he paused at the full stop i hope you will find him sympathetic and ready to in promoting all that is reasonable 
 a circle soon formed round speranski and the old man who had talked about his subordinate pryanichnikov addressed a question to him 
 prince andrew without joining in the conversation watched every movement of this man not long since an insignificant divinity student who now bolkonski thought held in his hands those plump white hands the fate of russia prince andrew was struck by the extraordinarily disdainful composure with which speranski answered the old man he appeared to address condescending words to him from an immeasurable height when the old man began to speak too loud speranski smiled and said he could not judge of the advantage or disadvantage of what pleased the sovereign 
 having talked for a little while in the general circle speranski rose and coming up to prince andrew took him along to the other end of the room it was clear that he thought it necessary to interest himself in bolkonski 
 i had no chance to talk with you prince during the animated conversation in which that venerable gentleman involved me he said with a mildly contemptuous smile as if intimating by that smile that he and prince andrew understood the insignificance of the people with whom he had just been talking this flattered prince andrew i have known of you for a long time first from your action with regard to your serfs a first example of which it is very desirable that there should be more imitators and secondly because you are one of those gentlemen of the chamber who have not considered themselves offended by the new decree concerning the ranks allotted to courtiers which is causing so much gossip and 
 no said prince andrew my father did not wish me to take advantage of the privilege i began the service from the lower grade 
 your father a man of the last century evidently stands above our contemporaries who so condemn this measure which merely reestablishes natural justice 
 i think however that these condemnations have some ground returned prince andrew trying to resist influence of which he began to be conscious he did not like to agree with him in everything and felt a wish to contradict though he usually spoke easily and well he felt a difficulty in expressing himself now while talking with speranski he was too much absorbed in observing the famous personality 
 grounds of personal ambition maybe speranski put in quietly 
 and of state interest to some extent said prince andrew 
 what do you mean asked speranski quietly lowering his eyes 
 i am an admirer of montesquieu replied prince andrew and his idea that le principe des monarchies est me parait incontestable certains droits et privileges de la noblesse me paraissent etre des moyens de soutenir ce sentiment 
 the principle of monarchies is honor seems to me incontestable certain rights and privileges for the aristocracy appear to me a means of maintaining that sentiment 
 the smile vanished from white face which was much improved by the change probably prince thought interested him 
 si vous envisagez la question sous ce point de vue he began pronouncing french with evident difficulty and speaking even slower than in russian but quite calmly 
 if you regard the question from that point of view 
 speranski went on to say that honor cannot be upheld by privileges harmful to the service that honor is either a negative concept of not doing what is blameworthy or it is a source of emulation in pursuit of commendation and rewards which recognize it his arguments were concise simple and clear 
 an institution upholding honor the source of emulation is one similar to the legion of the great emperor napoleon not harmful but helpful to the success of the service but not a class or court privilege 
 i do not dispute that but it cannot be denied that court privileges have attained the same end returned prince andrew every courtier considers himself bound to maintain his position worthily 
 yet you do not care to avail yourself of the privilege prince said speranski indicating by a smile that he wished to finish amiably an argument which was embarrassing for his companion if you will do me the honor of calling on me on wednesday he added i will after talking with magnitski let you know what may interest you and shall also have the pleasure of a more detailed chat with you 
 closing his eyes he bowed a la francaise without taking leave and trying to attract as little attention as possible he left the room

 book six 
 chapter vi 
 
 during the first weeks of his stay in petersburg prince andrew felt the whole trend of thought he had formed during his life of seclusion quite overshadowed by the trifling cares that engrossed him in that city 
 on returning home in the evening he would jot down in his notebook four or five necessary calls or appointments for certain hours the mechanism of life the arrangement of the day so as to be in time everywhere absorbed the greater part of his vital energy he did nothing did not even think or find time to think but only talked and talked successfully of what he had thought while in the country 
 he sometimes noticed with dissatisfaction that he repeated the same remark on the same day in different circles but he was so busy for whole days together that he had no time to notice that he was thinking of nothing

 during the first period of their acquaintance bolkonski felt a passionate admiration for him similar to that which he had once felt for bonaparte the fact that speranski was the son of a village priest and that stupid people might meanly despise him on account of his humble origin as in fact many did caused prince andrew to cherish his sentiment for him the more and unconsciously to strengthen it 
 on that first evening bolkonski spent with him having mentioned the commission for the revision of the code of laws speranski told him sarcastically that the commission had existed for a hundred and fifty years had cost millions and had done nothing except that rosenkampf had stuck labels on the corresponding paragraphs of the different codes 
 and that is all the state has for the millions it has spent said he we want to give the senate new juridical powers but we have no laws that is why it is a sin for men like you prince not to serve in these times 
 prince andrew said that for that work an education in jurisprudence was needed which he did not possess 
 but nobody possesses it so what would you have it is a vicious circle from which we must break a way out 
 a week later prince andrew was a member of the committee on army regulations and what he had not at all expected was chairman of a section of the committee for the revision of the laws at request he took the first part of the civil code that was being drawn up and with the aid of the code napoleon and the institutes of justinian he worked at formulating the section on personal rights

 during the first weeks of his stay in petersburg prince andrew felt the whole trend of thought he had formed during his life of seclusion quite overshadowed by the trifling cares that engrossed him in that city 
 on returning home in the evening he would jot down in his notebook four or five necessary calls or appointments for certain hours the mechanism of life the arrangement of the day so as to be in time everywhere absorbed the greater part of his vital energy he did nothing did not even think or find time to think but only talked and talked successfully of what he had thought while in the country 
 he sometimes noticed with dissatisfaction that he repeated the same remark on the same day in different circles but he was so busy for whole days together that he had no time to notice that he was thinking of nothing

 chapter vii 
 
 nearly two years before this in pierre on returning to petersburg after visiting his estates had involuntarily found himself in a leading position among the petersburg freemasons he arranged dining and funeral lodge meetings enrolled new members and busied himself uniting various lodges and acquiring authentic charters he gave money for the erection of temples and supplemented as far as he could the collection of alms in regard to which the majority of members were stingy and irregular he supported almost singlehanded a poorhouse the order had founded in petersburg 
 his life meanwhile continued as before with the same infatuations and dissipations he liked to dine and drink well and though he considered it immoral and humiliating could not resist the temptations of the bachelor circles in which he moved 
 amid the turmoil of his activities and distractions however pierre at the end of a year began to feel that the more firmly he tried to rest upon it the more masonic ground on which he stood gave way under him at the same time he felt that the deeper the ground sank under him the closer bound he involuntarily became to the order when he had joined the freemasons he had experienced the feeling of one who confidently steps onto the smooth surface of a bog when he put his foot down it sank in to make quite sure of the firmness the ground he put his other foot down and sank deeper still became stuck in it and involuntarily waded in the bog 
 joseph alexeevich was not in petersburg he had of late stood aside from the affairs of the petersburg lodges and lived almost entirely in moscow all the members of the lodges were men pierre knew in ordinary life and it was difficult for him to regard them merely as brothers in freemasonry and not as prince b or ivan vasilevich d whom he knew in society mostly as weak and insignificant men under the masonic aprons and insignia he saw the uniforms and decorations at which they aimed in ordinary life often after collecting alms and reckoning up twenty to thirty rubles received for the most part in promises from a dozen members of whom half were as well able to pay as himself pierre remembered the masonic vow in which each brother promised to devote all his belongings to his neighbor and doubts on which he tried not to dwell arose in his soul 
 he divided the brothers he knew into four categories in the first he put those who did not take an active part in the affairs of the lodges or in human affairs but were exclusively occupied with the mystical science of the order with questions of the threefold designation of god the three primordial elements sulphur mercury and salt or the meaning of the square and all the various figures of the temple of solomon pierre respected this class of brothers to which the elder ones chiefly belonged including pierre thought joseph alexeevich himself but he did not share their interests his heart was not in the mystical aspect of freemasonry 
 in the second category pierre reckoned himself and others like him seeking and vacillating who had not yet found in freemasonry a straight and comprehensible path but hoped to do so 
 in the third category he included those brothers the majority who saw nothing in freemasonry but the external forms and ceremonies and prized the strict performance of these forms without troubling about their purport or significance such were willarski and even the grand master of the principal lodge 
 finally to the fourth category also a great many brothers belonged particularly those who had lately joined these according to observations were men who had no belief in anything nor desire for anything but joined the freemasons merely to associate with the wealthy young brothers who were influential through their connections or rank and of whom there were very many in the lodge 
 pierre began to feel dissatisfied with what he was doing freemasonry at any rate as he saw it here sometimes seemed to him based merely on externals he did not think of doubting freemasonry itself but suspected that russian masonry had taken a wrong path and deviated from its original principles and so toward the end of the year he went abroad to be initiated into the higher secrets of the order 
 in the summer of pierre returned to petersburg our freemasons knew from correspondence with those abroad that bezukhov had obtained the confidence of many highly placed persons had been initiated into many mysteries had been raised to a higher grade and was bringing back with him much that might conduce to the advantage of the masonic cause in russia the petersburg freemasons all came to see him tried to ingratiate themselves with him and it seemed to them all that he was preparing something for them and concealing it 
 a solemn meeting of the lodge of the second degree was convened at which pierre promised to communicate to the petersburg brothers what he had to deliver to them from the highest leaders of their order the meeting was a full one after the usual ceremonies pierre rose and began his address 
 dear brothers he began blushing and stammering with a written speech in his hand it is not sufficient to observe our mysteries in the seclusion of our lodge we must act act we are drowsing but we must act pierre raised his notebook and began to read 
 for the dissemination of pure truth and to secure the triumph of virtue he read we must cleanse men from prejudice diffuse principles in harmony with the spirit of the times undertake the education of the young unite ourselves in indissoluble bonds with the wisest men boldly yet prudently overcome superstitions infidelity and folly and form of those devoted to us a body linked together by unity of purpose and possessed of authority and power 
 to attain this end we must secure a preponderance of virtue over vice and must endeavor to secure that the honest man may even in this world receive a lasting reward for his virtue but in these great endeavors we are gravely hampered by the political institutions of today what is to be done in these circumstances to favor revolutions overthrow everything repel force by force no we are very far from that every violent reform deserves censure for it quite fails to remedy evil while men remain what they are and also because wisdom needs no violence 
 the whole plan of our order should be based on the idea of preparing men of firmness and virtue bound together by unity of conviction aiming at the punishment of vice and folly and patronizing talent and virtue raising worthy men from the dust and attaching them to our brotherhood only then will our order have the power unobtrusively to bind the hands of the protectors of disorder and to control them without their being aware of it in a word we must found a form of government holding universal sway which should be diffused over the whole world without destroying the bonds of citizenship and beside which all other governments can continue in their customary course and do everything except what impedes the great aim of our order which is to obtain for virtue the victory over vice this aim was that of christianity itself it taught men to be wise and good and for their own benefit to follow the example and instruction of the best and wisest men 
 at that time when everything was plunged in darkness preaching alone was of course sufficient the novelty of truth endowed her with special strength but now we need much more powerful methods it is now necessary that man governed by his senses should find in virtue a charm palpable to those senses it is impossible to eradicate the passions but we must strive to direct them to a noble aim and it is therefore necessary that everyone should be able to satisfy his passions within the limits of virtue our order should provide means to that end 
 as soon as we have a certain number of worthy men in every state each of them again training two others and all being closely united everything will be possible for our order which has already in secret accomplished much for the welfare of mankind 
 this speech not only made a strong impression but created excitement in the lodge the majority of the brothers seeing in it dangerous designs of illuminism met it with a coldness that surprised pierre the grand master began answering him and pierre began developing his views with more and more warmth it was long since there had been so stormy a meeting parties were formed some accusing pierre of illuminism others supporting him at that meeting he was struck for the first time by the endless variety of minds which prevents a truth from ever presenting itself identically to two persons even those members who seemed to be on his side understood him in their own way with limitations and alterations he could not agree to as what he always wanted most was to convey his thought to others just as he himself understood it 
 the illuminati sought to substitute republican for monarchical institutions 
 at the end of the meeting the grand master with irony and reproved bezukhov for his vehemence and said it was not love of virtue alone but also a love of strife that had moved him in the dispute pierre did not answer him and asked briefly whether his proposal would be accepted he was told that it would not and without waiting for the usual formalities he left the lodge and went home

 to attain this end we must secure a preponderance of virtue over vice and must endeavor to secure that the honest man may even in this world receive a lasting reward for his virtue but in these great endeavors we are gravely hampered by the political institutions of today what is to be done in these circumstances to favor revolutions overthrow everything repel force by force no we are very far from that every violent reform deserves censure for it quite fails to remedy evil while men remain what they are and also because wisdom needs no violence 
 the whole plan of our order should be based on the idea of preparing men of firmness and virtue bound together by unity of conviction aiming at the punishment of vice and folly and patronizing talent and virtue raising worthy men from the dust and attaching them to our brotherhood only then will our order have the power unobtrusively to bind the hands of the protectors of disorder and to control them without their being aware of it in a word we must found a form of government holding universal sway which should be diffused over the whole world without destroying the bonds of citizenship and beside which all other governments can continue in their customary course and do everything except what impedes the great aim of our order which is to obtain for virtue the victory over vice this aim was that of christianity itself it taught men to be wise and good and for their own benefit to follow the example and instruction of the best and wisest men 
 at that time when everything was plunged in darkness preaching alone was of course sufficient the novelty of truth endowed her with special strength but now we need much more powerful methods it is now necessary that man governed by his senses should find in virtue a charm palpable to those senses it is impossible to eradicate the passions but we must strive to direct them to a noble aim and it is therefore necessary that everyone should be able to satisfy his passions within the limits of virtue our order should provide means to that end 
 as soon as we have a certain number of worthy men in every state each of them again training two others and all being closely united everything will be possible for our order which has already in secret accomplished much for the welfare of mankind 
 this speech not only made a strong impression but created excitement in the lodge the majority of the brothers seeing in it dangerous designs of illuminism met it with a coldness that surprised pierre the grand master began answering him and pierre began developing his views with more and more warmth it was long since there had been so stormy a meeting parties were formed some accusing pierre of illuminism others supporting him at that meeting he was struck for the first time by the endless variety of minds which prevents a truth from ever presenting itself identically to two persons even those members who seemed to be on his side understood him in their own way with limitations and alterations he could not agree to as what he always wanted most was to convey his thought to others just as he himself understood it 
 the illuminati sought to substitute republican for monarchical institutions 
 at the end of the meeting the grand master with irony and reproved bezukhov for his vehemence and said it was not love of virtue alone but also a love of strife that had moved him in the dispute pierre did not answer him and asked briefly whether his proposal would be accepted he was told that it would not and without waiting for the usual formalities he left the lodge and went home

 lane was almost entirely bordered on the right as far as the rue by houses of mean aspect on the left by a solitary building of severe outlines composed of numerous parts which grew gradually higher by a story or two as they approached the rue side so that this building which was very lofty on the rue side was tolerably low on the side adjoining the rue polonceau

 this wall did not abut directly on the street it formed a deeply retreating niche concealed by its two corners 
 from two observers who might have been one in the rue polonceau the other in the rue 
 beginning with these angles of the niche the wall extended along the rue polonceau as far as a house which bore the number and along the rue where the fragment was much shorter as far as the gloomy building which we have mentioned and whose gable it intersected thus forming another retreating angle in the street this gable was sombre of aspect only one window was visible or to speak more correctly two shutters covered with a sheet of zinc and kept constantly closed 
 the state of the places of which we are here giving a description is rigorously exact and will certainly awaken a very precise memory in the mind of old inhabitants of the quarter 
 the niche was entirely filled by a thing which resembled a colossal and wretched door it was a vast formless assemblage of perpendicular planks the upper ones being broader than the lower bound together by long transverse strips of iron at one side there was a carriage gate of the ordinary dimensions and which had evidently not been cut more than fifty years previously

 in the central portion of the front of this building on the rue side there were at all the windows of the different stories ancient cistern pipes of lead 
 the various branches of the pipes which led from one central pipe to all these little basins sketched out a sort of tree on the front 
 these ramifications of pipes with their hundred elbows imitated those old leafless which writhe over the fronts of old 
 this odd espalier with its branches of lead and iron was the first thing that struck jean valjean 
 he seated cosette with her back against a stone post with an injunction to be silent and ran to the spot where the conduit touched the pavement perhaps there was some way of climbing up by it and entering the house but the pipe was dilapidated and past service and hardly hung to its fastenings 
 moreover all the windows of this silent dwelling were grated with heavy iron bars even the attic windows in the roof and then the moon fell full upon that facade and the man who was watching at the corner of the street would have seen jean valjean in the act of climbing

 again pierre was overtaken by the depression he so dreaded for three days after the delivery of his speech at the lodge he lay on a sofa at home receiving no one and going nowhere 
 it was just then that he received a letter from his wife who implored him to see her telling him how grieved she was about him and how she wished to devote her whole life to him 
 at the end of the letter she informed him that in a few days she would return to petersburg from abroad 
 following this letter one of the masonic brothers whom pierre respected less than the others forced his way in to see him and turning the conversation upon matrimonial affairs by way of fraternal advice expressed the opinion that his severity to his wife was wrong and that he was neglecting one of the first rules of freemasonry by not forgiving the penitent 
 at the same time his prince wife sent to him imploring him to come if only for a few minutes to discuss a most important matter pierre saw that there was a conspiracy against him and that they wanted to reunite him with his wife and in the mood he then was this was not even unpleasant to him nothing mattered to him nothing in life seemed to him of much importance and under the influence of the depression that possessed him he valued neither his liberty nor his resolution to punish his wife 
 no one is right and no one is to blame so she too is not to blame he thought 
 if he did not at once give his consent to a reunion with his wife it was only because in his state of depression he did not feel able to take any step had his wife come to him he would not have turned her away compared to what preoccupied him was it not a matter of indifference whether he lived with his wife or not

 which would be impossible with gas lanterns 
 at that moment a heavy and measured sound began to be audible at some distance 
 jean valjean risked a glance round the corner of the street 
 seven or eight soldiers drawn up in a platoon had just debouched into the rue polonceau 
 he saw the gleam of their bayonets 
 they were advancing towards him these soldiers at whose head he distinguished tall figure advanced slowly and cautiously 
 they halted frequently it was plain that they were searching all the nooks of the walls and all the embrasures of the doors and alleys 
 this was some patrol that javert had could be no mistake as to this whose aid he had demanded 
 two acolytes were marching in their ranks 
 at the rate at which they were marching and in consideration of the halts which they were making it would take them about a quarter of an hour to reach the spot where jean valjean stood it was a frightful moment 
 a few minutes only separated jean valjean from that terrible precipice which yawned before him for the third time 
 and the galleys now meant not only the galleys but cosette lost to him forever that is to say a life resembling the interior of a tomb 
 there was but one thing which was possible 
 jean valjean had this peculiarity that he carried as one might say two pouches 
 in one he kept his saintly thoughts in the other the redoubtable talents of a convict 
 he rummaged in the one or the other according to circumstances 
 among his other resources thanks to his numerous escapes from the prison at toulon he was as it will be remembered a past master in the incredible art of crawling up without ladder or by sheer muscular force by leaning on the nape of his neck his shoulders his hips and his knees by helping himself on the rare projections of the stone in the right angle of a wall as high as the sixth story if need be an art which has rendered so celebrated and so alarming that corner of the wall of the conciergerie of paris by which battemolle condemned to death made his escape twenty years ago 
 jean valjean measured with his eyes the wall above which he espied the linden it was about eighteen feet in height 
 the angle which it formed with the gable of the large building was filled at its lower extremity by a mass of masonry of a triangular shape probably intended to preserve that too convenient corner from the rubbish of those dirty creatures called the this practice of filling up corners of the wall is much in use in paris 
 this mass was about five feet in height the space above the summit of this mass which it was necessary to climb was not more than fourteen feet 
 the wall was surmounted by a flat stone without a coping 
 cosette was the difficulty for she did not know how to climb a wall should he abandon her 
 jean valjean did not once think of that it was impossible to carry her 
 a whole strength is required to successfully carry out these singular ascents 
 the least burden would disturb his centre of gravity and pull him downwards 
 a rope would have been required jean valjean had none 
 where was he to get a rope at midnight in the rue polonceau 
 certainly if jean valjean had had a kingdom he would have given it for a rope at that moment 
 all extreme situations have their lightning flashes which sometimes dazzle sometimes illuminate us 
 jean despairing glance fell on the street of the blind alley genrot 
 at that epoch there were no in the streets of paris at nightfall lanterns placed at regular distances were lighted they were ascended and descended by means of a rope which traversed the street from side to side and was adjusted in a groove of the post the pulley over which this rope ran was fastened underneath the lantern in a little iron box the key to which was kept by the and the rope itself was protected by a metal case 
 jean valjean with the energy of a supreme struggle crossed the street at one bound entered the blind alley broke the latch of the little box with the point of his knife and an instant later he was beside cosette once more 
 he had a rope 
 these gloomy inventors of expedients work rapidly when they are fighting against fatality 
 we have already explained that the lanterns had not been lighted that night 
 the lantern in the genrot was thus naturally extinct like the rest and one could pass directly under it without even noticing that it was no longer in its place 
 nevertheless the hour the place the darkness jean absorption his singular gestures his goings and comings all had begun to render cosette uneasy 
 any other child than she would have given vent to loud shrieks long before 
 she contented herself with plucking jean valjean by the skirt of his coat 
 they could hear the sound of the approach ever more and more distinctly 
 father said she in a very low voice i am afraid 
 who is coming yonder 
 hush replied the unhappy man it is madame thenardier 
 cosette shuddered 
 he added 
 say nothing 
 interfere with me 
 if you cry out if you weep the thenardier is lying in wait for you 
 she is coming to take you back 
 then without haste but without making a useless movement with firm and curt precision the more remarkable at a moment when the patrol and javert might come upon him at any moment he undid his cravat passed it round body under the armpits taking care that it should not hurt the child fastened this cravat to one end of the rope by means of that knot which seafaring men call a swallow knot took the other end of the rope in his teeth pulled off his shoes and stockings which he threw over the wall stepped upon the mass of masonry and began to raise himself in the angle of the wall and the gable with as much solidity and certainty as though he had the rounds of a ladder under his feet and elbows half a minute had not elapsed when he was resting on his knees on the wall 
 cosette gazed at him in stupid amazement without uttering a word jean injunction and the name of madame thenardier had chilled her blood 
 all at once she heard jean voice crying to her though in a very low tone 
 put your back against the wall 
 she obeyed 
 say a word and be alarmed went on jean valjean 
 and she felt herself lifted from the ground 
 before she had time to recover herself she was on the top of the wall 
 jean valjean grasped her put her on his back took her two tiny hands in his large left hand lay down flat on his stomach and crawled along on top of the wall as far as the cant 
 as he had guessed there stood a building whose roof started from the top of the wooden barricade and descended to within a very short distance of the ground with a gentle slope which grazed the a lucky circumstance 
 for the wall was much higher on this side than on the street side jean valjean could only see the ground at a great depth below him 
 he had just reached the slope of the roof and had not yet left the crest of the wall when a violent uproar announced the arrival of the patrol 
 the thundering voice of javert was audible 
 search the blind alley 
 the rue is guarded so is the rue answer for it that he is in the blind alley 
 the soldiers rushed into the genrot alley 
 jean valjean allowed himself to slide down the roof still holding fast to cosette reached the and leaped to the ground whether from terror or courage cosette had not breathed a sound though her hands were a little abraded

 certainly if jean valjean had had a kingdom he would have given it for a rope at that moment 
 all extreme situations have their lightning flashes which sometimes dazzle sometimes illuminate us 
 jean despairing glance fell on the street of the blind alley genrot 
 at that epoch there were no in the streets of paris at nightfall lanterns placed at regular distances were lighted they were ascended and descended by means of a rope which traversed the street from side to side and was adjusted in a groove of the post the pulley over which this rope ran was fastened underneath the lantern in a little iron box the key to which was kept by the and the rope itself was protected by a metal case 
 jean valjean with the energy of a supreme struggle crossed the street at one bound entered the blind alley broke the latch of the little box with the point of his knife and an instant later he was beside cosette once more 
 he had a rope 
 these gloomy inventors of expedients work rapidly when they are fighting against fatality 
 we have already explained that the lanterns had not been lighted that night 
 the lantern in the genrot was thus naturally extinct like the rest and one could pass directly under it without even noticing that it was no longer in its place 
 nevertheless the hour the place the darkness jean absorption his singular gestures his goings and comings all had begun to render cosette uneasy 
 any other child than she would have given vent to loud shrieks long before 
 she contented herself with plucking jean valjean by the skirt of his coat 
 they could hear the sound of the approach ever more and more distinctly 
 father said she in a very low voice i am afraid 
 who is coming yonder 
 hush replied the unhappy man it is madame thenardier 
 cosette shuddered 
 he added 
 say nothing 
 interfere with me 
 if you cry out if you weep the thenardier is lying in wait for you 
 she is coming to take you back 
 then without haste but without making a useless movement with firm and curt precision the more remarkable at a moment when the patrol and javert might come upon him at any moment he undid his cravat passed it round body under the armpits taking care that it should not hurt the child fastened this cravat to one end of the rope by means of that knot which seafaring men call a swallow knot took the other end of the rope in his teeth pulled off his shoes and stockings which he threw over the wall stepped upon the mass of masonry and began to raise himself in the angle of the wall and the gable with as much solidity and certainty as though he had the rounds of a ladder under his feet and elbows half a minute had not elapsed when he was resting on his knees on the wall 
 cosette gazed at him in stupid amazement without uttering a word jean injunction and the name of madame thenardier had chilled her blood 
 all at once she heard jean voice crying to her though in a very low tone 
 put your back against the wall 
 she obeyed 
 say a word and be alarmed went on jean valjean 
 and she felt herself lifted from the ground 
 before she had time to recover herself she was on the top of the wall 
 jean valjean grasped her put her on his back took her two tiny hands in his large left hand lay down flat on his stomach and crawled along on top of the wall as far as the cant 
 as he had guessed there stood a building whose roof started from the top of the wooden barricade and descended to within a very short distance of the ground with a gentle slope which grazed the a lucky circumstance 
 for the wall was much higher on this side than on the street side jean valjean could only see the ground at a great depth below him 
 he had just reached the slope of the roof and had not yet left the crest of the wall when a violent uproar announced the arrival of the patrol 
 the thundering voice of javert was audible 
 search the blind alley 
 the rue is guarded so is the rue answer for it that he is in the blind alley 
 the soldiers rushed into the genrot alley 
 jean valjean allowed himself to slide down the roof still holding fast to cosette reached the and leaped to the ground whether from terror or courage cosette had not breathed a sound though her hands were a little abraded

 the beginning of an enigma 
 jean valjean found himself in a sort of garden which was very vast and of singular aspect one of those melancholy gardens which seem made to be looked at in winter and at night 
 this garden was oblong in shape with an alley of large poplars at the further end tolerably tall forest trees in the corners and an unshaded space in the centre where could be seen a very large solitary tree then several gnarled and bristling like bushes beds of vegetables a melon patch whose glass frames sparkled in the moonlight and an old well here and there stood stone benches which seemed black with moss the alleys were bordered with gloomy and very erect little shrubs the grass had half taken possession of them and a green mould covered the rest 
 jean valjean had beside him the building whose roof had served him as a means of descent a pile of fagots and behind the fagots directly against the wall a stone statue whose mutilated face was no longer anything more than a shapeless mask which loomed vaguely through the gloom 
 the building was a sort of ruin where dismantled chambers were distinguishable one of which much encumbered seemed to serve as a shed 
 the large building of the rue which had a wing on the rue turned two facades at right angles towards this garden these interior facades were even more tragic than the exterior all the windows were grated 
 not a gleam of light was visible at any one of them 
 the upper story had scuttles like prisons one of those facades cast its shadow on the other which fell over the garden like an immense black pall 
 no other house was visible 
 the bottom of the garden was lost in mist and darkness 
 nevertheless walls could be confusedly made out which intersected as though there were more cultivated land beyond and the low roofs of the rue polonceau 
 nothing more wild and solitary than this garden could be imagined there was no one in it which was quite natural in view of the hour but it did not seem as though this spot were made for any one to walk in even in broad daylight 
 jean first care had been to get hold of his shoes and put them on again then to step under the shed with cosette a man who is fleeing never thinks himself sufficiently hidden the child whose thoughts were still on the thenardier shared his instinct for withdrawing from sight as much as possible 
 cosette trembled and pressed close to him 
 they heard the tumultuous noise of the patrol searching the blind alley and the streets the blows of their against the stones appeals to the police spies whom he had posted and his imprecations mingled with words which could not be distinguished 
 at the expiration of a quarter of an hour it seemed as though that species of stormy roar were becoming more distant 
 jean valjean held his breath 
 he had laid his hand lightly on mouth 
 however the solitude in which he stood was so strangely calm that this frightful uproar close and furious as it was did not disturb him by so much as the shadow of a misgiving it seemed as though those walls had been built of the deaf stones of which the scriptures speak 
 all at once in the midst of this profound calm a fresh sound arose a sound as celestial divine ineffable ravishing as the other had been horrible 
 it was a hymn which issued from the gloom a dazzling burst of prayer and harmony in the obscure and alarming silence of the night voices but voices composed at one and the same time of the pure accents of virgins and the innocent accents of children voices which are not of the earth and which resemble those that the newborn infant still hears and which the dying man hears already this song proceeded from the gloomy edifice which towered above the garden 
 at the moment when the hubbub of demons retreated one would have said that a choir of angels was approaching through the gloom 
 cosette and jean valjean fell on their knees 
 they knew not what it was they knew not where they were but both of them the man and the child the penitent and the innocent felt that they must kneel 
 these voices had this strange characteristic that they did not prevent the building from seeming to be deserted it was a supernatural chant in an uninhabited house 
 while these voices were singing jean valjean thought of nothing he no longer beheld the night he beheld a blue sky 
 it seemed to him that he felt those wings which we all have within us unfolding 
 the song died away 
 it may have lasted a long time 
 jean valjean could not have told 
 hours of ecstasy are never more than a moment 
 all fell silent again 
 there was no longer anything in the street there was nothing in the garden 
 that which had menaced that which had reassured had vanished 
 the breeze swayed a few dry weeds on the crest of the wall and they gave out a faint sweet melancholy sound

 after this three pages were left blank in the diary and then the following was written 
 i have had a long and instructive talk alone with brother v who advised me to hold fast by brother a though i am unworthy much was revealed to me adonai is the name of the creator of the world elohim is the name of the ruler of all the third name is the name unutterable which means the all talks with brother v strengthen refresh and support me in the path of virtue in his presence doubt has no place the distinction between the poor teachings of mundane science and our sacred teaching is clear to me human sciences dissect everything to comprehend it and kill everything to examine it in the holy science of our order all is one all is known in its entirety and life the trinity the three elements of matter are sulphur mercury and salt sulphur is of an oily and fiery nature in combination with salt by its fiery nature it arouses a desire in the latter by means of which it attracts mercury seizes it holds it and in combination produces other bodies mercury is a fluid volatile spiritual essence christ the holy spirit him 
 rd december 
 awoke late read the scriptures but was apathetic afterwards went and paced up and down the large hall i wished to meditate but instead my imagination pictured an occurrence of four years ago when dolokhov meeting me in moscow after our duel said he hoped i was enjoying perfect peace of mind in spite of my absence at the time i gave him no answer now i recalled every detail of that meeting and in my mind gave him the most malevolent and bitter replies i recollected myself and drove away that thought only when i found myself glowing with anger but i did not sufficiently repent afterwards boris drubetskoy came and began relating various adventures his coming vexed me from the first and i said something disagreeable to him he replied i flared up and said much that was unpleasant and even rude to him he became silent and i recollected myself only when it was too late my god i cannot get on with him at all the cause of this is my egotism i set myself above him and so become much worse than he for he is lenient to my rudeness while i on the contrary nourish contempt for him o god grant that in his presence i may rather see my own vileness and behave so that he too may benefit after dinner i fell asleep and as i was drowsing off i clearly heard a voice saying in my left ear thy day 
 i dreamed that i was walking in the dark and was suddenly surrounded by dogs but i went on undismayed suddenly a smallish dog seized my left thigh with its teeth and would not let go i began to throttle it with my hands scarcely had i torn it off before another a bigger one began biting me i lifted it up but the higher i lifted it the bigger and heavier it grew and suddenly brother a came and taking my arm led me to a building to enter which we had to pass along a narrow plank i stepped on it but it bent and gave way and i began to clamber up a fence which i could scarcely reach with my hands after much effort i dragged myself up so that my leg hung down on one side and my body on the other i looked round and saw brother a standing on the fence and pointing me to a broad avenue and garden and in the garden was a large and beautiful building i woke up o lord great architect of nature help me to tear from myself these dogs my passions especially the last which unites in itself the strength of all the former ones and aid me to enter that temple of virtue to a vision of which i attained in my dream 
 th december 
 i dreamed that joseph alexeevich was sitting in my house and that i was very glad and wished to entertain him it seemed as if i chattered incessantly with other people and suddenly remembered that this could not please him and i wished to come close to him and embrace him but as soon as i drew near i saw that his face had changed and grown young and he was quietly telling me something about the teaching of our order but so softly that i could not hear it then it seemed that we all left the room and something strange happened we were sitting or lying on the floor he was telling me something and i wished to show him my sensibility and not listening to what he was saying i began picturing to myself the condition of my inner man and the grace of god sanctifying me and tears came into my eyes and i was glad he noticed this but be looked at me with vexation and jumped up breaking off his remarks i felt abashed and asked whether what he had been saying did not concern me but he did not reply gave me a kind look and then we suddenly found ourselves in my bedroom where there is a double bed he lay down on the edge of it and i burned with longing to caress him and lie down too and he said tell me frankly what is your chief temptation do you know it i think you know it already abashed by this question i replied that sloth was my chief temptation he shook his head incredulously and even more abashed i said that though i was living with my wife as he advised i was not living with her as her husband to this he replied that one should not deprive a wife of embraces and gave me to understand that that was my duty but i replied that i should be ashamed to do it and suddenly everything vanished and i awoke and found in my mind the text from the gospel the life was the light of men and the light shineth in darkness and the darkness comprehended it not joseph face had looked young and bright that day i received a letter from my benefactor in which he wrote about conjugal duties 
 th december 
 i had a dream from which i awoke with a throbbing heart i saw that i was in moscow in my house in the big sitting room and joseph alexeevich came in from the drawing room i seemed to know at once that the process of regeneration had already taken place in him and i rushed to meet him i embraced him and kissed his hands and he said hast thou noticed that my face is different i looked at him still holding him in my arms and saw that his face was young but that he had no hair on his head and his features were quite changed and i said i should have known you had i met you by chance and i thought to myself am i telling the truth and suddenly i saw him lying like a dead body then he gradually recovered and went with me into my study carrying a large book of sheets of drawing paper i said i drew that and he answered by bowing his head i opened the book and on all the pages there were excellent drawings and in my dream i knew that these drawings represented the love adventures of the soul with its beloved and on its pages i saw a beautiful representation of a maiden in transparent garments and with a transparent body flying up to the clouds and i seemed to know that this maiden was nothing else than a representation of the song of songs and looking at those drawings i dreamed i felt that i was doing wrong but could not tear myself away from them lord help me my god if thy forsaking me is thy doing thy will be done but if i am myself the cause teach me what i should do i shall perish of my debauchery if thou utterly desertest me

 i have had a long and instructive talk alone with brother v who advised me to hold fast by brother a though i am unworthy much was revealed to me adonai is the name of the creator of the world elohim is the name of the ruler of all the third name is the name unutterable which means the all talks with brother v strengthen refresh and support me in the path of virtue in his presence doubt has no place the distinction between the poor teachings of mundane science and our sacred teaching is clear to me human sciences dissect everything to comprehend it and kill everything to examine it in the holy science of our order all is one all is known in its entirety and life the trinity the three elements of matter are sulphur mercury and salt sulphur is of an oily and fiery nature in combination with salt by its fiery nature it arouses a desire in the latter by means of which it attracts mercury seizes it holds it and in combination produces other bodies mercury is a fluid volatile spiritual essence christ the holy spirit him

 awoke late read the scriptures but was apathetic afterwards went and paced up and down the large hall i wished to meditate but instead my imagination pictured an occurrence of four years ago when dolokhov meeting me in moscow after our duel said he hoped i was enjoying perfect peace of mind in spite of my absence at the time i gave him no answer now i recalled every detail of that meeting and in my mind gave him the most malevolent and bitter replies i recollected myself and drove away that thought only when i found myself glowing with anger but i did not sufficiently repent afterwards boris drubetskoy came and began relating various adventures his coming vexed me from the first and i said something disagreeable to him he replied i flared up and said much that was unpleasant and even rude to him he became silent and i recollected myself only when it was too late my god i cannot get on with him at all the cause of this is my egotism i set myself above him and so become much worse than he for he is lenient to my rudeness while i on the contrary nourish contempt for him o god grant that in his presence i may rather see my own vileness and behave so that he too may benefit after dinner i fell asleep and as i was drowsing off i clearly heard a voice saying in my left ear thy day 
 i dreamed that i was walking in the dark and was suddenly surrounded by dogs but i went on undismayed suddenly a smallish dog seized my left thigh with its teeth and would not let go i began to throttle it with my hands scarcely had i torn it off before another a bigger one began biting me i lifted it up but the higher i lifted it the bigger and heavier it grew and suddenly brother a came and taking my arm led me to a building to enter which we had to pass along a narrow plank i stepped on it but it bent and gave way and i began to clamber up a fence which i could scarcely reach with my hands after much effort i dragged myself up so that my leg hung down on one side and my body on the other i looked round and saw brother a standing on the fence and pointing me to a broad avenue and garden and in the garden was a large and beautiful building i woke up o lord great architect of nature help me to tear from myself these dogs my passions especially the last which unites in itself the strength of all the former ones and aid me to enter that temple of virtue to a vision of which i attained in my dream

 i dreamed that joseph alexeevich was sitting in my house and that i was very glad and wished to entertain him it seemed as if i chattered incessantly with other people and suddenly remembered that this could not please him and i wished to come close to him and embrace him but as soon as i drew near i saw that his face had changed and grown young and he was quietly telling me something about the teaching of our order but so softly that i could not hear it then it seemed that we all left the room and something strange happened we were sitting or lying on the floor he was telling me something and i wished to show him my sensibility and not listening to what he was saying i began picturing to myself the condition of my inner man and the grace of god sanctifying me and tears came into my eyes and i was glad he noticed this but be looked at me with vexation and jumped up breaking off his remarks i felt abashed and asked whether what he had been saying did not concern me but he did not reply gave me a kind look and then we suddenly found ourselves in my bedroom where there is a double bed he lay down on the edge of it and i burned with longing to caress him and lie down too and he said tell me frankly what is your chief temptation do you know it i think you know it already abashed by this question i replied that sloth was my chief temptation he shook his head incredulously and even more abashed i said that though i was living with my wife as he advised i was not living with her as her husband to this he replied that one should not deprive a wife of embraces and gave me to understand that that was my duty but i replied that i should be ashamed to do it and suddenly everything vanished and i awoke and found in my mind the text from the gospel the life was the light of men and the light shineth in darkness and the darkness comprehended it not joseph face had looked young and bright that day i received a letter from my benefactor in which he wrote about conjugal duties 
 th december 
 i had a dream from which i awoke with a throbbing heart i saw that i was in moscow in my house in the big sitting room and joseph alexeevich came in from the drawing room i seemed to know at once that the process of regeneration had already taken place in him and i rushed to meet him i embraced him and kissed his hands and he said hast thou noticed that my face is different i looked at him still holding him in my arms and saw that his face was young but that he had no hair on his head and his features were quite changed and i said i should have known you had i met you by chance and i thought to myself am i telling the truth and suddenly i saw him lying like a dead body then he gradually recovered and went with me into my study carrying a large book of sheets of drawing paper i said i drew that and he answered by bowing his head i opened the book and on all the pages there were excellent drawings and in my dream i knew that these drawings represented the love adventures of the soul with its beloved and on its pages i saw a beautiful representation of a maiden in transparent garments and with a transparent body flying up to the clouds and i seemed to know that this maiden was nothing else than a representation of the song of songs and looking at those drawings i dreamed i felt that i was doing wrong but could not tear myself away from them lord help me my god if thy forsaking me is thy doing thy will be done but if i am myself the cause teach me what i should do i shall perish of my debauchery if thou utterly desertest me

 poor cosette said nothing as she had seated herself beside him and leaned her head against him jean valjean had fancied that she was asleep 
 he bent down and looked at her 
 eyes were wide open and her thoughtful air pained jean valjean 
 she was still trembling 
 are you sleepy said jean valjean 
 i am very cold she replied

 the goodman took off his coat and wrapped it round cosette 
 are you less cold now said he 
 oh yes father 
 well wait for me a moment 
 i will soon be back 
 he quitted the ruin and crept along the large building seeking a better shelter 
 he came across doors but they were closed there were bars at all the windows of the ground floor 
 just after he had turned the inner angle of the edifice he observed that he was coming to some arched windows where he perceived a light he stood on tiptoe and peeped through one of these windows they all opened on a tolerably vast hall paved with large flagstones cut up by arcades and pillars where only a tiny light and great shadows were visible 
 the light came from a taper which was burning in one corner 
 the apartment was deserted and nothing was stirring in it 
 nevertheless by dint of gazing intently he thought he perceived on the ground something which appeared to be covered with a and which resembled a human form this form was lying face downward flat on the pavement with the arms extended in the form of a cross in the immobility of death one would have said judging from a sort of serpent which undulated over the floor that this sinister form had a rope round its neck 
 the whole chamber was bathed in that mist of places which are sparely illuminated which adds to horror 
 jean valjean often said afterwards that although many funereal spectres had crossed his path in life he had never beheld anything more and terrible than that enigmatical form accomplishing some inexplicable mystery in that gloomy place and beheld thus at night 
 it was alarming to suppose that that thing was perhaps dead and still more alarming to think that it was perhaps alive 
 he had the courage to plaster his face to the glass and to watch whether the thing would move 
 in spite of his remaining thus what seemed to him a very long time the outstretched form made no movement all at once he felt himself overpowered by an inexpressible terror and he fled 
 he began to run towards the shed not daring to look behind him 
 it seemed to him that if he turned his head he should see that form following him with great strides and waving its arms

 the rostovs monetary affairs had not improved during the two years they had spent in the country 
 though nicholas rostov had kept firmly to his resolution and was still serving modestly in an obscure regiment spending comparatively little the way of life at otradnoe management of affairs in particular was such that the debts inevitably increased every year the only resource obviously presenting itself to the old count was to apply for an official post so he had come to petersburg to look for one and also as he said to let the lassies enjoy themselves for the last time 
 soon after their arrival in petersburg berg proposed to vera and was accepted 
 though in moscow the rostovs belonged to the best society without themselves giving it a thought yet in petersburg their circle of acquaintances was a mixed and indefinite one in petersburg they were provincials and the very people they had entertained in moscow without inquiring to what set they belonged here looked down on them 
 the rostovs lived in the same hospitable way in petersburg as in moscow and the most diverse people met at their suppers country neighbors from otradnoe impoverished old squires and their daughters peronskaya a maid of honor pierre bezukhov and the son of their district postmaster who had obtained a post in petersburg among the men who very soon became frequent visitors at the rostovs house in petersburg were boris pierre whom the count had met in the street and dragged home with him and berg who spent whole days at the rostovs and paid the eldest daughter countess vera the attentions a young man pays when he intends to propose 
 not in vain had berg shown everybody his right hand wounded at austerlitz and held a perfectly unnecessary sword in his left he narrated that episode so persistently and with so important an air that everyone believed in the merit and usefulness of his deed and he had obtained two decorations for austerlitz 
 in the finnish war he also managed to distinguish himself he had picked up the scrap of a grenade that had killed an standing near the commander in chief and had taken it to his commander just as he had done after austerlitz he related this occurrence at such length and so insistently that everyone again believed it had been necessary to do this and he received two decorations for the finnish war also in he was a captain in the guards wore medals and held some special lucrative posts in petersburg 
 though some skeptics smiled when told of merits it could not be denied that he was a painstaking and brave officer on excellent terms with his superiors and a moral young man with a brilliant career before him and an assured position in society 
 four years before meeting a german comrade in the stalls of a moscow theater berg had pointed out vera rostova to him and had said in german das soll mein weib werden and from that moment had made up his mind to marry her now in petersburg having considered the rostovs position and his own he decided that the time had come to propose 
 that girl shall be my wife 
 proposal was at first received with a perplexity that was not flattering to him at first it seemed strange that the son of an obscure livonian gentleman should propose marriage to a countess rostova but chief characteristic was such a naive and good natured egotism that the rostovs involuntarily came to think it would be a good thing since he himself was so firmly convinced that it was good indeed excellent moreover the rostovs affairs were seriously embarrassed as the suitor could not but know and above all vera was had been taken out everywhere and though she was certainly and sensible no one up to now had proposed to her so they gave their consent 
 you see said berg to his comrade whom he called friend only because he knew that everyone has friends you see i have considered it all and should not marry if i had not thought it all out or if it were in any way unsuitable but on the contrary my papa and mamma are now provided for i have arranged that rent for them in the baltic provinces and i can live in petersburg on my pay and with her fortune and my good management we can get along nicely i am not marrying for money i consider that dishonorable but a wife should bring her share and a husband his i have my position in the service she has connections and some means in our times that is worth something it but above all she is a handsome estimable girl and she loves me 
 berg blushed and smiled 
 and i love her because her character is sensible and very good now the other sister though they are the same family is quite different an unpleasant character and has not the same intelligence she is so you know unpleasant but my fiancee well you will be coming he was going to say to dine but changed his mind and said to take tea with us and quickly doubling up his tongue he blew a small round ring of tobacco smoke perfectly embodying his dream of happiness 
 after the first feeling of perplexity aroused in the parents by proposal the holiday tone of joyousness usual at such times took possession of the family but the rejoicing was external and insincere in the feeling toward this wedding a certain awkwardness and constraint was evident as if they were ashamed of not having loved vera sufficiently and of being so ready to get her off their hands the old count felt this most he would probably have been unable to state the cause of his embarrassment but it resulted from the state of his affairs he did not know at all how much he had what his debts amounted to or what dowry he could give vera when his daughters were born he had assigned to each of them for her dowry an estate with three hundred serfs but one of these estates had already been sold and the other was mortgaged and the interest so much in arrears that it would have to be sold so that it was impossible to give it to vera nor had he any money 
 berg had already been engaged a month and only a week remained before the wedding but the count had not yet decided in his own mind the question of the dowry nor spoken to his wife about it at one time the count thought of giving her the ryazan estate or of selling a forest at another time of borrowing money on a note of hand a few days before the wedding berg entered the study early one morning and with a pleasant smile respectfully asked his future to let him know what dowry would be the count was so disconcerted by this inquiry that without consideration he gave the first reply that came into his head i like your being businesslike about it i like it you shall be satisfied 
 and patting berg on the shoulder he got up wishing to end the conversation but berg smiling pleasantly explained that if he did not know for certain how much vera would have and did not receive at least part of the dowry in advance he would have to break matters off 
 because consider count if i allowed myself to marry now without having definite means to maintain my wife i should be acting badly 
 the conversation ended by the count who wished to be generous and to avoid further importunity saying that he would give a note of hand for eighty thousand rubles berg smiled meekly kissed the count on the shoulder and said that he was very grateful but that it was impossible for him to arrange his new life without receiving thirty thousand in ready money or at least twenty thousand count he added and then a note of hand for only sixty thousand 
 yes yes all right said the count hurriedly only excuse me my dear fellow give you twenty thousand and a note of hand for eighty thousand as well yes yes kiss me

 book a black hunt a mute pack 
 chapter viii 
 
 the enigma becomes doubly mysterious 
 the child had laid her head on a stone and fallen asleep 
 he sat down beside her and began to think 
 little by little as he gazed at her he grew calm and regained possession of his freedom of mind 
 he clearly perceived this truth the foundation of his life henceforth that so long as she was there so long as he had her near him he should need nothing except for her he should fear nothing except for her 
 he was not even conscious that he was very cold since he had taken off his coat to cover her 
 nevertheless athwart this revery into which he had fallen he had heard for some time a peculiar noise 
 it was like the tinkling of a bell 
 this sound proceeded from the garden 
 it could be heard distinctly though faintly 
 it resembled the faint vague music produced by the bells of cattle at night in the pastures 
 this noise made valjean turn round 
 he looked and saw that there was some one in the garden 
 a being resembling a man was walking amid the of the melon beds rising stooping halting with regular movements as though he were dragging or spreading out something on the ground this person appeared to limp 
 jean valjean shuddered with the continual tremor of the unhappy for them everything is hostile and suspicious 
 they distrust the day because it enables people to see them and the night because it aids in surprising them 
 a little while before he had shivered because the garden was deserted and now he shivered because there was some one there 
 he fell back from chimerical terrors to real terrors 
 he said to himself that javert and the spies had perhaps not taken their departure that they had no doubt left people on the watch in the street that if this man should discover him in the garden he would cry out for help against thieves and deliver him up he took the sleeping cosette gently in his arms and carried her behind a heap of old furniture which was out of use in the most remote corner of the shed 
 cosette did not stir 
 from that point he scrutinized the appearance of the being in the melon patch 
 the strange thing about it was that the sound of the bell followed each of this movements 
 when the man approached the sound approached when the man retreated the sound retreated if he made any hasty gesture a tremolo accompanied the gesture when he halted the sound ceased 
 it appeared evident that the bell was attached to that man but what could that signify who was this man who had a bell suspended about him like a ram or an ox 
 as he put these questions to himself he touched hands they were icy cold 
 ah good god he cried 
 he spoke to her in a low voice 
 cosette 
 she did not open her eyes 
 he shook her vigorously 
 she did not wake 
 is she dead he said to himself and sprang to his feet quivering from head to foot 
 the most frightful thoughts rushed through his mind there are moments when hideous surmises assail us like a cohort of furies and violently force the partitions of our brains when those we love are in question our prudence invents every sort of madness 
 he remembered that sleep in the open air on a cold night may be fatal 
 cosette was pale and had fallen at full length on the ground at his feet without a movement 
 he listened to her breathing 
 she still breathed but with a respiration which seemed to him weak and on the point of extinction 
 how was he to warm her back to life 
 how was he to rouse her all that was not connected with this vanished from his thoughts he rushed wildly from the ruin 
 it was absolutely necessary that cosette should be in bed and beside a fire in less than a quarter of an hour

 he said to himself that javert and the spies had perhaps not taken their departure that they had no doubt left people on the watch in the street that if this man should discover him in the garden he would cry out for help against thieves and deliver him up he took the sleeping cosette gently in his arms and carried her behind a heap of old furniture which was out of use in the most remote corner of the shed 
 cosette did not stir 
 from that point he scrutinized the appearance of the being in the melon patch 
 the strange thing about it was that the sound of the bell followed each of this movements 
 when the man approached the sound approached when the man retreated the sound retreated if he made any hasty gesture a tremolo accompanied the gesture when he halted the sound ceased 
 it appeared evident that the bell was attached to that man but what could that signify who was this man who had a bell suspended about him like a ram or an ox 
 as he put these questions to himself he touched hands they were icy cold 
 ah good god he cried 
 he spoke to her in a low voice 
 cosette 
 she did not open her eyes 
 he shook her vigorously 
 she did not wake 
 is she dead he said to himself and sprang to his feet quivering from head to foot 
 the most frightful thoughts rushed through his mind there are moments when hideous surmises assail us like a cohort of furies and violently force the partitions of our brains when those we love are in question our prudence invents every sort of madness 
 he remembered that sleep in the open air on a cold night may be fatal 
 cosette was pale and had fallen at full length on the ground at his feet without a movement 
 he listened to her breathing 
 she still breathed but with a respiration which seemed to him weak and on the point of extinction 
 how was he to warm her back to life 
 how was he to rouse her all that was not connected with this vanished from his thoughts he rushed wildly from the ruin 
 it was absolutely necessary that cosette should be in bed and beside a fire in less than a quarter of an hour

 natasha was sixteen and it was the year the very year to which she had counted on her fingers with boris after they had kissed four years ago since then she had not seen him before sonya and her mother if boris happened to be mentioned she spoke quite freely of that episode as of some childish matter that was not worth mentioning but in the secret depths of her soul the question whether her engagement to boris was a jest or an important binding promise tormented her 
 since boris left moscow in to join the army he had had not seen the rostovs he had been in moscow several times and had passed near otradnoe but had never been to see them 
 sometimes it occurred to natasha that he not wish to see her and this conjecture was confirmed by the sad tone in which her elders spoke of him 
 nowadays old friends are not remembered the countess would say when boris was mentioned 
 anna mikhaylovna also had of late visited them less frequently seemed to hold herself with particular dignity and always spoke rapturously and gratefully of the merits of her son and the brilliant career on which he had entered when the rostovs came to petersburg boris called on them 
 he drove to their house in some agitation the memory of natasha was his most poetic recollection but he went with the firm intention of letting her and her parents feel that the childish relations between himself and natasha could not be binding either on her or on him he had a brilliant position in society thanks to his intimacy with countess bezukhova a brilliant position in the service thanks to the patronage of an important personage whose complete confidence he enjoyed and he was beginning to make plans for marrying one of the richest heiresses in petersburg plans which might very easily be realized when he entered the rostovs drawing room natasha was in her own room when she heard of his arrival she almost ran into the drawing room flushed and beaming with a more than cordial smile 
 boris remembered natasha in a short dress with dark eyes shining from under her curls and boisterous childish laughter as he had known her four years before and so he was taken aback when quite a different natasha entered and his face expressed rapturous astonishment this expression on his face pleased natasha 
 well do you recognize your little madcap playmate asked the countess 
 boris kissed hand and said that he was astonished at the change in her 
 how handsome you have grown 
 i should think so replied laughing eyes 
 and is papa older she asked 
 natasha sat down and without joining in boris conversation with the countess silently and minutely studied her suitor he felt the weight of that resolute and affectionate scrutiny and glanced at her occasionally 
 boris uniform spurs tie and the way his hair was brushed were all comme il faut and in the latest fashion this natasha noticed at once he sat rather sideways in the armchair next to the countess arranging with his right hand the cleanest of gloves that fitted his left hand like a skin and he spoke with a particularly refined compression of his lips about the amusements of the highest petersburg society recalling with mild irony old times in moscow and moscow acquaintances it was not accidentally natasha felt that he alluded when speaking of the highest aristocracy to an ball he had attended and to invitations he had received from and 
 all this time natasha sat silent glancing up at him from under her brows this gaze disturbed and confused boris more and more he looked round more frequently toward her and broke off in what he was saying he did not stay more than ten minutes then rose and took his leave the same inquisitive challenging and rather mocking eyes still looked at him after his first visit boris said to himself that natasha attracted him just as much as ever but that he must not yield to that feeling because to marry her a girl almost without fortune would mean ruin to his career while to renew their former relations without intending to marry her would be dishonorable boris made up his mind to avoid meeting natasha but despite that resolution he called again a few days later and began calling often and spending whole days at the rostovs it seemed to him that he ought to have an explanation with natasha and tell her that the old times must be forgotten that in spite of everything she could not be his wife that he had no means and they would never let her marry him but he failed to do so and felt awkward about entering on such an explanation from day to day he became more and more entangled it seemed to her mother and sonya that natasha was in love with boris as of old she sang him his favorite songs showed him her album making him write in it did not allow him to allude to the past letting it be understood how was the present and every day he went away in a fog without having said what he meant to and not knowing what he was doing or why he came or how it would all end he left off visiting helene and received reproachful notes from her every day and yet he continued to spend whole days with the rostovs

 the man with the bell 
 he walked straight up to the man whom he saw in the garden he had taken in his hand the roll of silver which was in the pocket of his waistcoat 
 the head was bent down and he did not see him approaching in a few strides jean valjean stood beside him 
 jean valjean accosted him with the cry 
 one hundred francs 
 the man gave a start and raised his eyes 
 you can earn a hundred francs went on jean valjean if you will grant me shelter for this night 
 the moon shone full upon jean terrified countenance 
 what so it is you father madeleine said the man 
 that name thus pronounced at that obscure hour in that unknown spot by that strange man made jean valjean start back 
 he had expected anything but that 
 the person who thus addressed him was a bent and lame old man dressed almost like a peasant who wore on his left knee a leather whence hung a moderately large bell 
 his face which was in the shadow was not distinguishable 
 however the goodman had removed his cap and exclaimed trembling all over 
 ah good god 
 how come you here father madeleine 
 where did you enter 
 did you fall from heaven 
 there is no trouble about that 
 if ever you do fall it will be from there and what a state you are in 
 you have no cravat you have no hat you have no coat 
 do you know you would have frightened any one who did not know you 
 no coat 
 lord god 
 are the saints going mad nowadays 
 but how did you get in here 
 his words tumbled over each other 
 the goodman talked with a rustic volubility in which there was nothing alarming 
 all this was uttered with a mixture of stupefaction and naive kindliness 
 who are you and what house is this demanded jean valjean 
 ah pardieu this is too much exclaimed the old man i am the person for whom you got the place here and this house is the one where you had me placed 
 what 
 you recognize me 
 no said jean valjean and how happens it that you know me 
 you saved my life said the man 
 he turned 
 a ray of moonlight outlined his profile and jean valjean recognized old fauchelevent 
 ah said jean valjean so it is you 
 yes i recollect you 
 that is very lucky said the old man in a reproachful tone 
 and what are you doing here resumed jean valjean 
 why i am covering my melons of course 
 in fact at the moment when jean valjean accosted him old fauchelevent held in his hand the end of a straw mat which he was occupied in spreading over the melon bed 
 during the hour or thereabouts that he had been in the garden he had already spread out a number of them it was this operation which had caused him to execute the peculiar movements observed from the shed by jean valjean 
 he continued 
 i said to myself the moon is bright 
 it is going to freeze what if i were to put my melons into their greatcoats 
 and he added looking at jean valjean with a broad you ought to have done the same 
 but how do you come here 
 jean valjean finding himself known to this man at least only under the name of madeleine thenceforth advanced only with caution he multiplied his questions 
 strange to say their roles seemed to be reversed 
 it was he the intruder who interrogated 
 and what is this bell which you wear on your knee 
 this replied fauchelevent is so that i may be avoided 
 
 what so that you may be avoided 
 old fauchelevent winked with an indescribable air 
 ah goodness there are only women in this young girls it appears that i should be a dangerous person to meet 
 the bell gives them warning 
 when i come they go 
 what house is this 
 come you know well enough 
 but i do not 
 not when you got me the place here as gardener 
 answer me as though i knew nothing 
 well then this is the convent 
 memories recurred to jean valjean 
 chance that is to say providence had cast him into precisely that convent in the quartier where old fauchelevent crippled by the fall from his cart had been admitted on his recommendation two years previously he repeated as though talking to himself 
 the convent 
 exactly returned old fauchelevent 
 but to come to the point how the deuce did you manage to get in here you father madeleine no matter if you are a saint you are a man as well and no man enters here 
 you certainly are here 
 there is no one but me 
 still said jean valjean i must stay here 
 ah good god cried fauchelevent 
 jean valjean drew near to the old man and said to him in a grave voice 
 father fauchelevent i saved your life 
 i was the first to recall it returned fauchelevent 
 well you can do for me that which i did for you in the olden days 
 fauchelevent took in his aged trembling and wrinkled hands jean two robust hands and stood for several minutes as though incapable of speaking 
 at length he exclaimed 
 oh that would be a blessing from the good god if i could make you some little return for that 
 save your life 
 monsieur le maire dispose of the old man 
 a wonderful joy had transfigured this old man 
 his countenance seemed to emit a ray of light 
 what do you wish me to do he resumed 
 that i will explain to you 
 you have a chamber 
 i have an isolated hovel yonder behind the ruins of the old convent in a corner which no one ever looks into 
 there are three rooms in it 
 the hut was in fact so well hidden behind the ruins and so cleverly arranged to prevent it being seen that jean valjean had not perceived it 
 good said jean valjean 
 now i am going to ask two things of you 
 what are they mr mayor 
 in the first place you are not to tell any one what you know about me in the second you are not to try to find out anything more 
 as you please 
 i know that you can do nothing that is not honest that you have always been a man after the good heart and then moreover you it was who placed me here 
 that concerns you i am at your service 
 that is settled then 
 now come with me 
 we will go and get the child 
 ah said fauchelevent so there is a child 
 he added not a word further and followed jean valjean as a dog follows his master 
 less than half an hour afterwards cosette who had grown rosy again before the flame of a good fire was lying asleep in the old bed 
 jean valjean had put on his cravat and coat once more his hat which he had flung over the wall had been found and picked up 
 while jean valjean was putting on his coat fauchelevent had removed the bell and kneecap which now hung on a nail beside a vintage basket that adorned the wall 
 the two men were warming themselves with their elbows resting on a table upon which fauchelevent had placed a bit of cheese black bread a bottle of wine and two glasses and the old man was saying to jean valjean as he laid his hand on the knee 
 ah 
 father madeleine you did not recognize me immediately you save lives and then you forget them 
 that is bad 
 but they remember you you are an ingrate

 book six 
 chapter xiii 
 
 one night when the old countess in nightcap and dressing jacket without her false curls and with her poor little knob of hair showing under her white cotton cap knelt sighing and groaning on a rug and bowing to the ground in prayer her door creaked and natasha also in a dressing jacket with slippers on her bare feet and her hair in curlpapers ran in the countess her prayerful mood dispelled looked round and frowned she was finishing her last prayer can it be that this couch will be my grave natasha flushed and eager seeing her mother in prayer suddenly checked her rush half sat down and unconsciously put out her tongue as if chiding herself seeing that her mother was still praying she ran on tiptoe to the bed and rapidly slipping one little foot against the other pushed off her slippers and jumped onto the bed the countess had feared might become her grave this couch was high with a feather bed and five pillows each smaller than the one below natasha jumped on it sank into the feather bed rolled over to the wall and began snuggling up the bedclothes as she settled down raising her knees to her chin kicking out and laughing almost inaudibly now covering herself up head and all and now peeping at her mother the countess finished her prayers and came to the bed with a stern face but seeing that head was covered she smiled in her kind weak way 
 now then now then said she 
 mamma can we have a talk yes said natasha now just one on your throat and another do and seizing her mother round the neck she kissed her on the throat in her behavior to her mother natasha seemed rough but she was so sensitive and tactful that however she clasped her mother she always managed to do it without hurting her or making her feel uncomfortable or displeased 
 well what is it tonight said the mother having arranged her pillows and waited until natasha after turning over a couple of times had settled down beside her under the quilt spread out her arms and assumed a serious expression 
 these visits of at night before the count returned from his club were one of the greatest pleasures of both mother and daughter 
 what is it tonight but i have to tell you 
 natasha put her hand on her mouth 
 about boris i know she said seriously what i have come about say it i know no do tell me and she removed her hand tell me mamma nice 
 natasha you are sixteen at your age i was married you say boris is nice he is very nice and i love him like a son but what then what are you thinking about you have quite turned his head i can see that 
 as she said this the countess looked round at her daughter natasha was lying looking steadily straight before her at one of the mahogany sphinxes carved on the corners of the bedstead so that the countess only saw her face in profile that face struck her by its peculiarly serious and concentrated expression 
 natasha was listening and considering 
 well what then said she 
 you have quite turned his head and why what do you want of him you know you marry him 
 why not said natasha without changing her position 
 because he is young because he is poor because he is a relation and because you yourself love him 
 how do you know 
 i know it is not right darling 
 but if i want to said natasha 
 leave off talking nonsense said the countess 
 but if i want to 
 natasha i am in earnest 
 natasha did not let her finish she drew the countess large hand to her kissed it on the back and then on the palm then again turned it over and began kissing first one knuckle then the space between the knuckles then the next knuckle whispering january february march april may speak mamma why you say anything speak said she turning to her mother who was tenderly gazing at her daughter and in that contemplation seemed to have forgotten all she had wished to say 
 it do my love not everyone will understand this friendship dating from your childish days and to see him so intimate with you may injure you in the eyes of other young men who visit us and above all it torments him for nothing he may already have found a suitable and wealthy match and now half crazy 
 crazy repeated natasha 
 tell you some things about myself i had a cousin 
 i know cyril matveich but he is old 
 he was not always old but this is what do natasha have a talk with boris he need not come so often 
 why not if he likes to 
 because i know it will end in nothing 
 how can you know no mamma speak to him what nonsense said natasha in the tone of one being deprived of her property well i marry but let him come if he enjoys it and i enjoy it natasha smiled and looked at her mother not to marry but just so she added 
 how so my pet 
 just so no need for me to marry him but just so 
 just so just so repeated the countess and shaking all over she went off into a good humored unexpected elderly laugh 
 laugh stop cried natasha shaking the whole bed awfully like me just such another giggler wait and she seized the countess hands and kissed a knuckle of the little finger saying june and continued kissing july august on the other hand but mamma is he very much in love what do you think was anybody ever so much in love with you and very nice very very nice only not quite my taste he is so narrow like the clock you understand narrow you know gray light gray 
 what rubbish talking said the countess 
 natasha continued you really understand nicholas would understand bezukhov now is blue and red and he is square 
 you flirt with him too said the countess laughing 
 no he is a freemason i have found out he is fine and red how can i explain it to you 
 little countess the voice called from behind the door not asleep natasha jumped up snatched up her slippers and ran barefoot to her own room 
 it was a long time before she could sleep she kept thinking that no one could understand all that she understood and all there was in her 
 sonya she thought glancing at that sleeping little kitten with her enormous plait of hair no how could she virtuous she fell in love with nicholas and does not wish to know anything more even mamma does not understand it is wonderful how clever i am and how charming she is she went on speaking of herself in the third person and imagining it was some very wise man the wisest and best of men who was saying it of her there is everything everything in her continued this man she is unusually intelligent charming and then she is pretty uncommonly pretty and agile she swims and rides splendidly and her voice one can really say a wonderful voice 
 she hummed a scrap from her favorite opera by cherubini threw herself on her bed laughed at the pleasant thought that she would immediately fall asleep called dunyasha the maid to put out the candle and before dunyasha had left the room had already passed into yet another happier world of dreams where everything was as light and beautiful as in reality and even more so because it was different 
 next day the countess called boris aside and had a talk with him after which he ceased coming to the rostovs

 well what is it tonight said the mother having arranged her pillows and waited until natasha after turning over a couple of times had settled down beside her under the quilt spread out her arms and assumed a serious expression 
 these visits of at night before the count returned from his club were one of the greatest pleasures of both mother and daughter 
 what is it tonight but i have to tell you 
 natasha put her hand on her mouth 
 about boris i know she said seriously what i have come about say it i know no do tell me and she removed her hand tell me mamma nice 
 natasha you are sixteen at your age i was married you say boris is nice he is very nice and i love him like a son but what then what are you thinking about you have quite turned his head i can see that 
 as she said this the countess looked round at her daughter natasha was lying looking steadily straight before her at one of the mahogany sphinxes carved on the corners of the bedstead so that the countess only saw her face in profile that face struck her by its peculiarly serious and concentrated expression 
 natasha was listening and considering 
 well what then said she 
 you have quite turned his head and why what do you want of him you know you marry him 
 why not said natasha without changing her position 
 because he is young because he is poor because he is a relation and because you yourself love him 
 how do you know 
 i know it is not right darling 
 but if i want to said natasha 
 leave off talking nonsense said the countess 
 but if i want to 
 natasha i am in earnest 
 natasha did not let her finish she drew the countess large hand to her kissed it on the back and then on the palm then again turned it over and began kissing first one knuckle then the space between the knuckles then the next knuckle whispering january february march april may speak mamma why you say anything speak said she turning to her mother who was tenderly gazing at her daughter and in that contemplation seemed to have forgotten all she had wished to say 
 it do my love not everyone will understand this friendship dating from your childish days and to see him so intimate with you may injure you in the eyes of other young men who visit us and above all it torments him for nothing he may already have found a suitable and wealthy match and now half crazy 
 crazy repeated natasha 
 tell you some things about myself i had a cousin 
 i know cyril matveich but he is old 
 he was not always old but this is what do natasha have a talk with boris he need not come so often 
 why not if he likes to 
 because i know it will end in nothing 
 how can you know no mamma speak to him what nonsense said natasha in the tone of one being deprived of her property well i marry but let him come if he enjoys it and i enjoy it natasha smiled and looked at her mother not to marry but just so she added 
 how so my pet 
 just so no need for me to marry him but just so 
 just so just so repeated the countess and shaking all over she went off into a good humored unexpected elderly laugh 
 laugh stop cried natasha shaking the whole bed awfully like me just such another giggler wait and she seized the countess hands and kissed a knuckle of the little finger saying june and continued kissing july august on the other hand but mamma is he very much in love what do you think was anybody ever so much in love with you and very nice very very nice only not quite my taste he is so narrow like the clock you understand narrow you know gray light gray 
 what rubbish talking said the countess 
 natasha continued you really understand nicholas would understand bezukhov now is blue and red and he is square 
 you flirt with him too said the countess laughing 
 no he is a freemason i have found out he is fine and red how can i explain it to you 
 little countess the voice called from behind the door not asleep natasha jumped up snatched up her slippers and ran barefoot to her own room 
 it was a long time before she could sleep she kept thinking that no one could understand all that she understood and all there was in her 
 sonya she thought glancing at that sleeping little kitten with her enormous plait of hair no how could she virtuous she fell in love with nicholas and does not wish to know anything more even mamma does not understand it is wonderful how clever i am and how charming she is she went on speaking of herself in the third person and imagining it was some very wise man the wisest and best of men who was saying it of her there is everything everything in her continued this man she is unusually intelligent charming and then she is pretty uncommonly pretty and agile she swims and rides splendidly and her voice one can really say a wonderful voice 
 she hummed a scrap from her favorite opera by cherubini threw herself on her bed laughed at the pleasant thought that she would immediately fall asleep called dunyasha the maid to put out the candle and before dunyasha had left the room had already passed into yet another happier world of dreams where everything was as light and beautiful as in reality and even more so because it was different 
 next day the countess called boris aside and had a talk with him after which he ceased coming to the rostovs

 book just man 
 chapter x 
 
 the bishop in the presence of an unknown light 
 at an epoch a little later than the date of the letter cited in the preceding pages he did a thing which if the whole town was to be believed was even more hazardous than his trip across the mountains infested with bandits 
 in the country near d a man lived quite alone 
 this man we will state at once was a former member of the convention his name was g 
 member of the convention g was mentioned with a sort of horror in the little world of d a member of the you imagine such a thing 
 that existed from the time when people called each other thou and when they said citizen 
 this man was almost a monster 
 he had not voted for the death of the king but almost 
 he was a he had been a terrible man how did it happen that such a man had not been brought before a court on the return of the legitimate princes they need not have cut off his head if you please clemency must be exercised agreed but a good banishment for life 
 an example in short etc 
 besides he was an atheist like all the rest of those people 
 gossip of the geese about the vulture 
 was g a vulture after all 
 yes if he were to be judged by the element of ferocity in this solitude of his 
 as he had not voted for the death of the king he had not been included in the decrees of exile and had been able to remain in france 
 he dwelt at a distance of of an hour from the city far from any hamlet far from any road in some hidden turn of a very wild valley no one knew exactly where 
 he had there it was said a sort of field a hole a lair 
 there were no neighbors not even since he had dwelt in that valley the path which led thither had disappeared under a growth of grass the locality was spoken of as though it had been the dwelling of a hangman 
 nevertheless the bishop meditated on the subject and from time to time he gazed at the horizon at a point where a clump of trees marked the valley of the former member of the convention and he said there is a soul yonder which is lonely 
 and he added deep in his own mind i owe him a visit 
 but let us avow it this idea which seemed natural at the first blush appeared to him after a reflection as strange impossible and almost repulsive 
 for at bottom he shared the general impression and the old member of the convention inspired him without his being clearly conscious of the fact himself with that sentiment which borders on hate and which is so well expressed by the word estrangement 
 still should the scab of the sheep cause the shepherd to recoil no but what a sheep 
 the good bishop was perplexed 
 sometimes he set out in that direction then he returned 
 finally the rumor one day spread through the town that a sort of young shepherd who served the member of the convention in his hovel had come in quest of a doctor that the old wretch was dying that paralysis was gaining on him and that he would not live over god some added 
 the bishop took his staff put on his cloak on account of his too threadbare cassock as we have mentioned and because of the evening breeze which was sure to rise soon and set out 
 the sun was setting and had almost touched the horizon when the bishop arrived at the excommunicated spot 
 with a certain beating of the heart he recognized the fact that he was near the lair he strode over a ditch leaped a hedge made his way through a fence of dead boughs entered a neglected paddock took a few steps with a good deal of boldness and suddenly at the extremity of the waste land and behind lofty brambles he caught sight of the cavern 
 it was a very low hut poor small and clean with a vine nailed against the outside 
 near the door in an old the of the peasants there was a man smiling at the sun 
 near the seated man stood a young boy the shepherd lad he was offering the old man a jar of milk 
 while the bishop was watching him the old man spoke 
 thank you he said i need nothing 
 and his smile quitted the sun to rest upon the child 
 the bishop stepped forward 
 at the sound which he made in walking the old man turned his head and his face expressed the sum total of the surprise which a man can still feel after a long life 
 this is the first time since i have been here said he that any one has entered here 
 who are you sir 
 the bishop answered 
 my name is bienvenu myriel 
 bienvenu myriel 
 i have heard that name 
 are you the man whom the people call monseigneur welcome 
 i am 
 the old man resumed with a 
 in that case you are my bishop 
 something of that sort 
 enter sir 
 the member of the convention extended his hand to the bishop but the bishop did not take it 
 the bishop confined himself to the remark 
 i am pleased to see that i have been misinformed 
 you certainly do not seem to me to be ill 
 monsieur replied the old man i am going to recover 
 he paused and then said 
 i shall die three hours hence 
 then he continued 
 i am something of a doctor i know in what fashion the last hour draws on 
 yesterday only my feet were cold the chill has ascended to my knees now i feel it mounting to my waist when it reaches the heart i shall stop 
 the sun is beautiful is it not 
 i had myself wheeled out here to take a last look at things 
 you can talk to me it does not fatigue me 
 you have done well to come and look at a man who is on the point of death it is well that there should be witnesses at that moment 
 one has caprices i should have liked to last until the dawn but i know that i shall hardly live three hours 
 it will be night then what does it matter after all 
 dying is a simple affair one has no need of the light for that 
 so be it 
 i shall die by starlight 
 the old man turned to the shepherd lad 
 go to thy bed thou wert awake all last night thou art tired 
 the child entered the hut 
 the old man followed him with his eyes and added as though speaking to himself 
 i shall die while he sleeps 
 the two slumbers may be good neighbors 
 the bishop was not touched as it seems that he should have been he did not think he discerned god in this manner of dying let us say the whole for these petty contradictions of great hearts must be indicated like the rest 
 he who on occasion was so fond of laughing at his grace was rather shocked at not being addressed as monseigneur and he was almost tempted to retort citizen he was assailed by a fancy for peevish familiarity common enough to doctors and priests but which was not habitual with him this man after all this member of the convention this representative of the people had been one of the powerful ones of the earth for the first time in his life probably the bishop felt in a mood to be severe 
 meanwhile the member of the convention had been surveying him with a modest cordiality in which one could have distinguished possibly that humility which is so fitting when one is on the verge of returning to dust 
 the bishop on his side although he generally restrained his curiosity which in his opinion bordered on a fault could not refrain from examining the member of the convention with an attention which as it did not have its course in sympathy would have served his conscience as a matter of reproach in connection with any other man a member of the convention produced on him somewhat the effect of being outside the pale of the law even of the law of charity 
 g calm his body almost upright his voice vibrating was one of those octogenarians who form the subject of astonishment to the physiologist the revolution had many of these men proportioned to the epoch in this old man one was conscious of a man put to the proof though so near to his end he preserved all the gestures of health in his clear glance in his firm tone in the robust movement of his shoulders there was something calculated to disconcert death azrael the mohammedan angel of the sepulchre would have turned back and thought that he had mistaken the door 
 g seemed to be dying because he willed it so 
 there was freedom in his agony 
 his legs alone were motionless 
 it was there that the shadows held him fast his feet were cold and dead but his head survived with all the power of life and seemed full of light 
 g at this solemn moment resembled the king in that tale of the orient who was flesh above and marble below 
 there was a stone there 
 the bishop sat down 
 the exordium was abrupt 
 i congratulate you said he in the tone which one uses for a reprimand 
 you did not vote for the death of the king after all 
 the old member of the convention did not appear to notice the bitter meaning underlying the words after all 
 he replied the smile had quite disappeared from his face 
 do not congratulate me too much sir 
 i did vote for the death of the tyrant 
 it was the tone of austerity answering the tone of severity 
 what do you mean to say resumed the bishop 
 i mean to say that man has a 
 i voted for the death of that tyrant 
 that tyrant engendered royalty which is authority falsely understood while science is authority rightly understood man should be governed only by science 
 and conscience added the bishop 
 it is the same thing 
 conscience is the quantity of innate science which we have within us 
 monseigneur bienvenu listened in some astonishment to this language which was very new to him 
 the member of the convention resumed 
 so far as louis xvi 
 was concerned i said no i did not think that i had the right to kill a man but i felt it my duty to exterminate evil 
 i voted the end of the tyrant that is to say the end of prostitution for woman the end of slavery for man the end of night for the child 
 in voting for the republic i voted for that 
 i voted for fraternity concord the dawn i have aided in the overthrow of prejudices and errors 
 the crumbling away of prejudices and errors causes light 
 we have caused the fall of the old world and the old world that vase of miseries has become through its upsetting upon the human race an urn of joy 
 mixed joy said the bishop 
 you may say troubled joy and after that fatal return of the past which is called joy which has disappeared alas 
 the work was incomplete i admit 
 we demolished the ancient regime in deeds we were not able to suppress it entirely in ideas to destroy abuses is not sufficient customs must be modified the mill is there no longer the wind is still there 
 you have demolished 
 it may be of use to demolish but i distrust a demolition complicated with wrath 
 right has its wrath bishop and the wrath of right is an element of progress 
 in any case and in spite of whatever may be said the french revolution is the most important step of the human race since the advent of christ 
 incomplete it may be but sublime it set free all the unknown social quantities it softened spirits it calmed appeased enlightened it caused the waves of civilization to flow over the earth 
 it was a good thing 
 the french revolution is the consecration of humanity 
 the bishop could not refrain from murmuring 
 yes 
 the member of the convention straightened himself up in his chair with an almost lugubrious solemnity and exclaimed so far as a dying man is capable of exclamation 
 ah there you go 
 i was expecting that word 
 a cloud had been forming for the space of fifteen hundred years at the end of fifteen hundred years it burst 
 you are putting the thunderbolt on its trial 
 the bishop felt without perhaps confessing it that something within him had suffered extinction 
 nevertheless he put a good face on the matter 
 he replied 
 the judge speaks in the name of justice the priest speaks in the name of pity which is nothing but a more lofty justice a thunderbolt should commit no error 
 and he added regarding the member of the convention steadily the while louis xvii 
 the conventionary stretched forth his hand and grasped the arm 
 louis xvii let us see 
 for whom do you mourn is it for the innocent child very good in that case i mourn with you is it for the royal child 
 i demand time for reflection to me the brother of cartouche an innocent child who was hung up by the armpits in the place de greve until death ensued for the sole crime of having been the brother of cartouche is no less painful than the grandson of louis xv an innocent child martyred in the tower of the temple for the sole crime of having been grandson of louis xv 
 monsieur said the bishop i like not this conjunction of names 
 cartouche 
 louis xv to which of the two do you object 
 a momentary silence ensued 
 the bishop almost regretted having come and yet he felt vaguely and strangely shaken 
 the conventionary resumed 
 ah monsieur priest you love not the crudities of the true christ loved them 
 he seized a rod and cleared out the temple his scourge full of lightnings was a harsh speaker of truths when he cried sinite parvulos he made no distinction between the little children 
 it would not have embarrassed him to bring together the dauphin of barabbas and the dauphin of herod 
 innocence monsieur is its own crown 
 innocence has no need to be a highness it is as august in rags as in fleurs de lys 
 that is true said the bishop in a low voice 
 i persist continued the conventionary g you have mentioned louis xvii 
 to me 
 let us come to an understanding 
 shall we weep for all the innocent all martyrs all children the lowly as well as the exalted 
 i agree to that 
 but in that case as i have told you we must go back further than and our tears must begin before louis xvii 
 i will weep with you over the children of kings provided that you will weep with me over the children of the people 
 i weep for all said the bishop 
 equally exclaimed conventionary g and if the balance must incline let it be on the side of the people 
 they have been suffering longer 
 another silence ensued 
 the conventionary was the first to break it he raised himself on one elbow took a bit of his cheek between his thumb and his forefinger as one does mechanically when one interrogates and judges and appealed to the bishop with a gaze full of all the forces of the death agony 
 it was almost an explosion 
 yes sir the people have been suffering a long while 
 and hold that is not all either why have you just questioned me and talked to me about louis xvii i know you not 
 ever since i have been in these parts i have dwelt in this enclosure alone never setting foot outside and seeing no one but that child who helps me your name has reached me in a confused manner it is true and very badly pronounced i must admit but that signifies nothing 
 clever men have so many ways of imposing on that honest goodman the people by the way i did not hear the sound of your carriage you have left it yonder behind the coppice at the fork of the roads no doubt i do not know you i tell you 
 you have told me that you are the bishop but that affords me no information as to your moral personality in short i repeat my question 
 who are you 
 you are a bishop that is to say a prince of the church one of those gilded men with heraldic bearings and revenues who have vast prebends the bishopric of d fifteen thousand francs settled income ten thousand in perquisites total thousand francs who have kitchens who have liveries who make good cheer who eat on friday who strut about a lackey before a lackey behind in a gala coach and who have palaces and who roll in their carriages in the name of jesus christ who went barefoot you are a palace horses servants good table all the sensualities of life you have this like the rest and like the rest you enjoy it it is well but this says either too much or too little this does not enlighten me upon the intrinsic and essential value of the man who comes with the probable intention of bringing wisdom to me 
 to whom do i speak who are you 
 the bishop hung his head and replied vermis am a worm 
 a worm of the earth in a carriage growled the conventionary 
 it was the turn to be arrogant and the to be humble 
 the bishop resumed mildly 
 so be it sir 
 but explain to me how my carriage which is a few paces off behind the trees yonder how my good table and the which i eat on friday how my thousand francs income how my palace and my lackeys prove that clemency is not a duty and that was not inexorable 
 the conventionary passed his hand across his brow as though to sweep away a cloud 
 before replying to you he said i beseech you to pardon me i have just committed a wrong sir 
 you are at my house you are my guest i owe you courtesy 
 you discuss my ideas and it becomes me to confine myself to combating your arguments 
 your riches and your pleasures are advantages which i hold over you in the debate but good taste dictates that i shall not make use of them 
 i promise you to make no use of them in the future 
 i thank you said the bishop 
 g resumed 
 let us return to the explanation which you have asked of me where were we 
 what were you saying to me 
 that was inexorable 
 inexorable yes said the bishop 
 what think you of marat clapping his hands at the guillotine 
 what think you of bossuet chanting the te deum over the dragonnades 
 the retort was a harsh one but it attained its mark with the directness of a point of steel 
 the bishop quivered under it no reply occurred to him but he was offended by this mode of alluding to bossuet 
 the best of minds will have their fetiches and they sometimes feel vaguely wounded by the want of respect of logic 
 the conventionary began to pant the asthma of the agony which is mingled with the last breaths interrupted his voice still there was a perfect lucidity of soul in his eyes 
 he went on 
 let me say a few words more in this and that direction i am willing 
 apart from the revolution which taken as a whole is an immense human affirmation is alas a rejoinder you think it inexorable sir but what of the whole monarchy sir carrier is a bandit but what name do you give to montrevel is a rascal but what is your opinion as to maillard is terrible but if you please 
 duchene senior is ferocious but what epithet will you allow me for the elder letellier 
 is a monster but not so great a one as m the marquis de louvois sir sir i am sorry for marie antoinette archduchess and queen but i am also sorry for that poor huguenot woman who in under louis the great sir while with a nursing infant was bound naked to the waist to a stake and the child kept at a distance her breast swelled with milk and her heart with anguish the little one hungry and pale beheld that breast and cried and agonized the executioner said to the woman a mother and a nurse abjure giving her her choice between the death of her infant and the death of her conscience 
 what say you to that torture of tantalus as applied to a mother 
 bear this well in mind sir the french revolution had its reasons for existence its wrath will be absolved by the future its result is the world made better from its most terrible blows there comes forth a caress for the human race 
 i abridge i stop i have too much the advantage moreover i am dying 
 and ceasing to gaze at the bishop the conventionary concluded his thoughts in these tranquil words 
 yes the brutalities of progress are called revolutions when they are over this fact is the human race has been treated harshly but that it has progressed 
 the conventionary doubted not that he had successively conquered all the inmost intrenchments of the bishop 
 one remained however and from this intrenchment the last resource of monseigneur resistance came forth this reply wherein appeared nearly all the harshness of the beginning 
 progress should believe in god 
 good cannot have an impious servitor he who is an atheist is but a bad leader for the human race 
 the former representative of the people made no reply 
 he was seized with a fit of trembling 
 he looked towards heaven and in his glance a tear gathered slowly 
 when the eyelid was full the tear trickled down his livid cheek and he said almost in a stammer quite low and to himself while his eyes were plunged in the depths 
 o thou 
 o ideal 
 thou alone existest 
 the bishop experienced an indescribable shock 
 after a pause the old man raised a finger heavenward and said 
 the infinite is 
 he is there 
 if the infinite had no person person would be without limit it would not be infinite in other words it would not exist 
 there is then an i that i of the infinite is god 
 the dying man had pronounced these last words in a loud voice and with the shiver of ecstasy as though he beheld some one when he had spoken his eyes closed 
 the effort had exhausted him it was evident that he had just lived through in a moment the few hours which had been left to him 
 that which he had said brought him nearer to him who is in death 
 the supreme moment was approaching 
 the bishop understood this time pressed it was as a priest that he had come 
 from extreme coldness he had passed by degrees to extreme emotion he gazed at those closed eyes he took that wrinkled aged and hand in his and bent over the dying man 
 this hour is the hour of god 
 do you not think that it would be regrettable if we had met in vain 
 the conventionary opened his eyes again 
 a gravity mingled with gloom was imprinted on his countenance 
 bishop said he with a slowness which probably arose more from his dignity of soul than from the failing of his strength i have passed my life in meditation study and contemplation i was sixty years of age when my country called me and commanded me to concern myself with its affairs 
 i obeyed 
 abuses existed i combated them tyrannies existed i destroyed them rights and principles existed i proclaimed and confessed them 
 our territory was invaded i defended it france was menaced i offered my breast i was not rich i am poor 
 i have been one of the masters of the state the vaults of the treasury were encumbered with specie to such a degree that we were forced to shore up the walls which were on the point of bursting beneath the weight of gold and silver i dined in dead tree street at sous i have succored the oppressed i have comforted the suffering i tore the cloth from the altar it is true but it was to bind up the wounds of my country 
 i have always upheld the march forward of the human race forward towards the light and i have sometimes resisted progress without pity 
 i have when the occasion offered protected my own adversaries men of your profession 
 and there is at peteghem in flanders at the very spot where the merovingian kings had their summer palace a convent of urbanists the abbey of sainte claire en beaulieu which i saved in 
 i have done my duty according to my powers and all the good that i was able after which i was hunted down pursued persecuted blackened jeered at scorned cursed proscribed 
 for many years past i with my white hair have been conscious that many people think they have the right to despise me to the poor ignorant masses i present the visage of one damned 
 and i accept this isolation of hatred without hating any one myself 
 now i am years old i am on the point of death 
 what is it that you have come to ask of me 
 your blessing said the bishop 
 and he knelt down 
 when the bishop raised his head again the face of the conventionary had become august 
 he had just expired 
 the bishop returned home deeply absorbed in thoughts which cannot be known to us 
 he passed the whole night in prayer on the following morning some bold and curious persons attempted to speak to him about member of the convention g he contented himself with pointing heavenward 
 from that moment he redoubled his tenderness and brotherly feeling towards all children and sufferers 
 any allusion to that old wretch of a g caused him to fall into a singular preoccupation 
 no one could say that the passage of that soul before his and the reflection of that grand conscience upon his did not count for something in his approach to perfection 
 this pastoral visit naturally furnished an occasion for a murmur of comment in all the little local coteries 
 was the bedside of such a dying man as that the proper place for a bishop 
 there was evidently no conversion to be expected all those revolutionists are backsliders 
 then why go there what was there to be seen there 
 he must have been very curious indeed to see a soul carried off by the devil 
 one day a dowager of the impertinent variety who thinks herself spiritual addressed this sally to him monseigneur people are inquiring when your greatness will receive the red oh a coarse color replied the bishop it is lucky that those who despise it in a cap revere it in a hat

 book just man 
 chapter x 
 
 the bishop in the presence of an unknown light 
 at an epoch a little later than the date of the letter cited in the preceding pages he did a thing which if the whole town was to be believed was even more hazardous than his trip across the mountains infested with bandits 
 in the country near d a man lived quite alone 
 this man we will state at once was a former member of the convention his name was g 
 member of the convention g was mentioned with a sort of horror in the little world of d a member of the you imagine such a thing 
 that existed from the time when people called each other thou and when they said citizen 
 this man was almost a monster 
 he had not voted for the death of the king but almost 
 he was a he had been a terrible man how did it happen that such a man had not been brought before a court on the return of the legitimate princes they need not have cut off his head if you please clemency must be exercised agreed but a good banishment for life 
 an example in short etc 
 besides he was an atheist like all the rest of those people 
 gossip of the geese about the vulture 
 was g a vulture after all 
 yes if he were to be judged by the element of ferocity in this solitude of his 
 as he had not voted for the death of the king he had not been included in the decrees of exile and had been able to remain in france 
 he dwelt at a distance of of an hour from the city far from any hamlet far from any road in some hidden turn of a very wild valley no one knew exactly where 
 he had there it was said a sort of field a hole a lair 
 there were no neighbors not even since he had dwelt in that valley the path which led thither had disappeared under a growth of grass the locality was spoken of as though it had been the dwelling of a hangman 
 nevertheless the bishop meditated on the subject and from time to time he gazed at the horizon at a point where a clump of trees marked the valley of the former member of the convention and he said there is a soul yonder which is lonely 
 and he added deep in his own mind i owe him a visit 
 but let us avow it this idea which seemed natural at the first blush appeared to him after a reflection as strange impossible and almost repulsive 
 for at bottom he shared the general impression and the old member of the convention inspired him without his being clearly conscious of the fact himself with that sentiment which borders on hate and which is so well expressed by the word estrangement 
 still should the scab of the sheep cause the shepherd to recoil no but what a sheep 
 the good bishop was perplexed 
 sometimes he set out in that direction then he returned 
 finally the rumor one day spread through the town that a sort of young shepherd who served the member of the convention in his hovel had come in quest of a doctor that the old wretch was dying that paralysis was gaining on him and that he would not live over god some added 
 the bishop took his staff put on his cloak on account of his too threadbare cassock as we have mentioned and because of the evening breeze which was sure to rise soon and set out 
 the sun was setting and had almost touched the horizon when the bishop arrived at the excommunicated spot 
 with a certain beating of the heart he recognized the fact that he was near the lair he strode over a ditch leaped a hedge made his way through a fence of dead boughs entered a neglected paddock took a few steps with a good deal of boldness and suddenly at the extremity of the waste land and behind lofty brambles he caught sight of the cavern 
 it was a very low hut poor small and clean with a vine nailed against the outside 
 near the door in an old the of the peasants there was a man smiling at the sun 
 near the seated man stood a young boy the shepherd lad he was offering the old man a jar of milk 
 while the bishop was watching him the old man spoke 
 thank you he said i need nothing 
 and his smile quitted the sun to rest upon the child 
 the bishop stepped forward 
 at the sound which he made in walking the old man turned his head and his face expressed the sum total of the surprise which a man can still feel after a long life 
 this is the first time since i have been here said he that any one has entered here 
 who are you sir 
 the bishop answered 
 my name is bienvenu myriel 
 bienvenu myriel 
 i have heard that name 
 are you the man whom the people call monseigneur welcome 
 i am 
 the old man resumed with a 
 in that case you are my bishop 
 something of that sort 
 enter sir 
 the member of the convention extended his hand to the bishop but the bishop did not take it 
 the bishop confined himself to the remark 
 i am pleased to see that i have been misinformed 
 you certainly do not seem to me to be ill 
 monsieur replied the old man i am going to recover 
 he paused and then said 
 i shall die three hours hence 
 then he continued 
 i am something of a doctor i know in what fashion the last hour draws on

 you have done well to come and look at a man who is on the point of death it is well that there should be witnesses at that moment 
 one has caprices i should have liked to last until the dawn but i know that i shall hardly live three hours 
 it will be night then what does it matter after all 
 dying is a simple affair one has no need of the light for that 
 so be it 
 i shall die by starlight 
 the old man turned to the shepherd lad 
 go to thy bed thou wert awake all last night thou art tired 
 the child entered the hut 
 the old man followed him with his eyes and added as though speaking to himself 
 i shall die while he sleeps 
 the two slumbers may be good neighbors 
 the bishop was not touched as it seems that he should have been he did not think he discerned god in this manner of dying let us say the whole for these petty contradictions of great hearts must be indicated like the rest 
 he who on occasion was so fond of laughing at his grace was rather shocked at not being addressed as monseigneur and he was almost tempted to retort citizen he was assailed by a fancy for peevish familiarity common enough to doctors and priests but which was not habitual with him this man after all this member of the convention this representative of the people had been one of the powerful ones of the earth for the first time in his life probably the bishop felt in a mood to be severe

 yes sir the people have been suffering a long while 
 and hold that is not all either why have you just questioned me and talked to me about louis xvii i know you not

 but explain to me how my carriage which is a few paces off behind the trees yonder how my good table and the which i eat on friday how my thousand francs income how my palace and my lackeys prove that clemency is not a duty and that was not inexorable 
 the conventionary passed his hand across his brow as though to sweep away a cloud 
 before replying to you he said i beseech you to pardon me i have just committed a wrong sir 
 you are at my house you are my guest i owe you courtesy 
 you discuss my ideas and it becomes me to confine myself to combating your arguments 
 your riches and your pleasures are advantages which i hold over you in the debate but good taste dictates that i shall not make use of them 
 i promise you to make no use of them in the future 
 i thank you said the bishop 
 g resumed 
 let us return to the explanation which you have asked of me where were we 
 what were you saying to me 
 that was inexorable 
 inexorable yes said the bishop 
 what think you of marat clapping his hands at the guillotine 
 what think you of bossuet chanting the te deum over the dragonnades 
 the retort was a harsh one but it attained its mark with the directness of a point of steel 
 the bishop quivered under it no reply occurred to him but he was offended by this mode of alluding to bossuet 
 the best of minds will have their fetiches and they sometimes feel vaguely wounded by the want of respect of logic 
 the conventionary began to pant the asthma of the agony which is mingled with the last breaths interrupted his voice still there was a perfect lucidity of soul in his eyes 
 he went on 
 let me say a few words more in this and that direction i am willing 
 apart from the revolution which taken as a whole is an immense human affirmation is alas a rejoinder you think it inexorable sir but what of the whole monarchy sir carrier is a bandit but what name do you give to montrevel is a rascal but what is your opinion as to maillard is terrible but if you please 
 duchene senior is ferocious but what epithet will you allow me for the elder letellier 
 is a monster but not so great a one as m the marquis de louvois sir sir i am sorry for marie antoinette archduchess and queen but i am also sorry for that poor huguenot woman who in under louis the great sir while with a nursing infant was bound naked to the waist to a stake and the child kept at a distance her breast swelled with milk and her heart with anguish the little one hungry and pale beheld that breast and cried and agonized the executioner said to the woman a mother and a nurse abjure giving her her choice between the death of her infant and the death of her conscience 
 what say you to that torture of tantalus as applied to a mother 
 bear this well in mind sir the french revolution had its reasons for existence its wrath will be absolved by the future its result is the world made better from its most terrible blows there comes forth a caress for the human race 
 i abridge i stop i have too much the advantage moreover i am dying 
 and ceasing to gaze at the bishop the conventionary concluded his thoughts in these tranquil words 
 yes the brutalities of progress are called revolutions when they are over this fact is the human race has been treated harshly but that it has progressed 
 the conventionary doubted not that he had successively conquered all the inmost intrenchments of the bishop 
 one remained however and from this intrenchment the last resource of monseigneur resistance came forth this reply wherein appeared nearly all the harshness of the beginning 
 progress should believe in god 
 good cannot have an impious servitor he who is an atheist is but a bad leader for the human race 
 the former representative of the people made no reply 
 he was seized with a fit of trembling 
 he looked towards heaven and in his glance a tear gathered slowly 
 when the eyelid was full the tear trickled down his livid cheek and he said almost in a stammer quite low and to himself while his eyes were plunged in the depths 
 o thou 
 o ideal 
 thou alone existest 
 the bishop experienced an indescribable shock 
 after a pause the old man raised a finger heavenward and said 
 the infinite is 
 he is there 
 if the infinite had no person person would be without limit it would not be infinite in other words it would not exist 
 there is then an i that i of the infinite is god 
 the dying man had pronounced these last words in a loud voice and with the shiver of ecstasy as though he beheld some one when he had spoken his eyes closed 
 the effort had exhausted him it was evident that he had just lived through in a moment the few hours which had been left to him 
 that which he had said brought him nearer to him who is in death 
 the supreme moment was approaching 
 the bishop understood this time pressed it was as a priest that he had come 
 from extreme coldness he had passed by degrees to extreme emotion he gazed at those closed eyes he took that wrinkled aged and hand in his and bent over the dying man 
 this hour is the hour of god 
 do you not think that it would be regrettable if we had met in vain 
 the conventionary opened his eyes again 
 a gravity mingled with gloom was imprinted on his countenance 
 bishop said he with a slowness which probably arose more from his dignity of soul than from the failing of his strength i have passed my life in meditation study and contemplation i was sixty years of age when my country called me and commanded me to concern myself with its affairs 
 i obeyed 
 abuses existed i combated them tyrannies existed i destroyed them rights and principles existed i proclaimed and confessed them 
 our territory was invaded i defended it france was menaced i offered my breast i was not rich i am poor 
 i have been one of the masters of the state the vaults of the treasury were encumbered with specie to such a degree that we were forced to shore up the walls which were on the point of bursting beneath the weight of gold and silver i dined in dead tree street at sous i have succored the oppressed i have comforted the suffering i tore the cloth from the altar it is true but it was to bind up the wounds of my country 
 i have always upheld the march forward of the human race forward towards the light and i have sometimes resisted progress without pity 
 i have when the occasion offered protected my own adversaries men of your profession 
 and there is at peteghem in flanders at the very spot where the merovingian kings had their summer palace a convent of urbanists the abbey of sainte claire en beaulieu which i saved in 
 i have done my duty according to my powers and all the good that i was able after which i was hunted down pursued persecuted blackened jeered at scorned cursed proscribed 
 for many years past i with my white hair have been conscious that many people think they have the right to despise me to the poor ignorant masses i present the visage of one damned 
 and i accept this isolation of hatred without hating any one myself 
 now i am years old i am on the point of death 
 what is it that you have come to ask of me 
 your blessing said the bishop 
 and he knelt down 
 when the bishop raised his head again the face of the conventionary had become august 
 he had just expired 
 the bishop returned home deeply absorbed in thoughts which cannot be known to us 
 he passed the whole night in prayer on the following morning some bold and curious persons attempted to speak to him about member of the convention g he contented himself with pointing heavenward 
 from that moment he redoubled his tenderness and brotherly feeling towards all children and sufferers 
 any allusion to that old wretch of a g caused him to fall into a singular preoccupation 
 no one could say that the passage of that soul before his and the reflection of that grand conscience upon his did not count for something in his approach to perfection 
 this pastoral visit naturally furnished an occasion for a murmur of comment in all the little local coteries 
 was the bedside of such a dying man as that the proper place for a bishop 
 there was evidently no conversion to be expected all those revolutionists are backsliders 
 then why go there what was there to be seen there 
 he must have been very curious indeed to see a soul carried off by the devil 
 one day a dowager of the impertinent variety who thinks herself spiritual addressed this sally to him monseigneur people are inquiring when your greatness will receive the red oh a coarse color replied the bishop it is lucky that those who despise it in a cap revere it in a hat

 a new hope 
 x 
 
 lined with power cables and circuitry conduits that rose from the depths and vanishedinto the heavens the service trench appeared to be hundreds of kilometers deep thenarrow catwalk running around one side looked like a starched thread glued on aglowing ocean it was barely wide enough for one man to traverse 
 one man edged his way along that treacherous walkway now his gaze intent onsomething ahead of him instead of the awesome metal abyss below the clackingsounds of enormous switching devices resounded like captive leviathans in the vastopen space tireless and never sleeping 
 two thick cables joined beneath an overlay panel it was locked but aftercareful inspection of sides top and bottom ben kenobi pressed the panel cover in aparticular fashion causing it to spring aside a blinking computer terminal wasrevealed beneath 
 with equal care he performed several adjustments to the terminal his actionswere rewarded when several indicator lights on the board changed from red to blue 
 without warning a secondary door close behind him opened hurriedlyreclosing the panel cover the old man slipped deeper into the shadows adetachment of troopers had appeared in the portal and the officer in charge moved towithin a couple of meters of the motionless hidden figure 
 secure this area until the alert has been cancelled 
 as they began to disperse kenobi became one with the dark 
 chewbacca grunted and wheezed and barely succeeded in forcing his thick torsothrough the hatchway opening with and help that turned to take stock of their surroundings 
 the hallway they had emerged into showed dust on the floor it gave theimpression of not having been used since the station had been built probably it wasonly a repair access corridor he had no idea where they were 
 something hit the wall behind them with a massive thunk and luke yelled foreveryone to watch out as a long gelatinous limb worked its way through the hatchand flailed hopefully about in the open corridor solo aimed his pistol at it as leiatried to slip past the chewbacca 
 somebody get this big hairy walking carpet out of my way suddenly shenoticed what solo was preparing to do no wait be heard 
 solo ignored her and fired at the hatchway the burst of energy was rewardedwith a distant roar as an avalanche of weakened wall and beaming all but buried thecreature in the chamber beyond 
 magnified by the narrow corridor the sounds continued to roll and echo for longminutes afterward luke shook his head in disgust realizing that someone like solowho spoke with the mouth of a gun might not always act sensibly until now he hadsort of looked up to the corellian but the senseless gesture of firing at the hatchwaybrought them for the first time in mind to the same level 
 the actions were more surprising than however listen shebegan staring up at him i know where you came from but as an afterthought she glanced back at luke adding to both of you herattention turned back to solo but from now on you do as i tell you 
 solo gaped at her this time the smug smile come look yourholiness he was finally able to stammer get something straight i takeorders only from one 
 a wonder still alive she shot back smoothly a quick look downthe corridor and she had started determinedly off in the other direction 
 solo looked at luke started to say something then hesitated and simply shookhis head slowly no reward is worth this i know if enough credit inthe universe to pay for putting up with herhey slow down 
 leia had started around a bend in the corridor and they ran swiftly to catch upwith her 
 the half dozen troops milling around the entrance to the power trench were moreinterested in discussing the peculiar disturbance in the detention block than in payingattention to their present boring duty so engrossed were they in speculation as tothe cause of the trouble that they failed to notice the fey wraith behind them itmoved from shadow to shadow like a ferret freezing when one of thetroopers seemed to turn slightly in its direction moving on again as if walking on air 
 several minutes later one of the troopers frowned inside his armor turning towhere he thought he had sensed a movement near the opening to the main was nothing but an undefinable something which the kenobi hadleft behind acutely uncomfortable yet understandably unwilling to confess tohallucinations the trooper turned back to the more prosaic conversation of his fellows someone finally discovered the two unconscious guards tied in the service lockerson board the captured freighter both men remained comatose despite all efforts torevive them 
 under the direction of several bickering officers troopers carried their twoarmorless comrades down the ramp and toward the nearest hospital bay on the waythey passed two forms hidden by a small opened service panel threepio and artoowent unnoticed despite their proximity to the hangar 
 as soon as the troops had passed artoo finished removing a socket cover andhurriedly shoved his sensor arm into the opening lights commenced a wild flashingon his face and smoke started issuing from several seams in the small droid before afrantic threepio could pull the arm free 
 immediately the smoke vanished the undisciplined blinking faded to emitted a few wilted beeps successfully giving the impression of a human whohad expected a glass of mild wine and instead unwittingly downed several gulps ofsomething proof 
 well next time watch where you stick your sensors threepio chastised hiscompanion you could have fried your insides he eyed the socket apower outlet stupid not an information terminal 
 artoo whistled a mournful apology together they hunted for the proper outlet 
 luke solo chewbacca and the princess reached the end of an empty before a large window which overlooked a hangar giving them asweeping tantalizing view of the freighter just below 
 pulling out his comlink and looking around them with increasing spoke into the pickup see threepiodo you copy 
 there was a threatening pause then i read you sir we had to abandon theregion around the office 
 are you both safe 
 for the moment though not sanguine about my old age in themain hangar across from the ship 
 luke looked toward the bay window in surprise i see you across must be right above you stand by join you as soon as we clicked off smiling suddenly at reference to his old the tall droid was more human than people 
 wonder if the old man was able to knock out the tractors solo was mutteringas he surveyed the scene below a dozen or so troopers were moving in and out ofthe freighter 
 getting back to the going to be like flying through the five fire rings offornax leia organa turned long enough to glance in surprise from the ship to came here in that wreck braver than i thought 
 at once praised and insulted solo sure how to react he settled forgiving her a dirty look as they started back down the hallway chewbacca bringing upthe rear 
 rounding a corner the three humans came to an abrupt halt so did the twentyimperial troopers marching toward them reacting is to drew his pistol and charged the platoon yelling and howlingin several languages at the top of his lungs 
 startled by the totally unexpected assault and wrongly assuming their attackerknew what he was doing the troopers started to back away several wild shots fromthe pistol initiated complete panic ranks and composure shattered thetroopers broke and fled down the passage 
 drunk with his own prowess solo continued the chase turning to shout back atluke get to the ship take care of these 
 are you out of your mind luke yelled at him where do you think 
 but solo had already rounded a far bend in the corridor and hear notthat it would have made any difference 
 upset at his disappearance chewbacca let out a thunderous if unsettledhowl and rushed down the hallway after him that left luke and leia standing alonein the empty corridor 
 maybe i was too hard on your friend he confessed reluctantly he certainlyis courageous 
 he certainly is an idiot a furious luke countered tightly i know whatgood do us if he gets himself killed muted alarms suddenly sounded from thebay below and behind them 
 done it luke growled disgustedly go together they startedoff in search of a way down to a level 
 solo continued his rout of all opposition running at top speed down the longhallway yelling and brandishing his pistol occasionally he got off a shot whoseeffect was more valuable psychologically than tactically 
 half the troops had already scattered down various subpassages and ten troopers he continued to harry still raced headlong away from him up againsta dead end which forced them to turn and confront their opponents 
 seeing that the ten had halted solo likewise slowed gradually he came to acomplete stop corellian and imperials regarded one another silently several ofthe troopers were staring not at han but past him 
 it suddenly occurred to solo that he was very much alone and the same thoughtwas beginning to seep into the minds of the guards he was gave way rapidly to anger rifles and pistols started to come took a step backward fired one shot then turned and ran like hell 
 chewbacca heard the whistle and crump of energy weapons firing as helumbered lightly down the corridor there was something odd about them sounded as if they were coming closer instead of moving away 
 he was debating what to do when solo came tearing around a corner and nearlyran him down seeing ten troopers in pursuit the wookie decided to reserve hisquestion for a less confused moment he turned and followed solo back up thehallway 
 luke grabbed the princess and pulled her back into a recess she was about toretort angrily at his brusqueness when the sound of marching feet caused her to shrinkback into the darkness with him 
 a squad of soldiers hurried past responding to the alarms that continued to ringsteadily luke looked out at the retreating backs and tried to catch his breath ouronly hope of reaching the ship is from the other side of the hangar they alreadyknow here he started back down the corridor motioning for her tofollow 
 two guards appeared at the far end of the passageway paused and pointeddirectly at them turning luke and leia began running back the way they had larger squad of troopers rounded the far bend and came racing toward them 
 blocking ahead and behind they hunted frantically for another way out thenleia spotted the cramped subhallway and gestured to it 
 luke fired at the nearest of their pursuers and joined her in running down thepassage it looked like a minor service corridor behind them pursuit soundeddeafeningly loud in the confining space but at least it minimized the amount of firethe troops could concentrate on them 
 a thick hatchway appeared ahead the lighting beyond turned dimmer hopes if they could lock the hatch even for a few moments and lostthemselves somewhere beyond they might have a chance of shaking their immediatetormentors 
 but the hatch stayed open showing no inclination to close automatically lukewas about to let out a shout of triumph when the ground suddenly vanished ahead ofhim his toes hanging over nothingness he failed to regain his balance succeedingjust in time to nearly go over the edge of the retracted catwalk anyway as the princessplowed into him from behind 
 the catwalk had been reduced to a stub protruding into empty air a cool draftcaressed face as he studied walls that soared to unseen heights overhead andplunged to fathomless depths below the service shaft was employed in circulatingand recycling the atmosphere of the station 
 at the moment luke was too frightened and concerned to be angry with theprincess for his attention a burst of energy exploded above their heads sendingmetal slivers flying 
 i think we made a wrong turn he murmured firing back at the advancingtroops and illuminating the narrow corridor behind them with destruction 
 an open hatchway showed on the other side of the chasm it might as wellhave been a away hunting along the rim of the doorway leia located aswitch and hit it quickly the hatch door behind them slid shut with a resoundingboom at least that cut off the fire from the rapidly nearing soldiers it also left thetwo fugitives balanced precariously on a small section of catwalk barely a metersquare if the remaining section were to unexpectedly withdraw into the wall theywould see more of the battle interior than either wished 
 gesturing for the princess to move aside as much as possible luke shielded hiseyes and aimed the pistol at the hatch controls a brief burst of energy melted themflush with the wall insuring that no one could open it easily from the other he turned his attention to the vast cavity blocking their path to the oppositeportal it beckoned small yellow rectangle of freedom 
 only the soft rush of air from below sounded until luke commented this is door but it hold them back very long 
 got to get across there somehow leia agreed once more examining themetal bordering the sealed doorway find the controls for extending the bridge 
 some desperate searching produced nothing while an ominous pounding andhissing sounded from behind the frozen door a small spot of white appeared in thecenter of the metal then began to spread and smoke 
 coming through luke groaned 
 the princess turned carefully to stare across the gap this must be a bridge with the controls only on the other side 
 reaching up to the point at the panel holding the unreachable controls caught on something at his waist a frustrated glance downward revealed engendered a bit of practical insanity 
 the cable coiled tightly in small loops was thin and fragile seeming but it wasgeneral line and would have supported weight easily itcertainly ought to hold leia and himself pulling the cable free of the waist catch hegauged its length matching it against the width of the abyss this should span thedistance with plenty to spare 
 what now the princess inquired curiously 
 luke reply instead he removed a small but heavy power unit from theutility belt of his armor and tied one end of the cable around it making sure thewrapping was secure he stepped as close to the edge of their uncertain perch as hedared 
 whirling the weighted end of the cord in increasing circles he let it arc acrossthe gorge it stuck an outcropping of cylindrical conduits on the other side and felldownward with forced patience he pulled the loose line back in then recoiled it foranother try 
 once again the weighted end orbited in ever greater circles and again he flung itacross the gap he could feel the rising heat behind him as he let it go heat from themelting metal doorway 
 this time the heavy end looped around an outcropping of pipes above wrappeditself several times around and slipped battery end down into a crack between backward he tugged and pulled on the cable pulling on it at the same time ashe tried to rest all his weight on it the cable showed no sign of parting 
 wrapping the other end of the line several times around his waist and right reached out and pulled the princess close to him with the other the hatch doorbehind them was now a molten white and liquid metal was running steadily from itsborders 
 something warm and pleasant touched lips shock at the princess hismouth still tingling from the kiss 
 just for luck she murmured with a slight almost embarrassed smile as she puther arms around him going to need it 
 gripping the thin cable as tightly as possible with his left hand luke put hisright over it took a deep breath and jumped out into air if he had miscalculated thedegree of arc in their swing they would miss the open hatch and slam into the metalwall to either side or below it if that happened he doubted he could maintain hisgrip on the rope 
 the transit was accomplished in less time than that thought in amoment luke was on the other side scrambling on his knees to make sure they back into the pit leia released her hold on him with admirable timing sherolled forward and into the open hatchway climbing gracefully to her feet as lukefought to untangle himself from the cable 
 a distant whine became a loud hen a groan as the hatch door on the other sidegave way it collapsed inward and tumbled into the depths if it touched hear it 
 a few bolts struck the wall nearby luke turned his own weapon on theunsuccessful troopers and returned the fire even as leia was pulling him into thepassageway behind 
 once clear of the door he hit the activating switch it shut tightly behind would have several minutes at least without having to worry about being shotin the back on the other hand luke have the slightest idea where they he found himself wondering what had happened to han and chewbacca 
 solo and his wookie partner had succeeded in shaking a portion of their it seemed that whenever they slipped free of several soldiers more appeared totake their place no question about it the word was out on them 
 ahead a series of shield doors was beginning to close 
 hurry chewie solo urged 
 chewbacca grunted once breathing like an overused engine despite hisimmense strength the wookie was not built for sprinting only hisenormous stride had enabled him to keep pace with the lithe corellian chewbaccaleft a couple of hairs in one of the doors but both slipped inside just before the fivelayers slammed shut 
 that ought to hold them for a while solo crowed with delight the wookiegrowled something at him but his partner fairly fluoresced with confidence 
 of course i can find the ship from get lost therecame another growl slightly accusing this time solo shrugged count he a corellian besides i was drunk 
 ben kenobi ducked into the shadows of a narrow passageway seeming tobecome part of the metal itself as a large cluster of troopers hurried past to make certain they had all passed he checked the corridor ahead beforestarting down it but he failed to see the dark silhouette which eclipsed the light farbehind him 
 kenobi had avoided one patrol after another slowly working his way backtoward the docking bay holding the freighter just another two turns and he shouldbe at the hangar what he would do then would be determined by howinconspicuous his charges had been 
 that young luke the adventurous corellian and his partner and the two robotshad been involved in something other than quiet napping he already suspected fromthe amount of activity he had observed while making his way back from the powertrench surely all those troops been out hunting just for him 
 but something else was troubling them judging from the reference he hadoverheard concerning a certain important prisoner now escaped that discovery hadpuzzled him until he considered the restless nature of both luke and han they were involved in some fashion 
 ben sensed something directly ahead and slowed cautiously it had a mostfamiliar feel to it a metal odor he could not quite place 
 then the figure stepped out in front of him blocking his entry to the hangar notfive meters away the outline and size of the figure completed the momentarypuzzle it was the maturity of the mind he had sensed that had temporarily confusedhim his hand moved naturally to the hilt of his deactivated saber 
 i have been waiting a long time kenobi darth vader intonedsolemnly we meet again at last the circle has been completed kenobisensed satisfaction beneath the hideous mask the presence i sensed earlier couldonly have been you 
 kenobi regarded the great form blocking his retreat and nodded slowly hegave the impression of being more curious than impressed you still have much tolearn 
 you were once my teacher vader admitted and i learned much from the time of learning has long passed and i am the master now 
 the logic that had constituted the missing link in his brilliant pupil remained asabsent as before there would be no reasoning here kenobi knew igniting hissaber he assumed the pose of a movement accomplished with the easeand elegance of a dancer 
 rather roughly vader imitated the movement several minutes followedwithout motion as the two men remained staring at each other as if waiting for someproper as yet unspoken signal 
 kenobi blinked once shook his head and tried to clear his eyes which hadbegun to water slightly sweat beaded up on his forehead and his eyelids flutteredagain 
 you powers are weak vader noted emotionlessly old man you shouldnever have come back it will make your end less peaceful than you might havewished 
 you sense only a part of the force darth kenobi murmured with the assuranceof one to whom death is merely another sensation like sleeping or making love ortouching a candle as always you perceive its reality as little as a utensil perceivesthe taste of food 
 executing a move of incredible swiftness for one so old kenobi lunged at themassive shape vader blocked the stab with equal speed riposting with acounterslash that kenobi barely parried another parry and kenobi countered this opportunity to move around the towering dark lord 
 they continued to trade blows with the old man now backing toward the his saber and locked the interaction of the two energy fields producinga violent sparking and flashing a low buzzing sound rose from the straining powerunits as each saber sought to override the other 
 threepio peeked around the entrance to the docking bay worriedly counting thenumber of troopers milling around the deserted freighter 
 where could they be oh oh 
 he ducked back out of sight just as one of the guards glanced in his second more cautious appraisal was more rewarding it revealed han solo andchewbacca hugging the wall of another tunnel on the far side of the bay 
 solo also was nonplussed at the number of guards he muttered wejust leave this party 
 chewbacca grunted and both turned only to relax and lower their weapons atthe sight of luke and the princess 
 what kept you solo quipped mirthlessly 
 we ran into leia explained panting heavily some old friends 
 luke was staring at the freighter is the ship all right 
 seems okay was analysis it look like removedanything or disturbed her engines the going to be getting to it 
 leia suddenly pointed to one of the opposite tunnels look 
 illuminated by the flare from contacting energy fields ben kenobi and darthvader were backing toward the bay the fight attracted the attention of others besidethe senator every one of the guards moved in for a better view of the olympianconflict 
 our chance solo observed starting forward 
 all seven of the troopers guarding the ship broke and rushed toward thecombatants going to the dark aid threepio barely ducked aside as they ranpast him turning back into the alcove he yelled to his companion 
 unplug yourself artoo leaving as soon as the artoo unit slippedhis sensor arm free of the socket the two droids began to slowly edge out into theopen bay 
 kenobi heard the approaching commotion and spared a glance back into thehangar the squad of troopers bearing down on him was enough to show that he wastrapped 
 vader took immediate advantage of the momentary distraction to bring his saberover and down kenobi somehow managed to deflect the sweeping blow at onceparrying and turning a complete circle 
 you still have your skill but your power fades prepare to meet the 
 kenobi gauged the shrinking distance between the oncoming troops and turned a pitying gaze on vader this is a fight you cannot win darth yourpower has matured since i taught you but i too have grown much since our my blade finds its mark you will cease to exist but if you cut me down i willonly become more powerful heed my words 
 your philosophies no longer confuse me old man vader growledcontemptuously i am the master now 
 once again he lunged forward feinting and then slashing in a deadly downwardarc with the saber it stuck home cutting the old man cleanly in half there was abrief flash as cloak fluttered to the deck in two neat sections 
 but ben kenobi was not in it wary of some tricks vader poked at the emptycloak sections with the saber there was no sign of the old man he had vanishedas though he had ever existed 
 the guards slowed their approach and joined vader in examining the place wherekenobi had stood seconds before several of them muttered and even the awesomepresence of the sith lord keep a few of them from feeling a little afraid 
 once the guards had turned and dashed for the far tunnels solo and the othersstarted for the starship shifted direction and was moving toward the guards 
 ben he screamed firing wildly toward the troops solo cursed but turned tofire in support of luke 
 one of the energy bolts struck the safety release on the tunnel blast door theemergency hold broken the heavy door fairly exploded downward both the guardsand vader leaped guards into the bay and vader backward to the oppositeside of the door 
 solo had turned and started for the entrance to the ship but he paused as he sawluke running toward the guards 
 too late leia yelled at him over 
 a familiar yet different voice rang in his voice all it said 
 bewildered luke turned to hunt for the source of that admonition he onlysaw leia beckoning to him as she followed artoo and threepio up the ramp 
 come on no time 
 hesitating his mind still on that imagined voice or was it imagined aconfused luke took aim and felled several soldiers before he too whirled andretreated into the freighter

 a new hope

 lined with power cables and circuitry conduits that rose from the depths and vanishedinto the heavens the service trench appeared to be hundreds of kilometers deep thenarrow catwalk running around one side looked like a starched thread glued on aglowing ocean it was barely wide enough for one man to traverse 
 one man edged his way along that treacherous walkway now his gaze intent onsomething ahead of him instead of the awesome metal abyss below the clackingsounds of enormous switching devices resounded like captive leviathans in the vastopen space tireless and never sleeping 
 two thick cables joined beneath an overlay panel it was locked but aftercareful inspection of sides top and bottom ben kenobi pressed the panel cover in aparticular fashion causing it to spring aside a blinking computer terminal wasrevealed beneath 
 with equal care he performed several adjustments to the terminal his actionswere rewarded when several indicator lights on the board changed from red to blue 
 without warning a secondary door close behind him opened hurriedlyreclosing the panel cover the old man slipped deeper into the shadows adetachment of troopers had appeared in the portal and the officer in charge moved towithin a couple of meters of the motionless hidden figure 
 secure this area until the alert has been cancelled 
 as they began to disperse kenobi became one with the dark 
 chewbacca grunted and wheezed and barely succeeded in forcing his thick torsothrough the hatchway opening with and help that turned to take stock of their surroundings 
 the hallway they had emerged into showed dust on the floor it gave theimpression of not having been used since the station had been built probably it wasonly a repair access corridor he had no idea where they were 
 something hit the wall behind them with a massive thunk and luke yelled foreveryone to watch out as a long gelatinous limb worked its way through the hatchand flailed hopefully about in the open corridor solo aimed his pistol at it as leiatried to slip past the chewbacca 
 somebody get this big hairy walking carpet out of my way suddenly shenoticed what solo was preparing to do no wait be heard 
 solo ignored her and fired at the hatchway the burst of energy was rewardedwith a distant roar as an avalanche of weakened wall and beaming all but buried thecreature in the chamber beyond 
 magnified by the narrow corridor the sounds continued to roll and echo for longminutes afterward luke shook his head in disgust realizing that someone like solowho spoke with the mouth of a gun might not always act sensibly until now he hadsort of looked up to the corellian but the senseless gesture of firing at the hatchwaybrought them for the first time in mind to the same level 
 the actions were more surprising than however listen shebegan staring up at him i know where you came from but as an afterthought she glanced back at luke adding to both of you herattention turned back to solo but from now on you do as i tell you 
 solo gaped at her this time the smug smile come look yourholiness he was finally able to stammer get something straight i takeorders only from one 
 a wonder still alive she shot back smoothly a quick look downthe corridor and she had started determinedly off in the other direction 
 solo looked at luke started to say something then hesitated and simply shookhis head slowly no reward is worth this i know if enough credit inthe universe to pay for putting up with herhey slow down 
 leia had started around a bend in the corridor and they ran swiftly to catch upwith her 
 the half dozen troops milling around the entrance to the power trench were moreinterested in discussing the peculiar disturbance in the detention block than in payingattention to their present boring duty so engrossed were they in speculation as tothe cause of the trouble that they failed to notice the fey wraith behind them itmoved from shadow to shadow like a ferret freezing when one of thetroopers seemed to turn slightly in its direction moving on again as if walking on air 
 several minutes later one of the troopers frowned inside his armor turning towhere he thought he had sensed a movement near the opening to the main was nothing but an undefinable something which the kenobi hadleft behind acutely uncomfortable yet understandably unwilling to confess tohallucinations the trooper turned back to the more prosaic conversation of his fellows someone finally discovered the two unconscious guards tied in the service lockerson board the captured freighter both men remained comatose despite all efforts torevive them 
 under the direction of several bickering officers troopers carried their twoarmorless comrades down the ramp and toward the nearest hospital bay on the waythey passed two forms hidden by a small opened service panel threepio and artoowent unnoticed despite their proximity to the hangar 
 as soon as the troops had passed artoo finished removing a socket cover andhurriedly shoved his sensor arm into the opening lights commenced a wild flashingon his face and smoke started issuing from several seams in the small droid before afrantic threepio could pull the arm free 
 immediately the smoke vanished the undisciplined blinking faded to emitted a few wilted beeps successfully giving the impression of a human whohad expected a glass of mild wine and instead unwittingly downed several gulps ofsomething proof 
 well next time watch where you stick your sensors threepio chastised hiscompanion you could have fried your insides he eyed the socket apower outlet stupid not an information terminal 
 artoo whistled a mournful apology together they hunted for the proper outlet 
 luke solo chewbacca and the princess reached the end of an empty before a large window which overlooked a hangar giving them asweeping tantalizing view of the freighter just below 
 pulling out his comlink and looking around them with increasing spoke into the pickup see threepiodo you copy 
 there was a threatening pause then i read you sir we had to abandon theregion around the office 
 are you both safe 
 for the moment though not sanguine about my old age in themain hangar across from the ship 
 luke looked toward the bay window in surprise i see you across must be right above you stand by join you as soon as we clicked off smiling suddenly at reference to his old the tall droid was more human than people 
 wonder if the old man was able to knock out the tractors solo was mutteringas he surveyed the scene below a dozen or so troopers were moving in and out ofthe freighter 
 getting back to the going to be like flying through the five fire rings offornax leia organa turned long enough to glance in surprise from the ship to came here in that wreck braver than i thought 
 at once praised and insulted solo sure how to react he settled forgiving her a dirty look as they started back down the hallway chewbacca bringing upthe rear 
 rounding a corner the three humans came to an abrupt halt so did the twentyimperial troopers marching toward them reacting is to drew his pistol and charged the platoon yelling and howlingin several languages at the top of his lungs 
 startled by the totally unexpected assault and wrongly assuming their attackerknew what he was doing the troopers started to back away several wild shots fromthe pistol initiated complete panic ranks and composure shattered thetroopers broke and fled down the passage 
 drunk with his own prowess solo continued the chase turning to shout back atluke get to the ship take care of these 
 are you out of your mind luke yelled at him where do you think 
 but solo had already rounded a far bend in the corridor and hear notthat it would have made any difference 
 upset at his disappearance chewbacca let out a thunderous if unsettledhowl and rushed down the hallway after him that left luke and leia standing alonein the empty corridor 
 maybe i was too hard on your friend he confessed reluctantly he certainlyis courageous 
 he certainly is an idiot a furious luke countered tightly i know whatgood do us if he gets himself killed muted alarms suddenly sounded from thebay below and behind them 
 done it luke growled disgustedly go together they startedoff in search of a way down to a level 
 solo continued his rout of all opposition running at top speed down the longhallway yelling and brandishing his pistol occasionally he got off a shot whoseeffect was more valuable psychologically than tactically 
 half the troops had already scattered down various subpassages and ten troopers he continued to harry still raced headlong away from him up againsta dead end which forced them to turn and confront their opponents 
 seeing that the ten had halted solo likewise slowed gradually he came to acomplete stop corellian and imperials regarded one another silently several ofthe troopers were staring not at han but past him 
 it suddenly occurred to solo that he was very much alone and the same thoughtwas beginning to seep into the minds of the guards he was gave way rapidly to anger rifles and pistols started to come took a step backward fired one shot then turned and ran like hell 
 chewbacca heard the whistle and crump of energy weapons firing as helumbered lightly down the corridor there was something odd about them sounded as if they were coming closer instead of moving away 
 he was debating what to do when solo came tearing around a corner and nearlyran him down seeing ten troopers in pursuit the wookie decided to reserve hisquestion for a less confused moment he turned and followed solo back up thehallway 
 luke grabbed the princess and pulled her back into a recess she was about toretort angrily at his brusqueness when the sound of marching feet caused her to shrinkback into the darkness with him

 sometimes while meditating on these things in solitude got up in a sudden terror and put on my bonnet to go see how all was at the farm persuaded my conscience that it was a duty to warn him how people talked regarding his ways and then recollected his confirmed bad habits and hopeless of benefiting him have flinched from the dismal house doubting if i could bear to be taken at my word 
 one time i passed the old gate going out of my way on a journey to gimmerton it was about the period that my narrative has reached a bright frosty afternoon the ground bare and the road hard and dry i came to a stone where the highway branches off on to the moor at your left hand a rough sand pillar with the letters cut on its north side on the east g and on the it serves as to the grange the heights and village the sun shone yellow on its grey head reminding me of summer and i cannot say why but all at once a gush of sensations flowed into my heart hindley and i held it a favourite spot twenty years before i gazed long at the block and stooping down perceived a hole near the bottom still full of and pebbles which we were fond of storing there with more perishable things and as fresh as reality it appeared that i beheld my early playmate seated on the withered turf his dark square head bent forward and his little hand scooping out the earth with a piece of slate poor hindley i exclaimed involuntarily i started my bodily eye was cheated into a momentary belief that the child lifted its face and stared straight into mine it vanished in a twinkling but immediately i felt an irresistible yearning to be at the heights superstition urged me to comply with this impulse supposing he should be dead i should die it were a sign of death the nearer i got to the house the more agitated i grew and on catching sight of it i trembled in every limb the apparition had outstripped me it stood looking through the gate that was my first idea on observing an boy setting his ruddy countenance against the bars further reflection suggested this must be hareton my hareton not altered greatly since i left him ten months since 
 god bless thee darling i cried forgetting instantaneously my foolish fears hareton nelly nelly thy nurse 
 he retreated out of length and picked up a large flint 
 i am come to see thy father hareton i added guessing from the action that nelly if she lived in his memory at all was not recognized as one with me 
 he raised his missile to hurl it i commenced a soothing speech but could not stay his hand the stone struck my bonnet and then ensued from the stammering lips of the little fellow a string of curses which whether he comprehended them or not were delivered with practised emphasis and distorted his baby features into a shocking expression of malignity you may be certain this grieved more than angered me fit to cry i took an orange from my pocket and offered it to propitiate him he hesitated and then snatched it from my hold as if he fancied i only intended to tempt and disappoint him i showed another keeping it out of his reach 
 who has taught you those fine words my bairn i inquired the curate 
 damn the curate and thee gie me that he replied 
 tell us where you got your lessons and you shall have it said i your master 
 devil daddy was his answer 
 and what do you learn from daddy i continued 
 he jumped at the fruit i raised it higher what does he teach you i asked 
 naught said he but to keep out of his gait daddy cannot bide me because i swear at him 
 ah and the devil teaches you to swear at daddy i observed 
 he drawled 
 who then 
 heathcliff 
 i asked if he liked mr heathcliff 
 ay he answered again 
 desiring to have his reasons for liking him i could only gather the he pays dad back what he gies to curses daddy for cursing me he says i mun do as i will 
 and the curate does not teach you to read and write then i pursued 
 no i was told the curate should have dashed down his he stepped over the had promised that 
 i put the orange in his hand and bade him tell his father that a woman called nelly dean was waiting to speak with him by the garden gate he went up the walk and entered the house but instead of hindley heathcliff appeared on the doorstones and i turned directly and ran down the road as hard as ever i could race making no halt till i gained the and feeling as scared as if i had raised a goblin this is not much connected with miss affair except that it urged me to resolve further on mounting vigilant guard and doing my utmost to check the spread of such bad influence at the grange even though i should wake a domestic storm by thwarting mrs pleasure 
 the next time heathcliff came my young lady chanced to be feeding some pigeons in the court she had never spoken a word to her for three days but she had likewise dropped her fretful complaining and we found it a great comfort heathcliff had not the habit of bestowing a single unnecessary civility on miss linton i knew now as soon as he beheld her his first precaution was to take a sweeping survey of the house front i was standing by the kitchen window but i drew out of sight he then stepped across the pavement to her and said something she seemed embarrassed and desirous of getting away to prevent it he laid his hand on her arm she averted her face he apparently put some question which she had no mind to answer there was another rapid glance at the house and supposing himself unseen the scoundrel had the impudence to embrace her 
 judas traitor i ejaculated you are a hypocrite too are you a deliberate deceiver 
 who is nelly said voice at my elbow i had been over intent on watching the pair outside to mark her entrance 
 your worthless friend i answered warmly the sneaking rascal yonder ah he has caught a glimpse of is coming in i wonder will he have the art to find a plausible excuse for making love to miss when he told you he hated her 
 mrs linton saw isabella tear herself free and run into the garden and a minute after heathcliff opened the door i withhold giving some loose to my indignation but catherine angrily insisted on silence and threatened to order me out of the kitchen if i dared to be so presumptuous as to put in my insolent tongue 
 to hear you people might think you were the mistress she cried you want setting down in your right place heathcliff what are you about raising this stir i said you must let isabella beg you will unless you are tired of being received here and wish linton to draw the bolts against you 
 god forbid that he should try answered the black villain i detested him just then god keep him meek and patient every day i grow madder after sending him to heaven 
 hush said catherine shutting the inner door vex me why have you disregarded my request did she come across you on purpose 
 what is it to you he growled a right to kiss her if she chooses and you have no right to object not your husband you be jealous of me 
 not jealous of you replied the mistress jealous for you clear your face you scowl at me if you like isabella you shall marry her but do you like her tell the truth heathcliff there you answer certain you 
 and would mr linton approve of his sister marrying that man i inquired 
 mr linton should approve returned my lady decisively 
 he might spare himself the trouble said heathcliff i could do as well without his approbation and as to you catherine i have a mind to speak a few words now while we are at it i want you to be aware that i know you have treated me do you hear and if you flatter yourself that i perceive it you are a fool and if you think i can be consoled by sweet words you are an idiot and if you fancy suffer unrevenged convince you of the contrary in a very little while meantime thank you for telling me your secret i swear make the most of it and stand you aside 
 what new phase of his character is this exclaimed mrs linton in amazement treated you take your revenge how will you take it ungrateful brute how have i treated you infernally 
 i seek no revenge on you replied heathcliff less vehemently not the plan the tyrant grinds down his slaves and they turn against him they crush those beneath them you are welcome to torture me to death for your amusement only allow me to amuse myself a little in the same style and refrain from insult as much as you are able having levelled my palace erect a hovel and complacently admire your own charity in giving me that for a home if i imagined you really wished me to marry isabel cut my throat 
 oh the evil is that i am not jealous is it cried catherine well i repeat my offer of a wife it is as bad as offering satan a lost soul your bliss lies like his in inflicting misery you prove it edgar is restored from the he gave way to at your coming i begin to be secure and tranquil and you restless to know us at peace appear resolved on exciting a quarrel quarrel with edgar if you please heathcliff and deceive his sister hit on exactly the most efficient method of revenging yourself on me 
 the conversation ceased mrs linton sat down by the fire flushed and gloomy the spirit which served her was growing intractable she could neither lay nor control it he stood on the hearth with folded arms brooding on his evil thoughts and in this position i left them to seek the master who was wondering what kept catherine below so long 
 ellen said he when i entered have you seen your mistress 
 yes in the kitchen sir i answered sadly put out by mr behaviour and indeed i do think time to arrange his visits on another footing harm in being too soft and now come to i related the scene in the court and as near as i dared the whole subsequent dispute i fancied it could not be very prejudicial to mrs linton unless she made it so afterwards by assuming the defensive for her guest edgar linton had difficulty in hearing me to the close his first words revealed that he did not clear his wife of blame 
 this is insufferable he exclaimed it is disgraceful that she should own him for a friend and force his company on me call me two men out of the hall ellen catherine shall linger no longer to argue with the low have humoured her enough 
 he descended and bidding the servants wait in the passage went followed by me to the kitchen its occupants had recommenced their angry discussion mrs linton at least was scolding with renewed vigour heathcliff had moved to the window and hung his head somewhat cowed by her violent rating apparently he saw the master first and made a hasty motion that she should be silent which she obeyed abruptly on discovering the reason of his intimation 
 how is this said linton addressing her what notion of propriety must you have to remain here after the language which has been held to you by that blackguard i suppose because it is his ordinary talk you think nothing of it you are habituated to his baseness and perhaps imagine i can get used to it too 
 have you been listening at the door edgar asked the mistress in a tone particularly calculated to provoke her husband implying both carelessness and contempt of his irritation heathcliff who had raised his eyes at the former speech gave a sneering laugh at the latter on purpose it seemed to draw mr attention to him he succeeded but edgar did not mean to entertain him with any high flights of passion 
 i have been so far forbearing with you sir he said quietly not that i was ignorant of your miserable degraded character but i felt you were only partly responsible for that and catherine wishing to keep up your acquaintance i your presence is a moral poison that would contaminate the most virtuous for that cause and to prevent worse consequences i shall deny you hereafter admission into this house and give notice now that i require your instant departure three minutes delay will render it involuntary and ignominious 
 heathcliff measured the height and breadth of the speaker with an eye full of derision 
 cathy this lamb of yours threatens like a bull he said it is in danger of splitting its skull against my knuckles by god mr linton mortally sorry that you are not worth knocking down 
 my master glanced towards the passage and signed me to fetch the men he had no intention of hazarding a personal encounter i obeyed the hint but mrs linton suspecting something followed and when i attempted to call them she pulled me back slammed the door to and locked it 
 fair means she said in answer to her look of angry surprise if you have not courage to attack him make an apology or allow yourself to be beaten it will correct you of feigning more valour than you possess no swallow the key before you shall get it delightfully rewarded for my kindness to each after constant indulgence of weak nature and the bad one i earn for thanks two samples of blind ingratitude stupid to absurdity edgar i was defending you and yours and i wish heathcliff may flog you sick for daring to think an evil thought of me 
 it did not need the medium of a flogging to produce that effect on the master he tried to wrest the key from grasp and for safety she flung it into the hottest part of the fire whereupon mr edgar was taken with a nervous trembling and his countenance grew deadly pale for his life he could not avert that access of emotion mingled anguish and humiliation overcame him completely he leant on the back of a chair and covered his face 
 oh heavens in old days this would win you knighthood exclaimed mrs linton we are vanquished we are vanquished heathcliff would as soon lift a finger at you as a king would march his army against a colony of mice cheer up you be hurt your type is not a lamb a sucking leveret 
 i wish you joy of the coward cathy said her friend i compliment you on your taste and that is the slavering shivering thing you preferred to me i would not strike him with my fist but kick him with my foot and experience considerable satisfaction is he weeping or is he going to faint for fear 
 the fellow approached and gave the chair on which linton rested a push better have kept his distance my master quickly sprang erect and struck him full on the throat a blow that would have levelled a slighter man it took his breath for a minute and while he choked mr linton walked out by the back door into the yard and from thence to the front entrance 
 there done with coming here cried catherine get away now return with a brace of pistols and half a dozen assistants if he did overhear us of course never forgive you played him an ill turn heathcliff but haste rather see edgar at bay than you 
 do you suppose going with that blow burning in my gullet he thundered by hell no crush his ribs in like a rotten hazel nut before i cross the threshold if i floor him now i shall murder him some time so as you value his existence let me get at him 
 not coming i interposed framing a bit of a lie the coachman and the two gardeners surely not wait to be thrust into the road by them each has a bludgeon and master will very likely be watching from the parlour windows to see that they fulfil his orders 
 the gardeners and coachman were there but linton was with them they had already entered the court heathcliff on second thoughts resolved to avoid a struggle against the three underlings he seized the poker smashed the lock from the inner door and made his escape as they tramped in 
 mrs linton who was very much excited bade me accompany her upstairs she did not know my share in contributing to the disturbance and i was anxious to keep her in ignorance 
 nearly distracted nelly she exclaimed throwing herself on the sofa a thousand smiths hammers are beating in my head tell isabella to shun me this uproar is owing to her and should she or anyone else aggravate my anger at present i shall get wild and nelly say to edgar if you see him again tonight that in danger of being seriously ill i wish it may prove true he has startled and distressed me shockingly i want to frighten him besides he might come and begin a string of abuse or complainings certain i should recriminate and god knows where we should end will you do so my good nelly you are aware that i am in no way blamable in this matter what possessed him to turn listener talk was outrageous after you left us but i could soon have diverted him from isabella and the rest meant nothing now all is dashed wrong by the craving to hear evil of self that haunts some people like a demon had edgar never gathered our conversation he would never have been the worse for it really when he opened on me in that unreasonable tone of displeasure after i had scolded heathcliff till i was hoarse for him i did not care hardly what they did to each other especially as i felt that however the scene closed we should all be driven asunder for nobody knows how long well if i cannot keep heathcliff for my edgar will be mean and jealous try to break their hearts by breaking my own that will be a prompt way of finishing all when i am pushed to extremity but a deed to be reserved for a forlorn hope not take linton by surprise with it to this point he has been discreet in dreading to provoke me you must represent the peril of quitting that policy and remind him of my passionate temper verging when kindled on frenzy i wish you could dismiss that apathy out of your countenance and look rather more anxious about me 
 the stolidity with which i received these instructions was no doubt rather exasperating for they were delivered in perfect sincerity but i believed a person who could plan the turning of her fits of passion to account beforehand might by exerting her will manage to control herself tolerably even while under their influence and i did not wish to frighten her husband as she said and multiply his annoyances for the purpose of serving her selfishness therefore i said nothing when i met the master coming towards the parlour but i took the liberty of turning back to listen whether they would resume their quarrel together he began to speak first 
 remain where you are catherine he said without any anger in his voice but with much sorrowful despondency i shall not stay i am neither come to wrangle nor be reconciled but i wish just to learn whether after this events you intend to continue your intimacy with 
 oh for sake interrupted the mistress stamping her foot for sake let us hear no more of it now your cold blood cannot be worked into a fever your veins are full of but mine are boiling and the sight of such chillness makes them dance 
 to get rid of me answer my question persevered mr linton you must answer it and that violence does not alarm me i have found that you can be as stoical as anyone when you please will you give up heathcliff hereafter or will you give up me it is impossible for you to be my friend and his at the same time and i absolutely require to know which you choose 
 i require to be let alone exclaimed catherine furiously i demand it you see i can scarcely stand edgar leave me 
 she rang the bell till it broke with a twang i entered leisurely it was enough to try the temper of a saint such senseless wicked rages there she lay dashing her head against the arm of the sofa and grinding her teeth so that you might fancy she would crash them to splinters mr linton stood looking at her in sudden compunction and fear he told me to fetch some water she had no breath for speaking i brought a glass full and as she would not drink i sprinkled it on her face in a few seconds she stretched herself out stiff and turned up her eyes while her cheeks at once blanched and livid assumed the aspect of death linton looked terrified 
 there is nothing in the world the matter i whispered i did not want him to yield though i could not help being afraid in my heart 
 she has blood on her lips he said shuddering 
 never mind i answered tartly and i told him how she had resolved previous to his coming on exhibiting a fit of frenzy i incautiously gave the account aloud and she heard me for she started hair flying over her shoulders her eyes flashing the muscles of her neck and arms standing out preternaturally i made up my mind for broken bones at least but she only glared about her for an instant and then rushed from the room the master directed me to follow i did to her chamber door she hindered me from going farther by securing it against me 
 as she never offered to descend to breakfast next morning i went to ask whether she would have some carried up no she replied peremptorily the same question was repeated at dinner and tea and again on the morrow after and received the same answer mr linton on his part spent his time in the library and did not inquire concerning his occupations isabella and he had had an interview during which he tried to elicit from her some sentiment of proper horror for advances but he could make nothing of her evasive replies and was obliged to close the examination unsatisfactorily adding however a solemn warning that if she were so insane as to encourage that worthless suitor it would dissolve all bonds of relationship between herself and him

 mrs linton saw isabella tear herself free and run into the garden and a minute after heathcliff opened the door i withhold giving some loose to my indignation but catherine angrily insisted on silence and threatened to order me out of the kitchen if i dared to be so presumptuous as to put in my insolent tongue 
 to hear you people might think you were the mistress she cried you want setting down in your right place heathcliff what are you about raising this stir i said you must let isabella beg you will unless you are tired of being received here and wish linton to draw the bolts against you 
 god forbid that he should try answered the black villain i detested him just then god keep him meek and patient every day i grow madder after sending him to heaven 
 hush said catherine shutting the inner door vex me why have you disregarded my request did she come across you on purpose 
 what is it to you he growled a right to kiss her if she chooses and you have no right to object not your husband you be jealous of me 
 not jealous of you replied the mistress jealous for you clear your face you scowl at me if you like isabella you shall marry her but do you like her tell the truth heathcliff there you answer certain you 
 and would mr linton approve of his sister marrying that man i inquired 
 mr linton should approve returned my lady decisively 
 he might spare himself the trouble said heathcliff i could do as well without his approbation and as to you catherine i have a mind to speak a few words now while we are at it i want you to be aware that i know you have treated me do you hear and if you flatter yourself that i perceive it you are a fool and if you think i can be consoled by sweet words you are an idiot and if you fancy suffer unrevenged convince you of the contrary in a very little while meantime thank you for telling me your secret i swear make the most of it and stand you aside 
 what new phase of his character is this exclaimed mrs linton in amazement treated you take your revenge how will you take it ungrateful brute how have i treated you infernally 
 i seek no revenge on you replied heathcliff less vehemently not the plan the tyrant grinds down his slaves and they turn against him they crush those beneath them you are welcome to torture me to death for your amusement only allow me to amuse myself a little in the same style and refrain from insult as much as you are able having levelled my palace erect a hovel and complacently admire your own charity in giving me that for a home if i imagined you really wished me to marry isabel cut my throat 
 oh the evil is that i am not jealous is it cried catherine well i repeat my offer of a wife it is as bad as offering satan a lost soul your bliss lies like his in inflicting misery you prove it edgar is restored from the he gave way to at your coming i begin to be secure and tranquil and you restless to know us at peace appear resolved on exciting a quarrel quarrel with edgar if you please heathcliff and deceive his sister hit on exactly the most efficient method of revenging yourself on me 
 the conversation ceased mrs linton sat down by the fire flushed and gloomy the spirit which served her was growing intractable she could neither lay nor control it he stood on the hearth with folded arms brooding on his evil thoughts and in this position i left them to seek the master who was wondering what kept catherine below so long 
 ellen said he when i entered have you seen your mistress 
 yes in the kitchen sir i answered sadly put out by mr behaviour and indeed i do think time to arrange his visits on another footing harm in being too soft and now come to i related the scene in the court and as near as i dared the whole subsequent dispute i fancied it could not be very prejudicial to mrs linton unless she made it so afterwards by assuming the defensive for her guest edgar linton had difficulty in hearing me to the close his first words revealed that he did not clear his wife of blame 
 this is insufferable he exclaimed it is disgraceful that she should own him for a friend and force his company on me call me two men out of the hall ellen catherine shall linger no longer to argue with the low have humoured her enough 
 he descended and bidding the servants wait in the passage went followed by me to the kitchen its occupants had recommenced their angry discussion mrs linton at least was scolding with renewed vigour heathcliff had moved to the window and hung his head somewhat cowed by her violent rating apparently he saw the master first and made a hasty motion that she should be silent which she obeyed abruptly on discovering the reason of his intimation 
 how is this said linton addressing her what notion of propriety must you have to remain here after the language which has been held to you by that blackguard i suppose because it is his ordinary talk you think nothing of it you are habituated to his baseness and perhaps imagine i can get used to it too 
 have you been listening at the door edgar asked the mistress in a tone particularly calculated to provoke her husband implying both carelessness and contempt of his irritation heathcliff who had raised his eyes at the former speech gave a sneering laugh at the latter on purpose it seemed to draw mr attention to him he succeeded but edgar did not mean to entertain him with any high flights of passion 
 i have been so far forbearing with you sir he said quietly not that i was ignorant of your miserable degraded character but i felt you were only partly responsible for that and catherine wishing to keep up your acquaintance i your presence is a moral poison that would contaminate the most virtuous for that cause and to prevent worse consequences i shall deny you hereafter admission into this house and give notice now that i require your instant departure three minutes delay will render it involuntary and ignominious 
 heathcliff measured the height and breadth of the speaker with an eye full of derision 
 cathy this lamb of yours threatens like a bull he said it is in danger of splitting its skull against my knuckles by god mr linton mortally sorry that you are not worth knocking down 
 my master glanced towards the passage and signed me to fetch the men he had no intention of hazarding a personal encounter i obeyed the hint but mrs linton suspecting something followed and when i attempted to call them she pulled me back slammed the door to and locked it 
 fair means she said in answer to her look of angry surprise if you have not courage to attack him make an apology or allow yourself to be beaten it will correct you of feigning more valour than you possess no swallow the key before you shall get it delightfully rewarded for my kindness to each after constant indulgence of weak nature and the bad one i earn for thanks two samples of blind ingratitude stupid to absurdity edgar i was defending you and yours and i wish heathcliff may flog you sick for daring to think an evil thought of me 
 it did not need the medium of a flogging to produce that effect on the master he tried to wrest the key from grasp and for safety she flung it into the hottest part of the fire whereupon mr edgar was taken with a nervous trembling and his countenance grew deadly pale for his life he could not avert that access of emotion mingled anguish and humiliation overcame him completely he leant on the back of a chair and covered his face 
 oh heavens in old days this would win you knighthood exclaimed mrs linton we are vanquished we are vanquished heathcliff would as soon lift a finger at you as a king would march his army against a colony of mice cheer up you be hurt your type is not a lamb a sucking leveret 
 i wish you joy of the coward cathy said her friend i compliment you on your taste and that is the slavering shivering thing you preferred to me i would not strike him with my fist but kick him with my foot and experience considerable satisfaction is he weeping or is he going to faint for fear 
 the fellow approached and gave the chair on which linton rested a push better have kept his distance my master quickly sprang erect and struck him full on the throat a blow that would have levelled a slighter man it took his breath for a minute and while he choked mr linton walked out by the back door into the yard and from thence to the front entrance 
 there done with coming here cried catherine get away now return with a brace of pistols and half a dozen assistants if he did overhear us of course never forgive you played him an ill turn heathcliff but haste rather see edgar at bay than you 
 do you suppose going with that blow burning in my gullet he thundered by hell no crush his ribs in like a rotten hazel nut before i cross the threshold if i floor him now i shall murder him some time so as you value his existence let me get at him 
 not coming i interposed framing a bit of a lie the coachman and the two gardeners surely not wait to be thrust into the road by them each has a bludgeon and master will very likely be watching from the parlour windows to see that they fulfil his orders 
 the gardeners and coachman were there but linton was with them they had already entered the court heathcliff on second thoughts resolved to avoid a struggle against the three underlings he seized the poker smashed the lock from the inner door and made his escape as they tramped in 
 mrs linton who was very much excited bade me accompany her upstairs she did not know my share in contributing to the disturbance and i was anxious to keep her in ignorance 
 nearly distracted nelly she exclaimed throwing herself on the sofa a thousand smiths hammers are beating in my head tell isabella to shun me this uproar is owing to her and should she or anyone else aggravate my anger at present i shall get wild and nelly say to edgar if you see him again tonight that in danger of being seriously ill i wish it may prove true he has startled and distressed me shockingly i want to frighten him besides he might come and begin a string of abuse or complainings certain i should recriminate and god knows where we should end will you do so my good nelly you are aware that i am in no way blamable in this matter what possessed him to turn listener talk was outrageous after you left us but i could soon have diverted him from isabella and the rest meant nothing now all is dashed wrong by the craving to hear evil of self that haunts some people like a demon had edgar never gathered our conversation he would never have been the worse for it really when he opened on me in that unreasonable tone of displeasure after i had scolded heathcliff till i was hoarse for him i did not care hardly what they did to each other especially as i felt that however the scene closed we should all be driven asunder for nobody knows how long well if i cannot keep heathcliff for my edgar will be mean and jealous try to break their hearts by breaking my own that will be a prompt way of finishing all when i am pushed to extremity but a deed to be reserved for a forlorn hope not take linton by surprise with it to this point he has been discreet in dreading to provoke me you must represent the peril of quitting that policy and remind him of my passionate temper verging when kindled on frenzy i wish you could dismiss that apathy out of your countenance and look rather more anxious about me 
 the stolidity with which i received these instructions was no doubt rather exasperating for they were delivered in perfect sincerity but i believed a person who could plan the turning of her fits of passion to account beforehand might by exerting her will manage to control herself tolerably even while under their influence and i did not wish to frighten her husband as she said and multiply his annoyances for the purpose of serving her selfishness therefore i said nothing when i met the master coming towards the parlour but i took the liberty of turning back to listen whether they would resume their quarrel together he began to speak first 
 remain where you are catherine he said without any anger in his voice but with much sorrowful despondency i shall not stay i am neither come to wrangle nor be reconciled but i wish just to learn whether after this events you intend to continue your intimacy with 
 oh for sake interrupted the mistress stamping her foot for sake let us hear no more of it now your cold blood cannot be worked into a fever your veins are full of but mine are boiling and the sight of such chillness makes them dance 
 to get rid of me answer my question persevered mr linton you must answer it and that violence does not alarm me i have found that you can be as stoical as anyone when you please will you give up heathcliff hereafter or will you give up me it is impossible for you to be my friend and his at the same time and i absolutely require to know which you choose 
 i require to be let alone exclaimed catherine furiously i demand it you see i can scarcely stand edgar leave me 
 she rang the bell till it broke with a twang i entered leisurely it was enough to try the temper of a saint such senseless wicked rages there she lay dashing her head against the arm of the sofa and grinding her teeth so that you might fancy she would crash them to splinters mr linton stood looking at her in sudden compunction and fear he told me to fetch some water she had no breath for speaking i brought a glass full and as she would not drink i sprinkled it on her face in a few seconds she stretched herself out stiff and turned up her eyes while her cheeks at once blanched and livid assumed the aspect of death linton looked terrified 
 there is nothing in the world the matter i whispered i did not want him to yield though i could not help being afraid in my heart 
 she has blood on her lips he said shuddering 
 never mind i answered tartly and i told him how she had resolved previous to his coming on exhibiting a fit of frenzy i incautiously gave the account aloud and she heard me for she started hair flying over her shoulders her eyes flashing the muscles of her neck and arms standing out preternaturally i made up my mind for broken bones at least but she only glared about her for an instant and then rushed from the room the master directed me to follow i did to her chamber door she hindered me from going farther by securing it against me 
 as she never offered to descend to breakfast next morning i went to ask whether she would have some carried up no she replied peremptorily the same question was repeated at dinner and tea and again on the morrow after and received the same answer mr linton on his part spent his time in the library and did not inquire concerning his occupations isabella and he had had an interview during which he tried to elicit from her some sentiment of proper horror for advances but he could make nothing of her evasive replies and was obliged to close the examination unsatisfactorily adding however a solemn warning that if she were so insane as to encourage that worthless suitor it would dissolve all bonds of relationship between herself and him

 chapter eleven 
 
 the first of june the kings are off to the seashore tomorrow and free three months i shall enjoy it exclaimed meg coming home one warm day to find jo laid upon the sofa in an unusual state of exhaustion while beth took off her dusty boots and amy made lemonade for the refreshment of the whole party 
 aunt march went today for which oh be joyful said jo i was mortally afraid ask me to go with her if she had i should have felt as if i ought to do it but plumfield is about as gay as a churchyard you know and rather be excused we had a flurry getting the old lady off and i had a fright every time she spoke to me for i was in such a hurry to be through that i was uncommonly helpful and sweet and feared find it impossible to part from me i quaked till she was fairly in the carriage and had a final fright for as it drove of she popped out her head saying josyphine you i hear any more for i basely turned and fled i did actually run and whisked round the corner whee i felt safe 
 poor old jo she came in looking as if bears were after her said beth as she cuddled her feet with a motherly air 
 aunt march is a regular samphire is she not observed amy tasting her mixture critically 
 she means vampire not seaweed but it matter too warm to be particular about parts of speech murmured jo 
 what shall you do all your vacation asked amy changing the subject with tact 
 i shall lie abed late and do nothing replied meg from the depths of the rocking chair been routed up early all winter and had to spend my days working for other people so now going to rest and revel to my content 
 no said jo that dozy way suit me laid in a heap of books and going to improve my shining hours reading on my perch in the old apple tree when not having l 
 say larks implored amy as a return snub for the samphire correction 
 say nightingales then with laurie proper and appropriate since a warbler 
 let us do any lessons beth for a while but play all the time and rest as the girls mean to proposed amy 
 well i will if mother mind i want to learn some new songs and my children need fitting up for the summer they are dreadfully out of order and really suffering for clothes 
 may we mother asked meg turning to mrs march who sat sewing in what they called corner you may try your experiment for a week and see how you like it i think by saturday night you will find that all play and no work is as bad as all work and no play 
 oh dear no it will be delicious sure said meg complacently 
 i now propose a toast as my friend and pardner sairy gamp says fun forever and no grubbing cried jo rising glass in hand as the lemonade went round 
 they all drank it merrily and began the experiment by lounging for the rest of the day next morning meg did not appear till ten her solitary breakfast did not taste nice and the room seemed lonely and untidy for jo had not filled the vases beth had not dusted and books lay scattered about nothing was neat and pleasant but corner which looked as usual and there meg sat to rest and read which meant to yawn and imagine what pretty summer dresses she would get with her salary jo spent the morning on the river with laurie and the afternoon reading and crying over the wide wide world up in the apple tree beth began by rummaging everything out of the big closet where her family resided but getting tired before half done she left her establishment and went to her music rejoicing that she had no dishes to wash amy arranged her bower put on her best white frock smoothed her curls and sat down to draw under the honeysuckle hoping someone would see and inquire who the young artist was as no one appeared but an inquisitive who examined her work with interest she went to walk got caught in a shower and came home dripping 
 at teatime they compared notes and all agreed that it had been a delightful though unusually long day meg who went shopping in the afternoon and got a sweet blue muslin had discovered after she had cut the breadths off that it wash which mishap made her slightly cross jo had burned the skin off her nose boating and got a raging headache by reading too long beth was worried by the confusion of her closet and the difficulty of learning three or four songs at once and amy deeply regretted the damage done her frock for katy party was to be the next day and now like flora mcflimsey she had nothing to wear but these were mere trifles and they assured their mother that the experiment was working finely she smiled said nothing and with help did their neglected work keeping home pleasant and the domestic machinery running smoothly it was astonishing what a peculiar and uncomfortable state of things was produced by the resting and reveling process the days kept getting longer and longer the weather was unusually variable and so were tempers and unsettled feeling possessed everyone and satan found plenty of mischief for the idle hands to do as the height of luxury meg put out some of her sewing and then found time hang so heavily that she fell to snipping and spoiling her clothes in her attempts to furbish them up moffat jo read till her eyes gave out and she was sick of books got so fidgety that even laurie had a quarrel with her and so reduced in spirits that she desperately wished she had gone with aunt march beth got on pretty well for she was constantly forgetting that it was to be all play and no work and fell back into her old ways now and then but something in the air affected her and more than once her tranquility was much disturbed so much so that on one occasion she actually shook poor dear joanna and told her she was a fright amy fared worst of all for her resources were small and when her sisters left her to amuse herself she soon found that accomplished and important little self a great burden she like dolls fairy tales were childish and one draw all the time tea parties amount to much neither did picnics unless very well conducted if one could have a fine house full of nice girls or go traveling the summer would be delightful but to stay at home with three selfish sisters and a boy was enough to try the patience of a boaz complained miss malaprop after several days devoted to pleasure fretting and ennui 
 no one would own that they were tired of the experiment but by friday night each acknowledged to herself that she was glad the week was nearly done hoping to impress the lesson more deeply mrs march who had a good deal of humor resolved to finish off the trial in an appropriate manner so she gave hannah a holiday and let the girls enjoy the full effect of the play system 
 when they got up on saturday morning there was no fire in the kitchen no breakfast in the dining room and no mother anywhere to be seen 
 mercy on us what has happened cried jo staring about her in dismay 
 meg ran upstairs and soon came back again looking relieved but rather bewildered and a little ashamed 
 mother sick only very tired and she says she is going to stay quietly in her room all day and let us do the best we can a very queer thing for her to do she act a bit like herself but she says it has been a hard week for her so we grumble but take care of ourselves 
 easy enough and i like the idea aching for something to do that is some new amusement you know added jo quickly 
 in fact it was an immense relief to them all to have a little work and they took hold with a will but soon realized the truth of saying housekeeping no joke there was plenty of food in the larder and while beth and amy set the table meg and jo got breakfast wondering as they did why servants ever talked about hard work 
 i shall take some up to mother though she said we were not to think of her for take care of herself said meg who presided and felt quite matronly behind the teapot 
 so a tray was fitted out before anyone began and taken up with the compliments the boiled tea was very bitter the omelet scorched and the biscuits speckled with saleratus but mrs march received her repast with thanks and laughed heartily over it after jo was gone 
 poor little souls they will have a hard time afraid but they suffer and it will do them good she said producing the more palatable viands with which she had provided herself and disposing of the bad breakfast so that their feelings might not be hurt a motherly little deception for which they were grateful 
 many were the complaints below and great the chagrin of the head cook at her failures never mind get the dinner and be servant you be mistress keep your hands nice see company and give orders said jo who knew still less than meg about culinary affairs 
 this obliging offer was gladly accepted and margaret retired to the parlor which she hastily put in order by whisking the litter under the sofa and shutting the blinds to save the trouble of dusting jo with perfect faith in her own powers and a friendly desire to make up the quarrel immediately put a note in the office inviting laurie to dinner 
 better see what you have got before you think of having company said meg when informed of the hospitable but rash act 
 oh corned beef and plenty of poatoes and i shall get some asparagus and a lobster for a relish as hannah says have lettuce and make a salad i know how but the book tells have blancmange and strawberries for dessert and coffee too if you want to be elegant 
 try too many messes jo for you make anything but gingerbread and molasses candy fit to eat i wash my hands of the dinner party and since you have asked laurie on your own responsibility you may just take care of him 
 i want you to do anything but be civil to him and help to the pudding give me your advice if i get in a muddle you asked jo rather hurt 
 yes but i know much except about bread and a few trifles you had better ask leave before you order anything returned meg prudently 
 of course i shall not a fool and jo went off in a huff at the doubts expressed of her powers 
 get what you like and disturb me going out to dinner and worry about things at home said mrs march when jo spoke to her i never enjoyed housekeeping and going to take a vacation today and read write go visiting and amuse myself 
 the unusual spectacle of her busy mother rocking comfortably and reading early in the morning made jo feel as if some unnatural phenomenon had occurred for an eclipse an earthquake or a volcanic eruption would hardly have seemed stranger 
 everything is out of sorts somehow she said to herself going downstairs beth crying a sure sign that something is wrong in this family if amy is bothering shake her 
 feeling very much out of sorts herself jo hurried into the parlor to find beth sobbing over pip the canary who lay dead in the cage with his little claws pathetically extended as if imploring the food for want of which he had died 
 all my fault i forgot him there a seed or a drop left oh pip oh pip how could i be so cruel to you cried beth taking the poor thing in her hands and trying to restore him 
 jo peeped into his eye felt his little heart and finding him stiff and cold shook her head and offered her domino box for a coffin 
 put him in the oven and maybe his will get warm and revive said amy hopefully 
 been starved and he be baked now dead make him a shroud and he shall be buried in the garden and never have another bird never my pip for i am too bad to own one murmured beth sitting on the floor with her pet folded in her hands the funeral shall be this afternoon and we will all go now cry bethy a pity but nothing goes right this week and pip has had the worst of the experiment make the shroud and lay him in my box and after the dinner party have a nice little funeral said jo beginning to feel as if she had undertaken a good deal 
 leaving the others to console beth she departed to the kitchen which was in a most discouraging state of confusion putting on a big apron she fell to work and got the dishes piled up ready for washing when she discovered that the fire was out 
 a sweet prospect muttered jo slamming the stove door open and poking vigorously among the cinders 
 having rekindled the fire she thought she would go to market while the water heated the walk revived her spirits and flattering herself that she had made good bargins she trudged home again after buying a very young lobster some very old asparagus and two boxes of acid strawberries by the time she got cleared up the dinner arrived and the stove was hannah had left a pan of bread to rise meg had worked it up early set it on the hearth for a second rising and forgotten it meg was entertaining sallie gardiner in the parlor when the door flew open and a floury crocky flushed and disheveled figure appeared demanding tartly 
 i say bread riz enough when it runs over the pans 
 sallie began to laugh but meg nodded and lifted her eyebrows as high as they would go which caused the apparition to vanish and put the sour bread into the oven without further delay mrs march went out after peeping here and there to see how matters went also saying a word of comfort to beth who sat making a winding sheet while the dear departed lay in state in the domino box a strange sense of helplessness fell upon the girls as the gray bonnet vanished round the corner and despair seized them when a few minutes later miss crocker appeared and said come to dinner now this lady was a thin yellow spinster with a sharp nose and inquisitive eyes who saw everything and gossiped about all she saw they disliked her but had been taught to be kind to her simply because she was old and poor and had few friends so meg gave her the easy chair and tried to entertain her while she asked questions critsized everything and told stories of the people whom she knew 
 language cannot describe the anxieties experiences and exertions which jo underwent that morning and the dinner she served up became a standing joke fearing to ask any more advice she did her best alone and discovered that something more than energy and good will is necessary to make a cook she boiled the asparagus for an hour and wasgrieved to find the heads cooked off and the stalks harder than ever the bread burned black for the salad dressing so aggravated her that she could not make it fit to ear the lobster was a scarlet mystery to her but she hammered and poked till it was unshelled and its meagerproportions concealed in a grove of lettuce leaves the potatoes had to be hurried not to keep the asparagus waiting and were not done at the last the blancmange was lumpy and the strawberries not as ripe as they looked having been skilfully deaconed 
 well they can eat beef and bread and butter if they are hungry only mortifying to have to spend your whole morning for nothing thought jo as she rang the bell half an hour later than usual and stood hot tired and dispirited surveying the feast spread before laurie accustomed to all sorts of elegance and miss crocker whose tattling tongue would report them far and wide 
 poor jo would gladly have gone under the table as one thing after another was tasted and left while amy giggled meg looked distressed miss crocker pursed her lips and laurie talked and laughed with all his might to give a cheerful tone to the festive scene one strong point was the fruit for she had sugared it well and had a pitcher of rich cream to eat with it her hot cheeks cooled a trifle and she drew a long breath as the pretty glass plates went round and everyone looked graciously at the little rosy islands floating in a sea of cream miss crocker tasted first made a wry face and drank some water hastily jo who refused thinking there might not be enough for they dwindled sadly after the picking over glanced at laurie but he was eating away manfully though there was a slight pucker about his mouth and he kept his eye fixed on his plate amy who was fond of delicate fare took a heaping spoonful choked hid her face in her napkin and left the table precipitately 
 oh what is it exclaimed jo trembling 
 salt instead of sugar and the cream is sour replied meg with a tragic gesture 
 jo uttered a groan and fell back in her chair remembering that she had given a last hasty powdering to the berries out of one of the two boxes on the kitchen table and had neglected to put the milk in the refrigerator she turned scarlet and was on the verge of crying when she met eyes which would look merry in spite of his heroic efforts the comical side of the affair suddenly struck her and she laughed till the tears ran down her cheeks so did everyone else even croaker as the girls called the old lady and the unfortunate dinner ended gaily with bread and butter olives and fun 
 i strength of mind enough to clear up now so we will sober ourselves with a funeral said jo as they rose and miss crocker made ready to go being eager to tell the new story at another dinner table 
 they did sober themselves for sake laurie dug a grave under the ferns in the grove little pip was laid in with many tears by his mistress and covered with moss while a wreath of violets and chickweed was hung on the stone which bore his epitaph composed by jo while she struggled with the dinner 
 here lies pip march 
 who died the th of june 
 loved and lamented sore 
 and not forgotten soon 
 at the conclusion of the ceremonies beth retired to her room overcome with emotion and lobster but there was no place of repose for the beds were not made and she found her grief much assuaged by beating up the pillows and putting things in order meg helped jo clear away the remains of the feast which took half the afternoon and left them so tired that they agreed to be contented with tea and toast for supper 
 laurie took amy to drive which was a deed of charity for the sour cream seemed to have had a bad effect upon her temper mrs march came home to find the three older girls hard at work in the middle of the afternoon and a glance at the closet gave her an idea of the success of one part of the experiment 
 before the housewives could rest several people called and there was a scramble to get ready to see them then tea must be got errands done and one or two necessary bits of sewing neglected until the last minute as twilight fell dewy and still one by one they gathered on the porch where the june roses were budding beautifully and each groaned or sighed as she sat down as if tired or troubled 
 what a dreadful day this has been began jo usually the first to speak 
 it has seemed shorter than usual but so uncomfortable said meg 
 not a bit like home added amy 
 it seem so without marmee and little pip sighed beth glancing with full eyes at the empty cage above her head 
 mother dear and you shall have another bird tomorrow if you want it 
 as she spoke mrs march came and took her place among them looking as if her holiday had not been much pleasanter than theirs 
 are you satisfied with your experiment girls or do you want another week of it she asked as beth nestled up to her and the rest turned toward her with brightening faces as flowers turn toward the sun 
 i cried jo decidedly 
 nor i echoed the others 
 you think then that it is better to have a few duties and live a little for others do you 
 lounging and larking pay observed jo shaking her head tired of it and mean to go to work at something right off 
 suppose you learn plain cooking a useful accomplishment which no woman should be without said mrs march laughing inaudibly at the recollection of dinner party for she had met miss crocker and heard her account of it 
 mother did you go away and let everything be just to see how get on cried meg who had had suspicions all day 
 yes i wanted you to see how the comfort of all depends on each doing her share faithfully while hannah and i did your work you got on pretty well though i think you were very happy or amiable so i thought as a little lesson i would show you what happens when everyone thinks only of herself you feel that it is pleasanter to help one another to have daily duties which make leisure sweet when it comes and to bear and forbear that home may be comfortable and lovely to us all 
 we do mother we do cried the girls 
 then let me advise you to take up your little burdens again for though they seem heavy sometimes they are good for us and lighten as we learn to carry them work is wholesome and there is plenty for everyone it keeps us from ennui and mischief is good for health and spirits and gives us a sense of power and independence better than money or fashion 
 work like bees and love it too see if we said jo learn plain cooking for my holiday task and the dinner party i have shall be a success 
 make the set of shirts for father instead of letting you do it marmee i can and i will though not fond of sewing that will be better than fussing over my own things which are plenty nice enough as they are said meg 
 do my lessons every day and not spend so much time with my music and dolls i am a stupid thing and ought to be studying not playing was resolution while amy followed their example by heroically declaring i shall learn to make buttonholes and attend to my parts of speech 
 very good then i am quite satisfied with the experiment and fancy that we shall not have to repeat it only go to the other extreme and delve like slaves have regular hours for work and play make each day both useful and pleasant and prove that you understand the worth of time by employing it well then youth will be delightful old age will bring few regrets and life become a beautiful success in spite of poverty 
 remember mother and they did

 no said jo that dozy way suit me laid in a heap of books and going to improve my shining hours reading on my perch in the old apple tree when not having l 
 say larks implored amy as a return snub for the samphire correction 
 say nightingales then with laurie proper and appropriate since a warbler 
 let us do any lessons beth for a while but play all the time and rest as the girls mean to proposed amy 
 well i will if mother mind i want to learn some new songs and my children need fitting up for the summer they are dreadfully out of order and really suffering for clothes 
 may we mother asked meg turning to mrs march who sat sewing in what they called corner you may try your experiment for a week and see how you like it i think by saturday night you will find that all play and no work is as bad as all work and no play 
 oh dear no it will be delicious sure said meg complacently 
 i now propose a toast as my friend and pardner sairy gamp says fun forever and no grubbing cried jo rising glass in hand as the lemonade went round 
 they all drank it merrily and began the experiment by lounging for the rest of the day next morning meg did not appear till ten her solitary breakfast did not taste nice and the room seemed lonely and untidy for jo had not filled the vases beth had not dusted and books lay scattered about nothing was neat and pleasant but corner which looked as usual and there meg sat to rest and read which meant to yawn and imagine what pretty summer dresses she would get with her salary jo spent the morning on the river with laurie and the afternoon reading and crying over the wide wide world up in the apple tree beth began by rummaging everything out of the big closet where her family resided but getting tired before half done she left her establishment and went to her music rejoicing that she had no dishes to wash amy arranged her bower put on her best white frock smoothed her curls and sat down to draw under the honeysuckle hoping someone would see and inquire who the young artist was as no one appeared but an inquisitive who examined her work with interest she went to walk got caught in a shower and came home dripping 
 at teatime they compared notes and all agreed that it had been a delightful though unusually long day meg who went shopping in the afternoon and got a sweet blue muslin had discovered after she had cut the breadths off that it wash which mishap made her slightly cross jo had burned the skin off her nose boating and got a raging headache by reading too long beth was worried by the confusion of her closet and the difficulty of learning three or four songs at once and amy deeply regretted the damage done her frock for katy party was to be the next day and now like flora mcflimsey she had nothing to wear but these were mere trifles and they assured their mother that the experiment was working finely she smiled said nothing and with help did their neglected work keeping home pleasant and the domestic machinery running smoothly it was astonishing what a peculiar and uncomfortable state of things was produced by the resting and reveling process the days kept getting longer and longer the weather was unusually variable and so were tempers and unsettled feeling possessed everyone and satan found plenty of mischief for the idle hands to do as the height of luxury meg put out some of her sewing and then found time hang so heavily that she fell to snipping and spoiling her clothes in her attempts to furbish them up moffat jo read till her eyes gave out and she was sick of books got so fidgety that even laurie had a quarrel with her and so reduced in spirits that she desperately wished she had gone with aunt march beth got on pretty well for she was constantly forgetting that it was to be all play and no work and fell back into her old ways now and then but something in the air affected her and more than once her tranquility was much disturbed so much so that on one occasion she actually shook poor dear joanna and told her she was a fright amy fared worst of all for her resources were small and when her sisters left her to amuse herself she soon found that accomplished and important little self a great burden she like dolls fairy tales were childish and one draw all the time tea parties amount to much neither did picnics unless very well conducted if one could have a fine house full of nice girls or go traveling the summer would be delightful but to stay at home with three selfish sisters and a boy was enough to try the patience of a boaz complained miss malaprop after several days devoted to pleasure fretting and ennui 
 no one would own that they were tired of the experiment but by friday night each acknowledged to herself that she was glad the week was nearly done hoping to impress the lesson more deeply mrs march who had a good deal of humor resolved to finish off the trial in an appropriate manner so she gave hannah a holiday and let the girls enjoy the full effect of the play system 
 when they got up on saturday morning there was no fire in the kitchen no breakfast in the dining room and no mother anywhere to be seen 
 mercy on us what has happened cried jo staring about her in dismay 
 meg ran upstairs and soon came back again looking relieved but rather bewildered and a little ashamed 
 mother sick only very tired and she says she is going to stay quietly in her room all day and let us do the best we can a very queer thing for her to do she act a bit like herself but she says it has been a hard week for her so we grumble but take care of ourselves 
 easy enough and i like the idea aching for something to do that is some new amusement you know added jo quickly 
 in fact it was an immense relief to them all to have a little work and they took hold with a will but soon realized the truth of saying housekeeping no joke there was plenty of food in the larder and while beth and amy set the table meg and jo got breakfast wondering as they did why servants ever talked about hard work 
 i shall take some up to mother though she said we were not to think of her for take care of herself said meg who presided and felt quite matronly behind the teapot 
 so a tray was fitted out before anyone began and taken up with the compliments the boiled tea was very bitter the omelet scorched and the biscuits speckled with saleratus but mrs march received her repast with thanks and laughed heartily over it after jo was gone 
 poor little souls they will have a hard time afraid but they suffer and it will do them good she said producing the more palatable viands with which she had provided herself and disposing of the bad breakfast so that their feelings might not be hurt a motherly little deception for which they were grateful 
 many were the complaints below and great the chagrin of the head cook at her failures never mind get the dinner and be servant you be mistress keep your hands nice see company and give orders said jo who knew still less than meg about culinary affairs 
 this obliging offer was gladly accepted and margaret retired to the parlor which she hastily put in order by whisking the litter under the sofa and shutting the blinds to save the trouble of dusting jo with perfect faith in her own powers and a friendly desire to make up the quarrel immediately put a note in the office inviting laurie to dinner 
 better see what you have got before you think of having company said meg when informed of the hospitable but rash act 
 oh corned beef and plenty of poatoes and i shall get some asparagus and a lobster for a relish as hannah says have lettuce and make a salad i know how but the book tells have blancmange and strawberries for dessert and coffee too if you want to be elegant 
 try too many messes jo for you make anything but gingerbread and molasses candy fit to eat i wash my hands of the dinner party and since you have asked laurie on your own responsibility you may just take care of him 
 i want you to do anything but be civil to him and help to the pudding give me your advice if i get in a muddle you asked jo rather hurt 
 yes but i know much except about bread and a few trifles you had better ask leave before you order anything returned meg prudently 
 of course i shall not a fool and jo went off in a huff at the doubts expressed of her powers 
 get what you like and disturb me going out to dinner and worry about things at home said mrs march when jo spoke to her i never enjoyed housekeeping and going to take a vacation today and read write go visiting and amuse myself 
 the unusual spectacle of her busy mother rocking comfortably and reading early in the morning made jo feel as if some unnatural phenomenon had occurred for an eclipse an earthquake or a volcanic eruption would hardly have seemed stranger 
 everything is out of sorts somehow she said to herself going downstairs beth crying a sure sign that something is wrong in this family if amy is bothering shake her 
 feeling very much out of sorts herself jo hurried into the parlor to find beth sobbing over pip the canary who lay dead in the cage with his little claws pathetically extended as if imploring the food for want of which he had died 
 all my fault i forgot him there a seed or a drop left oh pip oh pip how could i be so cruel to you cried beth taking the poor thing in her hands and trying to restore him 
 jo peeped into his eye felt his little heart and finding him stiff and cold shook her head and offered her domino box for a coffin 
 put him in the oven and maybe his will get warm and revive said amy hopefully 
 been starved and he be baked now dead make him a shroud and he shall be buried in the garden and never have another bird never my pip for i am too bad to own one murmured beth sitting on the floor with her pet folded in her hands the funeral shall be this afternoon and we will all go now cry bethy a pity but nothing goes right this week and pip has had the worst of the experiment make the shroud and lay him in my box and after the dinner party have a nice little funeral said jo beginning to feel as if she had undertaken a good deal 
 leaving the others to console beth she departed to the kitchen which was in a most discouraging state of confusion putting on a big apron she fell to work and got the dishes piled up ready for washing when she discovered that the fire was out 
 a sweet prospect muttered jo slamming the stove door open and poking vigorously among the cinders 
 having rekindled the fire she thought she would go to market while the water heated the walk revived her spirits and flattering herself that she had made good bargins she trudged home again after buying a very young lobster some very old asparagus and two boxes of acid strawberries by the time she got cleared up the dinner arrived and the stove was hannah had left a pan of bread to rise meg had worked it up early set it on the hearth for a second rising and forgotten it meg was entertaining sallie gardiner in the parlor when the door flew open and a floury crocky flushed and disheveled figure appeared demanding tartly 
 i say bread riz enough when it runs over the pans 
 sallie began to laugh but meg nodded and lifted her eyebrows as high as they would go which caused the apparition to vanish and put the sour bread into the oven without further delay mrs march went out after peeping here and there to see how matters went also saying a word of comfort to beth who sat making a winding sheet while the dear departed lay in state in the domino box a strange sense of helplessness fell upon the girls as the gray bonnet vanished round the corner and despair seized them when a few minutes later miss crocker appeared and said come to dinner now this lady was a thin yellow spinster with a sharp nose and inquisitive eyes who saw everything and gossiped about all she saw they disliked her but had been taught to be kind to her simply because she was old and poor and had few friends so meg gave her the easy chair and tried to entertain her while she asked questions critsized everything and told stories of the people whom she knew 
 language cannot describe the anxieties experiences and exertions which jo underwent that morning and the dinner she served up became a standing joke fearing to ask any more advice she did her best alone and discovered that something more than energy and good will is necessary to make a cook she boiled the asparagus for an hour and wasgrieved to find the heads cooked off and the stalks harder than ever the bread burned black for the salad dressing so aggravated her that she could not make it fit to ear the lobster was a scarlet mystery to her but she hammered and poked till it was unshelled and its meagerproportions concealed in a grove of lettuce leaves the potatoes had to be hurried not to keep the asparagus waiting and were not done at the last the blancmange was lumpy and the strawberries not as ripe as they looked having been skilfully deaconed 
 well they can eat beef and bread and butter if they are hungry only mortifying to have to spend your whole morning for nothing thought jo as she rang the bell half an hour later than usual and stood hot tired and dispirited surveying the feast spread before laurie accustomed to all sorts of elegance and miss crocker whose tattling tongue would report them far and wide 
 poor jo would gladly have gone under the table as one thing after another was tasted and left while amy giggled meg looked distressed miss crocker pursed her lips and laurie talked and laughed with all his might to give a cheerful tone to the festive scene one strong point was the fruit for she had sugared it well and had a pitcher of rich cream to eat with it her hot cheeks cooled a trifle and she drew a long breath as the pretty glass plates went round and everyone looked graciously at the little rosy islands floating in a sea of cream miss crocker tasted first made a wry face and drank some water hastily jo who refused thinking there might not be enough for they dwindled sadly after the picking over glanced at laurie but he was eating away manfully though there was a slight pucker about his mouth and he kept his eye fixed on his plate amy who was fond of delicate fare took a heaping spoonful choked hid her face in her napkin and left the table precipitately 
 oh what is it exclaimed jo trembling 
 salt instead of sugar and the cream is sour replied meg with a tragic gesture 
 jo uttered a groan and fell back in her chair remembering that she had given a last hasty powdering to the berries out of one of the two boxes on the kitchen table and had neglected to put the milk in the refrigerator she turned scarlet and was on the verge of crying when she met eyes which would look merry in spite of his heroic efforts the comical side of the affair suddenly struck her and she laughed till the tears ran down her cheeks so did everyone else even croaker as the girls called the old lady and the unfortunate dinner ended gaily with bread and butter olives and fun 
 i strength of mind enough to clear up now so we will sober ourselves with a funeral said jo as they rose and miss crocker made ready to go being eager to tell the new story at another dinner table 
 they did sober themselves for sake laurie dug a grave under the ferns in the grove little pip was laid in with many tears by his mistress and covered with moss while a wreath of violets and chickweed was hung on the stone which bore his epitaph composed by jo while she struggled with the dinner 
 here lies pip march 
 who died the th of june 
 loved and lamented sore 
 and not forgotten soon 
 at the conclusion of the ceremonies beth retired to her room overcome with emotion and lobster but there was no place of repose for the beds were not made and she found her grief much assuaged by beating up the pillows and putting things in order meg helped jo clear away the remains of the feast which took half the afternoon and left them so tired that they agreed to be contented with tea and toast for supper 
 laurie took amy to drive which was a deed of charity for the sour cream seemed to have had a bad effect upon her temper mrs march came home to find the three older girls hard at work in the middle of the afternoon and a glance at the closet gave her an idea of the success of one part of the experiment 
 before the housewives could rest several people called and there was a scramble to get ready to see them then tea must be got errands done and one or two necessary bits of sewing neglected until the last minute as twilight fell dewy and still one by one they gathered on the porch where the june roses were budding beautifully and each groaned or sighed as she sat down as if tired or troubled 
 what a dreadful day this has been began jo usually the first to speak 
 it has seemed shorter than usual but so uncomfortable said meg 
 not a bit like home added amy 
 it seem so without marmee and little pip sighed beth glancing with full eyes at the empty cage above her head 
 mother dear and you shall have another bird tomorrow if you want it 
 as she spoke mrs march came and took her place among them looking as if her holiday had not been much pleasanter than theirs 
 are you satisfied with your experiment girls or do you want another week of it she asked as beth nestled up to her and the rest turned toward her with brightening faces as flowers turn toward the sun 
 i cried jo decidedly 
 nor i echoed the others 
 you think then that it is better to have a few duties and live a little for others do you 
 lounging and larking pay observed jo shaking her head tired of it and mean to go to work at something right off 
 suppose you learn plain cooking a useful accomplishment which no woman should be without said mrs march laughing inaudibly at the recollection of dinner party for she had met miss crocker and heard her account of it 
 mother did you go away and let everything be just to see how get on cried meg who had had suspicions all day 
 yes i wanted you to see how the comfort of all depends on each doing her share faithfully while hannah and i did your work you got on pretty well though i think you were very happy or amiable so i thought as a little lesson i would show you what happens when everyone thinks only of herself you feel that it is pleasanter to help one another to have daily duties which make leisure sweet when it comes and to bear and forbear that home may be comfortable and lovely to us all 
 we do mother we do cried the girls 
 then let me advise you to take up your little burdens again for though they seem heavy sometimes they are good for us and lighten as we learn to carry them work is wholesome and there is plenty for everyone it keeps us from ennui and mischief is good for health and spirits and gives us a sense of power and independence better than money or fashion 
 work like bees and love it too see if we said jo learn plain cooking for my holiday task and the dinner party i have shall be a success 
 make the set of shirts for father instead of letting you do it marmee i can and i will though not fond of sewing that will be better than fussing over my own things which are plenty nice enough as they are said meg 
 do my lessons every day and not spend so much time with my music and dolls i am a stupid thing and ought to be studying not playing was resolution while amy followed their example by heroically declaring i shall learn to make buttonholes and attend to my parts of speech 
 very good then i am quite satisfied with the experiment and fancy that we shall not have to repeat it only go to the other extreme and delve like slaves have regular hours for work and play make each day both useful and pleasant and prove that you understand the worth of time by employing it well then youth will be delightful old age will bring few regrets and life become a beautiful success in spite of poverty 
 remember mother and they did

 away over a dune gives it a salute the plane 
 vanishes over the dune and into the swirling sand

 jonathan and ardeth bay come down a ravine in the 
 volcano and look out over the ruins of hamunaptra

 ears and a face like a falcon

 hamunaptra stairway day 
 carrying torches jonathan and ardeth bay make 
 their way down a long winding narrow staircase heading 
 into the bowels of the necropolis a passageway to hell 
 necropolis day 
 evelyn follows imhotep into the underground cemetery 
 she stops at the sight of all the big hairy rats scurrying 
 through the mausoleums and over the gravestones beni shoves 
 his rifle into her back and pushes her forward 
 beni 
 keep moving 
 evelyn gives him a look 
 evelyn 
 you know nasty little fellows 
 such as yourself always get 
 their comeuppance 
 beni suddenly looks worried 
 beni

 beni looks even more worried he nervously starts chewing on 
 his lip all three of them walk over the bridge crossing the 
 disgusting detritus moat evelyn looks down at it horrified 
 int passageway day

 doorway jonathan notices an amethyst scarab on the far wall 
 jonathan 
 i say look at that 
 he walks over and tries to jiggle it free it comes loose in 
 his hand he looks at the scarab in his palm it starts to 
 glow and then something inside it starts to wiggle 
 jonathan 
 say gents you should come 
 have a look at this 
 the wiggling continues a long agonizing beat and then the 
 scarab breaks out of cocoon and instantly burrows into 
 palm jonathan starts to freak out and scream 
 runs up and rips the arm off shirt the 
 scarab is now burrowing up arm whips 
 out his snaps it open and grabs 
 arm eyes widen in terror as the knife passes in 
 front of his face jonathan screams louder obviously being 
 cut open hand flicks something away 
 the scarab hits the floor and immediately starts scurrying 
 back towards jonathan wanting to finish the job 
 pulls out his gun and blows it away blam 
 int cemetery day 
 the gunshot echoes into the cemetery as imhotep evelyn and 
 beni to the strange altar where four thousand years 
 ago imhotep tried to bring back to life 
 imhotep scowls at the sound and angrily reaches into a 
 canopic jar he pulls out the crusted remains of 
 heart crushes it to dust in his hand and starts 
 reading from the book of the dead then he blows the dust 
 against a mausoleum wall the wall starts to come alive 
 evelyn and beni stare at the wall both of them 
 two forms emerge from the wall 
 mummified corpses two of long dead priests they 
 bow to turn and move off down a passageway 
 int passageway day 
 helps ardeth bay mend wound 
 
 from now on touch anything 
 not a damn thing keep your hands 
 off the furniture got it 
 jonathan swallows hard and nods vigorously

lionfish nov chapter eleven the dueling clubcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 harry woke up on sunday morning to find the dormitory blazing with winter sunlight and his arm reboned but very stiff he sat up quickly and looked over at bed but it had been blocked from view by the high curtains harry had changed behind yesterday seeing that he was awake madam pomfrey came bustling over with a breakfast tray and then began bending and stretching his arm and fingers 
 
 all in order she said as he clumsily fed himself porridge when finished eating you may leave 
 
 harry dressed as quickly as he could and hurried off to gryffindor tower desperate to tell ron and hermione about colin and dobby but they there harry left to look for them wondering where they could have got to and feeling slightly hurt that they interested in whether he had his bones back or not 
 
 as harry passed the library percy weasley strolled out of it looking in far better spirits than last time met 
 
 oh hello harry he said excellent flying yesterday really excellent gryffindor has just taken the lead for the house cup you earned fifty points 
 
 you seen ron or hermione have you said harry 
 
 no i said percy his smile fading i hope not in another 
 
 harry forced a laugh watched percy walk out of sight and then headed straight for moaning bathroom he see why ron and hermione would be in there again but after making sure that neither filch nor any prefects were around he opened the door and heard their voices coming from a locked stall 
 
 me he said closing the door behind him there was a clunk a splash and a gasp from within the stall and he saw eye peering through the keyhole 
 
 harry she said you gave us such a fright come in your arm 
 
 fine said harry squeezing into the stall an old cauldron was perched on the toilet and a crackling from under the rim told harry they had lit a fire beneath it conjuring up portable waterproof fires was a speciality of 
 
 come to meet you but we decided to get started on the polyjuice potion ron explained as harry with difficulty locked the stall again decided this is the safest place to hide it 
 
 harry started to tell them about colin but hermione interrupted 
 
 we already know we heard professor mcgonagall telling professor flitwick this morning why we decided better get going 
 
 the sooner we get a confession out of malfoy the better snarled ron know what i think he was in such a foul temper after the quidditch match he took it out on colin 
 
 something else said harry watching hermione tearing bundles of knotgrass and throwing them into the potion dobby came to visit me in the middle of the night 
 
 ron and hermione looked up amazed harry told them everything dobby had told him or told him hermione and ron listened with their mouths open 
 
 the chamber of secrets has been opened before hermione said 
 
 this settles it said ron in a triumphant voice lucius malfoy opened the chamber when he was at school here and now told dear old draco how to do it obvious wish told you what kind of in there though i want to know how come noticed it sneaking around the school 
 
 maybe it can make itself invisible said hermione prodding leeches to the bottom of the cauldron or maybe it can disguise itself pretend to be a suit of armor or something read about chameleon ghouls 
 
 you read too much hermione said ron pouring dead lacewings on top of the leeches he crumpled up the empty lacewing bag and looked at harry 
 
 so dobby stopped us from getting on the train and broke your arm he shook his head you know what harry if he stop trying to save your life going to kill you 
 
 the news that colin creevey had been attacked and was now lying as though dead in the hospital wing had spread through the entire school by monday morning the air was suddenly thick with rumor and suspicion the first years were now moving around the castle in groups as though scared they would be attacked if they ventured forth alone 
 
 ginny weasley who sat next to colin creevey in charms was distraught but harry felt that fred and george were going the wrong way about cheering her up they were taking turns covering themselves with fur or boils and jumping out at her from behind statues they only stopped when percy apoplectic with rage told them he was going to write to mrs weasley and tell her ginny was having nightmares 
 
 meanwhile hidden from the teachers a roaring trade in talismans amulets and other protective devices was sweeping the school neville longbottom bought a large green onion a pointed purple crystal and a rotting newt tail before the other gryffindor boys pointed out that he was in no danger he was a and therefore unlikely to be attacked 
 
 they went for filch first neville said his round face fearful and everyone knows almost a squib 
 
 in the second week of december professor mcgonagall came around as usual collecting names of those who would be staying at school for christmas harry ron and hermione signed her list they had heard that malfoy was staying which struck them as very suspicious the holidays would be the perfect time to use the polyjuice potion and try to worm a confession out of him 
 
 unfortunately the potion was only half finished they still needed the bicorn horn and the boomslang skin and the only place they were going to get them was from private stores harry privately felt rather face legendary monster than let snape catch him robbing his office 
 
 what we need said hermione briskly as thursday double potions lesson loomed nearer is a diversion then one of us can sneak into office and take what we need harry and ron looked at her nervously 
 
 i think better do the actual stealing hermione continued in a tone you two will be expelled if you get into any more trouble and got a clean record so all you need to do is cause enough mayhem to keep snape busy for five minutes or so 
 
 harry smiled feebly deliberately causing mayhem in potions class was about as safe as poking a sleeping dragon in the eye 
 
 potions lessons took place in one of the large dungeons thursday lesson proceeded in the usual way twenty cauldrons stood steaming between the wooden desks on which stood brass scales and jars of ingredients snape prowled through the fumes making waspish remarks about the while the slytherins sniggered appreciatively draco malfoy who was favorite student kept flicking eyes at ron and harry who knew that if they retaliated they would get detention faster than you could say unfair 
 
 swelling solution was far too runny but he had his mind on more important things he was waiting for signal and he hardly listened as snape paused to sneer at his watery potion when snape turned and walked off to bully neville hermione caught eye and nodded 
 
 harry ducked swiftly down behind his cauldron pulled one of filibuster fireworks out of his pocket and gave it a quick prod with his wand the firework began to fizz and sputter knowing he had only seconds harry straightened up took aim and lobbed it into the air it landed right on target in cauldron 
 
 potion exploded showering the whole class people shrieked as splashes of the swelling solution hit them malfoy got a faceful and his nose began to swell like a balloon goyle blundered around his hands over his eyes which had expanded to the size of a dinner plate snape was trying to restore calm and find out what had happened through the confusion harry saw hermione slip quietly into office 
 
 silence silence snape roared anyone who has been splashed come here for a deflating draft when i find out who did this 
 
 harry tried not to laugh as he watched malfoy hurry forward his head drooping with the weight of a nose like a small melon as half the class lumbered up to desk some weighted down with arms like clubs others unable to talk through gigantic lips harry saw hermione slide back into the dungeon the front of her robes bulging 
 
 when everyone had taken a swig of antidote and the various swellings had subsided snape swept over to cauldron and scooped out the twisted black remains of the firework there was a sudden hush 
 
 if i ever find out who threw this snape whispered i shall make sure that person is expelled 
 
 harry arranged his face into what he hoped was a puzzled expression snape was looking right at him and the bell that rang ten minutes later could not have been more welcome 
 
 he knew it was me harry told ron and hermione as they hurried back to moaning bathroom i could tell 
 
 hermione threw the new ingredients into the cauldron and began to stir feverishly 
 
 be ready in two weeks she said happily 
 
 snape prove it was you said ron reassuringly to harry what can he do 
 
 knowing snape something foul said harry as the potion frothed and bubbled 
 
 a week later harry ron and hermione were walking across the entrance hall when they saw a small knot of people gathered around the notice board reading a piece of parchment that had just been pinned up seamus finnigan and dean thomas beckoned them over looking excited 
 
 starting a dueling club said seamus first meeting tonight i mind dueling lessons they might come in handy one of these days 
 
 what you reckon monster can duel said ron but he too read the sign with interest 
 
 could be useful he said to harry and hermione as they went into dinner shall we go 
 
 harry and hermione were all for it so at eight that evening they hurried back to the great hall the long dining tables had vanished and a golden stage had appeared along one wall lit by thousands of candles floating overhead the ceiling was velvety black once more and most of the school eemed to be packed beneath it all carrying their wands and looking excited 
 
 i wonder be teaching us said hermione as they edged into the chattering crowd someone told me flitwick was a dueling champion when he was young maybe be him 
 
 as long as not harry began but he ended on a groan gilderoy lockhart was walking onto the stage resplendent in robes of deep plum and accompanied by none other than snape wearing his usual black 
 
 lockhart waved an arm for silence and called gather round gather round can everyone see me can you all hear me excellent 
 
 now professor dumbledore has granted me permission to start this little dueling club to train you all in case you ever need to defend yourselves as i myself have done on countless occasions for full details see my published works 
 
 let me introduce my assistant professor snape said lockhart flashing a wide smile he tells me he knows a tiny little bit about dueling himself and has sportingly agreed to help me with a short demonstration before we begin now i want any of you youngsters to worry still have your potions master when through with him never fear 
 
 it be good if they finished each other off ron muttered in ear 
 
 upper lip was curling harry wondered why lockhart was still smiling if snape had been looking at him like that have been running as fast as he could in the opposite direction 
 
 lockhart and snape turned to face each other and bowed at least lockhart did with much twirling of his hands whereas snape jerked his head irritably then they raised their wands like swords in front of them 
 
 as you see we are holding our wands in the accepted combative position lockhart told the silent crowd on the count of three we will cast our first spells neither of us will be aiming to kill of course 
 
 i bet on that harry murmured watching snape baring his teeth 
 
 one two three 
 
 both of them swung their wands above their heads and pointed them at their opponent snape cried expelliarmus there was a dazzling flash of scarlet light and lockhart was blasted off his feet he flew backward off the stage smashed into the wall and slid down it to sprawl on the floor 
 
 malfoy and some of the other slytherins cheered hermione was dancing on tiptoes do you think all right she squealed through her fingers 
 
 who cares said harry and ron together 
 
 lockhart was getting unsteadily to his feet his hat had fallen off and his wavy hair was standing on end 
 
 well there you have it he said tottering back onto the platform that was a disarming charm as you see lost my wand ah thank you miss brown yes an excellent idea to show them that professor snape but if you mind my saying so it was very obvious what you were about to do if i had wanted to stop you it would have been only too easy however i felt it would be instructive to let them see 
 
 snape was looking murderous possibly lockhart had noticed because he said enough demonstrating going to come amongst you now and put you all into pairs professor snape if like to help me 
 
 they moved through the crowd matching up partners lockhart teamed neville with justin but snape reached harry and ron first 
 
 time to split up the dream team i think he sneered weasley you can partner finnigan potter 
 
 harry moved automatically toward hermione 
 
 i think so said snape smiling coldly mr malfoy come over here see what you make of the famous potter and you miss granger you can partner miss bulstrode 
 
 malfoy strutted over smirking behind him walked a slytherin girl who reminded harry of a picture seen in holidays with hags she was large and square and her heavy jaw jutted aggressively hermione gave her a weak smile that she did not return 
 
 face your partners called lockhart back on the platform and bow 
 
 hrry and malfoy barely inclined their heads not taking their eyes off each other 
 
 wands at the ready shouted lockhart when i count to three cast your charms to disarm your opponents only to disarm them we want any accidents one two three 
 
 harry swung his wand high but malfoy had already started on two his spell hit harry so hard he felt as though been hit over the head with a saucepan he stumbled but everything still seemed to be working and wasting no more time harry pointed his wand straight at malfoy and shouted rictusempra 
 
 a jet of silver light hit malfoy in the stomach and he doubled up wheezing 
 
 i said disarm only lockhart shouted in alarm over the heads of the battling crowd as malfoy sank to his knees harry had hit him with a tickling charm and he could barely move for laughing harry hung back with a vague feeling it would be unsporting to bewitch malfoy while he was on the floor but this was a mistake gasping for breath malfoy pointed his wand at knees choked tarantallegra and the next second legs began to jerk around out of his control in a kind of quickstep 
 
 stop stop screamed lockhart but snape took charge finite incantatem he shouted feet stopped dancing malfoy stopped laughing and they were able to look up 
 
 a haze of greenish smoke was hovering over the scene both neville and justin were lying on the floor panting ron was holding up an seamus apologizing for whatever his broken wand had done but hermione and millicent bulstrode were still moving millicent had hermione in a headlock and hermione was whimpering in pain both their wands lay forgotten on the floor harry leapt forward and pulled millicent off it was difficult she was a lot bigger than he was 
 
 dear dear said lockhart skittering through the crowd looking at the aftermath of the duels up you go macmillan 
 
 careful there miss fawcett pinch it hard stop bleeding in a second 
 
 i think better teach you how to block unfriendly spells said lockhart standing flustered in the midst of the hall he glanced at snape whose black eyes glinted and looked quickly away have a volunteer pair longbottom and how about you 
 
 a bad idea professor lockhart said snape gliding over like a large and malevolent bat longbottom causes devastation with the simplest spells be sending left of up to the hospital wing in a matchbox round pink face went pinker how about malfoy and potter said snape with a twisted smile 
 
 excellent idea said lockhart gesturing harry and malfoy into the middle of the hall as the crowd backed away to give them room 
 
 now harry said lockhart when draco points his wand at you you do this 
 
 he raised his own wand attempted a complicated sort of wiggling action and dropped it snape smirked as lockhart quickly picked it up saying whoops my wand is a little overexcited 
 
 snape moved closer to malfoy bent down and whispered something in his ear malfoy smirked too harry looked up nervously at lockhart and said professor could you show me that blocking thing again 
 
 scared muttered malfoy so that lockhart hear him 
 
 you wish said harry out of the corner of his mouth 
 
 lockhart cuffed harry merrily on the shoulder just do what i did harry 
 
 what drop my wand 
 
 but lockhart listening 
 
 three two one go he shouted 
 
 malfoy raised his wand quickly and bellowed serpensortia 
 
 the end of his wand exploded harry watched aghast as a long black snake shot out of it fell heavily onto the floor between them and raised itself ready to strike there were screams as the crowd backed swiftly away clearing the floor 
 
 move potter said snape lazily clearly enjoying the sight of harry standing motionless eye to eye with the angry snake get rid of it 
 
 allow me shouted lockhart he brandished his wand at the snake and there was a loud bang the snake instead of vanishing flew ten feet into the air and fell back to the floor with a loud smack enraged hissing furiously it slithered straight toward justin and raised itself again fangs exposed poised to strike 
 
 harry sure what made him do it he even aware of deciding to do it all he knew was that his legs were carrying him forward as though he was on casters and that he had shouted stupidly at the snake leave him alone and miraculously inexplicably the snake slumped to the floor docile as a thick black garden hose its eyes now on harry harry felt the fear drain out of him he knew the snake attack anyone now though how he knew it he have explained 
 
 he looked up at justin grinning expecting to see justin looking relieved or puzzled or even grateful but certainly not angry and scared 
 
 what do you think playing at he shouted and before harry could say anything justin had turned and stormed out of the hall 
 
 snape stepped forward waved his wand and the snake vanished in a small puff of black smoke snape too was looking at harry in an unexpected way it was a shrewd and calculating look and harry like it he was also dimly aware of an ominous muttering all around the walls then he felt a tugging on the back of his robes 
 
 come on said voice in his ear move come on 
 
 ron steered him out of the hall hermione hurrying alongside them as they went through the doors the people on either side drew away as though they were frightened of catching something harry have a clue what was going on and neither ron nor hermione explained anything until they had dragged him all the way up to the empty gryffindor common room 
 
 then ron pushed harry into an armchair and said a parselmouth why you tell us 
 
 a what said harry 
 
 a parselmouth said ron you can talk to snakes 
 
 i know said harry i mean only the second time ever done it i accidentally set a boa constrictor on my cousin dudley at the zoo once long story but it was telling me it had never seen brazil and i sort of set it free without meaning to that was before i knew i was a wizard 
 
 a boa constrictor told you it had never seen brazil ron repeated faintly 
 
 so said harry i bet loads of people here can do it 
 
 oh no they said ron not a very common gift harry this is bad 
 
 bad said harry starting to feel quite angry wrong with everyone listen if i told that snake not to attack justin 
 
 oh what you said to it 
 
 what mean you were there you heard me 
 
 i heard you speaking parseltongue said ron snake language you could have been saying anything no wonder justin panicked you sounded like you were egging the snake on or something it was creepy you know 
 
 harry gaped at him 
 
 i spoke a different language but i realize how can i speak a language without knowing i can speak it 
 
 ron shook his head both he and hermione were looking as though someone had died harry see what was so terrible 
 
 want to tell me wrong with stopping a massive snake biting off head he said what does it matter how i did it as long as justin have to join the headless hunt 
 
 it matters said hermione speaking at last in a hushed voice because being able to talk to snakes was what salazar slytherin was famous for why the symbol of slytherin house is a serpent 
 
 mouth fell open 
 
 exactly said ron and now the whole going to think his or something 
 
 but not said harry with a panic he quite explain 
 
 find that hard to prove said hermione he lived about a thousand years ago for all we know you could be 
 
 harry lay awake for hours that night through a gap in the curtains around his he watched snow starting to drift past the tower window and wondered 
 
 could he be a descendant of salazar slithering he know anything about his family after all the dursleys had always forbidden questions about his wizarding relatives 
 
 quietly harry tried to say something in parseltongue the words come it seemed he had to be with a snake to do it 
 
 but in gryffindor harry thought the sorting hat have put me in here if i had slytherin blood 
 
 ah said a nasty little voice in his brain but the sorting hat wanted to put you in slytherin you remember 
 
 harry turned over see justin the next day in herbology and explain that been calling the snake off not egging it on which he thought angrily pummeling his pillow any fool should have realized 
 
 by next morning however the snow that had begun in the night had turned into a blizzard so thick that the last herbology lesson of the term was canceled professor sprout wanted to fit socks and scarves on the mandrakes a tricky operation she would entrust to no one else now that it was so important for the mandrakes to grow quickly and revive mrs norris and colin creevey 
 
 harry fretted about this next to the fire in the gryffindor common room while ron and hermione used their time off to play a game of wizard chess 
 
 for sake harry said hermione exasperated as one of bishops wrestled her knight off his horse and dragged him off the board go and find justin if so important to you 
 
 so harry got up and left through the portrait hole wondering where justin might be 
 
 the castle was darker than it usually was in daytime because of the thick swirling gray snow at every window shivering harry walked past classrooms where lessons were taking place catching snatches of what was happening within professor mcgonagall was shouting at someone who by the sound of it had turned his friend into a badger resisting the urge to take a look harry walked on by thinking that justin might be using his free time to catch up on some work and deciding to check the library first 
 
 a group of the hufliepuffs who should have been in herbology were indeed sitting at the back of the library but they seem to be working between the long lines of high bookshelves harry could see that their heads were close together and they were having what looked like an absorbing conversation he see whether justin was among them he was walking toward them when something of what they were saying met his ears and he paused to listen hidden in the invisibility section 
 
 so anyway a stout boy was saying i told justin to hide up in our dormitory i mean to say if marked him down as his next victim best if he keeps a low profile for a while of course been waiting for something like this to happen ever since he let slip to potter he was justin actually told him been down for eton not the kind of thing you bandy about with heir on the loose is it 
 
 you definitely think it is potter then ernie said a girl with blonde pigtails anxiously 
 
 hannah said the stout boy solemnly a parselmouth everyone knows the mark of a dark wizard have you ever heard of a decent one who could talk to snakes they called slytherin himself 
 
 there was some heavy murmuring at this and ernie went on remember what was written on the wall enemies of the heir beware potter had some sort of with filch next thing we know attacked that first year creevey was annoying potter at the quidditch match taking pictures of him while he was lying in the mud next thing we know been attacked 
 
 he always seems so nice though said hannah uncertainly and well the one who made disappear he be all bad can he 
 
 ernie lowered his voice mysteriously the hufflepuffs bent closer and harry edged nearer so that he could catch words 
 
 no one knows how he survived that attack by i mean to say he was only a baby when it happened he should have been blasted into smithereens only a really powerful dark wizard could have survived a curse like that he dropped his voice until it was barely more than a whisper and said probably why you wanted to kill him in the first place want another dark lord competing with him i wonder what other powers been hiding 
 
 harry take anymore clearing his throat loudly he stepped out from behind the bookshelves if he been feeling so angry he would have found the sight that greeted him funny every one of the hufflepuffs looked as though they had been petrified by the sight of him and the color was draining out of face 
 
 hello said harry looking for justin 
 
 the fears had clearly been confirmed they all looked fearfully at ernie 
 
 what do you want with him said ernie in a quavering voice 
 
 i wanted to tell him what really happened with that snake at the dueling club said harry 
 
 ernie bit his white lips and then taking a deep breath said we were all there we saw what happened 
 
 then you noticed that after i spoke to it the snake backed off said harry 
 
 all i saw said ernie stubbornly though he was trembling as he spoke was you speaking parseltongue and chasing the snake toward justin 
 
 i chase it at him harry said his voice shaking with anger it even touch him 
 
 it was a very near miss said ernie and in case getting ideas he added hastily i might tell you that you can trace my family back through nine generations of witches and warlocks and my as pure as so 
 
 i care what sort of blood got said harry fiercely why would i want to attack 
 
 heard you hate those muggles you live with said ernie swiftly 
 
 not possible to live with the dursleys and not hate them said harry like to see you try it 
 
 he turned on his heel and stormed out of the library earning himself a reproving glare from madam pince who was polishing the gilded cover of a large spellbook 
 
 harry blundered up the corridor barely noticing where he was going he was in such a fury the result was that he walked into something very large and solid which knocked him backward onto the floor 
 
 oh hello hagrid harry said looking up 
 
 face was entirely hidden by a woolly balaclava but it possibly be anyone else as he filled most of the corridor in his moleskin overcoat a dead rooster was hanging from one of his massive gloved hands 
 
 all righ harry he said pulling up the balaclava so he could speak why yeh in class 
 
 canceled said harry getting up you doing in here 
 
 hagrid held up the limp rooster 
 
 second one killed this term he explained either foxes or a bugbear need the permission ter put a charm around the hen coop 
 
 he peered more closely at harry from under his thick snowflecked eyebrows 
 
 yeh sure all righ yeh look all hot 
 
 harry bring himself to repeat what ernie and the rest of the hufflepuffs had been saying about him 
 
 nothing he said id better get going hagrid transfiguration next and got to pick up my books 
 
 he walked off his mind still full of what ernie had said about him 
 
 been waiting for something like this to happen ever since he let slip to potter he was 
 
 harry stamped up the stairs and turned along another corridor which was particularly dark the torches had been extinguished by a strong icy draft that was blowing through a loose windowpane he was halfway down the passage when he tripped headlong over something lying on the floor 
 
 he turned to squint at what fallen over and felt as though his stomach had dissolved 
 
 justin was lying on the floor rigid and cold a look of shock frozen on his face his eyes staring blankly at the ceiling and that all next to him was another figure the strangest sight harry had ever seen 
 
 it was nearly headless nick no longer and transparent but black and smoky floating immobile and horizontal six inches off the floor his head was half off and his face wore an expression of shock identical to 
 
 harry got to his feet his breathing fast and shallow his heart doing a kind of drumroll against his ribs he lookedwildly up and down the deserted corridor and saw a line of spiders scuttling as fast as they could away from the bodies the only sounds were the muffled voices of teachers from the classes on either side 
 
 he could run and no one would ever know he had been there but he just leave them lying here he had to get help would anyone believe he had anything to do with this 
 
 as he stood there panicking a door right next to him opened with a bang peeves the poltergeist came shooting out 
 
 why potty wee potter cackled peeves knocking glasses askew as he bounced past him potter up to potter lurking 
 
 peeves stopped halfway through a midair somersault upside down he spotted justin and nearly headless nick he flipped the right way up filled his lungs and before harry could stop him screamed attack attack another attack no mortal or ghost is safe run for your lives attaaaack 
 
 crash crash crash door after door flew open along the corridor and people flooded out for several long minutes there was a scene of such confusion that justin was in danger of being squashed and people kept standing in nearly headless nick harry found himself pinned against the wall as the teachers shouted for quiet professor mcgonagall came running followed by her own class one of whom still had hair she used her wand to set off a loud bang which restored silence and ordered everyone back into their classes no sooner had the scene cleared somewhat than ernie the hufflepuff arrived panting on the scene 
 
 caught in the act ernie yelled his face stark white pointing his finger dramatically at harry 
 
 that will do macmillan said professor mcgonagall sharply 
 
 peeves was bobbing overhead now grinning wickedly surveying the scene peeves always loved chaos as the teachers bent over justin and nearly headless nick examining them peeves broke into song 
 
 oh potter you rotter oh what have you done killing you think good fun 
 
 enough peeves barked professor mcgonagall and peeves zoomed away backward with his tongue out at harry 
 
 justin was carried up to the hospital wing by professor flitwick and professor sinistra of the astronomy department but nobody seemed to know what to do for nearly headless nick in the end professor mcgonagall conjured a large fan out of thin air which she gave to ernie with instructions to waft nearly headless nick up the stairs this ernie did fanning nick along like a silent black hovercraft this left harry and professor mcgonagall alone together 
 
 this way potter she said 
 
 professor said harry at once i swear i 
 
 this is out of my hands potter said professor mcgonagall curtly 
 
 they marched in silence around a corner and she stopped before a large and extremely ugly stone gargoyle 
 
 lemon drop she said this was evidently a password because the gargoyle sprang suddenly to life and hopped aside as the wall behind him split in two even full of dread for what was coming harry fail to be amazed behind the wall was a spiral staircase that was moving smoothly upward like an escalator as he and professor mcgonagall stepped onto it harry heard the wall thud closed behind them they rose upward in circles higher and higher until at last slightly dizzy harry saw a gleaming oak door ahead with a brass knocker in the shape of a griffin 
 
 he knew now where he was being taken this must be where dumbledore lived 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the chamber of secrets 
 

lionfish nov chapter eleven the dueling clubcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 harry woke up on sunday morning to find the dormitory blazing with winter sunlight and his arm reboned but very stiff he sat up quickly and looked over at bed but it had been blocked from view by the high curtains harry had changed behind yesterday seeing that he was awake madam pomfrey came bustling over with a breakfast tray and then began bending and stretching his arm and fingers 
 
 all in order she said as he clumsily fed himself porridge when finished eating you may leave 
 
 harry dressed as quickly as he could and hurried off to gryffindor tower desperate to tell ron and hermione about colin and dobby but they there harry left to look for them wondering where they could have got to and feeling slightly hurt that they interested in whether he had his bones back or not 
 
 as harry passed the library percy weasley strolled out of it looking in far better spirits than last time met 
 
 oh hello harry he said excellent flying yesterday really excellent gryffindor has just taken the lead for the house cup you earned fifty points 
 
 you seen ron or hermione have you said harry 
 
 no i said percy his smile fading i hope not in another 
 
 harry forced a laugh watched percy walk out of sight and then headed straight for moaning bathroom he see why ron and hermione would be in there again but after making sure that neither filch nor any prefects were around he opened the door and heard their voices coming from a locked stall 
 
 me he said closing the door behind him there was a clunk a splash and a gasp from within the stall and he saw eye peering through the keyhole 
 
 harry she said you gave us such a fright come in your arm 
 
 fine said harry squeezing into the stall an old cauldron was perched on the toilet and a crackling from under the rim told harry they had lit a fire beneath it conjuring up portable waterproof fires was a speciality of 
 
 come to meet you but we decided to get started on the polyjuice potion ron explained as harry with difficulty locked the stall again decided this is the safest place to hide it 
 
 harry started to tell them about colin but hermione interrupted 
 
 we already know we heard professor mcgonagall telling professor flitwick this morning why we decided better get going 
 
 the sooner we get a confession out of malfoy the better snarled ron know what i think he was in such a foul temper after the quidditch match he took it out on colin 
 
 something else said harry watching hermione tearing bundles of knotgrass and throwing them into the potion dobby came to visit me in the middle of the night 
 
 ron and hermione looked up amazed harry told them everything dobby had told him or told him hermione and ron listened with their mouths open 
 
 the chamber of secrets has been opened before hermione said 
 
 this settles it said ron in a triumphant voice lucius malfoy opened the chamber when he was at school here and now told dear old draco how to do it obvious wish told you what kind of in there though i want to know how come noticed it sneaking around the school 
 
 maybe it can make itself invisible said hermione prodding leeches to the bottom of the cauldron or maybe it can disguise itself pretend to be a suit of armor or something read about chameleon ghouls 
 
 you read too much hermione said ron pouring dead lacewings on top of the leeches he crumpled up the empty lacewing bag and looked at harry 
 
 so dobby stopped us from getting on the train and broke your arm he shook his head you know what harry if he stop trying to save your life going to kill you 
 
 the news that colin creevey had been attacked and was now lying as though dead in the hospital wing had spread through the entire school by monday morning the air was suddenly thick with rumor and suspicion the first years were now moving around the castle in groups as though scared they would be attacked if they ventured forth alone 
 
 ginny weasley who sat next to colin creevey in charms was distraught but harry felt that fred and george were going the wrong way about cheering her up they were taking turns covering themselves with fur or boils and jumping out at her from behind statues they only stopped when percy apoplectic with rage told them he was going to write to mrs weasley and tell her ginny was having nightmares 
 
 meanwhile hidden from the teachers a roaring trade in talismans amulets and other protective devices was sweeping the school neville longbottom bought a large green onion a pointed purple crystal and a rotting newt tail before the other gryffindor boys pointed out that he was in no danger he was a and therefore unlikely to be attacked 
 
 they went for filch first neville said his round face fearful and everyone knows almost a squib 
 
 in the second week of december professor mcgonagall came around as usual collecting names of those who would be staying at school for christmas harry ron and hermione signed her list they had heard that malfoy was staying which struck them as very suspicious the holidays would be the perfect time to use the polyjuice potion and try to worm a confession out of him 
 
 unfortunately the potion was only half finished they still needed the bicorn horn and the boomslang skin and the only place they were going to get them was from private stores harry privately felt rather face legendary monster than let snape catch him robbing his office 
 
 what we need said hermione briskly as thursday double potions lesson loomed nearer is a diversion then one of us can sneak into office and take what we need harry and ron looked at her nervously 
 
 i think better do the actual stealing hermione continued in a tone you two will be expelled if you get into any more trouble and got a clean record so all you need to do is cause enough mayhem to keep snape busy for five minutes or so 
 
 harry smiled feebly deliberately causing mayhem in potions class was about as safe as poking a sleeping dragon in the eye 
 
 potions lessons took place in one of the large dungeons thursday lesson proceeded in the usual way twenty cauldrons stood steaming between the wooden desks on which stood brass scales and jars of ingredients snape prowled through the fumes making waspish remarks about the while the slytherins sniggered appreciatively draco malfoy who was favorite student kept flicking eyes at ron and harry who knew that if they retaliated they would get detention faster than you could say unfair 
 
 swelling solution was far too runny but he had his mind on more important things he was waiting for signal and he hardly listened as snape paused to sneer at his watery potion when snape turned and walked off to bully neville hermione caught eye and nodded 
 
 harry ducked swiftly down behind his cauldron pulled one of filibuster fireworks out of his pocket and gave it a quick prod with his wand the firework began to fizz and sputter knowing he had only seconds harry straightened up took aim and lobbed it into the air it landed right on target in cauldron 
 
 potion exploded showering the whole class people shrieked as splashes of the swelling solution hit them malfoy got a faceful and his nose began to swell like a balloon goyle blundered around his hands over his eyes which had expanded to the size of a dinner plate snape was trying to restore calm and find out what had happened through the confusion harry saw hermione slip quietly into office 
 
 silence silence snape roared anyone who has been splashed come here for a deflating draft when i find out who did this 
 
 harry tried not to laugh as he watched malfoy hurry forward his head drooping with the weight of a nose like a small melon as half the class lumbered up to desk some weighted down with arms like clubs others unable to talk through gigantic lips harry saw hermione slide back into the dungeon the front of her robes bulging 
 
 when everyone had taken a swig of antidote and the various swellings had subsided snape swept over to cauldron and scooped out the twisted black remains of the firework there was a sudden hush 
 
 if i ever find out who threw this snape whispered i shall make sure that person is expelled 
 
 harry arranged his face into what he hoped was a puzzled expression snape was looking right at him and the bell that rang ten minutes later could not have been more welcome 
 
 he knew it was me harry told ron and hermione as they hurried back to moaning bathroom i could tell 
 
 hermione threw the new ingredients into the cauldron and began to stir feverishly 
 
 be ready in two weeks she said happily 
 
 snape prove it was you said ron reassuringly to harry what can he do 
 
 knowing snape something foul said harry as the potion frothed and bubbled 
 
 a week later harry ron and hermione were walking across the entrance hall when they saw a small knot of people gathered around the notice board reading a piece of parchment that had just been pinned up seamus finnigan and dean thomas beckoned them over looking excited 
 
 starting a dueling club said seamus first meeting tonight i mind dueling lessons they might come in handy one of these days 
 
 what you reckon monster can duel said ron but he too read the sign with interest 
 
 could be useful he said to harry and hermione as they went into dinner shall we go 
 
 harry and hermione were all for it so at eight that evening they hurried back to the great hall the long dining tables had vanished and a golden stage had appeared along one wall lit by thousands of candles floating overhead the ceiling was velvety black once more and most of the school eemed to be packed beneath it all carrying their wands and looking excited 
 
 i wonder be teaching us said hermione as they edged into the chattering crowd someone told me flitwick was a dueling champion when he was young maybe be him 
 
 as long as not harry began but he ended on a groan gilderoy lockhart was walking onto the stage resplendent in robes of deep plum and accompanied by none other than snape wearing his usual black 
 
 lockhart waved an arm for silence and called gather round gather round can everyone see me can you all hear me excellent 
 
 now professor dumbledore has granted me permission to start this little dueling club to train you all in case you ever need to defend yourselves as i myself have done on countless occasions for full details see my published works 
 
 let me introduce my assistant professor snape said lockhart flashing a wide smile he tells me he knows a tiny little bit about dueling himself and has sportingly agreed to help me with a short demonstration before we begin now i want any of you youngsters to worry still have your potions master when through with him never fear 
 
 it be good if they finished each other off ron muttered in ear 
 
 upper lip was curling harry wondered why lockhart was still smiling if snape had been looking at him like that have been running as fast as he could in the opposite direction 
 
 lockhart and snape turned to face each other and bowed at least lockhart did with much twirling of his hands whereas snape jerked his head irritably then they raised their wands like swords in front of them 
 
 as you see we are holding our wands in the accepted combative position lockhart told the silent crowd on the count of three we will cast our first spells neither of us will be aiming to kill of course 
 
 i bet on that harry murmured watching snape baring his teeth 
 
 one two three 
 
 both of them swung their wands above their heads and pointed them at their opponent snape cried expelliarmus there was a dazzling flash of scarlet light and lockhart was blasted off his feet he flew backward off the stage smashed into the wall and slid down it to sprawl on the floor 
 
 malfoy and some of the other slytherins cheered hermione was dancing on tiptoes do you think all right she squealed through her fingers 
 
 who cares said harry and ron together 
 
 lockhart was getting unsteadily to his feet his hat had fallen off and his wavy hair was standing on end 
 
 well there you have it he said tottering back onto the platform that was a disarming charm as you see lost my wand ah thank you miss brown yes an excellent idea to show them that professor snape but if you mind my saying so it was very obvious what you were about to do if i had wanted to stop you it would have been only too easy however i felt it would be instructive to let them see 
 
 snape was looking murderous possibly lockhart had noticed because he said enough demonstrating going to come amongst you now and put you all into pairs professor snape if like to help me 
 
 they moved through the crowd matching up partners lockhart teamed neville with justin but snape reached harry and ron first 
 
 time to split up the dream team i think he sneered weasley you can partner finnigan potter 
 
 harry moved automatically toward hermione 
 
 i think so said snape smiling coldly mr malfoy come over here see what you make of the famous potter and you miss granger you can partner miss bulstrode 
 
 malfoy strutted over smirking behind him walked a slytherin girl who reminded harry of a picture seen in holidays with hags she was large and square and her heavy jaw jutted aggressively hermione gave her a weak smile that she did not return 
 
 face your partners called lockhart back on the platform and bow 
 
 hrry and malfoy barely inclined their heads not taking their eyes off each other 
 
 wands at the ready shouted lockhart when i count to three cast your charms to disarm your opponents only to disarm them we want any accidents one two three 
 
 harry swung his wand high but malfoy had already started on two his spell hit harry so hard he felt as though been hit over the head with a saucepan he stumbled but everything still seemed to be working and wasting no more time harry pointed his wand straight at malfoy and shouted rictusempra 
 
 a jet of silver light hit malfoy in the stomach and he doubled up wheezing 
 
 i said disarm only lockhart shouted in alarm over the heads of the battling crowd as malfoy sank to his knees harry had hit him with a tickling charm and he could barely move for laughing harry hung back with a vague feeling it would be unsporting to bewitch malfoy while he was on the floor but this was a mistake gasping for breath malfoy pointed his wand at knees choked tarantallegra and the next second legs began to jerk around out of his control in a kind of quickstep 
 
 stop stop screamed lockhart but snape took charge finite incantatem he shouted feet stopped dancing malfoy stopped laughing and they were able to look up 
 
 a haze of greenish smoke was hovering over the scene both neville and justin were lying on the floor panting ron was holding up an seamus apologizing for whatever his broken wand had done but hermione and millicent bulstrode were still moving millicent had hermione in a headlock and hermione was whimpering in pain both their wands lay forgotten on the floor harry leapt forward and pulled millicent off it was difficult she was a lot bigger than he was 
 
 dear dear said lockhart skittering through the crowd looking at the aftermath of the duels up you go macmillan 
 
 careful there miss fawcett pinch it hard stop bleeding in a second 
 
 i think better teach you how to block unfriendly spells said lockhart standing flustered in the midst of the hall he glanced at snape whose black eyes glinted and looked quickly away have a volunteer pair longbottom and how about you 
 
 a bad idea professor lockhart said snape gliding over like a large and malevolent bat longbottom causes devastation with the simplest spells be sending left of up to the hospital wing in a matchbox round pink face went pinker how about malfoy and potter said snape with a twisted smile 
 
 excellent idea said lockhart gesturing harry and malfoy into the middle of the hall as the crowd backed away to give them room 
 
 now harry said lockhart when draco points his wand at you you do this 
 
 he raised his own wand attempted a complicated sort of wiggling action and dropped it snape smirked as lockhart quickly picked it up saying whoops my wand is a little overexcited 
 
 snape moved closer to malfoy bent down and whispered something in his ear malfoy smirked too harry looked up nervously at lockhart and said professor could you show me that blocking thing again 
 
 scared muttered malfoy so that lockhart hear him 
 
 you wish said harry out of the corner of his mouth 
 
 lockhart cuffed harry merrily on the shoulder just do what i did harry 
 
 what drop my wand 
 
 but lockhart listening 
 
 three two one go he shouted 
 
 malfoy raised his wand quickly and bellowed serpensortia 
 
 the end of his wand exploded harry watched aghast as a long black snake shot out of it fell heavily onto the floor between them and raised itself ready to strike there were screams as the crowd backed swiftly away clearing the floor 
 
 move potter said snape lazily clearly enjoying the sight of harry standing motionless eye to eye with the angry snake get rid of it 
 
 allow me shouted lockhart he brandished his wand at the snake and there was a loud bang the snake instead of vanishing flew ten feet into the air and fell back to the floor with a loud smack enraged hissing furiously it slithered straight toward justin and raised itself again fangs exposed poised to strike 
 
 harry sure what made him do it he even aware of deciding to do it all he knew was that his legs were carrying him forward as though he was on casters and that he had shouted stupidly at the snake leave him alone and miraculously inexplicably the snake slumped to the floor docile as a thick black garden hose its eyes now on harry harry felt the fear drain out of him he knew the snake attack anyone now though how he knew it he have explained 
 
 he looked up at justin grinning expecting to see justin looking relieved or puzzled or even grateful but certainly not angry and scared 
 
 what do you think playing at he shouted and before harry could say anything justin had turned and stormed out of the hall 
 
 snape stepped forward waved his wand and the snake vanished in a small puff of black smoke snape too was looking at harry in an unexpected way it was a shrewd and calculating look and harry like it he was also dimly aware of an ominous muttering all around the walls then he felt a tugging on the back of his robes 
 
 come on said voice in his ear move come on 
 
 ron steered him out of the hall hermione hurrying alongside them as they went through the doors the people on either side drew away as though they were frightened of catching something harry have a clue what was going on and neither ron nor hermione explained anything until they had dragged him all the way up to the empty gryffindor common room 
 
 then ron pushed harry into an armchair and said a parselmouth why you tell us 
 
 a what said harry 
 
 a parselmouth said ron you can talk to snakes 
 
 i know said harry i mean only the second time ever done it i accidentally set a boa constrictor on my cousin dudley at the zoo once long story but it was telling me it had never seen brazil and i sort of set it free without meaning to that was before i knew i was a wizard 
 
 a boa constrictor told you it had never seen brazil ron repeated faintly 
 
 so said harry i bet loads of people here can do it 
 
 oh no they said ron not a very common gift harry this is bad 
 
 bad said harry starting to feel quite angry wrong with everyone listen if i told that snake not to attack justin 
 
 oh what you said to it 
 
 what mean you were there you heard me 
 
 i heard you speaking parseltongue said ron snake language you could have been saying anything no wonder justin panicked you sounded like you were egging the snake on or something it was creepy you know 
 
 harry gaped at him 
 
 i spoke a different language but i realize how can i speak a language without knowing i can speak it 
 
 ron shook his head both he and hermione were looking as though someone had died harry see what was so terrible 
 
 want to tell me wrong with stopping a massive snake biting off head he said what does it matter how i did it as long as justin have to join the headless hunt 
 
 it matters said hermione speaking at last in a hushed voice because being able to talk to snakes was what salazar slytherin was famous for why the symbol of slytherin house is a serpent 
 
 mouth fell open 
 
 exactly said ron and now the whole going to think his or something 
 
 but not said harry with a panic he quite explain 
 
 find that hard to prove said hermione he lived about a thousand years ago for all we know you could be 
 
 harry lay awake for hours that night through a gap in the curtains around his he watched snow starting to drift past the tower window and wondered 
 
 could he be a descendant of salazar slithering he know anything about his family after all the dursleys had always forbidden questions about his wizarding relatives 
 
 quietly harry tried to say something in parseltongue the words come it seemed he had to be with a snake to do it 
 
 but in gryffindor harry thought the sorting hat have put me in here if i had slytherin blood 
 
 ah said a nasty little voice in his brain but the sorting hat wanted to put you in slytherin you remember 
 
 harry turned over see justin the next day in herbology and explain that been calling the snake off not egging it on which he thought angrily pummeling his pillow any fool should have realized 
 
 by next morning however the snow that had begun in the night had turned into a blizzard so thick that the last herbology lesson of the term was canceled professor sprout wanted to fit socks and scarves on the mandrakes a tricky operation she would entrust to no one else now that it was so important for the mandrakes to grow quickly and revive mrs norris and colin creevey 
 
 harry fretted about this next to the fire in the gryffindor common room while ron and hermione used their time off to play a game of wizard chess 
 
 for sake harry said hermione exasperated as one of bishops wrestled her knight off his horse and dragged him off the board go and find justin if so important to you 
 
 so harry got up and left through the portrait hole wondering where justin might be 
 
 the castle was darker than it usually was in daytime because of the thick swirling gray snow at every window shivering harry walked past classrooms where lessons were taking place catching snatches of what was happening within professor mcgonagall was shouting at someone who by the sound of it had turned his friend into a badger resisting the urge to take a look harry walked on by thinking that justin might be using his free time to catch up on some work and deciding to check the library first 
 
 a group of the hufliepuffs who should have been in herbology were indeed sitting at the back of the library but they seem to be working between the long lines of high bookshelves harry could see that their heads were close together and they were having what looked like an absorbing conversation he see whether justin was among them he was walking toward them when something of what they were saying met his ears and he paused to listen hidden in the invisibility section 
 
 so anyway a stout boy was saying i told justin to hide up in our dormitory i mean to say if marked him down as his next victim best if he keeps a low profile for a while of course been waiting for something like this to happen ever since he let slip to potter he was justin actually told him been down for eton not the kind of thing you bandy about with heir on the loose is it 
 
 you definitely think it is potter then ernie said a girl with blonde pigtails anxiously 
 
 hannah said the stout boy solemnly a parselmouth everyone knows the mark of a dark wizard have you ever heard of a decent one who could talk to snakes they called slytherin himself 
 
 there was some heavy murmuring at this and ernie went on remember what was written on the wall enemies of the heir beware potter had some sort of with filch next thing we know attacked that first year creevey was annoying potter at the quidditch match taking pictures of him while he was lying in the mud next thing we know been attacked 
 
 he always seems so nice though said hannah uncertainly and well the one who made disappear he be all bad can he 
 
 ernie lowered his voice mysteriously the hufflepuffs bent closer and harry edged nearer so that he could catch words 
 
 no one knows how he survived that attack by i mean to say he was only a baby when it happened he should have been blasted into smithereens only a really powerful dark wizard could have survived a curse like that he dropped his voice until it was barely more than a whisper and said probably why you wanted to kill him in the first place want another dark lord competing with him i wonder what other powers been hiding 
 
 harry take anymore clearing his throat loudly he stepped out from behind the bookshelves if he been feeling so angry he would have found the sight that greeted him funny every one of the hufflepuffs looked as though they had been petrified by the sight of him and the color was draining out of face 
 
 hello said harry looking for justin 
 
 the fears had clearly been confirmed they all looked fearfully at ernie 
 
 what do you want with him said ernie in a quavering voice 
 
 i wanted to tell him what really happened with that snake at the dueling club said harry 
 
 ernie bit his white lips and then taking a deep breath said we were all there we saw what happened 
 
 then you noticed that after i spoke to it the snake backed off said harry 
 
 all i saw said ernie stubbornly though he was trembling as he spoke was you speaking parseltongue and chasing the snake toward justin 
 
 i chase it at him harry said his voice shaking with anger it even touch him 
 
 it was a very near miss said ernie and in case getting ideas he added hastily i might tell you that you can trace my family back through nine generations of witches and warlocks and my as pure as so 
 
 i care what sort of blood got said harry fiercely why would i want to attack 
 
 heard you hate those muggles you live with said ernie swiftly 
 
 not possible to live with the dursleys and not hate them said harry like to see you try it 
 
 he turned on his heel and stormed out of the library earning himself a reproving glare from madam pince who was polishing the gilded cover of a large spellbook 
 
 harry blundered up the corridor barely noticing where he was going he was in such a fury the result was that he walked into something very large and solid which knocked him backward onto the floor 
 
 oh hello hagrid harry said looking up 
 
 face was entirely hidden by a woolly balaclava but it possibly be anyone else as he filled most of the corridor in his moleskin overcoat a dead rooster was hanging from one of his massive gloved hands 
 
 all righ harry he said pulling up the balaclava so he could speak why yeh in class 
 
 canceled said harry getting up you doing in here 
 
 hagrid held up the limp rooster 
 
 second one killed this term he explained either foxes or a bugbear need the permission ter put a charm around the hen coop 
 
 he peered more closely at harry from under his thick snowflecked eyebrows 
 
 yeh sure all righ yeh look all hot 
 
 harry bring himself to repeat what ernie and the rest of the hufflepuffs had been saying about him 
 
 nothing he said id better get going hagrid transfiguration next and got to pick up my books 
 
 he walked off his mind still full of what ernie had said about him 
 
 been waiting for something like this to happen ever since he let slip to potter he was 
 
 harry stamped up the stairs and turned along another corridor which was particularly dark the torches had been extinguished by a strong icy draft that was blowing through a loose windowpane he was halfway down the passage when he tripped headlong over something lying on the floor 
 
 he turned to squint at what fallen over and felt as though his stomach had dissolved 
 
 justin was lying on the floor rigid and cold a look of shock frozen on his face his eyes staring blankly at the ceiling and that all next to him was another figure the strangest sight harry had ever seen 
 
 it was nearly headless nick no longer and transparent but black and smoky floating immobile and horizontal six inches off the floor his head was half off and his face wore an expression of shock identical to 
 
 harry got to his feet his breathing fast and shallow his heart doing a kind of drumroll against his ribs he lookedwildly up and down the deserted corridor and saw a line of spiders scuttling as fast as they could away from the bodies the only sounds were the muffled voices of teachers from the classes on either side 
 
 he could run and no one would ever know he had been there but he just leave them lying here he had to get help would anyone believe he had anything to do with this 
 
 as he stood there panicking a door right next to him opened with a bang peeves the poltergeist came shooting out 
 
 why potty wee potter cackled peeves knocking glasses askew as he bounced past him potter up to potter lurking 
 
 peeves stopped halfway through a midair somersault upside down he spotted justin and nearly headless nick he flipped the right way up filled his lungs and before harry could stop him screamed attack attack another attack no mortal or ghost is safe run for your lives attaaaack 
 
 crash crash crash door after door flew open along the corridor and people flooded out for several long minutes there was a scene of such confusion that justin was in danger of being squashed and people kept standing in nearly headless nick harry found himself pinned against the wall as the teachers shouted for quiet professor mcgonagall came running followed by her own class one of whom still had hair she used her wand to set off a loud bang which restored silence and ordered everyone back into their classes no sooner had the scene cleared somewhat than ernie the hufflepuff arrived panting on the scene 
 
 caught in the act ernie yelled his face stark white pointing his finger dramatically at harry 
 
 that will do macmillan said professor mcgonagall sharply 
 
 peeves was bobbing overhead now grinning wickedly surveying the scene peeves always loved chaos as the teachers bent over justin and nearly headless nick examining them peeves broke into song 
 
 oh potter you rotter oh what have you done killing you think good fun 
 
 enough peeves barked professor mcgonagall and peeves zoomed away backward with his tongue out at harry 
 
 justin was carried up to the hospital wing by professor flitwick and professor sinistra of the astronomy department but nobody seemed to know what to do for nearly headless nick in the end professor mcgonagall conjured a large fan out of thin air which she gave to ernie with instructions to waft nearly headless nick up the stairs this ernie did fanning nick along like a silent black hovercraft this left harry and professor mcgonagall alone together 
 
 this way potter she said 
 
 professor said harry at once i swear i 
 
 this is out of my hands potter said professor mcgonagall curtly 
 
 they marched in silence around a corner and she stopped before a large and extremely ugly stone gargoyle 
 
 lemon drop she said this was evidently a password because the gargoyle sprang suddenly to life and hopped aside as the wall behind him split in two even full of dread for what was coming harry fail to be amazed behind the wall was a spiral staircase that was moving smoothly upward like an escalator as he and professor mcgonagall stepped onto it harry heard the wall thud closed behind them they rose upward in circles higher and higher until at last slightly dizzy harry saw a gleaming oak door ahead with a brass knocker in the shape of a griffin 
 
 he knew now where he was being taken this must be where dumbledore lived 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the chamber of secrets 
 

lionfish nov chapter eleven the fireboltcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 harry have a very clear idea of how he had managed to get back into the honeydukes cellar through the tunnel and into the castle once more all he knew was that the return trip seemed to take no time at all and that he hardly noticed what he was doing because his head was still pounding with the conversation he had just heard 
 
 why had nobody ever told him dumbledore hagrid mr weasley cornelius fudgewhy anyone ever mentioned the fact that parents had died because their best friend had betrayed them 
 
 ron and hermione watched harry nervously all through dinner not daring to talk about what overheard because percy was sitting close by them when they went upstairs to the crowded common room it was to find fred and george had set off half a dozen dungbombs in a fit of high spirits harry who want fred and george asking him whether reached hogsmeade or not sneaked quietly up to the empty dormitory and headed straight for his bedside cabinet he pushed his books aside and quickly found what he was looking for the photo album hagrid had given him two years ago which was full of wizard pictures of his mother and father he sat down on his bed drew the hangings around him and started turning the pages searching until 
 
 he stopped on a picture of his parents wedding day there was his father waving up at him beaming the untidy black hair harry had inherited standing up in all directions there was his mother alight with happiness arm in arm with his dad and therethat must be him their best manharry had never given him a thought before 
 
 if he known it was the same person he would never have guessed it was black in this old photograph his face sunken and waxy but handsome full of laughter had he already been working for voldemort when this picture had been taken was he already planning the deaths of the two people next to him did he realize he was facing twelve years in azkaban twelve years that would make him unrecognizable 
 
 but the dementors affect him harry thought staring into the handsome laughing face he have to hear my mum screaming if they get too close 
 
 harry slammed the album shut reached over and stuffed it back into his cabinet took off his robe and glasses and got into bed making sure the hangings were hiding him from view 
 
 the dormitory door opened 
 
 harry said voice uncertainly 
 
 but harry lay still pretending to be asleep he heard ron leave again and rolled over on his back his eyes wide open 
 
 a hatred such as he had never known before was coursing through harry like poison he could see black laughing at him through the darkness as though somebody had pasted the picture from the album over his eyes he watched as though somebody was playing him a piece of film sirius black blasting peter pettigrew who resembled neville longbottom into a thousand pieces he could hear though having no idea what voice might sound like a low excited mutter it has happened my lordthe potters have made me their and then came another voice laughing shrilly the same laugh that harry heard inside his head whenever the dementors drew near 
 
 harry you you look terrible 
 
 harry gotten to sleep until daybreak he had awoken to find the dormitory deserted dressed and gone down the spiral staircase to a common room that was completely empty except for ron who was eating a peppermint toad and massaging his stomach and hermione who had spread her homework over three tables 
 
 where is everyone said harry 
 
 gone the first day of the holidays remember said ron watching harry closely nearly lunchtime i was going to come and wake you up in a minute 
 
 harry slumped into a chair next to the fire snow was still falling outside the windows crookshanks was spread out in front of the fire like a large ginger rug 
 
 you really look well you know hermione said peering anxiously into his face 
 
 fine said harry 
 
 harry listen said hermione exchanging a look with ron you must be really upset about what we heard yesterday but the thing is you go doing anything stupid 
 
 like what said harry 
 
 like trying to go after black said ron sharply 
 
 harry could tell they had rehearsed this conversation while he had been asleep he say anything 
 
 you will you harry said hermione 
 
 because not worth dying for said ron 
 
 harry looked at them they seem to understand at all 
 
 know what i see and hear every time a dementor gets too near me ron and hermione shook their heads looking apprehensive i can hear my mum screaming and pleading with voldemort and if heard your mum screaming like that just about to be killed you forget it in a hurry and if you found out someone who was supposed to be a friend of hers betrayed her and sent voldemort after her 
 
 nothing you can do said hermione looking stricken the dementors will catch black and go back to azkaban and and serve him right 
 
 you heard what fudge said black affected by azkaban like normal people are not a punishment for him like it is for the others 
 
 so what are you saying said ron looking very tense you want to to kill black or something 
 
 be silly said hermione in a panicky voice harry want to kill anyone do you harry 
 
 again harry answer he know what he wanted to do all he knew was that the idea of doing nothing while black was at liberty was almost more than he could stand 
 
 malfoy knows he said abruptly remember what he said to me in potions if it was me hunt him down want revenge 
 
 going to take advice instead of ours said ron furiously listenyou know what mother got back after black had finished with him dad told me the order of merlin first class and finger in a box that was the biggest bit of him they could find a madman harry and dangerous 
 
 dad must have told him said harry ignoring ron he was right in inner circle 
 
 say will you interjected ron angrily 
 
 so obviously the malfoys knew black was working for voldemort 
 
 and love to see you blown into about a million pieces like pettigrew get a grip just hoping get yourself killed before he has to play you at quidditch 
 
 harry please said hermione her eyes now shining with tears please be sensible black did a terrible terrible thing but put yourself in danger what black wantsoh harry be playing right into hands if you went looking for him your mum and dad want you to get hurt would they never want you to go looking for black 
 
 never know what have wanted because thanks to black never spoken to them said harry shortly 
 
 there was a silence in which crookshanks stretched luxuriously flexing his claws pocket quivered 
 
 look said ron obviously casting around for a change of subject the holidays nearly christmas go down and see hagrid we visited him for ages 
 
 no said hermione quickly harry supposed to leave the castle ron 
 
 yeah go said harry sitting up and i can ask him how come he never mentioned black when he told me all about my parents 
 
 further discussion of sirius black plainly what ron had had in mind 
 
 or we could have a game of chess he said hastily or gobstones percy left a set 
 
 no visit hagrid said harry firmly 
 
 so they got their cloaks from their dormitories and set off through the portrait hole stand and fight you mongrels down through the empty castle and out through the oak front doors 
 
 they made their way slowly down the lawn making a shallow trench in the glittering powdery snow their socks and the hems of their cloaks soaked and freezing the forbidden forest looked as though it had been enchanted each tree smattered with silver and cabin looked like an iced cake 
 
 ron knocked but there was no answer 
 
 not out is he said hermione who was shivering under her cloak 
 
 ron had his ear to the door 
 
 a weird noise he said listen is that fang 
 
 harry and hermione put their ears to the door too from inside the cabin came a series of low throbbing moans 
 
 think better go and get someone said ron nervously 
 
 hagrid called harry thumping the door hagrid are you in there 
 
 there was a sound of heavy footsteps then the door creaked open hagrid stood there with his eyes red and swollen tears splashing down the front of his leather vest 
 
 heard he bellowed and he flung himself onto neck 
 
 hagrid being at least twice the size of a normal man this was no laughing matter harry about to collapse under weight was rescued by ron and hermione who each seized hagrid under an arm and heaved him back into the cabin hagrid allowed himself to be steered into a chair and slumped over the table sobbing uncontrollably his face glazed with tears that dripped down into his tangled beard 
 
 hagrid what is it said hermione aghast 
 
 harry spotted an letter lying open on the table 
 
 this hagrid 
 
 sobs redoubled but he shoved the letter toward harry who picked it up and read aloud 
 
 dear mr hagrid 
 further to our inquiry into the attack by a hippogriff on a student in your class we have accepted the assurances of professor dumbledore that you bear no responsibility for the regrettable incident 
 well okay then hagrid said ron clapping hagrid on the shoulder but hagrid continued to sob and waved one of his gigantic hands inviting harry to read on 
 
 however we must register our concern about the hippogriff in question we have decided to uphold the official complaint of mr lucius malfoy and this matter will therefore be taken to the committee for the disposal of dangerous creatures the hearing will take place on april th and we ask you to present yourself and your hippogriff at the offices in london on that date in the meantime the hippogriff should be kept tethered and isolated 
 yours in fellowship 
 there followed a list of the school governors 
 
 oh said ron but you said buckbeak a bad hippogriff hagrid i bet get off 
 
 yeh don know them gargoyles at the committee fer the disposal o dangerous creatures choked hagrid wiping his eyes on his sleeve got it in fer interestin creatures 
 
 a sudden sound from the corner of cabin made harry ron and hermione whip around buckbeak the hippogriff was lying in the corner chomping on something that was oozing blood all over the floor 
 
 i couldn leave him tied up out there in the snow choked hagrid all on his own at christmas 
 
 harry ron and hermione looked at one another they had never seen eye to eye with hagrid about what he called interesting creatures and other people called terrifying monsters on the other hand there seem to be any particular harm in buckbeak in fact by usual standards he was positively cute 
 
 have to put up a good strong defense hagrid said hermione sitting down and laying a hand on massive forearm sure you can prove buckbeak is safe 
 
 won make no sobbed hagrid them disposal devils all in lucius pocket scared o him ad if i lose the case buckbeak 
 
 hagrid drew his finger swiftly across his throat then gave a great wail and lurched forward his face in his arms 
 
 what about dumbledore hagrid said harry 
 
 done enough fer me already groaned hagrid got enough on his plate what with keepin them dementors outta the castle an sirius black lurkin around 
 
 ron and hermione looked quickly at harry as though expecting him to start berating hagrid for not telling him the truth about black but harry bring himself to do it not now that he saw hagrid so miserable and scared 
 
 listen hagrid he said you give up right you just need a good defense you can call us as witnesses 
 
 sure read about a case of said hermione thoughtfully where the hippogriff got off look it up for you hagrid and see exactly what happened 
 
 hagrid howled still more loudly harry and hermione looked at ron to help them 
 
 er shall i make a cup of tea said ron 
 
 harry stared at him 
 
 what my mum does whenever upset ron muttered shrugging 
 
 at last after many more assurances of help with a steaming mug of tea in front of him hagrid blew his nose on a handkerchief the size of a tablecloth and said yer right i can afford to go ter pieces gotta pull meself together 
 
 fang the boarhound came timidly out from under the table and laid his head on knee 
 
 not bin meself lately said hagrid stroking fang with one hand and mopping his face with the other worried abou buckbeak an no one likin me classes 
 
 we do like them lied hermione at once 
 
 yeah great said ron crossing his fingers under the table er how are the flobberworms 
 
 dead said hagrid gloomily too much lettuce 
 
 oh no said ron his lip twitching 
 
 an them dementors make me feel ruddy terrible an all said hagrid with a sudden shudder gotta walk past em time i want a drink in the three broomsticks s like bein back in azkaban 
 
 he fell silent gulping his tea harry ron and hermione watched him breathlessly they had never heard hagrid talk about his brief spell in azkaban before after a pause hermione said timidly is it awful in there hagrid 
 
 no idea said hagrid quietly never bin anywhere like it thought i was goin mad kep goin over horrible stuff in me mindthe day i got expelled from hogwartsday me dad diedday i had ter let norbert go 
 
 his eyes filled with tears norbert was the baby dragon hagrid had once won in a game of cards 
 
 yeh can really remember who yeh are after a while an yeh can really see the point o livin at all i used ter hope jus die in me sleep when they let me out it was like bein born again came floodin back it was the bes feelin in the world mind the dementors keen on lettin me go 
 
 but you were innocent said hermione 
 
 hagrid snorted 
 
 think that matters to them they don care long as got a couple o hundred humans stuck there with em so they can leech all the happiness out of em they don give a damn guilty an not 
 
 hagrid went quiet for a moment staring into his tea then he said quietly thought o jus letting buckbeak go tryin ter make him fly awaybut how explain ter a hippogriff gotta go inter hidin an an scared o breakin the law he looked up at them tears leaking down his face again i don ever want ter go back ter azkaban 
 
 
 
 the trip to though far from fun had nevertheless had the effect ron and hermione had hoped though harry had by no means forgotten about black he brood constantly on revenge if he wanted to help hagrid win his case against the committee for the disposal of dangerous creatures he ron and hermione went to the library the next day and returned to the empty common room laden with books that might help prepare a defense for buckbeak the three of them sat in front of the roaring fire slowly turning the pages of dusty volumes about famous cases of marauding beasts speaking occasionally when they ran across something relevant 
 
 somethingthere was a case in but the hippogriff was convicted ugh look what they did to it disgusting 
 
 this might help look a manticore savaged someone in and they let the manticore off oh no that was only because everyone was too scared to go near it 
 
 meanwhile in the rest of the castle the usual magnificent christmas decorations had been put up despite the fact that hardly any of the students remained to enjoy them thick streamers of holly and mistletoe were strung along the corridors mysterious lights shone from inside every suit of armor and the great hall was filled with its usual twelve christmas trees glittering with golden stars a powerful and delicious smell of cooking pervaded the corridors and by christmas eve it had grown so strong that even scabbers poked his nose out of the shelter of pocket to sniff hopefully at the air 
 
 on christmas morning harry was woken by ron throwing his pillow at him 
 
 oy presents 
 
 harry reached for his glasses and put them on squinting through the to the foot of his bed where a small heap of parcels had appeared ron was already ripping the paper off his own presents 
 
 another sweater from mummaroon againsee if got one 
 
 harry had mrs weasley had sent him a scarlet sweater with the gryffindor lion knitted on the front also a dozen mince pies some christmas cake and a box of nut brittle as he moved all these things aside he saw a long thin package lying underneath 
 
 that said ron looking over a freshly unwrapped pair of maroon socks in his hand 
 
 dunno 
 
 harry ripped the parcel open and gasped as a magnificent gleaming broomstick rolled out onto his bedspread ron dropped his socks and jumped off his bed for a closer look 
 
 i believe it he said hoarsely 
 
 it was a firebolt identical to the dream broom harry had gone to see every day in diagon alley its handle glittered as he picked it up he could feel it vibrating and let go it hung in midair unsupported at exactly the right height for him to mount it his eyes moved from the golden registration number at the top of the handle right down to the perfectly smooth streamlined birch twigs that made up the tail 
 
 who sent it to you said ron in a hushed voice 
 
 look and see if a card said harry 
 
 ron ripped apart the wrappings 
 
 nothing blimey spend that much on you 
 
 well said harry feeling stunned betting it the dursleys 
 
 i bet it was dumbledore said ron now walking around and around the firebolt taking in every glorious inch he sent you the invisibility cloak anonymously 
 
 that was my though said harry dumbledore was just passing it on to me he spend hundreds of galleons on me he go giving students stuff like this 
 
 why he say it was from him said ron in case some git like malfoy said it was favoritism hey harry ron gave a great whoop of laughter malfoy wait til he sees you on this be sick as a pig this is an international standard broom this is 
 
 i believe this harry muttered running a hand along the firebolt while ron sank onto bed laughing his head off at the thought of malfoy who 
 
 i know said ron controlling himself i know who it been lupin 
 
 what said harry now starting to laugh himself lupin listen if he had this much gold be able to buy himself some new robes 
 
 yeah but he likes you said ron and he was away when your nimbus got smashed and he heard about it and decided to visit diagon alley and get this for you 
 
 what mean he was away said harry he was ill when i was playing in that match 
 
 well he in the hospital wing said ron i was there cleaning out the bedpans on that detention from snape remember 
 
 harry frowned at ron 
 
 i see lupin affording something like this 
 
 you two laughing about 
 
 hermione had just come in wearing her dressing gown and carrying crookshanks who was looking very grumpy with a string of tinsel tied around his neck 
 
 bring him in here said ron hurriedly snatching scabbers from the depths of his bed and stowing him in his pajama pocket 
 
 but hermione listening she dropped crookshanks onto empty bed and stared at the firebolt 
 
 oh harry who sent you that 
 
 no idea said harry there a card or anything with it 
 
 to his great surprise hermione did not appear either excited or intrigued by the news on the contrary her face fell and she bit her lip 
 
 the matter with you said ron 
 
 i know said hermione slowly but a bit odd it i mean this is supposed to be quite a good broom it 
 
 ron sighed exasperatedly 
 
 the best broom there is hermione he said 
 
 so it been really expensive 
 
 probably cost more than all the slytherins brooms put together said ron happily 
 
 send harry something as expensive as that and not even tell him sent it said hermione 
 
 who cares said ron impatiently listen harry can i have a go on it can i 
 
 i think anyone should ride that broom just yet said hermione shrilly 
 
 harry and ron looked at her 
 
 what think going to do with it sweep the floor said ron 
 
 but before hermione could answer crookshanks sprang from bed right at chest 
 
 get him out of here ron bellowed as claws ripped his pajamas and scabbers attempted a wild escape over his shoulder ron seized scabbers by the tail and aimed a misjudged kick at crookshanks that hit the trunk at the end of bed knocking it over and causing ron to hop up and down howling with pain 
 
 fur suddenly stood on end a shrill tinny whistling was filling the room the pocket sneakoscope had become dislodged from uncle old socks and was whirling and gleaming on the floor 
 
 i forgot about that harry said bending down and picking up the sneakoscope i never wear those socks if i can help it 
 
 the sneakoscope whirled and whistled in his palm crookshanks was hissing and spitting at it 
 
 better take that cat out of here hermione said ron furiously sitting on bed nursing his toe you shut that thing up he added to harry as hermione strode out of the room yellow eyes still fixed maliciously on ron 
 
 harry stuffed the sneakoscope back inside the socks and threw it back into his trunk all that could be heard now were stifled moans of pain and rage scabbers was huddled in hands it had been a while since harry had seen him out of pocket and he was unpleasantly surprised to see that scabbers once so fat was now very skinny patches of fur seemed to have fallen out too 
 
 not looking too good is he harry said 
 
 stress said ron be fine if that big stupid furball left him alone 
 
 but harry remembering what the woman at the magical menagerie had said about rats living only three years help feeling that unless scabbers had powers he had never revealed he was reaching the end of his life and despite frequent complaints that scabbers was both boring and useless he was sure ron would be very miserable if scabbers died 
 
 christmas spirit was definitely thin on the ground in the gryffindor common room that morning hermione had shut crookshanks in her dormitory but was furious with ron for trying to kick him ron was still fuming about fresh attempt to eat scabbers harry gave up trying to make them talk to each other and devoted himself to examining the firebolt which he had brought down to the common room with him for some reason this seemed to annoy hermione as well she say anything but she kept looking darkly at the broom as though it too had been criticizing her cat 
 
 at lunchtime they went down to the great hall to find that the house tables had been moved against the walls again and that a single table set for twelve stood in the middle of the room professors dumbledore mcgonagall snape sprout and flitwick were there along with filch the caretaker who had taken off his usual brown coat and was wearing a very old and rather tailcoat there were only three other students two extremely first years and a slytherin fifth year 
 
 merry christmas said dumbledore as harry ron and hermione approached the table as there are so few of us it seemed foolish to use the house tablessit down sit down 
 
 harry ron and hermione sat down side by side at the end of the table 
 
 crackers said dumbledore enthusiastically offering the end of a large silver noisemaker to snape who took it reluctantly and tugged with a bang like a gunshot the cracker flew apart to reveal a large pointed witches hat topped with a stuffed vulture 
 
 harry remembering the boggart caught eye and they both grinned mouth thinned and he pushed the hat toward dumbledore who swapped it for his hat at once 
 
 dig in he advised the table beaming around 
 
 as harry was helping himself to roast potatoes the doors of the great hall opened again it was professor trelawney gliding toward them as though on wheels she had put on a green sequined dress in honor of the occasion making her look more than ever like a glittering oversized dragonfly 
 
 sibyll this is a pleasant surprise said dumbledore standing up 
 
 i have been crystal gazing headmaster said professor trelawney in her mistiest most faraway voice and to my astonishment i saw myself abandoning my solitary luncheon and coming to join you who am i to refuse the promptings of fate i at once hastened from my tower and i do beg you to forgive my lateness 
 
 certainly certainly said dumbledore his eyes twinkling let me draw you up a chair 
 
 and he did indeed draw a chair in midair with his wand which revolved for a few seconds before falling with a thud between professors snape and mcgonagall professor trelawney however did not sit down her enormous eyes had been roving around the table and she suddenly uttered a kind of soft scream 
 
 i dare not headmaster if i join the table we shall be thirteen nothing could be more unlucky never forget that when thirteen dine together the first to rise will be the first to die 
 
 risk it sibyll said professor mcgonagall impatiently do sit down the getting stone cold 
 
 professor trelawney hesitated then lowered herself into the empty chair eyes shut and mouth clenched tight as though expecting a thunderbolt to hit the table professor mcgonagall poked a large spoon into the nearest tureen 
 
 tripe sibyll 
 
 professor trelawney ignored her eyes open again she looked around once more and said but where is dear professor lupin 
 
 afraid the poor fellow is ill again said dumbledore indicating that everybody should start serving themselves most unfortunate that it should happen on christmas day 
 
 but surely you already knew that sibyll said professor mcgonagall her eyebrows raised 
 
 professor trelawney gave professor mcgonagall a very cold look 
 
 certainly i knew minerva she said quietly but one does not parade the fact that one is i frequently act as though i am not possessed of the inner eye so as not to make others nervous 
 
 that explains a great deal said professor mcgonagall tartly 
 
 professor voice suddenly became a good deal less misty 
 
 if you must know minerva i have seen that poor professor lupin will not be with us for very long he seems aware himself that his time is short he positively fled when i offered to crystal gaze for him 
 
 imagine that said professor mcgonagall dryly 
 
 i doubt said dumbledore in a cheerful but slightly raised voice which put an end to professor mcgonagall and professor conversation that professor lupin is in any immediate danger severus made the potion for him again 
 
 yes headmaster said snape 
 
 good said dumbledore then he should be up and about in no timederek have you had any of the chipolatas excellent 
 
 the boy went furiously red on being addressed directly by dumbledore and took the platter of sausages with trembling hands 
 
 professor trelawney behaved almost normally until the very end of christmas dinner two hours later full to bursting with christmas dinner and still wearing their cracker hats harry and ron got up first from the table and she shrieked loudly 
 
 my dears which of you left his seat first which 
 
 dunno said ron looking uneasily at harry 
 
 i doubt it will make much difference said professor mcgonagall coldly unless a mad is waiting outside the doors to slaughter the first into the entrance hall 
 
 even ron laughed professor trelawney looked highly affronted 
 
 coming harry said to hermione 
 
 no hermione muttered i want a quick word with professor mcgonagall 
 
 probably trying to see if she can take any more classes yawned ron as they make their way into the entrance hall which was completely devoid of mad 
 
 when they reached the portrait hole they found sir cadogan enjoying a christmas part with a couple of monks several previous headmasters of hogwarts and his fat pony he pushed up his visor toasted them with a flagon of mead 
 
 merry hic christmas password 
 
 scurvy cur said ron 
 
 and the same to you sir roared sir cadogan as the painting swung forward to admit them 
 
 harry went straight up to the dormitory collected his firebolt and the broomstick servicing kit hermione had given him for his birthday brought them downstairs and tried to find something to do with the firebolt however there where no bent twigs to clip and the handle was so shiny already it seemed pointless to polish it he and ron simply sat admiring it from every angle until the portrait hole opened and hermione came in accompanied by professor mcgonagall 
 
 though professor mcgonagall was head of gryffindor house harry had only seen her in the common room once before and that had been to make a very grave announcement he and ron stared at her both holding the firebolt hermione walked around them sat down picked up the nearest book and hid her face behind it 
 
 so it is it said professor mcgonagall beadily walking over to the fireside and staring at the firebolt miss granger has just informed me that you have been sent a broomstick potter 
 
 harry and ron looked around at hermione they could see her forehead reddening over the top of her book which was 
 
 may i said professor mcgonagall but she wait for an answer before pulling the firebolt out of their hands she examined it carefully from handle to hmm and there was no note at all potter no card no message of any kind 
 
 no said harry blankly 
 
 i see said professor mcgonagall well afraid i will have to take this potter 
 
 w what said harry scrambling to his feet why 
 
 it will need to be checked for jinxes said professor mcgonagall of course no expert but i daresay madam hooch and professor flitwick will strip it down 
 
 strip it down repeated ron as though professor mcgonagall was mad 
 
 it take more than a few weeks said professor mcgonagall you will have it back if we are sure it is 
 
 nothing wrong with it said harry his voice shaking slightly honestly professor 
 
 you know that potter said professor mcgonagall quite kindly not until flown it at any rate and afraid that is out of the question until we are certain that it has not been tampered with i shall keep you informed 
 
 professor mcgonagall turned on her heel and carried the firebolt out of the portrait hole which closed behind her harry stood staring after her the tin of polish still clutched in his hands ron however rounded on hermione 
 
 what did you go running to mcgonagall for 
 
 hermione threw her book aside she was still pink in the face but stood up and faced ron defiantly 
 
 because i thought and professor mcgonagall agrees with me that that broom was probably sent to harry by sirius black 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the prisoner of azkaban 
 

lionfish nov chapter eleven the fireboltcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 harry have a very clear idea of how he had managed to get back into the honeydukes cellar through the tunnel and into the castle once more all he knew was that the return trip seemed to take no time at all and that he hardly noticed what he was doing because his head was still pounding with the conversation he had just heard 
 
 why had nobody ever told him dumbledore hagrid mr weasley cornelius fudgewhy anyone ever mentioned the fact that parents had died because their best friend had betrayed them 
 
 ron and hermione watched harry nervously all through dinner not daring to talk about what overheard because percy was sitting close by them when they went upstairs to the crowded common room it was to find fred and george had set off half a dozen dungbombs in a fit of high spirits harry who want fred and george asking him whether reached hogsmeade or not sneaked quietly up to the empty dormitory and headed straight for his bedside cabinet he pushed his books aside and quickly found what he was looking for the photo album hagrid had given him two years ago which was full of wizard pictures of his mother and father he sat down on his bed drew the hangings around him and started turning the pages searching until 
 
 he stopped on a picture of his parents wedding day there was his father waving up at him beaming the untidy black hair harry had inherited standing up in all directions there was his mother alight with happiness arm in arm with his dad and therethat must be him their best manharry had never given him a thought before 
 
 if he known it was the same person he would never have guessed it was black in this old photograph his face sunken and waxy but handsome full of laughter had he already been working for voldemort when this picture had been taken was he already planning the deaths of the two people next to him did he realize he was facing twelve years in azkaban twelve years that would make him unrecognizable 
 
 but the dementors affect him harry thought staring into the handsome laughing face he have to hear my mum screaming if they get too close 
 
 harry slammed the album shut reached over and stuffed it back into his cabinet took off his robe and glasses and got into bed making sure the hangings were hiding him from view 
 
 the dormitory door opened 
 
 harry said voice uncertainly 
 
 but harry lay still pretending to be asleep he heard ron leave again and rolled over on his back his eyes wide open 
 
 a hatred such as he had never known before was coursing through harry like poison he could see black laughing at him through the darkness as though somebody had pasted the picture from the album over his eyes he watched as though somebody was playing him a piece of film sirius black blasting peter pettigrew who resembled neville longbottom into a thousand pieces he could hear though having no idea what voice might sound like a low excited mutter it has happened my lordthe potters have made me their and then came another voice laughing shrilly the same laugh that harry heard inside his head whenever the dementors drew near 
 
 harry you you look terrible 
 
 harry gotten to sleep until daybreak he had awoken to find the dormitory deserted dressed and gone down the spiral staircase to a common room that was completely empty except for ron who was eating a peppermint toad and massaging his stomach and hermione who had spread her homework over three tables 
 
 where is everyone said harry 
 
 gone the first day of the holidays remember said ron watching harry closely nearly lunchtime i was going to come and wake you up in a minute 
 
 harry slumped into a chair next to the fire snow was still falling outside the windows crookshanks was spread out in front of the fire like a large ginger rug 
 
 you really look well you know hermione said peering anxiously into his face 
 
 fine said harry 
 
 harry listen said hermione exchanging a look with ron you must be really upset about what we heard yesterday but the thing is you go doing anything stupid 
 
 like what said harry 
 
 like trying to go after black said ron sharply 
 
 harry could tell they had rehearsed this conversation while he had been asleep he say anything 
 
 you will you harry said hermione 
 
 because not worth dying for said ron 
 
 harry looked at them they seem to understand at all 
 
 know what i see and hear every time a dementor gets too near me ron and hermione shook their heads looking apprehensive i can hear my mum screaming and pleading with voldemort and if heard your mum screaming like that just about to be killed you forget it in a hurry and if you found out someone who was supposed to be a friend of hers betrayed her and sent voldemort after her 
 
 nothing you can do said hermione looking stricken the dementors will catch black and go back to azkaban and and serve him right 
 
 you heard what fudge said black affected by azkaban like normal people are not a punishment for him like it is for the others 
 
 so what are you saying said ron looking very tense you want to to kill black or something 
 
 be silly said hermione in a panicky voice harry want to kill anyone do you harry 
 
 again harry answer he know what he wanted to do all he knew was that the idea of doing nothing while black was at liberty was almost more than he could stand 
 
 malfoy knows he said abruptly remember what he said to me in potions if it was me hunt him down want revenge 
 
 going to take advice instead of ours said ron furiously listenyou know what mother got back after black had finished with him dad told me the order of merlin first class and finger in a box that was the biggest bit of him they could find a madman harry and dangerous 
 
 dad must have told him said harry ignoring ron he was right in inner circle 
 
 say will you interjected ron angrily 
 
 so obviously the malfoys knew black was working for voldemort 
 
 and love to see you blown into about a million pieces like pettigrew get a grip just hoping get yourself killed before he has to play you at quidditch 
 
 harry please said hermione her eyes now shining with tears please be sensible black did a terrible terrible thing but put yourself in danger what black wantsoh harry be playing right into hands if you went looking for him your mum and dad want you to get hurt would they never want you to go looking for black 
 
 never know what have wanted because thanks to black never spoken to them said harry shortly 
 
 there was a silence in which crookshanks stretched luxuriously flexing his claws pocket quivered 
 
 look said ron obviously casting around for a change of subject the holidays nearly christmas go down and see hagrid we visited him for ages 
 
 no said hermione quickly harry supposed to leave the castle ron 
 
 yeah go said harry sitting up and i can ask him how come he never mentioned black when he told me all about my parents 
 
 further discussion of sirius black plainly what ron had had in mind 
 
 or we could have a game of chess he said hastily or gobstones percy left a set 
 
 no visit hagrid said harry firmly 
 
 so they got their cloaks from their dormitories and set off through the portrait hole stand and fight you mongrels down through the empty castle and out through the oak front doors 
 
 they made their way slowly down the lawn making a shallow trench in the glittering powdery snow their socks and the hems of their cloaks soaked and freezing the forbidden forest looked as though it had been enchanted each tree smattered with silver and cabin looked like an iced cake 
 
 ron knocked but there was no answer 
 
 not out is he said hermione who was shivering under her cloak 
 
 ron had his ear to the door 
 
 a weird noise he said listen is that fang 
 
 harry and hermione put their ears to the door too from inside the cabin came a series of low throbbing moans 
 
 think better go and get someone said ron nervously 
 
 hagrid called harry thumping the door hagrid are you in there 
 
 there was a sound of heavy footsteps then the door creaked open hagrid stood there with his eyes red and swollen tears splashing down the front of his leather vest 
 
 heard he bellowed and he flung himself onto neck 
 
 hagrid being at least twice the size of a normal man this was no laughing matter harry about to collapse under weight was rescued by ron and hermione who each seized hagrid under an arm and heaved him back into the cabin hagrid allowed himself to be steered into a chair and slumped over the table sobbing uncontrollably his face glazed with tears that dripped down into his tangled beard 
 
 hagrid what is it said hermione aghast 
 
 harry spotted an letter lying open on the table 
 
 this hagrid 
 
 sobs redoubled but he shoved the letter toward harry who picked it up and read aloud 
 
 dear mr hagrid 
 further to our inquiry into the attack by a hippogriff on a student in your class we have accepted the assurances of professor dumbledore that you bear no responsibility for the regrettable incident 
 well okay then hagrid said ron clapping hagrid on the shoulder but hagrid continued to sob and waved one of his gigantic hands inviting harry to read on 
 
 however we must register our concern about the hippogriff in question we have decided to uphold the official complaint of mr lucius malfoy and this matter will therefore be taken to the committee for the disposal of dangerous creatures the hearing will take place on april th and we ask you to present yourself and your hippogriff at the offices in london on that date in the meantime the hippogriff should be kept tethered and isolated 
 yours in fellowship 
 there followed a list of the school governors 
 
 oh said ron but you said buckbeak a bad hippogriff hagrid i bet get off 
 
 yeh don know them gargoyles at the committee fer the disposal o dangerous creatures choked hagrid wiping his eyes on his sleeve got it in fer interestin creatures 
 
 a sudden sound from the corner of cabin made harry ron and hermione whip around buckbeak the hippogriff was lying in the corner chomping on something that was oozing blood all over the floor 
 
 i couldn leave him tied up out there in the snow choked hagrid all on his own at christmas 
 
 harry ron and hermione looked at one another they had never seen eye to eye with hagrid about what he called interesting creatures and other people called terrifying monsters on the other hand there seem to be any particular harm in buckbeak in fact by usual standards he was positively cute 
 
 have to put up a good strong defense hagrid said hermione sitting down and laying a hand on massive forearm sure you can prove buckbeak is safe 
 
 won make no sobbed hagrid them disposal devils all in lucius pocket scared o him ad if i lose the case buckbeak 
 
 hagrid drew his finger swiftly across his throat then gave a great wail and lurched forward his face in his arms 
 
 what about dumbledore hagrid said harry 
 
 done enough fer me already groaned hagrid got enough on his plate what with keepin them dementors outta the castle an sirius black lurkin around 
 
 ron and hermione looked quickly at harry as though expecting him to start berating hagrid for not telling him the truth about black but harry bring himself to do it not now that he saw hagrid so miserable and scared 
 
 listen hagrid he said you give up right you just need a good defense you can call us as witnesses 
 
 sure read about a case of said hermione thoughtfully where the hippogriff got off look it up for you hagrid and see exactly what happened 
 
 hagrid howled still more loudly harry and hermione looked at ron to help them 
 
 er shall i make a cup of tea said ron 
 
 harry stared at him 
 
 what my mum does whenever upset ron muttered shrugging 
 
 at last after many more assurances of help with a steaming mug of tea in front of him hagrid blew his nose on a handkerchief the size of a tablecloth and said yer right i can afford to go ter pieces gotta pull meself together 
 
 fang the boarhound came timidly out from under the table and laid his head on knee 
 
 not bin meself lately said hagrid stroking fang with one hand and mopping his face with the other worried abou buckbeak an no one likin me classes 
 
 we do like them lied hermione at once 
 
 yeah great said ron crossing his fingers under the table er how are the flobberworms 
 
 dead said hagrid gloomily too much lettuce 
 
 oh no said ron his lip twitching 
 
 an them dementors make me feel ruddy terrible an all said hagrid with a sudden shudder gotta walk past em time i want a drink in the three broomsticks s like bein back in azkaban 
 
 he fell silent gulping his tea harry ron and hermione watched him breathlessly they had never heard hagrid talk about his brief spell in azkaban before after a pause hermione said timidly is it awful in there hagrid 
 
 no idea said hagrid quietly never bin anywhere like it thought i was goin mad kep goin over horrible stuff in me mindthe day i got expelled from hogwartsday me dad diedday i had ter let norbert go 
 
 his eyes filled with tears norbert was the baby dragon hagrid had once won in a game of cards 
 
 yeh can really remember who yeh are after a while an yeh can really see the point o livin at all i used ter hope jus die in me sleep when they let me out it was like bein born again came floodin back it was the bes feelin in the world mind the dementors keen on lettin me go 
 
 but you were innocent said hermione 
 
 hagrid snorted 
 
 think that matters to them they don care long as got a couple o hundred humans stuck there with em so they can leech all the happiness out of em they don give a damn guilty an not 
 
 hagrid went quiet for a moment staring into his tea then he said quietly thought o jus letting buckbeak go tryin ter make him fly awaybut how explain ter a hippogriff gotta go inter hidin an an scared o breakin the law he looked up at them tears leaking down his face again i don ever want ter go back ter azkaban 
 
 
 
 the trip to though far from fun had nevertheless had the effect ron and hermione had hoped though harry had by no means forgotten about black he brood constantly on revenge if he wanted to help hagrid win his case against the committee for the disposal of dangerous creatures he ron and hermione went to the library the next day and returned to the empty common room laden with books that might help prepare a defense for buckbeak the three of them sat in front of the roaring fire slowly turning the pages of dusty volumes about famous cases of marauding beasts speaking occasionally when they ran across something relevant 
 
 somethingthere was a case in but the hippogriff was convicted ugh look what they did to it disgusting 
 
 this might help look a manticore savaged someone in and they let the manticore off oh no that was only because everyone was too scared to go near it 
 
 meanwhile in the rest of the castle the usual magnificent christmas decorations had been put up despite the fact that hardly any of the students remained to enjoy them thick streamers of holly and mistletoe were strung along the corridors mysterious lights shone from inside every suit of armor and the great hall was filled with its usual twelve christmas trees glittering with golden stars a powerful and delicious smell of cooking pervaded the corridors and by christmas eve it had grown so strong that even scabbers poked his nose out of the shelter of pocket to sniff hopefully at the air 
 
 on christmas morning harry was woken by ron throwing his pillow at him 
 
 oy presents 
 
 harry reached for his glasses and put them on squinting through the to the foot of his bed where a small heap of parcels had appeared ron was already ripping the paper off his own presents 
 
 another sweater from mummaroon againsee if got one 
 
 harry had mrs weasley had sent him a scarlet sweater with the gryffindor lion knitted on the front also a dozen mince pies some christmas cake and a box of nut brittle as he moved all these things aside he saw a long thin package lying underneath 
 
 that said ron looking over a freshly unwrapped pair of maroon socks in his hand 
 
 dunno 
 
 harry ripped the parcel open and gasped as a magnificent gleaming broomstick rolled out onto his bedspread ron dropped his socks and jumped off his bed for a closer look 
 
 i believe it he said hoarsely 
 
 it was a firebolt identical to the dream broom harry had gone to see every day in diagon alley its handle glittered as he picked it up he could feel it vibrating and let go it hung in midair unsupported at exactly the right height for him to mount it his eyes moved from the golden registration number at the top of the handle right down to the perfectly smooth streamlined birch twigs that made up the tail 
 
 who sent it to you said ron in a hushed voice 
 
 look and see if a card said harry 
 
 ron ripped apart the wrappings 
 
 nothing blimey spend that much on you 
 
 well said harry feeling stunned betting it the dursleys 
 
 i bet it was dumbledore said ron now walking around and around the firebolt taking in every glorious inch he sent you the invisibility cloak anonymously 
 
 that was my though said harry dumbledore was just passing it on to me he spend hundreds of galleons on me he go giving students stuff like this 
 
 why he say it was from him said ron in case some git like malfoy said it was favoritism hey harry ron gave a great whoop of laughter malfoy wait til he sees you on this be sick as a pig this is an international standard broom this is 
 
 i believe this harry muttered running a hand along the firebolt while ron sank onto bed laughing his head off at the thought of malfoy who 
 
 i know said ron controlling himself i know who it been lupin 
 
 what said harry now starting to laugh himself lupin listen if he had this much gold be able to buy himself some new robes 
 
 yeah but he likes you said ron and he was away when your nimbus got smashed and he heard about it and decided to visit diagon alley and get this for you 
 
 what mean he was away said harry he was ill when i was playing in that match 
 
 well he in the hospital wing said ron i was there cleaning out the bedpans on that detention from snape remember 
 
 harry frowned at ron 
 
 i see lupin affording something like this 
 
 you two laughing about 
 
 hermione had just come in wearing her dressing gown and carrying crookshanks who was looking very grumpy with a string of tinsel tied around his neck 
 
 bring him in here said ron hurriedly snatching scabbers from the depths of his bed and stowing him in his pajama pocket 
 
 but hermione listening she dropped crookshanks onto empty bed and stared at the firebolt 
 
 oh harry who sent you that 
 
 no idea said harry there a card or anything with it 
 
 to his great surprise hermione did not appear either excited or intrigued by the news on the contrary her face fell and she bit her lip 
 
 the matter with you said ron 
 
 i know said hermione slowly but a bit odd it i mean this is supposed to be quite a good broom it 
 
 ron sighed exasperatedly 
 
 the best broom there is hermione he said 
 
 so it been really expensive 
 
 probably cost more than all the slytherins brooms put together said ron happily 
 
 send harry something as expensive as that and not even tell him sent it said hermione 
 
 who cares said ron impatiently listen harry can i have a go on it can i 
 
 i think anyone should ride that broom just yet said hermione shrilly 
 
 harry and ron looked at her 
 
 what think going to do with it sweep the floor said ron 
 
 but before hermione could answer crookshanks sprang from bed right at chest 
 
 get him out of here ron bellowed as claws ripped his pajamas and scabbers attempted a wild escape over his shoulder ron seized scabbers by the tail and aimed a misjudged kick at crookshanks that hit the trunk at the end of bed knocking it over and causing ron to hop up and down howling with pain 
 
 fur suddenly stood on end a shrill tinny whistling was filling the room the pocket sneakoscope had become dislodged from uncle old socks and was whirling and gleaming on the floor 
 
 i forgot about that harry said bending down and picking up the sneakoscope i never wear those socks if i can help it 
 
 the sneakoscope whirled and whistled in his palm crookshanks was hissing and spitting at it 
 
 better take that cat out of here hermione said ron furiously sitting on bed nursing his toe you shut that thing up he added to harry as hermione strode out of the room yellow eyes still fixed maliciously on ron 
 
 harry stuffed the sneakoscope back inside the socks and threw it back into his trunk all that could be heard now were stifled moans of pain and rage scabbers was huddled in hands it had been a while since harry had seen him out of pocket and he was unpleasantly surprised to see that scabbers once so fat was now very skinny patches of fur seemed to have fallen out too 
 
 not looking too good is he harry said 
 
 stress said ron be fine if that big stupid furball left him alone 
 
 but harry remembering what the woman at the magical menagerie had said about rats living only three years help feeling that unless scabbers had powers he had never revealed he was reaching the end of his life and despite frequent complaints that scabbers was both boring and useless he was sure ron would be very miserable if scabbers died 
 
 christmas spirit was definitely thin on the ground in the gryffindor common room that morning hermione had shut crookshanks in her dormitory but was furious with ron for trying to kick him ron was still fuming about fresh attempt to eat scabbers harry gave up trying to make them talk to each other and devoted himself to examining the firebolt which he had brought down to the common room with him for some reason this seemed to annoy hermione as well she say anything but she kept looking darkly at the broom as though it too had been criticizing her cat 
 
 at lunchtime they went down to the great hall to find that the house tables had been moved against the walls again and that a single table set for twelve stood in the middle of the room professors dumbledore mcgonagall snape sprout and flitwick were there along with filch the caretaker who had taken off his usual brown coat and was wearing a very old and rather tailcoat there were only three other students two extremely first years and a slytherin fifth year 
 
 merry christmas said dumbledore as harry ron and hermione approached the table as there are so few of us it seemed foolish to use the house tablessit down sit down 
 
 harry ron and hermione sat down side by side at the end of the table 
 
 crackers said dumbledore enthusiastically offering the end of a large silver noisemaker to snape who took it reluctantly and tugged with a bang like a gunshot the cracker flew apart to reveal a large pointed witches hat topped with a stuffed vulture 
 
 harry remembering the boggart caught eye and they both grinned mouth thinned and he pushed the hat toward dumbledore who swapped it for his hat at once 
 
 dig in he advised the table beaming around 
 
 as harry was helping himself to roast potatoes the doors of the great hall opened again it was professor trelawney gliding toward them as though on wheels she had put on a green sequined dress in honor of the occasion making her look more than ever like a glittering oversized dragonfly 
 
 sibyll this is a pleasant surprise said dumbledore standing up 
 
 i have been crystal gazing headmaster said professor trelawney in her mistiest most faraway voice and to my astonishment i saw myself abandoning my solitary luncheon and coming to join you who am i to refuse the promptings of fate i at once hastened from my tower and i do beg you to forgive my lateness 
 
 certainly certainly said dumbledore his eyes twinkling let me draw you up a chair 
 
 and he did indeed draw a chair in midair with his wand which revolved for a few seconds before falling with a thud between professors snape and mcgonagall professor trelawney however did not sit down her enormous eyes had been roving around the table and she suddenly uttered a kind of soft scream 
 
 i dare not headmaster if i join the table we shall be thirteen nothing could be more unlucky never forget that when thirteen dine together the first to rise will be the first to die 
 
 risk it sibyll said professor mcgonagall impatiently do sit down the getting stone cold 
 
 professor trelawney hesitated then lowered herself into the empty chair eyes shut and mouth clenched tight as though expecting a thunderbolt to hit the table professor mcgonagall poked a large spoon into the nearest tureen 
 
 tripe sibyll 
 
 professor trelawney ignored her eyes open again she looked around once more and said but where is dear professor lupin 
 
 afraid the poor fellow is ill again said dumbledore indicating that everybody should start serving themselves most unfortunate that it should happen on christmas day 
 
 but surely you already knew that sibyll said professor mcgonagall her eyebrows raised 
 
 professor trelawney gave professor mcgonagall a very cold look 
 
 certainly i knew minerva she said quietly but one does not parade the fact that one is i frequently act as though i am not possessed of the inner eye so as not to make others nervous 
 
 that explains a great deal said professor mcgonagall tartly 
 
 professor voice suddenly became a good deal less misty 
 
 if you must know minerva i have seen that poor professor lupin will not be with us for very long he seems aware himself that his time is short he positively fled when i offered to crystal gaze for him 
 
 imagine that said professor mcgonagall dryly 
 
 i doubt said dumbledore in a cheerful but slightly raised voice which put an end to professor mcgonagall and professor conversation that professor lupin is in any immediate danger severus made the potion for him again 
 
 yes headmaster said snape 
 
 good said dumbledore then he should be up and about in no timederek have you had any of the chipolatas excellent 
 
 the boy went furiously red on being addressed directly by dumbledore and took the platter of sausages with trembling hands 
 
 professor trelawney behaved almost normally until the very end of christmas dinner two hours later full to bursting with christmas dinner and still wearing their cracker hats harry and ron got up first from the table and she shrieked loudly 
 
 my dears which of you left his seat first which 
 
 dunno said ron looking uneasily at harry 
 
 i doubt it will make much difference said professor mcgonagall coldly unless a mad is waiting outside the doors to slaughter the first into the entrance hall 
 
 even ron laughed professor trelawney looked highly affronted 
 
 coming harry said to hermione 
 
 no hermione muttered i want a quick word with professor mcgonagall 
 
 probably trying to see if she can take any more classes yawned ron as they make their way into the entrance hall which was completely devoid of mad 
 
 when they reached the portrait hole they found sir cadogan enjoying a christmas part with a couple of monks several previous headmasters of hogwarts and his fat pony he pushed up his visor toasted them with a flagon of mead 
 
 merry hic christmas password 
 
 scurvy cur said ron 
 
 and the same to you sir roared sir cadogan as the painting swung forward to admit them 
 
 harry went straight up to the dormitory collected his firebolt and the broomstick servicing kit hermione had given him for his birthday brought them downstairs and tried to find something to do with the firebolt however there where no bent twigs to clip and the handle was so shiny already it seemed pointless to polish it he and ron simply sat admiring it from every angle until the portrait hole opened and hermione came in accompanied by professor mcgonagall 
 
 though professor mcgonagall was head of gryffindor house harry had only seen her in the common room once before and that had been to make a very grave announcement he and ron stared at her both holding the firebolt hermione walked around them sat down picked up the nearest book and hid her face behind it 
 
 so it is it said professor mcgonagall beadily walking over to the fireside and staring at the firebolt miss granger has just informed me that you have been sent a broomstick potter 
 
 harry and ron looked around at hermione they could see her forehead reddening over the top of her book which was 
 
 may i said professor mcgonagall but she wait for an answer before pulling the firebolt out of their hands she examined it carefully from handle to hmm and there was no note at all potter no card no message of any kind 
 
 no said harry blankly 
 
 i see said professor mcgonagall well afraid i will have to take this potter 
 
 w what said harry scrambling to his feet why 
 
 it will need to be checked for jinxes said professor mcgonagall of course no expert but i daresay madam hooch and professor flitwick will strip it down 
 
 strip it down repeated ron as though professor mcgonagall was mad 
 
 it take more than a few weeks said professor mcgonagall you will have it back if we are sure it is 
 
 nothing wrong with it said harry his voice shaking slightly honestly professor 
 
 you know that potter said professor mcgonagall quite kindly not until flown it at any rate and afraid that is out of the question until we are certain that it has not been tampered with i shall keep you informed 
 
 professor mcgonagall turned on her heel and carried the firebolt out of the portrait hole which closed behind her harry stood staring after her the tin of polish still clutched in his hands ron however rounded on hermione 
 
 what did you go running to mcgonagall for 
 
 hermione threw her book aside she was still pink in the face but stood up and faced ron defiantly 
 
 because i thought and professor mcgonagall agrees with me that that broom was probably sent to harry by sirius black

 there was a definite gloom in the air when harry awoke next morning heavy rain was still splattering against the window as he got dressed in jeans and a sweatshirt they would change into their school robes on the hogwarts express 
 
 he ron fred and george had just reached the landing on their way down to breakfast when mrs weasley appeared at the foot of the stairs looking harassed 
 
 arthur she called up the staircase arthur urgent message from the ministry 
 
 harry flattened himself against the wall as mr weasley came clattering past with his robes on and hurtled out of sight when harry and the others entered the kitchen they saw mrs weasley rummaging anxiously in the drawers got a quill here somewhere and mr weasley bending over the fire talking to 
 
 harry shut his eyes hard and opened them again to make sure that they were working properly 
 
 amos head was sitting in the middle of the flames like a large bearded egg it was talking very fast completely unperturbed by the sparks flying around it and the flames licking its ears 
 
 muggle neighbors heard bangs and shouting so they went and called those arthur got to get over there 
 
 here said mrs weasley breathlessly pushing a piece of parchment a bottle of ink and a crumpled quill into mr hands 
 
 a real stroke of luck i heard about it said mr head i had to come into the office early to send a couple of owls and i found the improper use of magic lot all setting off if rita skeeter gets hold of this one arthur

 mr head rolled its eyes says he heard an intruder in his yard says he was creeping toward the house but was ambushed by his dustbins

 mr weasley groaned 
 
 and what about the intruder 
 
 arthur you know said mr head rolling its eyes again someone creeping into his yard in the dead of night more likely a very cat wandering around somewhere covered in potato peelings but if the improper use of magic lot get their hands on had it think of his record got to get him off on a minor charge something in your department what are exploding dustbins worth 
 
 might be a caution said mr weasley still writing very fast his brow furrowed use his wand he actually attack anyone 
 
 bet he leapt out of bed and started jinxing everything he could reach through the window said mr diggory but have a job proving it there any casualties 
 
 all right off mr weasley said and he stuffed the parchment with his notes on it into his pocket and dashed out of the kitchen again 
 
 mr head looked around at mrs weasley 
 
 sorry about this molly it said more calmly bothering you so early and everythingbut the only one who can get off and supposed to be starting his new job today why he had to choose last night 
 
 never mind amos said mrs weasley sure you have a bit of toast or anything before you go 
 
 oh go on then said mr diggory 
 
 mrs weasley took a piece of buttered toast from a stack on the kitchen table put it into the fire tongs and transferred it into mr mouth 
 
 fanks he said in a muffled voice and then with a small pop vanished 
 
 harry could hear mr weasley calling hurried to bill charlie percy and the girls within five minutes he was back in the kitchen his robes on the right way now dragging a comb through his hair

 bill and charlie decided to come and see everyone off at cross station but percy apologizing most profusely said that he really needed to get to work 
 
 i just justify taking more time off at the moment he told them mr crouch is really starting to rely on me 
 
 yeah you know what percy said george seriously i reckon know your name soon 
 
 mrs weasley had braved the telephone in the village post office to order three ordinary muggle taxis to take them into london 
 
 arthur tried to borrow ministry cars for us mrs weasley whispered to harry as they stood in the yard watching the taxi drivers heaving six heavy hogwarts trunks into their cars but there any to dear they look happy do they 
 
 harry like to tell mrs weasley that muggle taxi drivers rarely transported overexcited owls and pigwidgeon was making an earsplitting racket nor did it help that a number of fabulous fireworks went off unexpectedly when trunk sprang open causing the driver carrying it to yell with fright and pain as crookshanks clawed his way up the leg 
 
 the journey was uncomfortable owing to the fact that they were jammed in the back of the taxis with their trunks crookshanks took quite a while to recover from the fireworks and by the time they entered london harry ron and hermione were all severely scratched they were very relieved to get out at cross even though the rain was coming down harder than ever and they got soaked carrying their trunks across the busy road and into the station 
 
 harry was used to getting onto platform nine and by now it was a simple matter of walking straight through the apparently solid barrier dividing platforms nine and ten the only tricky part was doing this in an unobtrusive way so as to avoid attracting muggle attention they did it in groups today harry ron and hermione the most conspicuous since they were accompanied by pigwidgeon and crookshanks went first they leaned casually against the barrier chatting unconcernedly and slid sideways through itand as they did so platform nine and materialized in front of them 
 
 the hogwarts express a gleaming scarlet steam engine was already there clouds of steam billowing from it through which the many hogwarts students and parents on the platform appeared like dark ghosts pigwidgeon became noisier than ever in response to the hooting of many owls through the mist harry ron and hermione set off to find seats and were soon stowing their luggage in a compartment halfway along the train they then hopped back down onto the platform to say to mrs weasley bill and charlie 
 
 i might be seeing you all sooner than you think said charlie grinning as he hugged ginny 
 
 why said fred keenly 
 
 see said charlie just tell percy i mentioned classified information until such time as the ministry sees fit to release it after all 
 
 yeah i sort of wish i were back at hogwarts this year said bill hands in his pockets looking almost wistfully at the train 
 
 why said george impatiently 
 
 going to have an interesting year said bill his eyes twinkling i might even get time off to come and watch a bit of it 
 
 a bit of what said ron 
 
 but at that moment the whistle blew and mrs weasley chivvied them toward the train doors 
 
 thanks for having us to stay mrs weasley said hermione as they climbed on board closed the door and leaned out of the window to talk to her 
 
 yeah thanks for everything mrs weasley said harry 
 
 oh it was my pleasure dears said mrs weasley invite you for christmas butwell i expect all going to want to stay at hogwarts what withone thing and another 
 
 mum said ron irritably what three know that we 
 
 find out this evening i expect said mrs weasley smiling going to be very exciting mind you very glad changed the rules 
 
 what rules said harry ron fred and george together 
 
 sure professor dumbledore will tell behave you you fred and you george 
 
 the pistons hissed loudly and the train began to move 
 
 tell us happening at hogwarts fred bellowed out of the window as mrs weasley bill and charlie sped away from them what rules are they changing 
 
 but mrs weasley only smiled and waved before the train had rounded the corner she bill and charlie had disapparated 
 
 harry ron and hermione went back to their compartment the thick rain splattering the windows made it very difficult to see out of them ron undid his trunk pulled out his maroon dress robes and flung them over cage to muffle his hooting 
 
 bagman wanted to tell us happening at hogwarts he said grumpily sitting down next to harry at the world cup remember but my own mother say wonder what 
 
 shh hermione whispered suddenly pressing her finger to her lips and pointing toward the compartment next to theirs harry and ron listened and heard a familiar drawling voice drifting in through the open door 
 
 father actually considered sending me to durmstrang rather than hogwarts you know he knows the headmaster you see well you know his opinion of dumbledore the such a and durmstrang admit that sort of riffraff but mother like the idea of me going to school so far away father says durmstrang takes a far more sensible line than hogwarts about the dark arts durmstrang students actually learn them not just the defense rubbish we do 
 
 hermione got up tiptoed to the compartment door and slid it shut blocking out voice 
 
 so he thinks durmstrang would have suited him does he she said angrily i wish he had gone then we have to put up with him 
 
 another wizarding school said harry 
 
 yes said hermione sniffily and got a horrible reputation according to an appraisal of magical education in europe it puts a lot of emphasis on the dark arts 
 
 i think heard of it said ron vaguely where is it what country 
 
 well nobody knows do they said hermione raising her eyebrows 
 
 er why not said harry 
 
 traditionally been a lot of rivalry between all the magic schools durmstrang and beauxbatons like to conceal their whereabouts so nobody can steal their secrets said hermione 
 
 come off it said ron starting to laugh got to be about the same size as hogwarts how are you going to hide a great big castle 
 
 but hogwarts is hidden said hermione in surprise everyone knows thatwell everyone read hogwarts a history anyway 
 
 just you then said ron so go on how hide a place like hogwarts 
 
 bewitched said hermione if a muggle looks at it all they see is a moldering old ruin with a sign over the entrance saying danger do not enter unsafe 
 
 so just look like a ruin to an outsider too 
 
 maybe said hermione shrugging or it might have charms on it like the world cup stadium and to keep foreign wizards from finding it have made it unplottable 
 
 come again 
 
 well you can enchant a building so impossible to plot on a map you 
 
 erif you say so said harry 
 
 but i think durmstrang must be somewhere in the far north said hermione thoughtfully somewhere very cold because got fur capes as part of their uniforms 
 
 ah think of the possibilities said ron dreamily it been so easy to push malfoy off a glacier and make it look like an his mother likes him 
 
 the rain became heavier and heavier as the train moved farther north the sky was so dark and the windows so steamy that the lanterns were lit by midday the lunch trolley came rattling along the corridor and harry bought a large stack of cauldron cakes for them to share 
 
 several of their friends looked in on them as the afternoon progressed including seamus finnigan dean thomas and neville longbottom a extremely forgetful boy who had been brought up by his formidable witch of a grandmother seamus was still wearing his ireland rosette some of its magic seemed to be wearing off now it was still squeaking troy mullet moran but in a very feeble and exhausted sort of way after half an hour or so hermione growing tired of the endless quidditch talk buried herself once more in the standard book of spells grade and started trying to learn a summoning charm 
 
 neville listened jealously to the others conversation as they relived the cup match 
 
 gran want to go he said miserably buy tickets it sounded amazing though 
 
 it was said ron look at this neville 
 
 he rummaged in his trunk up in the luggage rack and pulled out the miniature figure of viktor krum 
 
 oh wow said neville enviously as ron tipped krum onto his pudgy hand 
 
 we saw him right up close as well said ron we were in the top box 
 
 for the first and last time in your life weasley 
 
 draco malfoy had appeared in the doorway behind him stood crabbe and goyle his enormous thuggish cronies both of whom appeared to have grown at least a foot during the summer evidently they had overheard the conversation through the compartment door which dean and seamus had left ajar 
 
 remember asking you to join us malfoy said harry coolly 
 
 weasleywhat is that said malfoy pointing at cage a sleeve of dress robes was dangling from it swaying with the motion of the train the moldy lace cuff very obvious 
 
 ron made to stuff the robes out of sight but malfoy was too quick for him he seized the sleeve and pulled 
 
 look at this said malfoy in ecstasy holding up robes and showing crabbe and goyle weasley you thinking of wearing these were you i mean they were very fashionable in about eighteen ninety 
 
 eat dung malfoy said ron the same color as the dress robes as he snatched them back out of grip malfoy howled with derisive laughter crabbe and goyle guffawed stupidly 
 
 sogoing to enter weasley going to try and bring a bit of glory to the family name money involved as well you be able to afford some decent robes if you won 
 
 what are you talking about snapped ron 
 
 are you going to enter malfoy repeated i suppose you will potter you never miss a chance to show off do you 
 
 either explain what on about or go away malfoy said hermione testily over the top of the standard book of spells grade 
 
 a gleeful smile spread across pale face 
 
 tell me you know he said delightedly got a father and brother at the ministry and you even know my god my father told me about it ages agoheard it from cornelius fudge but then always associated with the top people at the your too junior to know about it weasleyyesthey probably talk about important stuff in front of him 
 
 laughing once more malfoy beckoned to crabbe and goyle and the three of them disappeared 
 
 ron got to his feet and slammed the sliding compartment door so hard behind them that the glass shattered 
 
 ron said hermione reproachfully and she pulled out her wand muttered reparo and the glass shards flew back into a single pane and back into the door 
 
 wellmaking it look like he knows everything and we ron snarled always associated with the top people at the got a promotion any timehe just likes it where he is 
 
 of course he does said hermione quietly let malfoy get to you ron 
 
 him get to me as if said ron picking up one of the remaining cauldron cakes and squashing it into a pulp 
 
 bad mood continued for the rest of the journey he talk much as they changed into their school robes and was still glowering when the hogwarts express slowed down at last and finally stopped in the of hogsmeade station 
 
 as the train doors opened there was a rumble of thunder overhead hermione bundled up crookshanks in her cloak and ron left his dress robes over pigwidgeon as they left the train heads bent and eyes narrowed against the downpour the rain was now coming down so thick and fast that it was as though buckets of water were being emptied repeatedly over their heads 
 
 hi hagrid harry yelled seeing a gigantic silhouette at the far end of the platform 
 
 all righ harry hagrid bellowed back waving see yeh at the feast if we don drown 
 
 first years traditionally reached hogwarts castle by sailing across the lake with hagrid 
 
 oooh i fancy crossing the lake in this weather said hermione fervently shivering as they inched slowly along the dark platform with the rest of the crowd a hundred horseless carriages stood waiting for them outside the station harry ron hermione and neville climbed gratefully into one of them the door shut with a snap and a few moments later with a great lurch the long procession of carriages was rumbling and splashing its way up the track toward hogwarts castle

 tell me you know he said delightedly got a father and brother at the ministry and you even know my god my father told me about it ages agoheard it from cornelius fudge but then always associated with the top people at the your too junior to know about it weasleyyesthey probably talk about important stuff in front of him 
 
 laughing once more malfoy beckoned to crabbe and goyle and the three of them disappeared 
 
 ron got to his feet and slammed the sliding compartment door so hard behind them that the glass shattered 
 
 ron said hermione reproachfully and she pulled out her wand muttered reparo and the glass shards flew back into a single pane and back into the door 
 
 wellmaking it look like he knows everything and we ron snarled always associated with the top people at the got a promotion any timehe just likes it where he is 
 
 of course he does said hermione quietly let malfoy get to you ron 
 
 him get to me as if said ron picking up one of the remaining cauldron cakes and squashing it into a pulp 
 
 bad mood continued for the rest of the journey he talk much as they changed into their school robes and was still glowering when the hogwarts express slowed down at last and finally stopped in the of hogsmeade station 
 
 as the train doors opened there was a rumble of thunder overhead hermione bundled up crookshanks in her cloak and ron left his dress robes over pigwidgeon as they left the train heads bent and eyes narrowed against the downpour the rain was now coming down so thick and fast that it was as though buckets of water were being emptied repeatedly over their heads 
 
 hi hagrid harry yelled seeing a gigantic silhouette at the far end of the platform 
 
 all righ harry hagrid bellowed back waving see yeh at the feast if we don drown 
 
 first years traditionally reached hogwarts castle by sailing across the lake with hagrid 
 
 oooh i fancy crossing the lake in this weather said hermione fervently shivering as they inched slowly along the dark platform with the rest of the crowd a hundred horseless carriages stood waiting for them outside the station harry ron hermione and neville climbed gratefully into one of them the door shut with a snap and a few moments later with a great lurch the long procession of carriages was rumbling and splashing its way up the track toward hogwarts castle

 harry did not want to tell the others that he and luna were having the same hallucination if that was what it was so he said nothing more about the horses as he sat down inside the carriage and slammed the door behind him nevertheless he could not help watching the silhouettes of the horses moving beyond the window 
 
 did everyone see that woman asked ginny she doing back here hagrid have left can he 
 
 be quite glad if he has said luna he a very good teacher is he 
 
 yes he is said harry ron and ginny angrily 
 
 harry glared at hermione she cleared her throat and quickly said erm yes very good 
 
 well we in ravenclaw think a bit of a joke said luna unfazed 
 
 got a rubbish sense of humour then ron snapped as the wheels below them creaked into motion 
 
 luna did not seem perturbed by rudeness on the contrary she simply watched him for a while as though he were a mildly interesting television programme 
 
 rattling and swaying the carriages moved in convoy up the road when they passed between the tall stone pillars topped with winged boars on either side of the gates to the school grounds harry leaned forwards to try and see whether there were any lights on in cabin by the forbidden forest but the grounds were in complete darkness hogwarts castle however loomed ever closer a towering mass of turrets jet black against the dark sky here and there a window blazing fiery bright above them 
 
 the carriages jingled to a halt near the stone steps leading up to the oak front doors and harry got out of the carriage first he turned again to look for lit windows down by the forest but there was definitely no sign of life within cabin unwillingly because he had they would have vanished he turned his eyes instead upon the strange skeletal creatures standing quietly in the chill night air their blank white eyes gleaming 
 
 harry had once before had the experience of seeing something that ron could not but that had been a reflection in a mirror something much more insubstantial than a hundred very beasts strong enough to pull a fleet of carriages if luna was to be believed the beasts had always been there but invisible why then could harry suddenly see them and why could ron not 
 
 are you coming or what said ron beside him 
 
 oh yeah said harry quickly and they joined the crowd hurrying up the stone steps into the castle 
 
 the entrance hall was ablaze with torches and echoing with footsteps as the students crossed the flagged stone floor for the double doors to the right leading to the great hall and the feast 
 
 the four long house tables in the great hall were filling up under the starless black ceiling which was just like the sky they could glimpse through the high windows candles floated in midair all along the tables illuminating the silvery ghosts who were dotted about the hall and the faces of the students talking eagerly exchanging summer news shouting greetings at friends from other houses eyeing one new haircuts and robes again harry noticed people putting their heads together to whisper as he passed he gritted his teeth and tried to act as though he neither noticed nor cared 
 
 luna drifted away from them at the ravenclaw table the moment they reached ginny was hailed by some fellow and left to sit with them harry ron hermione and neville found seats together about halfway down the table between nearly headless nick the gryffindor house ghost and parvati patil and lavender brown the last two of whom gave harry airy greetings that made him quite sure they had stopped talking about him a split second before he had more important things to worry about however he was looking over the students heads to the staff table that ran along the top wall of the hall 
 
 not there 
 
 ron and hermione scanned the staff table too though there was no real need size made him instantly obvious in any lineup 
 
 he have left said ron sounding slightly anxious 
 
 of course he said harry firmly 
 
 you think hurt or anything do you said hermione uneasily 
 
 no said harry at once 
 
 but where is he then 
 
 there was a pause then harry said very quietly so that neville parvati and lavender could not hear maybe not back yet you knowfrom his missionthe thing he was doing over the summer for dumbledore 
 
 yeah yeah be it said ron sounding reassured but hermione bit her lip looking up and down the staff table as though hoping for some conclusive explanation of absence 
 
 that she said sharply pointing towards the middle of the staff table 
 
 eyes followed hers they lit first upon professor dumbledore sitting in his golden chair at the centre of the long staff table wearing robes scattered with silvery stars and a matching hat head was inclined towards the woman sitting next to him who was talking into his ear she looked harry thought like maiden aunt squat with short curly hair in which she had placed a horrible pink alice band that matched the fluffy pink cardigan she wore over her robes then she turned her face slightly to take a sip from her goblet and he saw with a shock of recognition a pallid toadlike face and a pair of prominent pouchy eyes 
 
 that umbridge woman 
 
 who said hermione 
 
 she was at my hearing she works for fudge 
 
 nice cardigan said ron smirking 
 
 she works for fudge hermione repeated frowning what on she doing here then 
 
 dunno 
 
 hermione scanned the staff table her eyes narrowed 
 
 no she muttered no surely not 
 
 harry did not understand what she was talking about but did not ask his attention had been caught by professor who had just appeared behind the staff table she worked her way along to the very end and took the seat that ought to have been that meant the must have crossed the lake and reached the castle and sure enough a few seconds later the doors from the entrance hall opened a long line of entered led by professor mcgonagall who was carrying a stool on which sat an ancient wizards hat heavily patched and darned with a wide rip near the frayed brim 
 
 the buzz of talk in the great hall faded away the lined up in front of the staff table facing the rest of the students and professor mcgonagall placed the stool carefully in front of them then stood back 
 
 the faces glowed palely in the candlelight a small boy right in the middle of the row looked as though he was trembling harry recalled fleetingly how terrified he had felt when he had stood there waiting for the unknown test that would determine to which house he belonged 
 
 the whole school waited with bated breath then the rip near the brim opened wide like a mouth and the sorting hat burst into song 
 
 in times of old when i was new 
 
 and hogwarts barely started 
 
 the founders of our noble school 
 
 thought never to be parted 
 
 united by a common goal 
 
 they had the selfsame yearning 
 
 to make the best magic school 
 
 and pass along their learning 
 
 together we will build and teach 
 
 the four good friends decided 
 
 and never did they dream that they 
 
 might some day be divided 
 
 for were there such friends anywhere 
 
 as slytherin and gryffindor 
 
 unless it was the second pair 
 
 of hufflepuff and ravenclaw 
 
 so how could it have gone so wrong 
 
 how could such friendships fail 
 
 why i was there and so can tell 
 
 the whole sad sorry tale 
 
 said slytherin teach just those 
 
 whose ancestry is purest 
 
 said ravenclaw teach those whose 
 
 intelligence is surest 
 
 said gryffindor teach all those 
 
 with brave deeds to their name 
 
 said hufflepuff teach the lot 
 
 and treat them just the same 
 
 these differences caused little strife 
 
 when first they came to light 
 
 for each of the four founders had 
 
 a house in which they might 
 
 take only those they wanted so 
 
 for instance slytherin 
 
 took only wizards 
 
 of great cunning just like him 
 
 and only those of sharpest mind 
 
 were taught by ravenclaw 
 
 while the bravest and the boldest 
 
 went to daring gryffindor 
 
 good hufflepuff she took the rest 
 
 and taught them all she knew 
 
 thus the houses and their founders 
 
 retained friendships firm and true 
 
 so hogwarts worked in harmony 
 
 for several happy years 
 
 but then discord crept among us 
 
 feeding on our faults and fears 
 
 the houses that like pillars four 
 
 had once held up our school 
 
 now turned upon each other and 
 
 divided sought to rule 
 
 and for a while it seemed the school 
 
 must meet an early end 
 
 what with duelling and with fighting 
 
 and the clash of friend on friend 
 
 and at last there came c morning 
 
 when old slytherin departed 
 
 and though the fighting then died out 
 
 he left us quite downhearted 
 
 and never since the founders four 
 
 were whittled down to three 
 
 have the houses been united 
 
 as they once were meant to be 
 
 and now the sorting hat is here 
 
 and you all know the score 
 
 i sort you into houses 
 
 because that is what for 
 
 but this year go further 
 
 listen closely to my song 
 
 though condemned i am to split you 
 
 still i worry that wrong 
 
 though i must fulfil my duty 
 
 and must quarter every year 
 
 still i wonder whether sorting 
 
 may not bring the end i fear 
 
 oh know the perils read the signs 
 
 the warning history shows 
 
 for our hogwarts is in danger 
 
 from external deadly foes 
 
 and we must unite inside her 
 
 or crumble from within 
 
 i have told you i have warned you 
 
 let the sorting now begin 
 
 
 
 the hat became motionless once more applause broke out though it was punctured for the first time in memory with muttering and whispers all across the great hall students were exchanging remarks with their neighbours and harry clapping along with everyone else knew exactly what they were talking about 
 
 branched out a bit this year it said ron his eyebrows raised 
 
 too right it has said harry 
 
 the sorting hat usually confined itself to describing the different qualities looked for by each of the four hogwarts houses and its own role in sorting them harry could not remember it ever trying to give the school advice before 
 
 i wonder if ever given warnings before said hermione sounding slightly anxious 
 
 yes indeed said nearly headless nick knowledgeably leaning across neville towards her neville winced it was very uncomfortable to have a ghost lean through you the hat feels itself to give the school due warning whenever it feels 
 
 but professor mcgonagall who was waiting to read out the list of names was giving the whispering students the sort of look that scorches nearly headless nick placed a finger to his lips and sat primly upright again as the muttering came to an abrupt end with a last frowning look that swept the lour house tables professor mcgonagall lowered her eyes to her long piece of parchment and called out the first name 
 
 abercrombie euan 
 
 the boy harry had noticed earlier stumbled forwards and put the hat on his head it was only prevented from falling right down to his shoulders by his very prominent ears the hat considered for a moment then the rip near the brim opened again and shouted 
 
 gryffindor 
 
 harry clapped loudly with the rest of gryffindor house as euan abercrombie staggered to their table and sat down looking as though he would like very much to sink through the floor and never be looked at again 
 
 slowly the long line of thinned in the pauses between the names and the sorting decisions harry could hear stomach rumbling loudly finally zeller rose was sorted into hufflepuff and professor mcgonagall picked up the hat and stool and marched them away as professor dumbledore rose to his feet 
 
 whatever his recent bitter feelings had been towards his headmaster harry was somehow soothed to see dumbledore standing before them all between the absence of hagrid and the presence of those dragonish horses he had felt that his return to hogwarts so long anticipated was full of unexpected surprises like jarring notes in a familiar song but this at least was how it was supposed to be their headmaster rising to greet them all before the feast 
 
 to our newcomers said dumbledore in a ringing voice his arms stretched wide and a beaming smile on his lips welcome to our old handswelcome back there is a time for but this is not it tuck in 
 
 there was an appreciative laugh and an outbreak of applause as dumbledore sat down neatly and threw his long beard over his shoulder so as to keep it out of the way of his platefor food had appeared out of nowhere so that the five long tables were groaning under joints and pies and dishes of vegetables bread and sauces and flagons of pumpkin juice 
 
 excellent said ron with a kind of groan of longing and he seized the nearest plate of chops and began piling them on to his plate watched wistfully by nearly headless nick 
 
 what were you saying before the sorting hermione asked the ghost about the hat giving warnings 
 
 oh yes said nick who seemed glad of a reason to turn away from ron who was now eating roast potatoes with almost indecent enthusiasm yes i have heard the hat give several warnings before always at times when it detects periods of great danger for the school and always of course its advice is the same stand together be strong from within 
 
 ow kunnit nofe skusin danger ifzat said ron 
 
 his mouth was so full harry thought it was quite an achievement for him to make any noise at all 
 
 i beg your pardon said nearly headless nick politely while hermione looked revolted ron gave an enormous swallow and said how can it know if the in danger if a hat 
 
 i have no idea said nearly headless nick of course it lives in office so i daresay it picks things up there 
 
 and it wants all the houses to be friends said harry looking over at the slytherin table where draco malfoy was holding court fat chance 
 
 well now you take that attitude said nick reprovingly peaceful the key we ghosts though we belong to separate houses maintain links of friendship in spite of the competitiveness between gryffindor and slytherin i would never dream of seeking an argument with the bloody baron 
 
 only because terrified of him said ron 
 
 nearly headless nick looked highly affronted 
 
 terrified i hope i sir nicholas de have never been guilty of cowardice in my life the noble blood that runs in my veins 
 
 what blood asked ron surely you still got 
 
 a figure of speech said nearly headless nick now so annoyed his head was trembling ominously on his partially severed neck i assume i am still allowed to enjoy the use of whichever words i like even if the pleasures of eating and drinking are denied me but i am quite used to students poking fun at my death i assure you 
 
 nick he really laughing at you said hermione throwing a furious look at ron 
 
 unfortunately mouth was packed to exploding point again and all he could manage was node iddum eentup sechew which nick did not seem to think constituted an adequate apology rising into the air he straightened his feathered hat and swept away from them to the other end of the table coming to rest between the creevey brothers colin and dennis 
 
 well done ron snapped hermione 
 
 what said ron indignantly having managed finally to swallow his food not allowed to ask a simple question 
 
 oh forget it said hermione irritably and the pair of them spent the rest of the meal in huffy silence 
 
 harry was too used to their bickering to bother trying to reconcile them he felt it was a better use of his time to eat his way steadily through his steak and kidney pie then a large plateful of his favourite treacle tart 
 
 when all the students had finished eating and the noise level in the hall was starting to creep upwards again dumbledore got to his feet once more talking ceased immediately as all turned to face the headmaster harry was feeling pleasantly drowsy now his bed was waiting somewhere above wonderfully warm and soft 
 
 well now that we are all digesting another magnificent feast i beg a few moments of your attention for the usual notices said dumbledore ought to know that the forest in the grounds is to studentsand a few of our older students ought to know by now too harry ron and hermione exchanged smirks 
 
 mr filch the caretaker has asked me for what he tells me is the time to remind you all that magic is not permitted in corridors between classes nor are a number of other things all of which can be checked on the extensive list now fastened to mr office door 
 
 we have had two changes in staffing this year we are very pleased to welcome back professor who will be taking care of magical creatures lessons we are also delighted to introduce professor umbridge our new defence against the dark arts teacher 
 
 there was a round of polite but fairly unenthusiastic applause during which harry ron and hermione exchanged slightly panicked looks dumbledore had not said for how long would be teaching 
 
 dumbledore continued tryouts for the house quidditch teams will take place on the 
 
 he broke off looking enquiringly at professor umbridge as she was not much taller standing than sitting there was a moment when nobody understood why dumbledore had stopped talking but then professor umbridge cleared her throat hem hem and it became clear that she had got to her feet and was intending to make a speech 
 
 dumbledore only looked taken aback for a moment then he sat down smartly and looked alertly at professor umbridge as though he desired nothing better than to listen to her talk other members of staff were not as adept at hiding their surprise professor eyebrows had disappeared into her flyaway hair and professor mouth was as thin as harry had ever seen it no new teacher had ever interrupted dumbledore before many of the students were smirking this woman obviously did not know how things were done at hogwarts 
 
 thank you headmaster professor umbridge simpered for those kind words of welcome 
 
 her voice was breathy and and again harry felt a powerful rush of dislike that he could not explain to himself all he knew was that he loathed everything about her from her stupid voice to her fluffy pink cardigan she gave another little cough hem hem and continued 
 
 well it is lovely to be back at hogwarts i must say she smiled revealing very pointed teeth and to see such happy little faces looking up at me 
 
 harry glanced around none of the faces he could see looked happy on the contrary they all looked rather at being addressed as though they were five years old 
 
 i am very much looking forward to getting to know you all and sure be very good friends 
 
 students exchanged looks at this some of them were barely concealing grins 
 
 be her friend as long as i have to borrow that cardigan parvati whispered to lavender and both of them lapsed into silent giggles 
 
 professor umbridge cleared her throat again hem hem but when she continued some of the breathiness had vanished from her voice she sounded much more businesslike and now her words had a dull sound to them 
 
 the ministry of magic has always considered the education of young witches and wizards to be of vital importance the rare gifts with which you were born may come to nothing if not nurtured and honed by careful instruction the ancient skills unique to the wizarding community must be passed down the generations lest we lose them for ever the treasure trove of magical knowledge amassed by our ancestors must be guarded replenished and polished by those who have been called to the noble profession of teaching 
 
 professor umbridge paused here and made a little bow to her fellow staff members none of whom bowed back to her professor dark eyebrows had contracted so that she looked positively hawklike and harry distinctly saw her exchange a significant glance with professor sprout as umbridge gave another little hem hem and went on with her speech 
 
 every headmaster and headmistress of hogwarts has brought something new to the weighty task of governing this historic school and that is as it should be for without progress there will be stagnation and decay there again progress for sake must be discouraged for our tried and tested traditions often require no tinkering a balance then between old and new between permanence and change between tradition and innovation 
 
 harry found his attentiveness ebbing as though his brain was slipping in and out of tune the quiet that always filled the hall when dumbledore was speaking was breaking up as students put their heads together whispering and giggling over on the ravenclaw table cho chang was chatting animatedly with her friends a few seats along from cho luna lovegood had got out the quibbler again meanwhile at the hufflepuff table ernie macmillan was one of the few still staring at professor umbridge but he was and harry was sure he was only pretending to listen in an attempt to live up to the new badge gleaming on his chest 
 
 professor umbridge did not seem to notice the restlessness of her audience harry had the impression that a riot could have broken out under her nose and she would have ploughed on with her speech the teachers however were still listening very attentively and hermione seemed to be drinking in every word umbridge spoke though judging by her expression they were not at all to her taste 
 
 because some changes will be for the better while others will come in the fullness of time to be recognised as errors of judgement meanwhile some old habits will be retained and rightly so whereas others outmoded and outworn must be abandoned let us move forward then into a new era of openness effectiveness and accountability intent on preserving what ought to be preserved perfecting what needs to be perfected and pruning wherever we find practices that ought to be prohibited 
 
 she sat down dumbledore clapped the staff followed his lead though harry noticed that several of them brought their hands together only once or twice before stopping a few students joined in but most had been taken unawares by the end of the speech not having listened to more than a few words of it and before they could start applauding properly dumbledore had stood up again 
 
 thank you very much professor umbridge that was most illuminating he said bowing to her now as i was saying quidditch tryouts will be held 
 
 yes it certainly was illuminating said hermione in a low voice 
 
 not telling me you enjoyed it ron said quietly turning a glazed face towards hermione that was about the dullest speech ever heard and i grew up with percy 
 
 i said illuminating not enjoyable said hermione it explained a lot 
 
 did it said harry in surprise sounded like a load of waffle to me 
 
 there was some important stuff hidden in the waffle said hermione grimly 
 
 was there said ron blankly 
 
 how about progress for sake must be discouraged how about pruning wherever we find practices that ought to be prohibited 
 
 well what does that mean said ron impatiently 
 
 tell you what it means said hermione through gritted teeth it means the interfering at hogwarts 
 
 there was a great clattering and banging all around them dumbledore had obviously just dismissed the school because everyone was standing up ready to leave the hall hermione jumped up looking flustered 
 
 ron supposed to show the where to go 
 
 oh yeah said ron who had obviously forgotten heyhey you lot midgets 
 
 ron 
 
 well they are titchy 
 
 i know but you call them hermione called commandingly along the table this way please 
 
 a group of new students walked shyly up the gap between the gryffindor and hufflepuff tables all of them trying hard not to lead the group they did indeed seem very small harry was sure he had not appeared that young when he had arrived here he grinned at them a blond boy next to euan abercrombie looked petrified he nudged euan and whispered something in his ear euan abercrombie looked equally frightened and stole a horrified look at harry who felt the grin slide off his face like stinksap 
 
 see you later he said dully to ron and hermione and he made his way out of the great hall alone doing everything he could to ignore more whispering staring and pointing as he passed he kept his eyes fixed ahead as he wove his way through the crowd in the entrance hall then he hurried up the marble staircase took a couple of concealed short cuts and had soon left most of the crowds behind 
 
 he had been stupid not to expect this he thought angrily as he walked through the much emptier upstairs corridors of course everyone was staring at him he had emerged from the triwizard maze two months previously clutching the dead body of a fellow student and claiming to have seen lord voldemort return to power there had not been time last term to explain himself before all had to go homeeven if he had felt up to giving the whole school a detailed account of the terrible events in that graveyard 
 
 harry had reached the end of the corridor to the gryffindor common room and come to a halt in front of the portrait of the fat lady before he realised that he did not know the new password 
 
 er he said glumly staring up at the fat lady who smoothed the folds of her pink satin dress and looked sternly back at him 
 
 no password no entrance she said loftily 
 
 harry i know it someone panted up behind him and he turned to see neville jogging towards him guess what it is actually going to be able to remember it for once he waved the stunted little cactus he had shown them on the train mimbuius mimbletonia 
 
 correct said the fat lady and her portrait swung open towards them like a door revealing a circular hole in the wall behind through which harry and neville now climbed 
 
 the gryffindor common room looked as welcoming as ever a cosy circular tower room full of dilapidated squashy armchairs and rickety old tables a fire was crackling merrily in the grate and a few people were warming their hands by it before going up to their dormitories on the other side of the room fred and george weasley were pinning something up on the noticeboard harry waved goodnight to them and headed straight for the door to the boys dormitories he was not in much of a mood for talking at the moment neville followed him 
 
 dean thomas and seamus finnigan had reached the dormitory first and were in the process of covering the walls beside their beds with posters and photographs they had been talking as harry pushed open the door but stopped abruptly the moment they saw him harry wondered whether they had been talking about him then whether he was being paranoid 
 
 hi he said moving across to his own trunk and opening it 
 
 hey harry said dean who was putting on a pair of pyjamas in the west ham colours good holiday 
 
 not bad muttered harry as a true account of his holiday would have taken most of the night to relate and he could not face it you 
 
 yeah it was ok chuckled dean better than anyway he was just telling me 
 
 why what happened seamus neville asked as he placed his mimbuius mimbletonia tenderly on his bedside cabinet 
 
 seamus did not answer immediately he was making rather a meal of ensuring that his poster of the kenmare kestrels quidditch team was quite straight then he said with his back still turned to harry me mam want me to come back 
 
 what said harry pausing in the act of pulling off his robes 
 
 she want me to come back to hogwarts 
 
 seamus turned away from his poster and pulled his own pyjamas out of his trunk still not looking at harry 
 
 butwhy said harry astonished he knew that mother was a witch and could not understand therefore why she should have come over so dursleyish 
 
 seamus did not answer until he had finished buttoning his pyjamas 
 
 well he said in a measured voice i suppose because of you 
 
 what mean said harry quickly 
 
 his heart was beating rather fast he felt vaguely as though something was closing in on him 
 
 well said seamus again still avoiding eye she er well not just you dumbledore too 
 
 she believes the daily prophet said harry she thinks a liar and an old fool 
 
 seamus looked up at him 
 
 yeah something like that 
 
 harry said nothing he threw his wand down on to his bedside table pulled off his robes stuffed them angrily into his trunk and pulled on his pyjamas he was sick of it sick of being the person who is stared at and talked about all the time if any of them knew if any of them had the faintest idea what it felt like to be the one all these things had happened to mrs finnigan had no idea the stupid woman he thought savagely 
 
 he got into bed and made to pull the hangings closed around him but before he could do so seamus said look what did happen that night when you know when with cedric diggory and all 
 
 seamus sounded nervous and eager at the same time dean who had been bending over his trunk trying to retrieve a slipper went oddly still and harry knew he was listening hard 
 
 what are you asking me for harry retorted just read the daily prophet like your mother why you tell you all you need to know 
 
 you have a go at my mother seamus snapped 
 
 have a go at anyone who calls me a liar said harry 
 
 talk to me like that 
 
 talk to you how i want said harry his temper rising so fast he snatched his wand back from his bedside table if got a problem sharing a dormitory with me go and ask mcgonagall if you can be moved stop your mummy worrying 
 
 leave my mother out of this potter 
 
 going on 
 
 ron had appeared in the doorway his wide eyes travelled from harry who was kneeling on his bed with his wand pointing at seamus to seamus who was standing there with his fists raised 
 
 having a go at my mother seamus yelled 
 
 what said ron harry do thatwe met your mother we liked her 
 
 before she started believing every word the stinking daily prophet writes about me said harry at the top of his voice 
 
 oh said ron comprehension dawning across his freckled face oh right 
 
 you know what said seamus heatedly casting harry a venomous look right i want to share a dormitory with him any more mad 
 
 out of order seamus said ron whose ears were starting to glow redalways a danger sign 
 
 out of order am i shouted seamus who in contrast with ron was going pale you believe all the rubbish come out with about do you you reckon telling the truth 
 
 yeah i do said ron angrily 
 
 then mad too said seamus in disgust 
 
 yeah well unfortunately for you pal also a prefect said ron jabbing himself in the chest with a finger so unless you want detention watch your mouth 
 
 seamus looked for a few seconds as though detention would be a reasonable price to pay to say what was going through his mind but with a noise of contempt he turned on his heel vaulted into bed and pulled the hangings shut with such violence that they were ripped from the bed and fell in a dusty pile to the floor ron glared at seamus then looked at dean and neville 
 
 anyone parents got a problem with harry he said aggressively 
 
 my parents are muggles mate said dean shrugging they know nothing about no deaths at hogwarts because not stupid enough to tell them 
 
 you know my mother weasel anything out of anyone seamus snapped at him anyway your parents get the daily know our been sacked from the wizengamot and the international confederation of wizards because losing his marbles 
 
 my gran says rubbish piped up neville she says the daily prophet going downhill not dumbledore cancelled our subscription we believe harry said neville simply he climbed into bed and pulled the covers up to his chin looking owlishly over them at seamus my grans always said would come back one day she says if dumbledore says back back 
 
 harry felt a rush of gratitude towards neville nobody else said anything seamus got out his wand repaired the bed hangings and vanished behind them dean got into bed rolled over and fell silent neville who appeared to have nothing more to say either was gazing fondly at his moonlit cactus 
 
 harry lay back on his pillows while ron bustled around the next bed putting his things away he fell shaken by the argument with seamus whom he had always liked very much how many more people were going to suggest that he was lying or unhinged 
 
 had dumbledore suffered like this all summer as first the wizengamot then the international confederation of wizards had thrown him from their ranks was it anger at harry perhaps that had stopped dumbledore getting in touch with him for months the two of them were in this together after all dumbledore had believed harry announced his version of events to the whole school and then to the wider wizarding community anyone who thought harry was a liar had to think that dumbledore was too or else that dumbledore had been hoodwinked 
 
 know right in the end thought harry miserably as ron got into bed and extinguished the last candle in the dormitory but he wondered how many more attacks like he would have to endure before that time came

 harry did not want to tell the others that he and luna were having the same hallucination if that was what it was so he said nothing more about the horses as he sat down inside the carriage and slammed the door behind him nevertheless he could not help watching the silhouettes of the horses moving beyond the window 
 
 did everyone see that woman asked ginny she doing back here hagrid have left can he 
 
 be quite glad if he has said luna he a very good teacher is he 
 
 yes he is said harry ron and ginny angrily 
 
 harry glared at hermione she cleared her throat and quickly said erm yes very good 
 
 well we in ravenclaw think a bit of a joke said luna unfazed 
 
 got a rubbish sense of humour then ron snapped as the wheels below them creaked into motion 
 
 luna did not seem perturbed by rudeness on the contrary she simply watched him for a while as though he were a mildly interesting television programme 
 
 rattling and swaying the carriages moved in convoy up the road when they passed between the tall stone pillars topped with winged boars on either side of the gates to the school grounds harry leaned forwards to try and see whether there were any lights on in cabin by the forbidden forest but the grounds were in complete darkness hogwarts castle however loomed ever closer a towering mass of turrets jet black against the dark sky here and there a window blazing fiery bright above them 
 
 the carriages jingled to a halt near the stone steps leading up to the oak front doors and harry got out of the carriage first he turned again to look for lit windows down by the forest but there was definitely no sign of life within cabin unwillingly because he had they would have vanished he turned his eyes instead upon the strange skeletal creatures standing quietly in the chill night air their blank white eyes gleaming 
 
 harry had once before had the experience of seeing something that ron could not but that had been a reflection in a mirror something much more insubstantial than a hundred very beasts strong enough to pull a fleet of carriages if luna was to be believed the beasts had always been there but invisible why then could harry suddenly see them and why could ron not 
 
 are you coming or what said ron beside him 
 
 oh yeah said harry quickly and they joined the crowd hurrying up the stone steps into the castle 
 
 the entrance hall was ablaze with torches and echoing with footsteps as the students crossed the flagged stone floor for the double doors to the right leading to the great hall and the feast 
 
 the four long house tables in the great hall were filling up under the starless black ceiling which was just like the sky they could glimpse through the high windows candles floated in midair all along the tables illuminating the silvery ghosts who were dotted about the hall and the faces of the students talking eagerly exchanging summer news shouting greetings at friends from other houses eyeing one new haircuts and robes again harry noticed people putting their heads together to whisper as he passed he gritted his teeth and tried to act as though he neither noticed nor cared 
 
 luna drifted away from them at the ravenclaw table the moment they reached ginny was hailed by some fellow and left to sit with them harry ron hermione and neville found seats together about halfway down the table between nearly headless nick the gryffindor house ghost and parvati patil and lavender brown the last two of whom gave harry airy greetings that made him quite sure they had stopped talking about him a split second before he had more important things to worry about however he was looking over the students heads to the staff table that ran along the top wall of the hall 
 
 not there 
 
 ron and hermione scanned the staff table too though there was no real need size made him instantly obvious in any lineup 
 
 he have left said ron sounding slightly anxious 
 
 of course he said harry firmly 
 
 you think hurt or anything do you said hermione uneasily 
 
 no said harry at once 
 
 but where is he then 
 
 there was a pause then harry said very quietly so that neville parvati and lavender could not hear maybe not back yet you knowfrom his missionthe thing he was doing over the summer for dumbledore 
 
 yeah yeah be it said ron sounding reassured but hermione bit her lip looking up and down the staff table as though hoping for some conclusive explanation of absence 
 
 that she said sharply pointing towards the middle of the staff table 
 
 eyes followed hers they lit first upon professor dumbledore sitting in his golden chair at the centre of the long staff table wearing robes scattered with silvery stars and a matching hat head was inclined towards the woman sitting next to him who was talking into his ear she looked harry thought like maiden aunt squat with short curly hair in which she had placed a horrible pink alice band that matched the fluffy pink cardigan she wore over her robes then she turned her face slightly to take a sip from her goblet and he saw with a shock of recognition a pallid toadlike face and a pair of prominent pouchy eyes 
 
 that umbridge woman 
 
 who said hermione 
 
 she was at my hearing she works for fudge 
 
 nice cardigan said ron smirking 
 
 she works for fudge hermione repeated frowning what on she doing here then 
 
 dunno 
 
 hermione scanned the staff table her eyes narrowed 
 
 no she muttered no surely not 
 
 harry did not understand what she was talking about but did not ask his attention had been caught by professor who had just appeared behind the staff table she worked her way along to the very end and took the seat that ought to have been that meant the must have crossed the lake and reached the castle and sure enough a few seconds later the doors from the entrance hall opened a long line of entered led by professor mcgonagall who was carrying a stool on which sat an ancient wizards hat heavily patched and darned with a wide rip near the frayed brim 
 
 the buzz of talk in the great hall faded away the lined up in front of the staff table facing the rest of the students and professor mcgonagall placed the stool carefully in front of them then stood back 
 
 the faces glowed palely in the candlelight a small boy right in the middle of the row looked as though he was trembling harry recalled fleetingly how terrified he had felt when he had stood there waiting for the unknown test that would determine to which house he belonged 
 
 the whole school waited with bated breath then the rip near the brim opened wide like a mouth and the sorting hat burst into song 
 
 in times of old when i was new 
 
 and hogwarts barely started 
 
 the founders of our noble school 
 
 thought never to be parted 
 
 united by a common goal 
 
 they had the selfsame yearning 
 
 to make the best magic school 
 
 and pass along their learning 
 
 together we will build and teach 
 
 the four good friends decided 
 
 and never did they dream that they 
 
 might some day be divided 
 
 for were there such friends anywhere 
 
 as slytherin and gryffindor 
 
 unless it was the second pair 
 
 of hufflepuff and ravenclaw 
 
 so how could it have gone so wrong 
 
 how could such friendships fail 
 
 why i was there and so can tell 
 
 the whole sad sorry tale 
 
 said slytherin teach just those 
 
 whose ancestry is purest 
 
 said ravenclaw teach those whose 
 
 intelligence is surest 
 
 said gryffindor teach all those 
 
 with brave deeds to their name 
 
 said hufflepuff teach the lot 
 
 and treat them just the same 
 
 these differences caused little strife 
 
 when first they came to light 
 
 for each of the four founders had 
 
 a house in which they might 
 
 take only those they wanted so 
 
 for instance slytherin 
 
 took only wizards 
 
 of great cunning just like him 
 
 and only those of sharpest mind 
 
 were taught by ravenclaw 
 
 while the bravest and the boldest 
 
 went to daring gryffindor 
 
 good hufflepuff she took the rest 
 
 and taught them all she knew 
 
 thus the houses and their founders 
 
 retained friendships firm and true 
 
 so hogwarts worked in harmony 
 
 for several happy years 
 
 but then discord crept among us 
 
 feeding on our faults and fears 
 
 the houses that like pillars four 
 
 had once held up our school 
 
 now turned upon each other and 
 
 divided sought to rule 
 
 and for a while it seemed the school 
 
 must meet an early end 
 
 what with duelling and with fighting 
 
 and the clash of friend on friend 
 
 and at last there came c morning 
 
 when old slytherin departed 
 
 and though the fighting then died out 
 
 he left us quite downhearted 
 
 and never since the founders four 
 
 were whittled down to three 
 
 have the houses been united 
 
 as they once were meant to be 
 
 and now the sorting hat is here 
 
 and you all know the score 
 
 i sort you into houses 
 
 because that is what for 
 
 but this year go further 
 
 listen closely to my song 
 
 though condemned i am to split you 
 
 still i worry that wrong 
 
 though i must fulfil my duty 
 
 and must quarter every year 
 
 still i wonder whether sorting 
 
 may not bring the end i fear 
 
 oh know the perils read the signs 
 
 the warning history shows 
 
 for our hogwarts is in danger 
 
 from external deadly foes 
 
 and we must unite inside her 
 
 or crumble from within 
 
 i have told you i have warned you 
 
 let the sorting now begin 
 
 
 
 the hat became motionless once more applause broke out though it was punctured for the first time in memory with muttering and whispers all across the great hall students were exchanging remarks with their neighbours and harry clapping along with everyone else knew exactly what they were talking about 
 
 branched out a bit this year it said ron his eyebrows raised 
 
 too right it has said harry 
 
 the sorting hat usually confined itself to describing the different qualities looked for by each of the four hogwarts houses and its own role in sorting them harry could not remember it ever trying to give the school advice before 
 
 i wonder if ever given warnings before said hermione sounding slightly anxious 
 
 yes indeed said nearly headless nick knowledgeably leaning across neville towards her neville winced it was very uncomfortable to have a ghost lean through you the hat feels itself to give the school due warning whenever it feels 
 
 but professor mcgonagall who was waiting to read out the list of names was giving the whispering students the sort of look that scorches nearly headless nick placed a finger to his lips and sat primly upright again as the muttering came to an abrupt end with a last frowning look that swept the lour house tables professor mcgonagall lowered her eyes to her long piece of parchment and called out the first name 
 
 abercrombie euan 
 
 the boy harry had noticed earlier stumbled forwards and put the hat on his head it was only prevented from falling right down to his shoulders by his very prominent ears the hat considered for a moment then the rip near the brim opened again and shouted 
 
 gryffindor 
 
 harry clapped loudly with the rest of gryffindor house as euan abercrombie staggered to their table and sat down looking as though he would like very much to sink through the floor and never be looked at again 
 
 slowly the long line of thinned in the pauses between the names and the sorting decisions harry could hear stomach rumbling loudly finally zeller rose was sorted into hufflepuff and professor mcgonagall picked up the hat and stool and marched them away as professor dumbledore rose to his feet 
 
 whatever his recent bitter feelings had been towards his headmaster harry was somehow soothed to see dumbledore standing before them all between the absence of hagrid and the presence of those dragonish horses he had felt that his return to hogwarts so long anticipated was full of unexpected surprises like jarring notes in a familiar song but this at least was how it was supposed to be their headmaster rising to greet them all before the feast 
 
 to our newcomers said dumbledore in a ringing voice his arms stretched wide and a beaming smile on his lips welcome to our old handswelcome back there is a time for but this is not it tuck in 
 
 there was an appreciative laugh and an outbreak of applause as dumbledore sat down neatly and threw his long beard over his shoulder so as to keep it out of the way of his platefor food had appeared out of nowhere so that the five long tables were groaning under joints and pies and dishes of vegetables bread and sauces and flagons of pumpkin juice 
 
 excellent said ron with a kind of groan of longing and he seized the nearest plate of chops and began piling them on to his plate watched wistfully by nearly headless nick 
 
 what were you saying before the sorting hermione asked the ghost about the hat giving warnings 
 
 oh yes said nick who seemed glad of a reason to turn away from ron who was now eating roast potatoes with almost indecent enthusiasm yes i have heard the hat give several warnings before always at times when it detects periods of great danger for the school and always of course its advice is the same stand together be strong from within 
 
 ow kunnit nofe skusin danger ifzat said ron 
 
 his mouth was so full harry thought it was quite an achievement for him to make any noise at all 
 
 i beg your pardon said nearly headless nick politely while hermione looked revolted ron gave an enormous swallow and said how can it know if the in danger if a hat 
 
 i have no idea said nearly headless nick of course it lives in office so i daresay it picks things up there 
 
 and it wants all the houses to be friends said harry looking over at the slytherin table where draco malfoy was holding court fat chance 
 
 well now you take that attitude said nick reprovingly peaceful the key we ghosts though we belong to separate houses maintain links of friendship in spite of the competitiveness between gryffindor and slytherin i would never dream of seeking an argument with the bloody baron 
 
 only because terrified of him said ron 
 
 nearly headless nick looked highly affronted 
 
 terrified i hope i sir nicholas de have never been guilty of cowardice in my life the noble blood that runs in my veins 
 
 what blood asked ron surely you still got 
 
 a figure of speech said nearly headless nick now so annoyed his head was trembling ominously on his partially severed neck i assume i am still allowed to enjoy the use of whichever words i like even if the pleasures of eating and drinking are denied me but i am quite used to students poking fun at my death i assure you 
 
 nick he really laughing at you said hermione throwing a furious look at ron 
 
 unfortunately mouth was packed to exploding point again and all he could manage was node iddum eentup sechew which nick did not seem to think constituted an adequate apology rising into the air he straightened his feathered hat and swept away from them to the other end of the table coming to rest between the creevey brothers colin and dennis 
 
 well done ron snapped hermione 
 
 what said ron indignantly having managed finally to swallow his food not allowed to ask a simple question 
 
 oh forget it said hermione irritably and the pair of them spent the rest of the meal in huffy silence 
 
 harry was too used to their bickering to bother trying to reconcile them he felt it was a better use of his time to eat his way steadily through his steak and kidney pie then a large plateful of his favourite treacle tart 
 
 when all the students had finished eating and the noise level in the hall was starting to creep upwards again dumbledore got to his feet once more talking ceased immediately as all turned to face the headmaster harry was feeling pleasantly drowsy now his bed was waiting somewhere above wonderfully warm and soft 
 
 well now that we are all digesting another magnificent feast i beg a few moments of your attention for the usual notices said dumbledore ought to know that the forest in the grounds is to studentsand a few of our older students ought to know by now too harry ron and hermione exchanged smirks 
 
 mr filch the caretaker has asked me for what he tells me is the time to remind you all that magic is not permitted in corridors between classes nor are a number of other things all of which can be checked on the extensive list now fastened to mr office door 
 
 we have had two changes in staffing this year we are very pleased to welcome back professor who will be taking care of magical creatures lessons we are also delighted to introduce professor umbridge our new defence against the dark arts teacher 
 
 there was a round of polite but fairly unenthusiastic applause during which harry ron and hermione exchanged slightly panicked looks dumbledore had not said for how long would be teaching 
 
 dumbledore continued tryouts for the house quidditch teams will take place on the 
 
 he broke off looking enquiringly at professor umbridge as she was not much taller standing than sitting there was a moment when nobody understood why dumbledore had stopped talking but then professor umbridge cleared her throat hem hem and it became clear that she had got to her feet and was intending to make a speech 
 
 dumbledore only looked taken aback for a moment then he sat down smartly and looked alertly at professor umbridge as though he desired nothing better than to listen to her talk other members of staff were not as adept at hiding their surprise professor eyebrows had disappeared into her flyaway hair and professor mouth was as thin as harry had ever seen it no new teacher had ever interrupted dumbledore before many of the students were smirking this woman obviously did not know how things were done at hogwarts 
 
 thank you headmaster professor umbridge simpered for those kind words of welcome 
 
 her voice was breathy and and again harry felt a powerful rush of dislike that he could not explain to himself all he knew was that he loathed everything about her from her stupid voice to her fluffy pink cardigan she gave another little cough hem hem and continued 
 
 well it is lovely to be back at hogwarts i must say she smiled revealing very pointed teeth and to see such happy little faces looking up at me 
 
 harry glanced around none of the faces he could see looked happy on the contrary they all looked rather at being addressed as though they were five years old 
 
 i am very much looking forward to getting to know you all and sure be very good friends 
 
 students exchanged looks at this some of them were barely concealing grins 
 
 be her friend as long as i have to borrow that cardigan parvati whispered to lavender and both of them lapsed into silent giggles 
 
 professor umbridge cleared her throat again hem hem but when she continued some of the breathiness had vanished from her voice she sounded much more businesslike and now her words had a dull sound to them 
 
 the ministry of magic has always considered the education of young witches and wizards to be of vital importance the rare gifts with which you were born may come to nothing if not nurtured and honed by careful instruction the ancient skills unique to the wizarding community must be passed down the generations lest we lose them for ever the treasure trove of magical knowledge amassed by our ancestors must be guarded replenished and polished by those who have been called to the noble profession of teaching 
 
 professor umbridge paused here and made a little bow to her fellow staff members none of whom bowed back to her professor dark eyebrows had contracted so that she looked positively hawklike and harry distinctly saw her exchange a significant glance with professor sprout as umbridge gave another little hem hem and went on with her speech 
 
 every headmaster and headmistress of hogwarts has brought something new to the weighty task of governing this historic school and that is as it should be for without progress there will be stagnation and decay there again progress for sake must be discouraged for our tried and tested traditions often require no tinkering a balance then between old and new between permanence and change between tradition and innovation 
 
 harry found his attentiveness ebbing as though his brain was slipping in and out of tune the quiet that always filled the hall when dumbledore was speaking was breaking up as students put their heads together whispering and giggling over on the ravenclaw table cho chang was chatting animatedly with her friends a few seats along from cho luna lovegood had got out the quibbler again meanwhile at the hufflepuff table ernie macmillan was one of the few still staring at professor umbridge but he was and harry was sure he was only pretending to listen in an attempt to live up to the new badge gleaming on his chest 
 
 professor umbridge did not seem to notice the restlessness of her audience harry had the impression that a riot could have broken out under her nose and she would have ploughed on with her speech the teachers however were still listening very attentively and hermione seemed to be drinking in every word umbridge spoke though judging by her expression they were not at all to her taste 
 
 because some changes will be for the better while others will come in the fullness of time to be recognised as errors of judgement meanwhile some old habits will be retained and rightly so whereas others outmoded and outworn must be abandoned let us move forward then into a new era of openness effectiveness and accountability intent on preserving what ought to be preserved perfecting what needs to be perfected and pruning wherever we find practices that ought to be prohibited 
 
 she sat down dumbledore clapped the staff followed his lead though harry noticed that several of them brought their hands together only once or twice before stopping a few students joined in but most had been taken unawares by the end of the speech not having listened to more than a few words of it and before they could start applauding properly dumbledore had stood up again 
 
 thank you very much professor umbridge that was most illuminating he said bowing to her now as i was saying quidditch tryouts will be held 
 
 yes it certainly was illuminating said hermione in a low voice 
 
 not telling me you enjoyed it ron said quietly turning a glazed face towards hermione that was about the dullest speech ever heard and i grew up with percy 
 
 i said illuminating not enjoyable said hermione it explained a lot 
 
 did it said harry in surprise sounded like a load of waffle to me 
 
 there was some important stuff hidden in the waffle said hermione grimly 
 
 was there said ron blankly 
 
 how about progress for sake must be discouraged how about pruning wherever we find practices that ought to be prohibited 
 
 well what does that mean said ron impatiently 
 
 tell you what it means said hermione through gritted teeth it means the interfering at hogwarts 
 
 there was a great clattering and banging all around them dumbledore had obviously just dismissed the school because everyone was standing up ready to leave the hall hermione jumped up looking flustered 
 
 ron supposed to show the where to go 
 
 oh yeah said ron who had obviously forgotten heyhey you lot midgets 
 
 ron 
 
 well they are titchy 
 
 i know but you call them hermione called commandingly along the table this way please 
 
 a group of new students walked shyly up the gap between the gryffindor and hufflepuff tables all of them trying hard not to lead the group they did indeed seem very small harry was sure he had not appeared that young when he had arrived here he grinned at them a blond boy next to euan abercrombie looked petrified he nudged euan and whispered something in his ear euan abercrombie looked equally frightened and stole a horrified look at harry who felt the grin slide off his face like stinksap 
 
 see you later he said dully to ron and hermione and he made his way out of the great hall alone doing everything he could to ignore more whispering staring and pointing as he passed he kept his eyes fixed ahead as he wove his way through the crowd in the entrance hall then he hurried up the marble staircase took a couple of concealed short cuts and had soon left most of the crowds behind 
 
 he had been stupid not to expect this he thought angrily as he walked through the much emptier upstairs corridors of course everyone was staring at him he had emerged from the triwizard maze two months previously clutching the dead body of a fellow student and claiming to have seen lord voldemort return to power there had not been time last term to explain himself before all had to go homeeven if he had felt up to giving the whole school a detailed account of the terrible events in that graveyard 
 
 harry had reached the end of the corridor to the gryffindor common room and come to a halt in front of the portrait of the fat lady before he realised that he did not know the new password 
 
 er he said glumly staring up at the fat lady who smoothed the folds of her pink satin dress and looked sternly back at him 
 
 no password no entrance she said loftily 
 
 harry i know it someone panted up behind him and he turned to see neville jogging towards him guess what it is actually going to be able to remember it for once he waved the stunted little cactus he had shown them on the train mimbuius mimbletonia 
 
 correct said the fat lady and her portrait swung open towards them like a door revealing a circular hole in the wall behind through which harry and neville now climbed 
 
 the gryffindor common room looked as welcoming as ever a cosy circular tower room full of dilapidated squashy armchairs and rickety old tables a fire was crackling merrily in the grate and a few people were warming their hands by it before going up to their dormitories on the other side of the room fred and george weasley were pinning something up on the noticeboard harry waved goodnight to them and headed straight for the door to the boys dormitories he was not in much of a mood for talking at the moment neville followed him 
 
 dean thomas and seamus finnigan had reached the dormitory first and were in the process of covering the walls beside their beds with posters and photographs they had been talking as harry pushed open the door but stopped abruptly the moment they saw him harry wondered whether they had been talking about him then whether he was being paranoid 
 
 hi he said moving across to his own trunk and opening it 
 
 hey harry said dean who was putting on a pair of pyjamas in the west ham colours good holiday 
 
 not bad muttered harry as a true account of his holiday would have taken most of the night to relate and he could not face it you 
 
 yeah it was ok chuckled dean better than anyway he was just telling me 
 
 why what happened seamus neville asked as he placed his mimbuius mimbletonia tenderly on his bedside cabinet 
 
 seamus did not answer immediately he was making rather a meal of ensuring that his poster of the kenmare kestrels quidditch team was quite straight then he said with his back still turned to harry me mam want me to come back 
 
 what said harry pausing in the act of pulling off his robes 
 
 she want me to come back to hogwarts 
 
 seamus turned away from his poster and pulled his own pyjamas out of his trunk still not looking at harry 
 
 butwhy said harry astonished he knew that mother was a witch and could not understand therefore why she should have come over so dursleyish 
 
 seamus did not answer until he had finished buttoning his pyjamas 
 
 well he said in a measured voice i suppose because of you 
 
 what mean said harry quickly 
 
 his heart was beating rather fast he felt vaguely as though something was closing in on him 
 
 well said seamus again still avoiding eye she er well not just you dumbledore too 
 
 she believes the daily prophet said harry she thinks a liar and an old fool 
 
 seamus looked up at him 
 
 yeah something like that 
 
 harry said nothing he threw his wand down on to his bedside table pulled off his robes stuffed them angrily into his trunk and pulled on his pyjamas he was sick of it sick of being the person who is stared at and talked about all the time if any of them knew if any of them had the faintest idea what it felt like to be the one all these things had happened to mrs finnigan had no idea the stupid woman he thought savagely 
 
 he got into bed and made to pull the hangings closed around him but before he could do so seamus said look what did happen that night when you know when with cedric diggory and all 
 
 seamus sounded nervous and eager at the same time dean who had been bending over his trunk trying to retrieve a slipper went oddly still and harry knew he was listening hard 
 
 what are you asking me for harry retorted just read the daily prophet like your mother why you tell you all you need to know 
 
 you have a go at my mother seamus snapped 
 
 have a go at anyone who calls me a liar said harry 
 
 talk to me like that 
 
 talk to you how i want said harry his temper rising so fast he snatched his wand back from his bedside table if got a problem sharing a dormitory with me go and ask mcgonagall if you can be moved stop your mummy worrying 
 
 leave my mother out of this potter 
 
 going on 
 
 ron had appeared in the doorway his wide eyes travelled from harry who was kneeling on his bed with his wand pointing at seamus to seamus who was standing there with his fists raised 
 
 having a go at my mother seamus yelled 
 
 what said ron harry do thatwe met your mother we liked her 
 
 before she started believing every word the stinking daily prophet writes about me said harry at the top of his voice 
 
 oh said ron comprehension dawning across his freckled face oh right 
 
 you know what said seamus heatedly casting harry a venomous look right i want to share a dormitory with him any more mad 
 
 out of order seamus said ron whose ears were starting to glow redalways a danger sign 
 
 out of order am i shouted seamus who in contrast with ron was going pale you believe all the rubbish come out with about do you you reckon telling the truth 
 
 yeah i do said ron angrily 
 
 then mad too said seamus in disgust 
 
 yeah well unfortunately for you pal also a prefect said ron jabbing himself in the chest with a finger so unless you want detention watch your mouth 
 
 seamus looked for a few seconds as though detention would be a reasonable price to pay to say what was going through his mind but with a noise of contempt he turned on his heel vaulted into bed and pulled the hangings shut with such violence that they were ripped from the bed and fell in a dusty pile to the floor ron glared at seamus then looked at dean and neville 
 
 anyone parents got a problem with harry he said aggressively 
 
 my parents are muggles mate said dean shrugging they know nothing about no deaths at hogwarts because not stupid enough to tell them 
 
 you know my mother weasel anything out of anyone seamus snapped at him anyway your parents get the daily know our been sacked from the wizengamot and the international confederation of wizards because losing his marbles 
 
 my gran says rubbish piped up neville she says the daily prophet going downhill not dumbledore cancelled our subscription we believe harry said neville simply he climbed into bed and pulled the covers up to his chin looking owlishly over them at seamus my grans always said would come back one day she says if dumbledore says back back 
 
 harry felt a rush of gratitude towards neville nobody else said anything seamus got out his wand repaired the bed hangings and vanished behind them dean got into bed rolled over and fell silent neville who appeared to have nothing more to say either was gazing fondly at his moonlit cactus 
 
 harry lay back on his pillows while ron bustled around the next bed putting his things away he fell shaken by the argument with seamus whom he had always liked very much how many more people were going to suggest that he was lying or unhinged 
 
 had dumbledore suffered like this all summer as first the wizengamot then the international confederation of wizards had thrown him from their ranks was it anger at harry perhaps that had stopped dumbledore getting in touch with him for months the two of them were in this together after all dumbledore had believed harry announced his version of events to the whole school and then to the wider wizarding community anyone who thought harry was a liar had to think that dumbledore was too or else that dumbledore had been hoodwinked 
 
 know right in the end thought harry miserably as ron got into bed and extinguished the last candle in the dormitory but he wondered how many more attacks like he would have to endure before that time came 
 
 rowling

lionfish nov chapter eleven helping handcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 as hermione had predicted the free periods were not the hours of blissful relaxation ron had anticipated but times in which to attempt to keep up with the vast amount of homework they were being set not only were they studying as though they had exams every day but the lessons themselves had become more demanding than ever before harry barely understood half of what professor mcgonagall said to them these days even hermione had had to ask her to repeat instructions once or twice incredibly and to increasing resentment best subject had suddenly become potions thanks to the prince 
 
 spells were now expected not only in defense against the dark arts but in charms and transfiguration too harry frequently looked over at his classmates in the common room or at mealtimes to see them purple in the face and straining as though they had overdosed on but he knew that they were really struggling to make spells work without saying incantations aloud it was a relief to get outside into the greenhouses they were dealing with more dangerous plants than ever in herbology but at least they were still allowed to swear loudly if the venomous tentacula seized them unexpectedly from behind 
 
 one result of their enormous workload and the frantic hours of practicing spells was that harry ron and hermione had so far been unable to find time to go and visit hagrid he had stopped coming to meals at the staff table an ominous sign and on the few occasions when they had passed him in the corridors or out in the grounds he had mysteriously failed to notice them or hear their greetings 
 
 got to go and explain said hermione looking up at huge empty chair at the staff table the following saturday at breakfast 
 
 got quidditch tryouts this morning said ron and supposed to be practicing that aguamenti charm from flitwick anyway explain what how are we going to tell him we hated his stupid subject 
 
 we hate it said hermione 
 
 speak for yourself i forgotten the skrewts said ron darkly and telling you now had a narrow escape you hear him going on about his gormless brother have been teaching grawp how to tie his shoelaces if stayed 
 
 i hate not talking to hagrid said hermione looking upset 
 
 go down after quidditch harry assured her he too was missing hagrid although like ron he thought that they were better off without grawp in their lives but trials might take all morning the number of people who have applied he felt slightly nervous at confronting the first hurdle of his captaincy i dunno why the this popular all of a sudden 
 
 oh come on harry said hermione suddenly impatient not quidditch popular you never been more interesting and frankly never been more fanciable 
 
 ron gagged on a large piece of kipper hermione spared him one look of disdain before turning back to harry 
 
 everyone knows been telling the truth now they the whole wizarding world has had to admit that you were right about voldemort being back and that you really have fought him twice in the last two years and escaped both times and now calling you the chosen come on you see why people are fascinated by you 
 
 harry was finding the great hall very hot all of a sudden even though the ceiling still looked cold and rainy 
 
 and been through all that persecution from the ministry when they were trying to make out you were unstable and a liar you can still see the marks on the back of your hand where that evil woman made you write with your own blood but you stuck to your story anyway 
 
 you can still see where those brains got hold of me in the ministry look said ron shaking back his sleeves 
 
 and it hurt that grown about a foot over the summer either hermione finished ignoring ron 
 
 tall said ron inconsequentially 
 
 the post owls arrived swooping down through windows scattering everyone with droplets of water most people were receiving more post than usual anxious parents were keen to hear from their children and to reassure them in turn that all was well at home harry had received no mail since the start of term his only regular correspondent was now dead and although he had hoped that lupin might write occasionally he had so far been disappointed he was very surprised therefore to see the snowy white hedwig circling amongst all the brown and gray owls she landed in front of him carrying a large square package a moment later an identical package landed in front of ron crushing beneath it his minuscule and exhausted owl pigwidgeon 
 
 ha said harry unwrapping the parcel to reveal a new copy of advanced fresh from flourish and blotts 
 
 oh good said hermione delighted now you can give that graffitied copy back 
 
 are you mad said harry keeping it look thought it out 
 
 he pulled the old copy of advanced out of his bag and tapped the cover with his wand muttering diffindo the cover fell off he did the same thing with the book hermione looked scandalized he then swapped the covers tapped each and said reparo 
 
 there sat the copy disguised as a new book and there sat the fresh copy from flourish and blotts looking thoroughly 
 
 give slughorn back the new one he complain it cost nine galleons 
 
 hermione pressed her lips together looking angry and disapproving but was distracted by a third owl landing in front of her carrying that copy of the daily prophet she unfolded it hastily and scanned the front page 
 
 anyone we know dead asked ron in a determinedly casual voice he posed the same question every time hermione opened her paper 
 
 no but there have been more dementor attacks said hermione and an arrest 
 
 excellent who said harry thinking of bellatrix lestrange 
 
 stan shunpike said hermione 
 
 what said harry startled 
 
 stanley shunpike conductor on the popular wizarding conveyance the knight bus has been arrested on suspicion of death eater activity mr shunpike was taken into custody late last night after a raid on his clapham home 
 
 stan shunpike a death eater said harry remembering the spotty youth he had first met three years before no way 
 
 he might have been put under the imperius curse said ron reasonably you never can tell 
 
 it look like it said hermione who was still reading it says here he was arrested after he was overheard talking about the death eaters secret plans in a pub she looked up with a troubled expression on her face if he was under the imperius curse hardly stand around gossiping about their plans would he 
 
 it sounds like he was trying to make out he knew more than he did said ron he the one who claimed he was going to become minister of magic when he was trying to chat up those veela 
 
 yeah him said harry i dunno what playing at taking stan seriously 
 
 they probably want to look as though doing something said hermione frowning people are terrifiedyou know the patil twins parents want them to go home and eloise midgen has already been withdrawn her father picked her up last night 
 
 what said ron goggling at hermione but hogwarts is safer than their homes bound to be got aurors and all those extra protective spells and got dumbledore 
 
 i think got him all the time said hermione very quietly glancing toward the staff table over the top of the prophet you noticed his been empty as often as this past week 
 
 harry and ron looked up at the staff table the chair was indeed empty now harry came to think of it he had not seen dumbledore since their private lesson a week ago 
 
 i think left the school to do something with the order said hermione in a low voice i mean all looking serious it 
 
 harry and ron did not answer but harry knew that they were all thinking the same thing there had been a horrible incident the day before when hannah abbott had been taken out of herbology to be told her mother had been found dead they had not seen hannah since 
 
 when they left the gryffindor table five minutes later to head down to the quidditch pitch they passed lavender brown and parvati patil remembering what hermione had said about the patil twins parents wanting them to leave hogwarts harry was unsurprised to see that the two best friends were whispering together looking distressed what did surprise him was that when ron drew level with them parvati suddenly nudged lavender who looked around and gave ron a wide smile ron blinked at her then returned the smile uncertainly his walk instantly became something more like a strut harry resisted the temptation to laugh remembering that ron had refrained from doing so after malfoy had broken nose hermione however looked cold and distant all the way down to the stadium through the cool misty drizzle and departed to find a place in the stands without wishing ron good luck 
 
 as harry had expected the trials took most of the morning half of gryffindor house seemed to have turned up from first years who were nervously clutching a selection of the dreadful old school brooms to seventh years who towered over the rest looking coolly intimidating the latter included a large boy harry recognized immediately from the hogwarts express 
 
 we met on the train in old compartment he said confidently stepping out of the crowd to shake hand cormac mclaggen keeper 
 
 you try out last year did you asked harry taking note of the breadth of mclaggen and thinking that he would probably block all three goal hoops without even moving 
 
 i was in the hospital wing when they held the trials said mclaggen with something of a swagger ate a pound of doxy eggs for a bet 
 
 right said harry well if you wait over there 
 
 he pointed over to the edge of the pitch close to where hermione was sitting he thought he saw a flicker of annoyance pass over face and wondered whether mclaggen expected preferential treatment because they were both old favorites 
 
 harry decided to start with a basic test asking all applicants for the team to divide into groups of ten and fly once around the pitch this was a good decision the first ten was made up of first years and it could not have been plainer that they had hardly ever flown before only one boy managed to remain airborne for more than a few seconds and he was so surprised he promptly crashed into one of the goal posts 
 
 the second group was comprised of ten of the silliest girls harry had ever encountered who when he blew his whistle merely fell about giggling and clutching one another romilda vane was amongst them when he told them to leave the pitch they did so quite cheerfully and went to sit in the stands to heckle everyone else 
 
 the third group had a halfway around the pitch most of the fourth group had come without broomsticks the fifth group were hufflepuffs 
 
 if anyone else here not from gryffindor roared harry who was starting to get seriously annoyed leave now please 
 
 there was a pause then a couple of little ravenclaws went sprinting off the pitch snorting with laughter 
 
 after two hours many complaints and several tantrums one involving a crashed comet two sixty and several broken teeth harry had found himself three chasers katie bell returned to the team after an excellent trial a new find called demelza robins who was particularly good at dodging bludgers and ginny weasley who had outflown all the competition and scored seventeen goals to boot pleased though he was with his choices harry had also shouted himself hoarse at the many complainers and was now enduring a similar battle with the rejected beaters 
 
 my final decision and if you get out of the way of the keepers hex you he bellowed 
 
 neither of his chosen beaters had the old brilliance of fred and george but he was still reasonably pleased with them jimmy peakes a short but boy who had managed to raise a lump the size of an egg on the back of head with a ferociously hit bludger and ritchie coote who looked weedy but aimed well they now joined katie demelza and ginny in the stands to watch the selection of their last team member 
 
 harry had deliberately left the trial of the keepers until last hoping for an emptier stadium and less pressure on all concerned unfortunately however all the rejected players and a number of people who had come down to watch after a lengthy breakfast had joined the crowd by now so that it was larger than ever as each keeper flew up to the goal hoops the crowd roared and jeered in equal measure harry glanced over at ron who had always had a problem with nerves harry had hoped that winning their final match last term might have cured it but apparently not ron was a delicate shade of green 
 
 none of the first five applicants saved more than two goals apiece to great disappointment cormac mclaggen saved four penalties out of five on the last one however he shot off in completely the wrong direction the crowd laughed and booed and mclaggen returned to the ground grinding his teeth 
 
 ron looked ready to pass out as he mounted his cleansweep eleven 
 
 good luck cried a voice from the stands harry looked around expecting to see hermione but it was lavender brown he would have quite liked to have hidden his face in his hands as she did a moment later but thought that as the captain he ought to show slightly more grit and so turned to watch ron do his trial 
 
 yet he need not have worried ron saved one two three four five penalties in a row delighted and resisting joining in the cheers of the crowd with difficulty harry turned to mclaggen to tell him that most unfortunately ron had beaten him only to find red face inches from his own he stepped back hastily 
 
 his sister really try said mclaggen menacingly there was a vein pulsing in his temple like the one harry had often admired in uncle she gave him an easy save 
 
 rubbish said harry coldly that was the one he nearly missed 
 
 mclaggen took a step nearer harry who stood his ground this time 
 
 give me another go 
 
 no said harry had your go you saved four ron saved five keeper he won it fair and square get out of my way 
 
 he thought for a moment that mclaggen might punch him but he contented himself with an ugly grimace and stormed away growling what sounded like threats to thin air 
 
 harry turned around to find his new team beaming at him 
 
 well done he croaked you flew really well 
 
 you did brilliantly ron 
 
 this time it really was hermione running toward them from the stands harry saw lavender walking off the pitch arm in arm with parvati a rather grumpy expression on her face ron looked extremely pleased with himself and even taller than usual as he grinned at the team and at hermione 
 
 after fixing the time of their first full practice for the following thursday harry ron and hermione bade goodbye to the rest of the team and headed off toward a watery sun was trying to break through the clouds now and it had stopped drizzling at last harry felt extremely hungry he hoped there would be something to eat at 
 
 i thought i was going to miss that fourth penalty ron was saying happily tricky shot from demelza did you see had a bit of spin on it 
 
 yes yes you were magnificent said hermione looking amused 
 
 i was better than that mclaggen anyway said ron in a highly satisfied voice did you see him lumbering off in the wrong direction on his fifth looked like been confunded 
 
 to surprise hermione turned a very deep shade of pink at these words ron noticed nothing he was too busy describing each of his other penalties in loving detail 
 
 the great gray hippogriff buckbeak was tethered in front of cabin he clicked his beak at their approach and turned his huge head toward them 
 
 oh dear said hermione nervously still a bit scary he 
 
 come off it ridden him you said ron harry stepped forward and bowed low to the hippogriff without breaking eye contact or blinking after a few seconds buckbeak sank into a bow too 
 
 how are you harry asked him in a low voice moving forward to stroke the feathery head missing him but okay here with hagrid you 
 
 oi said a loud voice 
 
 hagrid had come striding around the corner of his cabin wearing a large flowery apron and carrying a sack of potatoes his enormous boarhound fang was at his heels fang gave a booming bark and bounded forward 
 
 git away from him have yer fingersoh yeh lot 
 
 fang was jumping up at hermione and ron attempting to lick their ears hagrid stood and looked at them all for a split second then turned and strode into his cabin slamming the door behind him 
 
 oh dear said hermione looking stricken 
 
 worry about it said harry grimly he walked over to the door and knocked loudly 
 
 hagrid open up we want to talk to you 
 
 there was no sound from within 
 
 if you open the door blast it open harry said pulling out his wand 
 
 harry said hermione sounding shocked you possibly 
 
 yeah i can said harry stand back 
 
 but before he could say anything else the door flew open again as harry had known it would and there stood hagrid glowering down at him and looking despite the flowery apron positively alarming 
 
 a teacher he roared at harry a teacher potter how dare yeh threaten ter break down my door 
 
 sorry sir said harry emphasizing the last word as he stowed his wand inside his robes 
 
 hagrid looked stunned since when have yeh called me sir 
 
 since when have you called me potter 
 
 oh very clever growled hagrid very amusin me outsmarted innit all righ come in then yeh ungrateful little 
 
 mumbling darkly he stood back to let them pass hermione scurried in after harry looking rather frightened 
 
 well said hagrid grumpily as harry ron and hermione sat down around his enormous wooden table fang laying his head immediately upon knee and drooling all over his robes this feelin sorry for me reckon lonely or summat 
 
 no said harry at once we wanted to see you 
 
 missed you said hermione tremulously 
 
 missed me have yeh snorted hagrid yeah righ 
 
 he stomped around brewing up tea in his enormous copper kettle muttering all the while finally he slammed down three mugs of tea in front of them and a plate of his rock cakes harry was hungry enough even for cooking and took one at once 
 
 hagrid said hermione timidly when he joined them at the table and started peeling his potatoes with a brutality that suggested that each tuber had done him a great personal wrong we really wanted to carry on with care of magical creatures you know hagrid gave another great snort harry rather thought some bogeys landed on the potatoes and was inwardly thankful that they were not staying for dinner 
 
 we did said hermione but none of us could fit it into our schedules 
 
 yeah righ said hagrid again 
 
 there was a funny squelching sound and they all looked around hermione let out a tiny shriek and ron leapt out of his seat and hurried around the table away from the large barrel standing in the corner that they had only just noticed it was full of what looked like maggots slimy white and writhing 
 
 what are they hagrid asked harry trying to sound interested rather than revolted but putting down his rock cake all the same 
 
 jus giant grubs said hagrid 
 
 and they grow into said ron looking apprehensive 
 
 they won grow inter nuthin said hagrid i got em ter feed ter aragog 
 
 and without warning he burst into tears 
 
 hagrid cried hermione leaping up hurrying around the table the long way to avoid the barrel of maggots and putting an arm around his shaking shoulders what is it 
 
 him gulped hagrid his eyes streaming as he mopped his face with his apron aragog i think dyin he got ill over the summer an not gettin better i don know what do if he if he bin tergether so long 
 
 hermione patted shoulder looking at a complete loss for anything to say harry knew how she felt he had known hagrid to present a vicious baby dragon with a teddy bear seen him croon over giant scorpions with suckers and stingers attempt to reason with his brutal giant of a but this was perhaps the most incomprehensible of all his monster fancies the gigantic talking spider aragog who dwelled deep in the forbidden forest and which he and ron had only narrowly escaped four years previously 
 
 is thereis there anything we can do hermione asked ignoring frantic grimaces and 
 
 i don think there is hermione choked hagrid attempting to stem the flood of his tears see the rest o the tribe family gettin a bit funny now ill bit restive 
 
 yeah i think we saw a bit of that side of them said ron in an undertone 
 
 i don reckon be safe fer anyone but me ter go near the colony at the mo hagrid finished blowing his nose hard on his apron and looking up but thanks fer offerin hermione it means a lot 
 
 after that the atmosphere lightened considerably for although neither harry nor ron had shown any inclination to go and feed giant grubs to a murderous gargantuan spider hagrid seemed to take it for granted that they would have liked to have done and became his usual self once more 
 
 ar i always knew find it hard ter squeeze me inter yer timetables he said gruffly pouring them more tea even if yeh applied fer 
 
 we have done said hermione we smashed the entire stock of ministry when we were there last summer it was in the daily prophet 
 
 ar well then said hagrid no way yeh done it sorry binyeh jus bin worried about aragog an i did wonder whether if professor had bin teachin yeh 
 
 at which all three of them stated categorically and untruthfully that professor who had substituted for hagrid a few times was a dreadful teacher with the result that by the time hagrid waved them off the premises at dusk he looked quite cheerful 
 
 starving said harry once the door had closed behind them and they were hurrying through the dark and deserted grounds he had abandoned the rock cake after an ominous cracking noise from one of his back teeth and got that detention with snape tonight i got much time for dinner 
 
 as they came into the castle they spotted cormac mclaggen entering the great hall it took him two attempts to get through the doors he ricocheted off the frame on the first attempt ron merely guffawed gloatingly and strode off into the hall after him but harry caught arm and held her back 
 
 what said hermione defensively 
 
 if you ask me said harry quietly mclaggen looks like he was confunded this morning and he was standing right in front of where you were sitting 
 
 hermione blushed 
 
 oh all right then i did it she whispered but you should have heard the way he was talking about ron and ginny anyway got a nasty temper you saw how he reacted when he get inyou have wanted someone like that on the team 
 
 
 no said harry no i suppose true but that dishonest hermione i mean a prefect you 
 
 oh be quiet she snapped as he smirked 
 
 what are you two doing demanded ron reappearing in the doorway to the great hall and looking suspicious 
 
 nothing said harry and hermione together and they hurried after ron the smell of roast beef made stomach ache with hunger but they had barely taken three steps toward the gryffindor table when professor slughorn appeared in front of them blocking their path 
 
 harry harry just the man i was hoping to see he boomed genially twiddling the ends of his walrus mustache and puffing out his enormous belly i was hoping to catch you before dinner what do you say to a spot of supper tonight in my rooms instead having a little party just a few rising stars got mclaggen coming and zabini the charming melinda bobbini know whether you know her her family owns a large chain of apothecariesand of course i hope very much that miss granger will favor me by coming too 
 
 slughorn made hermione a little bow as he finished speaking it was as though ron was not present slughorn did not so much as look at him 
 
 i come professor said harry at once got a detention with professor snape 
 
 oh dear said slughorn his face falling comically dear dear i was counting on you harry well now just have to have a word with severus and explain the situation sure be able to persuade him to postpone your detention yes see you both later 
 
 he bustled away out of the hall 
 
 got no chance of persuading snape said harry the moment slughorn was out of earshot this already been postponed once snape did it for dumbledore but he do it for anyone else 
 
 oh i wish you could come i want to go on my own said hermione anxiously harry knew that she was thinking about mclaggen 
 
 i doubt be alone probably be invited snapped ron who did not seem to have taken kindly to being ignored by slughorn 
 
 after dinner they made their way back to gryffindor tower the common room was very crowded as most people had finished dinner by now but they managed to find a free table and sat down ron who had been in a bad mood ever since the encounter with slughorn folded his arms and frowned at the ceiling hermione reached out for a copy of the evening prophet which somebody had left abandoned on a chair 
 
 anything new said harry 
 
 not really hermione had opened the newspaper and was scanning the inside pages oh look your in here all right she added quickly for ron had looked around in alarm it just says been to visit the malfoys house this second search of the death eaters residence does not seem to have yielded any results arthur weasley of the office for the detection and confiscation of counterfeit defensive spells and protective objects said that his team had been acting upon a confidential 
 
 yeah mine said harry i told him at kings cross about malfoy and that thing he was trying to get borgin to fix well if not at their house he must have brought whatever it is to hogwarts with him 
 
 but how can he have done harry said hermione putting down the newspaper with a surprised look we were all searched when we arrived we 
 
 were you said harry taken aback i 
 
 oh no of course you i forgot you were late well filch ran over all of us with secrecy sensors when we got into the entrance hall any dark object would have been found i know for a fact crabbe had a shrunken head confiscated so you see malfoy have brought in anything dangerous 
 
 momentarily stymied harry watched ginny weasley playing with arnold the pygmy puff for a while before seeing a way around this objection 
 
 sent it to him by owl then he said his mother or someone 
 
 all the owls are being checked too said hermione filch told us so when he was jabbing those secrecy sensors everywhere he could reach 
 
 really stumped this time harry found nothing else to say there did not seem to be any way malfoy could have brought a dangerous or dark object into the school he looked hopefully at ron who was sitting with his arms folded staring over at lavender brown 
 
 can you think of any way malfoy 
 
 oh drop it harry said ron 
 
 listen not my fault slughorn invited hermione and me to his stupid party neither of us wanted to go you know said harry firing up 
 
 well as not invited to any parties said ron getting to his feet again i think go to bed 
 
 he stomped off toward the door to the boys dormitories leaving harry and hermione staring after him 
 
 harry said the new chaser demelza robins appearing suddenly at his shoulder got a message for you 
 
 from professor slughorn asked harry sitting up hopefully 
 
 no from professor snape said demelza heart sank he says to come to his office at half past eight tonight to do your detentionerno matter how many party invitations received and he wanted you to know be sorting out rotten flobberworms from good ones to use in potions andand he says no need to bring protective gloves 
 
 right said harry grimly thanks a lot demelza 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the half blood prince 
 

lionfish nov chapter eleven helping handcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 as hermione had predicted the free periods were not the hours of blissful relaxation ron had anticipated but times in which to attempt to keep up with the vast amount of homework they were being set not only were they studying as though they had exams every day but the lessons themselves had become more demanding than ever before harry barely understood half of what professor mcgonagall said to them these days even hermione had had to ask her to repeat instructions once or twice incredibly and to increasing resentment best subject had suddenly become potions thanks to the prince 
 
 spells were now expected not only in defense against the dark arts but in charms and transfiguration too harry frequently looked over at his classmates in the common room or at mealtimes to see them purple in the face and straining as though they had overdosed on but he knew that they were really struggling to make spells work without saying incantations aloud it was a relief to get outside into the greenhouses they were dealing with more dangerous plants than ever in herbology but at least they were still allowed to swear loudly if the venomous tentacula seized them unexpectedly from behind 
 
 one result of their enormous workload and the frantic hours of practicing spells was that harry ron and hermione had so far been unable to find time to go and visit hagrid he had stopped coming to meals at the staff table an ominous sign and on the few occasions when they had passed him in the corridors or out in the grounds he had mysteriously failed to notice them or hear their greetings 
 
 got to go and explain said hermione looking up at huge empty chair at the staff table the following saturday at breakfast 
 
 got quidditch tryouts this morning said ron and supposed to be practicing that aguamenti charm from flitwick anyway explain what how are we going to tell him we hated his stupid subject 
 
 we hate it said hermione 
 
 speak for yourself i forgotten the skrewts said ron darkly and telling you now had a narrow escape you hear him going on about his gormless brother have been teaching grawp how to tie his shoelaces if stayed 
 
 i hate not talking to hagrid said hermione looking upset 
 
 go down after quidditch harry assured her he too was missing hagrid although like ron he thought that they were better off without grawp in their lives but trials might take all morning the number of people who have applied he felt slightly nervous at confronting the first hurdle of his captaincy i dunno why the this popular all of a sudden 
 
 oh come on harry said hermione suddenly impatient not quidditch popular you never been more interesting and frankly never been more fanciable 
 
 ron gagged on a large piece of kipper hermione spared him one look of disdain before turning back to harry 
 
 everyone knows been telling the truth now they the whole wizarding world has had to admit that you were right about voldemort being back and that you really have fought him twice in the last two years and escaped both times and now calling you the chosen come on you see why people are fascinated by you 
 
 harry was finding the great hall very hot all of a sudden even though the ceiling still looked cold and rainy 
 
 and been through all that persecution from the ministry when they were trying to make out you were unstable and a liar you can still see the marks on the back of your hand where that evil woman made you write with your own blood but you stuck to your story anyway 
 
 you can still see where those brains got hold of me in the ministry look said ron shaking back his sleeves 
 
 and it hurt that grown about a foot over the summer either hermione finished ignoring ron 
 
 tall said ron inconsequentially 
 
 the post owls arrived swooping down through windows scattering everyone with droplets of water most people were receiving more post than usual anxious parents were keen to hear from their children and to reassure them in turn that all was well at home harry had received no mail since the start of term his only regular correspondent was now dead and although he had hoped that lupin might write occasionally he had so far been disappointed he was very surprised therefore to see the snowy white hedwig circling amongst all the brown and gray owls she landed in front of him carrying a large square package a moment later an identical package landed in front of ron crushing beneath it his minuscule and exhausted owl pigwidgeon 
 
 ha said harry unwrapping the parcel to reveal a new copy of advanced fresh from flourish and blotts 
 
 oh good said hermione delighted now you can give that graffitied copy back 
 
 are you mad said harry keeping it look thought it out 
 
 he pulled the old copy of advanced out of his bag and tapped the cover with his wand muttering diffindo the cover fell off he did the same thing with the book hermione looked scandalized he then swapped the covers tapped each and said reparo 
 
 there sat the copy disguised as a new book and there sat the fresh copy from flourish and blotts looking thoroughly 
 
 give slughorn back the new one he complain it cost nine galleons 
 
 hermione pressed her lips together looking angry and disapproving but was distracted by a third owl landing in front of her carrying that copy of the daily prophet she unfolded it hastily and scanned the front page 
 
 anyone we know dead asked ron in a determinedly casual voice he posed the same question every time hermione opened her paper 
 
 no but there have been more dementor attacks said hermione and an arrest 
 
 excellent who said harry thinking of bellatrix lestrange 
 
 stan shunpike said hermione

 stanley shunpike conductor on the popular wizarding conveyance the knight bus has been arrested on suspicion of death eater activity mr shunpike was taken into custody late last night after a raid on his clapham home

 they probably want to look as though doing something said hermione frowning people are terrifiedyou know the patil twins parents want them to go home and eloise midgen has already been withdrawn her father picked her up last night 
 
 what said ron goggling at hermione but hogwarts is safer than their homes bound to be got aurors and all those extra protective spells and got dumbledore

 he pointed over to the edge of the pitch close to where hermione was sitting he thought he saw a flicker of annoyance pass over face and wondered whether mclaggen expected preferential treatment because they were both old favorites

 my final decision and if you get out of the way of the keepers hex you he bellowed 
 
 neither of his chosen beaters had the old brilliance of fred and george but he was still reasonably pleased with them jimmy peakes a short but boy who had managed to raise a lump the size of an egg on the back of head with a ferociously hit bludger and ritchie coote who looked weedy but aimed well they now joined katie demelza and ginny in the stands to watch the selection of their last team member 
 
 harry had deliberately left the trial of the keepers until last hoping for an emptier stadium and less pressure on all concerned unfortunately however all the rejected players and a number of people who had come down to watch after a lengthy breakfast had joined the crowd by now so that it was larger than ever as each keeper flew up to the goal hoops the crowd roared and jeered in equal measure harry glanced over at ron who had always had a problem with nerves harry had hoped that winning their final match last term might have cured it but apparently not ron was a delicate shade of green 
 
 none of the first five applicants saved more than two goals apiece to great disappointment cormac mclaggen saved four penalties out of five on the last one however he shot off in completely the wrong direction the crowd laughed and booed and mclaggen returned to the ground grinding his teeth 
 
 ron looked ready to pass out as he mounted his cleansweep eleven 
 
 good luck cried a voice from the stands harry looked around expecting to see hermione but it was lavender brown he would have quite liked to have hidden his face in his hands as she did a moment later but thought that as the captain he ought to show slightly more grit and so turned to watch ron do his trial 
 
 yet he need not have worried ron saved one two three four five penalties in a row delighted and resisting joining in the cheers of the crowd with difficulty harry turned to mclaggen to tell him that most unfortunately ron had beaten him only to find red face inches from his own he stepped back hastily 
 
 his sister really try said mclaggen menacingly there was a vein pulsing in his temple like the one harry had often admired in uncle she gave him an easy save 
 
 rubbish said harry coldly that was the one he nearly missed 
 
 mclaggen took a step nearer harry who stood his ground this time 
 
 give me another go 
 
 no said harry had your go you saved four ron saved five keeper he won it fair and square get out of my way 
 
 he thought for a moment that mclaggen might punch him but he contented himself with an ugly grimace and stormed away growling what sounded like threats to thin air 
 
 harry turned around to find his new team beaming at him 
 
 well done he croaked you flew really well 
 
 you did brilliantly ron 
 
 this time it really was hermione running toward them from the stands harry saw lavender walking off the pitch arm in arm with parvati a rather grumpy expression on her face ron looked extremely pleased with himself and even taller than usual as he grinned at the team and at hermione 
 
 after fixing the time of their first full practice for the following thursday harry ron and hermione bade goodbye to the rest of the team and headed off toward a watery sun was trying to break through the clouds now and it had stopped drizzling at last harry felt extremely hungry he hoped there would be something to eat at 
 
 i thought i was going to miss that fourth penalty ron was saying happily tricky shot from demelza did you see had a bit of spin on it 
 
 yes yes you were magnificent said hermione looking amused 
 
 i was better than that mclaggen anyway said ron in a highly satisfied voice did you see him lumbering off in the wrong direction on his fifth looked like been confunded 
 
 to surprise hermione turned a very deep shade of pink at these words ron noticed nothing he was too busy describing each of his other penalties in loving detail 
 
 the great gray hippogriff buckbeak was tethered in front of cabin he clicked his beak at their approach and turned his huge head toward them 
 
 oh dear said hermione nervously still a bit scary he 
 
 come off it ridden him you said ron harry stepped forward and bowed low to the hippogriff without breaking eye contact or blinking after a few seconds buckbeak sank into a bow too 
 
 how are you harry asked him in a low voice moving forward to stroke the feathery head missing him but okay here with hagrid you 
 
 oi said a loud voice 
 
 hagrid had come striding around the corner of his cabin wearing a large flowery apron and carrying a sack of potatoes his enormous boarhound fang was at his heels fang gave a booming bark and bounded forward 
 
 git away from him have yer fingersoh yeh lot 
 
 fang was jumping up at hermione and ron attempting to lick their ears hagrid stood and looked at them all for a split second then turned and strode into his cabin slamming the door behind him 
 
 oh dear said hermione looking stricken 
 
 worry about it said harry grimly he walked over to the door and knocked loudly 
 
 hagrid open up we want to talk to you 
 
 there was no sound from within 
 
 if you open the door blast it open harry said pulling out his wand 
 
 harry said hermione sounding shocked you possibly 
 
 yeah i can said harry stand back 
 
 but before he could say anything else the door flew open again as harry had known it would and there stood hagrid glowering down at him and looking despite the flowery apron positively alarming 
 
 a teacher he roared at harry a teacher potter how dare yeh threaten ter break down my door 
 
 sorry sir said harry emphasizing the last word as he stowed his wand inside his robes 
 
 hagrid looked stunned since when have yeh called me sir 
 
 since when have you called me potter 
 
 oh very clever growled hagrid very amusin me outsmarted innit all righ come in then yeh ungrateful little 
 
 mumbling darkly he stood back to let them pass hermione scurried in after harry looking rather frightened 
 
 well said hagrid grumpily as harry ron and hermione sat down around his enormous wooden table fang laying his head immediately upon knee and drooling all over his robes this feelin sorry for me reckon lonely or summat 
 
 no said harry at once we wanted to see you 
 
 missed you said hermione tremulously 
 
 missed me have yeh snorted hagrid yeah righ 
 
 he stomped around brewing up tea in his enormous copper kettle muttering all the while finally he slammed down three mugs of tea in front of them and a plate of his rock cakes harry was hungry enough even for cooking and took one at once 
 
 hagrid said hermione timidly when he joined them at the table and started peeling his potatoes with a brutality that suggested that each tuber had done him a great personal wrong we really wanted to carry on with care of magical creatures you know hagrid gave another great snort harry rather thought some bogeys landed on the potatoes and was inwardly thankful that they were not staying for dinner 
 
 we did said hermione but none of us could fit it into our schedules 
 
 yeah righ said hagrid again 
 
 there was a funny squelching sound and they all looked around hermione let out a tiny shriek and ron leapt out of his seat and hurried around the table away from the large barrel standing in the corner that they had only just noticed it was full of what looked like maggots slimy white and writhing 
 
 what are they hagrid asked harry trying to sound interested rather than revolted but putting down his rock cake all the same 
 
 jus giant grubs said hagrid 
 
 and they grow into said ron looking apprehensive 
 
 they won grow inter nuthin said hagrid i got em ter feed ter aragog 
 
 and without warning he burst into tears 
 
 hagrid cried hermione leaping up hurrying around the table the long way to avoid the barrel of maggots and putting an arm around his shaking shoulders what is it 
 
 him gulped hagrid his eyes streaming as he mopped his face with his apron aragog i think dyin he got ill over the summer an not gettin better i don know what do if he if he bin tergether so long 
 
 hermione patted shoulder looking at a complete loss for anything to say harry knew how she felt he had known hagrid to present a vicious baby dragon with a teddy bear seen him croon over giant scorpions with suckers and stingers attempt to reason with his brutal giant of a but this was perhaps the most incomprehensible of all his monster fancies the gigantic talking spider aragog who dwelled deep in the forbidden forest and which he and ron had only narrowly escaped four years previously 
 
 is thereis there anything we can do hermione asked ignoring frantic grimaces and 
 
 i don think there is hermione choked hagrid attempting to stem the flood of his tears see the rest o the tribe family gettin a bit funny now ill bit restive 
 
 yeah i think we saw a bit of that side of them said ron in an undertone 
 
 i don reckon be safe fer anyone but me ter go near the colony at the mo hagrid finished blowing his nose hard on his apron and looking up but thanks fer offerin hermione it means a lot 
 
 after that the atmosphere lightened considerably for although neither harry nor ron had shown any inclination to go and feed giant grubs to a murderous gargantuan spider hagrid seemed to take it for granted that they would have liked to have done and became his usual self once more 
 
 ar i always knew find it hard ter squeeze me inter yer timetables he said gruffly pouring them more tea even if yeh applied fer 
 
 we have done said hermione we smashed the entire stock of ministry when we were there last summer it was in the daily prophet 
 
 ar well then said hagrid no way yeh done it sorry binyeh jus bin worried about aragog an i did wonder whether if professor had bin teachin yeh 
 
 at which all three of them stated categorically and untruthfully that professor who had substituted for hagrid a few times was a dreadful teacher with the result that by the time hagrid waved them off the premises at dusk he looked quite cheerful 
 
 starving said harry once the door had closed behind them and they were hurrying through the dark and deserted grounds he had abandoned the rock cake after an ominous cracking noise from one of his back teeth and got that detention with snape tonight i got much time for dinner 
 
 as they came into the castle they spotted cormac mclaggen entering the great hall it took him two attempts to get through the doors he ricocheted off the frame on the first attempt ron merely guffawed gloatingly and strode off into the hall after him but harry caught arm and held her back 
 
 what said hermione defensively 
 
 if you ask me said harry quietly mclaggen looks like he was confunded this morning and he was standing right in front of where you were sitting 
 
 hermione blushed 
 
 oh all right then i did it she whispered but you should have heard the way he was talking about ron and ginny anyway got a nasty temper you saw how he reacted when he get inyou have wanted someone like that on the team 
 
 
 no said harry no i suppose true but that dishonest hermione i mean a prefect you 
 
 oh be quiet she snapped as he smirked 
 
 what are you two doing demanded ron reappearing in the doorway to the great hall and looking suspicious 
 
 nothing said harry and hermione together and they hurried after ron the smell of roast beef made stomach ache with hunger but they had barely taken three steps toward the gryffindor table when professor slughorn appeared in front of them blocking their path 
 
 harry harry just the man i was hoping to see he boomed genially twiddling the ends of his walrus mustache and puffing out his enormous belly i was hoping to catch you before dinner what do you say to a spot of supper tonight in my rooms instead having a little party just a few rising stars got mclaggen coming and zabini the charming melinda bobbini know whether you know her her family owns a large chain of apothecariesand of course i hope very much that miss granger will favor me by coming too 
 
 slughorn made hermione a little bow as he finished speaking it was as though ron was not present slughorn did not so much as look at him 
 
 i come professor said harry at once got a detention with professor snape 
 
 oh dear said slughorn his face falling comically dear dear i was counting on you harry well now just have to have a word with severus and explain the situation sure be able to persuade him to postpone your detention yes see you both later 
 
 he bustled away out of the hall 
 
 got no chance of persuading snape said harry the moment slughorn was out of earshot this already been postponed once snape did it for dumbledore but he do it for anyone else 
 
 oh i wish you could come i want to go on my own said hermione anxiously harry knew that she was thinking about mclaggen 
 
 i doubt be alone probably be invited snapped ron who did not seem to have taken kindly to being ignored by slughorn 
 
 after dinner they made their way back to gryffindor tower the common room was very crowded as most people had finished dinner by now but they managed to find a free table and sat down ron who had been in a bad mood ever since the encounter with slughorn folded his arms and frowned at the ceiling hermione reached out for a copy of the evening prophet which somebody had left abandoned on a chair 
 
 anything new said harry 
 
 not really hermione had opened the newspaper and was scanning the inside pages oh look your in here all right she added quickly for ron had looked around in alarm it just says been to visit the malfoys house this second search of the death eaters residence does not seem to have yielded any results arthur weasley of the office for the detection and confiscation of counterfeit defensive spells and protective objects said that his team had been acting upon a confidential 
 
 yeah mine said harry i told him at kings cross about malfoy and that thing he was trying to get borgin to fix well if not at their house he must have brought whatever it is to hogwarts with him 
 
 but how can he have done harry said hermione putting down the newspaper with a surprised look we were all searched when we arrived we 
 
 were you said harry taken aback i 
 
 oh no of course you i forgot you were late well filch ran over all of us with secrecy sensors when we got into the entrance hall any dark object would have been found i know for a fact crabbe had a shrunken head confiscated so you see malfoy have brought in anything dangerous 
 
 momentarily stymied harry watched ginny weasley playing with arnold the pygmy puff for a while before seeing a way around this objection 
 
 sent it to him by owl then he said his mother or someone 
 
 all the owls are being checked too said hermione filch told us so when he was jabbing those secrecy sensors everywhere he could reach 
 
 really stumped this time harry found nothing else to say there did not seem to be any way malfoy could have brought a dangerous or dark object into the school he looked hopefully at ron who was sitting with his arms folded staring over at lavender brown 
 
 can you think of any way malfoy 
 
 oh drop it harry said ron 
 
 listen not my fault slughorn invited hermione and me to his stupid party neither of us wanted to go you know said harry firing up 
 
 well as not invited to any parties said ron getting to his feet again i think go to bed 
 
 he stomped off toward the door to the boys dormitories leaving harry and hermione staring after him 
 
 harry said the new chaser demelza robins appearing suddenly at his shoulder got a message for you 
 
 from professor slughorn asked harry sitting up hopefully 
 
 no from professor snape said demelza heart sank he says to come to his office at half past eight tonight to do your detentionerno matter how many party invitations received and he wanted you to know be sorting out rotten flobberworms from good ones to use in potions andand he says no need to bring protective gloves 
 
 right said harry grimly thanks a lot demelza 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the half blood prince 
 

lionfish nov chapter eleven the bribecontents prev chapter next chapter 
 
 if kreacher could escape a lake full of inferi harry was confident that the capture of mundungus would take a few hours at most and he prowled the house all morning in a state of high anticipation however kreacher did not return that morning or even that afternoon by nightfall harry felt discouraged and anxious and a supper composed largely of moldy bread upon which hermione had tried a variety of unsuccessful transfigurations did nothing to help 
 
 kreacher did not return the following day nor the day after that however two cloaked men had appeared in the square outside number twelve and they remained there into the night gazing in the direction of the house that they could not see 
 
 death eaters for sure said ron as he harry and hermione watched from the drawing room windows reckon they know were in here 
 
 i dont think so said hermione though she looked frightened or theyd have sent snape in after us wouldnt they 
 
 dyou reckon hes been in here and has his tongue tied by moodys curse asked ron 
 
 yes said hermione otherwise hed have been able to tell that lot how to get in wouldnt he but theyre probably watching to see whether we turn up they know that harry owns the house after all 
 
 how do they c began harry 
 
 wizarding wills are examined by the ministry remember theyll know sirius left you the place 
 
 the presence of the death eaters outside increased the ominous mood inside number twelve they had not heard a word form anyone beyond grimmauld place since mr weasleys patronus and the strain was starting to tell restless and irritable ron had developed an annoying habit of playing with the deluminator in his pocket this particularly infuriated hermione who was whiling away the wait for kreacher by studying the tales of beedle the bard and did not appreciate the way the lights kept flashing on and off 
 
 will you stop it she cried on the third evening of kreachers absence as all the light was sucked from the drawing room yet again 
 
 sorry sorry said ron clicking the deluminator and restoring the lights i dont know im doing it 
 
 well cant you find something useful to occupy yourself 
 
 what like reading kids stories 
 
 dumbledore left me this book ron c 
 
 c and he left me the deluminator maybe im supposed to use it 
 
 unable to stand the bickering harry slipped out of the room unnoticed by either of them he headed downstairs toward the kitchen which he kept visiting because he was sure that was where kreacher was most likely to reappear halfway down the flight of stairs into the hall however he heard a tap on the front door then metallic clicks and the grinding of the chain 
 
 every nerve in his body seemed to tauten he pulled out his wand moved into the shadows beside the decapitated elf heads and waited the door opened he saw a glimpse of the lamplit square outside and a cloaked figure edged into the hall and closed the door behind it the intruder took a step forward and moodys voice asked severus snape then the dust figure rose from the end of the hall and rushed him raising its dead hand 
 
 it was not i who killed you albus said a quiet voice 
 
 the jinx broke the exploded again and it was impossible to make out the newcomer through the dense gray cloud it left behind 
 
 harry pointed the wand into the middle of it 
 
 dont move 
 
 he had forgotten the portrait of mrs black at the sound of his yell the curtains hiding her flew open and she began to scream mudbloods and filth dishonoring my house c 
 
 ron and hermione came crashing down the stairs behind harry wands pointing like his at the unknown man now standing with his arms raised in the hall below 
 
 hold your fire its me remus 
 
 oh thank goodness said hermione weakly pointing her wand at mrs black instead with a bang the curtains swished shut again and silence fell ron too lowered his wand but harry did not 
 
 show yourself he called back 
 
 lupin moved forward into the lamplight hands still held high in a gesture of surrender 
 
 i am remus john lupin werewolf sometimes known as moony one of the four creators of the marauders map married to nymphadora usually known as tonks and i taught you how to produce a patronus harry which takes the form of a stag 
 
 oh all right said harry lowering his wand but i had to check didnt i 
 
 speaking as your against the dark arts teacher i quite agree that you had to check ron hermione you shouldnt be so quick to lower your defenses 
 
 they ran down the stairs towards him wrapped in a thick black traveling cloak he looked exhausted but pleased to see them 
 
 no sign of severus then he asked 
 
 no said harry whats going on is everyone okay 
 
 yes said lupin but were all being watched there are a couple of death eaters in the square outside c 
 
 we know c 
 
 i had to apparate very precisely onto the top step outside the front door to be sure that they would not see me they cant know youre in here or im sure theyd have more people out there theyre staking out everywhere thats got any connection with you harry lets go downstairs theres a lot to tell you and i want to know what happened after you left the burrow 
 
 they descended into the kitchen where hermione pointed her wand at the grate a fire sprang up instantly it gave the illusion of coziness to the stark stone walls and glistened off the long wooden table lupin pulled a few butterbeers from beneath his traveling cloak and they sat down 
 
 id have been here three days ago but i needed to shake off the death eater tailing me said lupin so you came straight here after the wedding 
 
 no said harry only after we ran into a couple of death eaters in a caf on tottenham court road 
 
 lupin slopped most of his butterbeer down his front 
 
 what 
 
 they explained what had happened when they had finished lupin looked aghast 
 
 but how did they find you so quickly its impossible to track anyone who apparates unless you grab hold of them as they disappear 
 
 and it doesnt seem likely they were just strolling down tottenham court road at the time does it said harry 
 
 we wondered said hermione tentatively whether harry could still have the trace on him 
 
 impossible said lupin ron looked smug and harry felt hugely relieved apart from anything else theyd know for sure harry was here if he still had the trace on him wouldnt they but i cant see how they could have tracked you to tottenham court road thats worrying really worrying 
 
 he looked disturbed but as far as harry was concerned that question could wait 
 
 tell us what happened after we left we havent heard a thing since rons dad told us the family was safe 
 
 well kingsley saved us said lupin thanks to his warning most of the wedding guests were able to disapparate before they arrived 
 
 were they death eaters or ministry people interjected hermione 
 
 a mixture but to all intents and purposes theyre the same thing now said lupin there were about a dozen of them but they didnt know you were there harry arthur heard a rumor that they tried to torture your whereabouts out of scrimgeour before they killed him if its true he didnt give you away 
 
 harry looked at ron and hermione their expressions reflected the mingled shock and gratitude he felt he had never liked scrimgeour much but if what lupin said was true the mans final act had been to try to protect harry 
 
 the death eaters searched the burrow from top to bottom lupin went on they found the ghoul but didnt want to get too close c and then they interrogated those of us who remained for hours they were trying to get information on you harry but of course nobody apart from the order knew that you had been there 
 
 at the same time that they were smashing up the wedding more death eaters were forcing their way into every house in the country no deaths he added quickly forestalling the question but they were rough they burned down dedalus diggles house but as you know he wasnt there and they used the cruciarus curse on tonkss family again trying to find out where you went after you visited them theyre all right c shaken obviously but otherwise okay 
 
 the death eaters got through all those protective charms 
 
 harry asked remembering how effective these had been on the night he had crashed in tonkss parents garden 
 
 what youve got to realize harry is that the death eaters have got the full might of the ministry on their side now said lupin theyve got the power to perform brutal spells without fear of identification or arrest they managed to penetrate every defensive spell wed cast against them and once inside they were completely open about why theyd come 
 
 and are they bothering to give an excuse for torturing harrys whereabouts out of people asked hermione an edge to her voice 
 
 well lupin said he hesitated then pulled out a folded copy of the daily prophet 
 
 here he said pushing it across the table to harry youll know sooner or later anyway thats their pretext for going after you 
 
 harry smoothed out the paper a huge photograph of his own face filled the front page he read the headline over it 
 
 
 
 
 wanted for questioning about the death of albus dumbledore 
 ron and hermione gave roars of outrage but harry said nothing he pushed the newspaper away he did not want to read anymore he knew what it would say nobody but those who had been on top of the tower when dumbledore died knew who had really killed him and as rita skeeter had already told the wizarding world harry had been seen running from the place moments after dumbledore had fallen 
 
 im sorry harry lupin said 
 
 so death eaters have taken over the daily prophet too asked hermione furiously 
 
 lupin nodded 
 
 but surely people realize whats going on 
 
 the coup has been smooth and virtually silent said lupin 
 
 the official version of scrimgeours murder is that he resigned he has been replaced by pius thicknesse who is under the imperius curse 
 
 why didnt voldemort declare himself minister of magic asked ron 
 
 lupin laughed 
 
 he doesnt need to ron effectively he is the minister but why should he sit behind a desk at the ministry his puppet thicknesse is taking care of everyday business leaving voldemort free to extend his power beyond the ministry 
 
 naturally many people have deduced what has happened there has been such a dramatic change in ministry policy in the last few days and many are whispering that voldemort must be behind it however that is the point they whisper they darent confide in each other not knowing whom to trust they are scared to speak out in case their suspicions are true and their families are targeted yes voldemort is playing a very clever game declaring himself might have provoked open rebellion remaining masked has created confusion uncertainty and fear 
 
 and this dramatic change in ministry policy said harry involves warning the wizarding world against me instead of voldemort 
 
 thats certainly a part of it said lupin and it is a masterstroke now that dumbledore is dead you c the boy who lived c were sure to be the symbol and rallying point for any resistance to voldemort but by suggesting that you had a hand in the old hats death voldemort has not only set a price upon your head but sown doubt and fear amongst many who would have defended you 
 
 meanwhile the ministry has started moving against 
 
 lupin pointed at the daily prophet 
 
 look at page two 
 
 hermione turned the pages with much the same expression of distaste she had when handling secrets of the darkest art 
 
 register she read aloud the ministry of magic is undertaking a survey of the better to understand how they came to possess magical secrets 
 
 recent research undertaken by the department of mysteries reveals that magic can only be passed from person to person when wizards reproduce where no proven wizarding ancestry exists therefore the is likely to have obtained magical power by theft or force 
 
 the ministry is determined to root out such usurpers of magical power and to this end has issued an invitation to every to present themselves for interview by the newly appointed registration commission 
 
 people wont let this happen said ron 
 
 it is happening ron said lupin are being rounded up as we speak 
 
 but how are they supposed to have stolen magic said ron its mental if you could steal magic there wouldnt be any squibs would there 
 
 i know said lupin nevertheless unless you can prove that you have at least one close wizarding relative you are now deemed to have obtained your magical power illegally and must suffer the punishment 
 
 ron glanced at hermione then said what if purebloods and halfbloods swear a part of their family ill tell everyone hermiones my cousin c 
 
 hermione covered rons hand with hers and squeezed it 
 
 thank you ron but i couldnt let you c 
 
 you wont have a choice said ron fiercely gripping her hand back ill teach you my family tree so you can answer questions on it 
 
 hermione gave a shaky laugh 
 
 ron as were on the run with harry potter the most wanted person in the country i dont think it matters if i was going back to school it would be different whats voldemort planning for hogwarts she asked lupin 
 
 attendance is now compulsory for every young witch and wizard he replied that was announced yesterday its a change because it was never obligatory before of course nearly every witch and wizard in britain has been educated at hogwarts but their parents had the right to teach them at home or send them abroad if they preferred this way voldemort will have the whole wizarding population under his eye from a young age and its also another way of weeding out because students must be given blood status c meaning that they have proven to the ministry that they are of wizard descent c before they are allowed to attend 
 
 harry felt sickened and angry at this moment excited would be poring over stacks of newly purchased unaware that they would never see hogwarts perhaps never see their families again either 
 
 its its he muttered struggling to find words that did justice to the horror of his thoughts but lupin said quietly i know 
 
 lupin hesitated 
 
 ill understand if you cant confirm this harry but the order is under the impression that dumbledore left you a mission 
 
 he did harry replied and ron and hermione are in on it and theyre coming with me 
 
 can you confide in me what the mission is 
 
 harry looked into the prematurely lined face framed in thick but graying hair and wished that he could return a different answer 
 
 i cant remus im sorry if dumbledore didnt tell you i dont think i can 
 
 i thought youd say that said lupin looking disappointed but i might still be of some use to you you know what i am and what i can do i could come with you to provide protection there would be no need to tell me exactly what you were up to 
 
 harry hesitated it was a very tempting offer though how they would be able to keep their mission secret from lupin if he were with them all the time he could not imagine 
 
 hermione however looked puzzled 
 
 but what about tonks she asked 
 
 what about her said lupin 
 
 well said hermione frowning youre married how does she feel about you going away with us 
 
 tonks will be perfectly safe said lupin shell be at her parents house 
 
 there was something strange in lupins tone it was almost cold there was also something odd in the idea of tonks remaining hidden at her parents house she was after all a member of the order and as far as harry knew was likely to want to be in the thick of the action 
 
 remus said hermione tentatively is everything all right you know between you and c 
 
 everything is fine thank you said lupin pointedly 
 
 hermione turned pink there was another pause an awkward and embarrassed one and then lupin said with an air of forcing himself to admit something unpleasant tonks is going to have a baby 
 
 oh how wonderful squealed hermione 
 
 excellent said ron enthusiastically 
 
 congratulations said harry 
 
 lupin gave an artificial smile that was more like a grimace then said so do you accept my offer will three become four i cannot believe that dumbledore would have disapproved he appointed me your defense against the dark arts teacher after all and i must tell you that i believe we are facing magic many of us have never encountered or imagined 
 
 ron and hermione both looked at harry 
 
 just c just to be clear he said you want to leave tonks at her parents house and come away with us 
 
 shell be perfectly safe there theyll look after her said lupin he spoke with a finality bordering on indifference harry im sure james would have wanted me to stick with you 
 
 well said harry slowly im not im pretty sure my father would have wanted to know why you arent sticking with your own kid actually 
 
 lupins face drained of color the temperature in the kitchen might have dropped ten degrees ron stared around the room as though he had been bidden to memorize it while hermiones eyes swiveled backward and forward from harry to lupin 
 
 you dont understand said lupin at last 
 
 explain then said harry 
 
 lupin swallowed 
 
 i c i made a grave mistake in marrying tonks i did it against my better judgment and have regretted it very much every since 
 
 i see said harry so youre just going to dump her and the kid and run off with us 
 
 lupin sprang to his feet his chair toppled over backward and he glared at them so fiercely that harry saw for the first time ever she shadow of the wolf upon his human face 
 
 dont you understand what ive done to my wife and my unborn child i should never have married her ive made her an outcast 
 
 lupin kicked aside the chair he had overturned 
 
 you have only ever seen me amongst the order or under dumbledores protection at hogwarts you dont know how most of the wizarding world sees creatures like me when they know of my affliction they can barely talk to me dont you see what ive done 
 
 even her own family is disgusted by our marriage what parents want their only daughter to marry a werewolf and the child c the child c 
 
 lupin actually seized handfuls of his own hair he looked quite deranged 
 
 my kind dont usually breed it will be like me i am convinced of it c how can i forgive myself when i knowingly risked passing on my own condition to an innocent child and if by some miracle it is not like me then it will be better off a hundred times so without a father of whom it must always be ashamed 
 
 remus whispered hermione tears in her eyes dont say that c how could any child be ashamed of you 
 
 oh i dont know hermione said harry id be pretty ashamed of him 
 
 harry did not know where his rage was coming from but it had propelled him to his feet too lupin looked as though harry had hit him 
 
 if the new regime thinks are bad harry said what will they do to a whose fathers in the order my father died trying to protect my mother and me and you reckon hed tell you to abandon your kid to go on an adventure with us 
 
 how c how dare you said lupin this is not about a desire for c for danger or personal glory c how dare you suggest such a c 
 
 i think youre feeling a bit of a daredevil harry said you fancy stepping into siriuss shoes c 
 
 harry no hermione begged him but he continued to glare into lupins livid face 
 
 id never have believed this harry said the man who taught me to fight dementors c a coward 
 
 lupin drew his wand so fast that harry had barely reached for his own there was a loud bang and he felt himself flying backward as if punched as he slammed into the kitchen wall and slid to the floor he glimpsed the tail of lupins cloak disappearing around the door 
 
 remus remus come back hermione cried but lupin did not respond a moment later they heard the front door slam 
 
 harry wailed hermione how could you 
 
 it was easy said harry he stood up he could feel a lump swelling where his head had hit the wall he was still so full of anger he was shaking 
 
 dont look at me like that he snapped at hermione 
 
 dont you start on her snarled ron 
 
 no c no c we mustnt fight said hermione launching herself between them 
 
 you shouldnt have said that stuff to lupin ron told harry 
 
 he had it coming to him said harry broken images were racing each other through his mind sirius falling through the veil dumbledore suspended broken in midair a flash of green light and his mothers voice begging for mercy 
 
 parents said harry shouldnt leave their kids unless c unless theyve got to 
 
 harry c said hermione stretching out a consoling hand but he shrugged it off and walked away his eyes on the fire hermione had conjured he had once spoken to lupin out of that fireplace seeking reassurance about james and lupin had consoled him now lupins tortured white face seemed to swim in the air before him he felt a sickening surge of remorse neither ron nor hermione spoke but harry felt sure that they were looking at each other behind his back communicating silently 
 
 he turned around and caught them turning hurriedly away form each other 
 
 i know i shouldnt have called him a coward 
 
 no you shouldnt said ron at once 
 
 but hes acting like one 
 
 all the same said hermione 
 
 i know said harry but if it makes him go back to tonks itll be worth it wont it 
 
 he could not keep the plea out of his voice hermione looked sympathetic ron uncertain harry looked down at his feet thinking of his father would james have backed harry in what he had said to lupin or would he have been angry at how his son had treated his old friend 
 
 the silent kitchen seemed to hum with the shock of the recent scene and with ron and hermiones unspoken reproaches the daily prophet lupin had brought was still lying on the table harrys own face staring up at the ceiling from the front page he walked over to it and sat down opened the paper at random and pretended to read he could not take in the words his mind was still too full of the encounter with lupin he was sure that ron and hermione had resumed their silent communications on the other side of the prophet he turned a page loudly and dumbledores name leapt out at him it was a moment or two before he took in the meaning of the photograph which showed a family group beneath the photograph were the words the dumbledore family left to right albus percival holding newborn ariana kendra and aberforth 
 
 his attention caught harry examined the picture more carefully dumbledores father percival was a man with eyes that seemed to twinkle even in this faded old photograph the baby ariana was a little longer than a loaf of bread and no more the mother kendra had jet black hair pulled into a high bun her face had a carved quality about it harry thought of photos of native americans hed seen as he studied her dark eyes high cheekbones and straight nose formally composed above a silk gown albus and aberforth wore matching lacy collared jackets and had identical hairstyles albus looked several years older but otherwise the two boys looked very alike for this was before albuss nose had been broken and before he started wearing glasses 
 
 the family looked quite happy and normal smiling serenely up out of the newspaper baby arianas arm waved vaguely out of her shawl harry looked above the picture and saw the headline 
 
 
 
 
 exclusive extract from upcoming 
 biography of albus dumbledore 
 by rita skeeter 
 
 
 
 thinking it could hardly make him feel any worse than he already did harry began to read 
 
 
 
 
 proud and haughty kendra dumbledore could not bear to remain in after her husband percivals arrest and imprisonment in azkaban she therefore decided to uproot the family and relocate to godrics hollow the village that was later to gain fame as the scene of harry potters strange escape from 
 
 like godrics hollow was home to a number of wizarding families but as kendra knew none of them she would be spared the curiosity about her husbands crime she had faced in her former village by repeatedly rebuffing the friendly advances of her new wizarding neighbors she soon ensured that her family was left well alone 
 
 slammed the door in my face when i went around to welcome her with a batch of homemade cauldron cakes says bathilda bagshot the first year they were there i only ever saw the two boys wouldnt have known there was a daughter if i hadnt been picking plangentines by moonlight the winter after they moved in and saw kendra leading ariana out into the back garden walked her round the lawn once keeping a firm grip on her then took her back inside didnt know what to make of it 
 
 it seems that kendra thought the move to godrics hollow was the perfect opportunity to hide ariana once and for all something she had probably been planning for years the timing was significant ariana was barely seven years old when she vanished from sight and seven is the age by which most experts agree that magic will have revealed itself if present nobody now alive remembers ariana ever demonstrating even the slightest sign of magical ability it seems clear therefore that kendra made a decision to hide her daughters existence rather than suffer the shame of admitting that she had produced a squib moving away from the friends and neighbors who knew ariana would of course make imprisoning her all the easier the tiny number of people who henceforth knew of arianas existence could be counted upon to keep the secret including her two brothers who had deflected awkward questions with the answer their mother had taught them my sister is too frail for school 
 
 
 
 
 next week albus dumbledore at hogwarts c the prizes and the pretense 
 harry had been wrong what he had read had indeed made him feel worse he looked back at the photograph of the apparently happy family was it true how could he find out he wanted to go to godrics hollow even if bathilda was in no fit state to talk to him he wanted to visit the place where he and dumbledore had both lost loved ones he was in the process of lowering the newspaper to ask rons and hermiones opinions when a deafening crack echoed around the kitchen 
 for the first time in three days harry had forgotten all about kreacher his immediate thought was that lupin had burst back into the room and for a split second he did not take in the mass of struggling limbs that had appeared out of thin air right beside his chair he hurried to his feet as kreacher disentangled himself and bowing low to harry croaked kreacher has returned with the thief mundungus fletcher master 
 
 mundungus scrambled up and pulled out his wand hermione however was too quick for him 
 
 expelliarmus 
 
 mundunguss wand soared into the air and hermione caught it mundungus dived for the stairs ron him and mundungus hit the stone floor with a muffled crunch 
 
 what he bellowed writhing in his attempts to free himself from rons grip whave i done setting a bleedin on me what are you playing at whave i done lemme go lemme go of c 
 
 youre not in much of a position to make threats said harry he threw aside the newspaper crossed the kitchen in a few strides and dropped to his knees beside mundungus who stopped struggling and looked terrified ron got up panting and watched as harry pointed his wand deliberately at mundunguss nose mundungus stank of stale sweat and tobacco smoke his hair was matted and his robes stained 
 
 kreacher apologizes for the delay in bringing the thief master croaked the elf fletcher knows how to avoid capture has many and accomplices nevertheless kreacher cornered the thief in the end 
 
 youve done really well kreacher said harry and the elf bowed low 
 
 right weve got a few questions for you harry told mundungus who shouted at once 
 
 i panicked okay i never wanted to come along no offense mate but i never volunteered to die for you an that was bleedin come flying at me anyone woulda got outta there i said all along i didnt wanna do it c 
 
 for your information none of the rest of us disapparated said hermione 
 
 well youre a bunch of bleedin eroes then arent you but i never pretended i was up for killing meself c 
 
 were not interested in why you ran out on said harry moving his wand a little closer to mundunguss baggy bloodshot eyes we already knew you were an unreliable bit of scum 
 
 well then why the ell am i being unted down by or is this about them goblets again i aint got none of em left or you could ave em c 
 
 its not about the goblets either although youre getting warmer said harry shut up and listen 
 
 it felt wonderful to have something to do someone of whom he could demand some small portion of truth harrys wand was now so close to the bridge of mundunguss nose that mundungus had gone trying to keep it in view 
 
 when you cleaned out this house of anything valuable harry began but mundungus interrupted him again 
 
 sirius never cared about any of the junk c 
 
 there was the sound of pattering fee a blaze of shining copper an echoing clang and a shriek of agony kreacher had taken a run at mundungus and hit him over the head with a saucepan 
 
 call im off call im off e should be locked up screamed mundungus cowering as kreacher raised the pan again 
 
 kreacher no shouted harry 
 
 kreachers thin arms trembled with the weight of the pan still held aloft 
 
 perhaps just one more master harry for luck 
 
 ron laughed 
 
 we need him conscious kreacher but if he needs persuading you can do the honors said harry 
 
 thank you very much master said kreacher with a bow and he retreated a short distance his great pale eyes still fixed upon mundungus with loathing 
 
 when you stripped this house of all the valuables you could find harry began again you took a bunch of stuff from the kitchen cupboard there was a locket there harrys mouth was suddenly dry he could sense ron and hermiones tension and excitement too what did you do with it 
 
 why asked mundungus is it valuable 
 
 youve still got it cried hermione 
 
 no he hasnt said ron shrewdly hes wondering whether he should have asked more money for it 
 
 more said mundungus that wouldnt have been effing difficultbleedin gave it away din i no choice 
 
 what do you mean 
 
 i was selling in diagon alley and she come up to me and asks if ive got a license for trading in magical artifacts bleedin snoop she was gonna fine me but she took a fancy to the locket an told me shed take it and let me off that time and to fink meself lucky 
 
 who was this woman asked harry 
 
 i dunno some ministry hag 
 
 mundungus considered for a moment brow wrinkled 
 
 little woman bow on top of er head 
 
 he frowned and then added looked like a toad 
 
 harry dropped his wand it hit mundungus on the nose and shot red sparks into his eyebrows which ignited 
 
 aquamenti screamed hermione and a jet of water streamed from her wand engulfing a spluttering and choking mundungus 
 
 harry looked up and saw his own shock reflected in rons and hermiones faces the scars on the back of his right hand seemed to be tingling again 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the deathly hallows 
 

lionfish nov chapter eleven the bribecontents prev chapter next chapter 
 
 if kreacher could escape a lake full of inferi harry was confident that the capture of mundungus would take a few hours at most and he prowled the house all morning in a state of high anticipation however kreacher did not return that morning or even that afternoon by nightfall harry felt discouraged and anxious and a supper composed largely of moldy bread upon which hermione had tried a variety of unsuccessful transfigurations did nothing to help 
 
 kreacher did not return the following day nor the day after that however two cloaked men had appeared in the square outside number twelve and they remained there into the night gazing in the direction of the house that they could not see 
 
 death eaters for sure said ron as he harry and hermione watched from the drawing room windows reckon they know were in here 
 
 i dont think so said hermione though she looked frightened or theyd have sent snape in after us wouldnt they 
 
 dyou reckon hes been in here and has his tongue tied by moodys curse asked ron 
 
 yes said hermione otherwise hed have been able to tell that lot how to get in wouldnt he but theyre probably watching to see whether we turn up they know that harry owns the house after all 
 
 how do they c began harry 
 
 wizarding wills are examined by the ministry remember theyll know sirius left you the place 
 
 the presence of the death eaters outside increased the ominous mood inside number twelve they had not heard a word form anyone beyond grimmauld place since mr weasleys patronus and the strain was starting to tell restless and irritable ron had developed an annoying habit of playing with the deluminator in his pocket this particularly infuriated hermione who was whiling away the wait for kreacher by studying the tales of beedle the bard and did not appreciate the way the lights kept flashing on and off 
 
 will you stop it she cried on the third evening of kreachers absence as all the light was sucked from the drawing room yet again 
 
 sorry sorry said ron clicking the deluminator and restoring the lights i dont know im doing it 
 
 well cant you find something useful to occupy yourself 
 
 what like reading kids stories 
 
 dumbledore left me this book ron c 
 
 c and he left me the deluminator maybe im supposed to use it 
 
 unable to stand the bickering harry slipped out of the room unnoticed by either of them he headed downstairs toward the kitchen which he kept visiting because he was sure that was where kreacher was most likely to reappear halfway down the flight of stairs into the hall however he heard a tap on the front door then metallic clicks and the grinding of the chain 
 
 every nerve in his body seemed to tauten he pulled out his wand moved into the shadows beside the decapitated elf heads and waited the door opened he saw a glimpse of the lamplit square outside and a cloaked figure edged into the hall and closed the door behind it the intruder took a step forward and moodys voice asked severus snape then the dust figure rose from the end of the hall and rushed him raising its dead hand 
 
 it was not i who killed you albus said a quiet voice 
 
 the jinx broke the exploded again and it was impossible to make out the newcomer through the dense gray cloud it left behind 
 
 harry pointed the wand into the middle of it 
 
 dont move 
 
 he had forgotten the portrait of mrs black at the sound of his yell the curtains hiding her flew open and she began to scream mudbloods and filth dishonoring my house c 
 
 ron and hermione came crashing down the stairs behind harry wands pointing like his at the unknown man now standing with his arms raised in the hall below 
 
 hold your fire its me remus 
 
 oh thank goodness said hermione weakly pointing her wand at mrs black instead with a bang the curtains swished shut again and silence fell ron too lowered his wand but harry did not 
 
 show yourself he called back 
 
 lupin moved forward into the lamplight hands still held high in a gesture of surrender 
 
 i am remus john lupin werewolf sometimes known as moony one of the four creators of the marauders map married to nymphadora usually known as tonks and i taught you how to produce a patronus harry which takes the form of a stag 
 
 oh all right said harry lowering his wand but i had to check didnt i 
 
 speaking as your against the dark arts teacher i quite agree that you had to check ron hermione you shouldnt be so quick to lower your defenses 
 
 they ran down the stairs towards him wrapped in a thick black traveling cloak he looked exhausted but pleased to see them 
 
 no sign of severus then he asked 
 
 no said harry whats going on is everyone okay 
 
 yes said lupin but were all being watched there are a couple of death eaters in the square outside c 
 
 we know c 
 
 i had to apparate very precisely onto the top step outside the front door to be sure that they would not see me they cant know youre in here or im sure theyd have more people out there theyre staking out everywhere thats got any connection with you harry lets go downstairs theres a lot to tell you and i want to know what happened after you left the burrow 
 
 they descended into the kitchen where hermione pointed her wand at the grate a fire sprang up instantly it gave the illusion of coziness to the stark stone walls and glistened off the long wooden table lupin pulled a few butterbeers from beneath his traveling cloak and they sat down 
 
 id have been here three days ago but i needed to shake off the death eater tailing me said lupin so you came straight here after the wedding 
 
 no said harry only after we ran into a couple of death eaters in a caf on tottenham court road 
 
 lupin slopped most of his butterbeer down his front 
 
 what 
 
 they explained what had happened when they had finished lupin looked aghast 
 
 but how did they find you so quickly its impossible to track anyone who apparates unless you grab hold of them as they disappear 
 
 and it doesnt seem likely they were just strolling down tottenham court road at the time does it said harry 
 
 we wondered said hermione tentatively whether harry could still have the trace on him 
 
 impossible said lupin ron looked smug and harry felt hugely relieved apart from anything else theyd know for sure harry was here if he still had the trace on him wouldnt they but i cant see how they could have tracked you to tottenham court road thats worrying really worrying 
 
 he looked disturbed but as far as harry was concerned that question could wait 
 
 tell us what happened after we left we havent heard a thing since rons dad told us the family was safe 
 
 well kingsley saved us said lupin thanks to his warning most of the wedding guests were able to disapparate before they arrived 
 
 were they death eaters or ministry people interjected hermione 
 
 a mixture but to all intents and purposes theyre the same thing now said lupin there were about a dozen of them but they didnt know you were there harry arthur heard a rumor that they tried to torture your whereabouts out of scrimgeour before they killed him if its true he didnt give you away 
 
 harry looked at ron and hermione their expressions reflected the mingled shock and gratitude he felt he had never liked scrimgeour much but if what lupin said was true the mans final act had been to try to protect harry 
 
 the death eaters searched the burrow from top to bottom lupin went on they found the ghoul but didnt want to get too close c and then they interrogated those of us who remained for hours they were trying to get information on you harry but of course nobody apart from the order knew that you had been there 
 
 at the same time that they were smashing up the wedding more death eaters were forcing their way into every house in the country no deaths he added quickly forestalling the question but they were rough they burned down dedalus diggles house but as you know he wasnt there and they used the cruciarus curse on tonkss family again trying to find out where you went after you visited them theyre all right c shaken obviously but otherwise okay 
 
 the death eaters got through all those protective charms 
 
 harry asked remembering how effective these had been on the night he had crashed in tonkss parents garden 
 
 what youve got to realize harry is that the death eaters have got the full might of the ministry on their side now said lupin theyve got the power to perform brutal spells without fear of identification or arrest they managed to penetrate every defensive spell wed cast against them and once inside they were completely open about why theyd come 
 
 and are they bothering to give an excuse for torturing harrys whereabouts out of people asked hermione an edge to her voice 
 
 well lupin said he hesitated then pulled out a folded copy of the daily prophet 
 
 here he said pushing it across the table to harry youll know sooner or later anyway thats their pretext for going after you 
 
 harry smoothed out the paper a huge photograph of his own face filled the front page he read the headline over it 
 
 
 
 
 wanted for questioning about the death of albus dumbledore 
 ron and hermione gave roars of outrage but harry said nothing he pushed the newspaper away he did not want to read anymore he knew what it would say nobody but those who had been on top of the tower when dumbledore died knew who had really killed him and as rita skeeter had already told the wizarding world harry had been seen running from the place moments after dumbledore had fallen 
 
 im sorry harry lupin said 
 
 so death eaters have taken over the daily prophet too asked hermione furiously 
 
 lupin nodded 
 
 but surely people realize whats going on 
 
 the coup has been smooth and virtually silent said lupin 
 
 the official version of scrimgeours murder is that he resigned he has been replaced by pius thicknesse who is under the imperius curse 
 
 why didnt voldemort declare himself minister of magic asked ron 
 
 lupin laughed 
 
 he doesnt need to ron effectively he is the minister but why should he sit behind a desk at the ministry his puppet thicknesse is taking care of everyday business leaving voldemort free to extend his power beyond the ministry 
 
 naturally many people have deduced what has happened there has been such a dramatic change in ministry policy in the last few days and many are whispering that voldemort must be behind it however that is the point they whisper they darent confide in each other not knowing whom to trust they are scared to speak out in case their suspicions are true and their families are targeted yes voldemort is playing a very clever game declaring himself might have provoked open rebellion remaining masked has created confusion uncertainty and fear 
 
 and this dramatic change in ministry policy said harry involves warning the wizarding world against me instead of voldemort 
 
 thats certainly a part of it said lupin and it is a masterstroke now that dumbledore is dead you c the boy who lived c were sure to be the symbol and rallying point for any resistance to voldemort but by suggesting that you had a hand in the old hats death voldemort has not only set a price upon your head but sown doubt and fear amongst many who would have defended you 
 
 meanwhile the ministry has started moving against 
 
 lupin pointed at the daily prophet 
 
 look at page two 
 
 hermione turned the pages with much the same expression of distaste she had when handling secrets of the darkest art 
 
 register she read aloud the ministry of magic is undertaking a survey of the better to understand how they came to possess magical secrets 
 
 recent research undertaken by the department of mysteries reveals that magic can only be passed from person to person when wizards reproduce where no proven wizarding ancestry exists therefore the is likely to have obtained magical power by theft or force 
 
 the ministry is determined to root out such usurpers of magical power and to this end has issued an invitation to every to present themselves for interview by the newly appointed registration commission 
 
 people wont let this happen said ron 
 
 it is happening ron said lupin are being rounded up as we speak 
 
 but how are they supposed to have stolen magic said ron its mental if you could steal magic there wouldnt be any squibs would there 
 
 i know said lupin nevertheless unless you can prove that you have at least one close wizarding relative you are now deemed to have obtained your magical power illegally and must suffer the punishment 
 
 ron glanced at hermione then said what if purebloods and halfbloods swear a part of their family ill tell everyone hermiones my cousin c 
 
 hermione covered rons hand with hers and squeezed it 
 
 thank you ron but i couldnt let you c 
 
 you wont have a choice said ron fiercely gripping her hand back ill teach you my family tree so you can answer questions on it 
 
 hermione gave a shaky laugh 
 
 ron as were on the run with harry potter the most wanted person in the country i dont think it matters if i was going back to school it would be different whats voldemort planning for hogwarts she asked lupin 
 
 attendance is now compulsory for every young witch and wizard he replied that was announced yesterday its a change because it was never obligatory before of course nearly every witch and wizard in britain has been educated at hogwarts but their parents had the right to teach them at home or send them abroad if they preferred this way voldemort will have the whole wizarding population under his eye from a young age and its also another way of weeding out because students must be given blood status c meaning that they have proven to the ministry that they are of wizard descent c before they are allowed to attend 
 
 harry felt sickened and angry at this moment excited would be poring over stacks of newly purchased unaware that they would never see hogwarts perhaps never see their families again either 
 
 its its he muttered struggling to find words that did justice to the horror of his thoughts but lupin said quietly i know 
 
 lupin hesitated 
 
 ill understand if you cant confirm this harry but the order is under the impression that dumbledore left you a mission 
 
 he did harry replied and ron and hermione are in on it and theyre coming with me 
 
 can you confide in me what the mission is 
 
 harry looked into the prematurely lined face framed in thick but graying hair and wished that he could return a different answer 
 
 i cant remus im sorry if dumbledore didnt tell you i dont think i can 
 
 i thought youd say that said lupin looking disappointed but i might still be of some use to you you know what i am and what i can do i could come with you to provide protection there would be no need to tell me exactly what you were up to 
 
 harry hesitated it was a very tempting offer though how they would be able to keep their mission secret from lupin if he were with them all the time he could not imagine 
 
 hermione however looked puzzled 
 
 but what about tonks she asked 
 
 what about her said lupin 
 
 well said hermione frowning youre married how does she feel about you going away with us 
 
 tonks will be perfectly safe said lupin shell be at her parents house 
 
 there was something strange in lupins tone it was almost cold there was also something odd in the idea of tonks remaining hidden at her parents house she was after all a member of the order and as far as harry knew was likely to want to be in the thick of the action 
 
 remus said hermione tentatively is everything all right you know between you and c 
 
 everything is fine thank you said lupin pointedly 
 
 hermione turned pink there was another pause an awkward and embarrassed one and then lupin said with an air of forcing himself to admit something unpleasant tonks is going to have a baby 
 
 oh how wonderful squealed hermione 
 
 excellent said ron enthusiastically 
 
 congratulations said harry 
 
 lupin gave an artificial smile that was more like a grimace then said so do you accept my offer will three become four i cannot believe that dumbledore would have disapproved he appointed me your defense against the dark arts teacher after all and i must tell you that i believe we are facing magic many of us have never encountered or imagined 
 
 ron and hermione both looked at harry 
 
 just c just to be clear he said you want to leave tonks at her parents house and come away with us 
 
 shell be perfectly safe there theyll look after her said lupin he spoke with a finality bordering on indifference harry im sure james would have wanted me to stick with you 
 
 well said harry slowly im not im pretty sure my father would have wanted to know why you arent sticking with your own kid actually 
 
 lupins face drained of color the temperature in the kitchen might have dropped ten degrees ron stared around the room as though he had been bidden to memorize it while hermiones eyes swiveled backward and forward from harry to lupin 
 
 you dont understand said lupin at last 
 
 explain then said harry 
 
 lupin swallowed 
 
 i c i made a grave mistake in marrying tonks i did it against my better judgment and have regretted it very much every since 
 
 i see said harry so youre just going to dump her and the kid and run off with us 
 
 lupin sprang to his feet his chair toppled over backward and he glared at them so fiercely that harry saw for the first time ever she shadow of the wolf upon his human face 
 
 dont you understand what ive done to my wife and my unborn child i should never have married her ive made her an outcast 
 
 lupin kicked aside the chair he had overturned 
 
 you have only ever seen me amongst the order or under dumbledores protection at hogwarts you dont know how most of the wizarding world sees creatures like me when they know of my affliction they can barely talk to me dont you see what ive done 
 
 even her own family is disgusted by our marriage what parents want their only daughter to marry a werewolf and the child c the child c 
 
 lupin actually seized handfuls of his own hair he looked quite deranged 
 
 my kind dont usually breed it will be like me i am convinced of it c how can i forgive myself when i knowingly risked passing on my own condition to an innocent child and if by some miracle it is not like me then it will be better off a hundred times so without a father of whom it must always be ashamed 
 
 remus whispered hermione tears in her eyes dont say that c how could any child be ashamed of you 
 
 oh i dont know hermione said harry id be pretty ashamed of him 
 
 harry did not know where his rage was coming from but it had propelled him to his feet too lupin looked as though harry had hit him 
 
 if the new regime thinks are bad harry said what will they do to a whose fathers in the order my father died trying to protect my mother and me and you reckon hed tell you to abandon your kid to go on an adventure with us 
 
 how c how dare you said lupin this is not about a desire for c for danger or personal glory c how dare you suggest such a c 
 
 i think youre feeling a bit of a daredevil harry said you fancy stepping into siriuss shoes c 
 
 harry no hermione begged him but he continued to glare into lupins livid face 
 
 id never have believed this harry said the man who taught me to fight dementors c a coward 
 
 lupin drew his wand so fast that harry had barely reached for his own there was a loud bang and he felt himself flying backward as if punched as he slammed into the kitchen wall and slid to the floor he glimpsed the tail of lupins cloak disappearing around the door 
 
 remus remus come back hermione cried but lupin did not respond a moment later they heard the front door slam 
 
 harry wailed hermione how could you 
 
 it was easy said harry he stood up he could feel a lump swelling where his head had hit the wall he was still so full of anger he was shaking 
 
 dont look at me like that he snapped at hermione 
 
 dont you start on her snarled ron 
 
 no c no c we mustnt fight said hermione launching herself between them 
 
 you shouldnt have said that stuff to lupin ron told harry 
 
 he had it coming to him said harry broken images were racing each other through his mind sirius falling through the veil dumbledore suspended broken in midair a flash of green light and his mothers voice begging for mercy 
 
 parents said harry shouldnt leave their kids unless c unless theyve got to 
 
 harry c said hermione stretching out a consoling hand but he shrugged it off and walked away his eyes on the fire hermione had conjured he had once spoken to lupin out of that fireplace seeking reassurance about james and lupin had consoled him now lupins tortured white face seemed to swim in the air before him he felt a sickening surge of remorse neither ron nor hermione spoke but harry felt sure that they were looking at each other behind his back communicating silently 
 
 he turned around and caught them turning hurriedly away form each other 
 
 i know i shouldnt have called him a coward 
 
 no you shouldnt said ron at once 
 
 but hes acting like one 
 
 all the same said hermione 
 
 i know said harry but if it makes him go back to tonks itll be worth it wont it 
 
 he could not keep the plea out of his voice hermione looked sympathetic ron uncertain harry looked down at his feet thinking of his father would james have backed harry in what he had said to lupin or would he have been angry at how his son had treated his old friend 
 
 the silent kitchen seemed to hum with the shock of the recent scene and with ron and hermiones unspoken reproaches the daily prophet lupin had brought was still lying on the table harrys own face staring up at the ceiling from the front page he walked over to it and sat down opened the paper at random and pretended to read he could not take in the words his mind was still too full of the encounter with lupin he was sure that ron and hermione had resumed their silent communications on the other side of the prophet he turned a page loudly and dumbledores name leapt out at him it was a moment or two before he took in the meaning of the photograph which showed a family group beneath the photograph were the words the dumbledore family left to right albus percival holding newborn ariana kendra and aberforth 
 
 his attention caught harry examined the picture more carefully dumbledores father percival was a man with eyes that seemed to twinkle even in this faded old photograph the baby ariana was a little longer than a loaf of bread and no more the mother kendra had jet black hair pulled into a high bun her face had a carved quality about it harry thought of photos of native americans hed seen as he studied her dark eyes high cheekbones and straight nose formally composed above a silk gown albus and aberforth wore matching lacy collared jackets and had identical hairstyles albus looked several years older but otherwise the two boys looked very alike for this was before albuss nose had been broken and before he started wearing glasses 
 
 the family looked quite happy and normal smiling serenely up out of the newspaper baby arianas arm waved vaguely out of her shawl harry looked above the picture and saw the headline 
 
 
 
 
 exclusive extract from upcoming 
 biography of albus dumbledore 
 by rita skeeter 
 
 
 
 thinking it could hardly make him feel any worse than he already did harry began to read 
 
 
 
 
 proud and haughty kendra dumbledore could not bear to remain in after her husband percivals arrest and imprisonment in azkaban she therefore decided to uproot the family and relocate to godrics hollow the village that was later to gain fame as the scene of harry potters strange escape from 
 
 like godrics hollow was home to a number of wizarding families but as kendra knew none of them she would be spared the curiosity about her husbands crime she had faced in her former village by repeatedly rebuffing the friendly advances of her new wizarding neighbors she soon ensured that her family was left well alone 
 
 slammed the door in my face when i went around to welcome her with a batch of homemade cauldron cakes says bathilda bagshot the first year they were there i only ever saw the two boys wouldnt have known there was a daughter if i hadnt been picking plangentines by moonlight the winter after they moved in and saw kendra leading ariana out into the back garden walked her round the lawn once keeping a firm grip on her then took her back inside didnt know what to make of it 
 
 it seems that kendra thought the move to godrics hollow was the perfect opportunity to hide ariana once and for all something she had probably been planning for years the timing was significant ariana was barely seven years old when she vanished from sight and seven is the age by which most experts agree that magic will have revealed itself if present nobody now alive remembers ariana ever demonstrating even the slightest sign of magical ability it seems clear therefore that kendra made a decision to hide her daughters existence rather than suffer the shame of admitting that she had produced a squib moving away from the friends and neighbors who knew ariana would of course make imprisoning her all the easier the tiny number of people who henceforth knew of arianas existence could be counted upon to keep the secret including her two brothers who had deflected awkward questions with the answer their mother had taught them my sister is too frail for school 
 
 
 
 
 next week albus dumbledore at hogwarts c the prizes and the pretense 
 harry had been wrong what he had read had indeed made him feel worse he looked back at the photograph of the apparently happy family was it true how could he find out he wanted to go to godrics hollow even if bathilda was in no fit state to talk to him he wanted to visit the place where he and dumbledore had both lost loved ones he was in the process of lowering the newspaper to ask rons and hermiones opinions when a deafening crack echoed around the kitchen 
 for the first time in three days harry had forgotten all about kreacher his immediate thought was that lupin had burst back into the room and for a split second he did not take in the mass of struggling limbs that had appeared out of thin air right beside his chair he hurried to his feet as kreacher disentangled himself and bowing low to harry croaked kreacher has returned with the thief mundungus fletcher master 
 
 mundungus scrambled up and pulled out his wand hermione however was too quick for him 
 
 expelliarmus 
 
 mundunguss wand soared into the air and hermione caught it mundungus dived for the stairs ron him and mundungus hit the stone floor with a muffled crunch 
 
 what he bellowed writhing in his attempts to free himself from rons grip whave i done setting a bleedin on me what are you playing at whave i done lemme go lemme go of c 
 
 youre not in much of a position to make threats said harry he threw aside the newspaper crossed the kitchen in a few strides and dropped to his knees beside mundungus who stopped struggling and looked terrified ron got up panting and watched as harry pointed his wand deliberately at mundunguss nose mundungus stank of stale sweat and tobacco smoke his hair was matted and his robes stained 
 
 kreacher apologizes for the delay in bringing the thief master croaked the elf fletcher knows how to avoid capture has many and accomplices nevertheless kreacher cornered the thief in the end 
 
 youve done really well kreacher said harry and the elf bowed low 
 
 right weve got a few questions for you harry told mundungus who shouted at once 
 
 i panicked okay i never wanted to come along no offense mate but i never volunteered to die for you an that was bleedin come flying at me anyone woulda got outta there i said all along i didnt wanna do it c 
 
 for your information none of the rest of us disapparated said hermione 
 
 well youre a bunch of bleedin eroes then arent you but i never pretended i was up for killing meself c 
 
 were not interested in why you ran out on said harry moving his wand a little closer to mundunguss baggy bloodshot eyes we already knew you were an unreliable bit of scum 
 
 well then why the ell am i being unted down by or is this about them goblets again i aint got none of em left or you could ave em c 
 
 its not about the goblets either although youre getting warmer said harry shut up and listen 
 
 it felt wonderful to have something to do someone of whom he could demand some small portion of truth harrys wand was now so close to the bridge of mundunguss nose that mundungus had gone trying to keep it in view 
 
 when you cleaned out this house of anything valuable harry began but mundungus interrupted him again 
 
 sirius never cared about any of the junk c 
 
 there was the sound of pattering fee a blaze of shining copper an echoing clang and a shriek of agony kreacher had taken a run at mundungus and hit him over the head with a saucepan 
 
 call im off call im off e should be locked up screamed mundungus cowering as kreacher raised the pan again 
 
 kreacher no shouted harry 
 
 kreachers thin arms trembled with the weight of the pan still held aloft 
 
 perhaps just one more master harry for luck 
 
 ron laughed 
 
 we need him conscious kreacher but if he needs persuading you can do the honors said harry 
 
 thank you very much master said kreacher with a bow and he retreated a short distance his great pale eyes still fixed upon mundungus with loathing 
 
 when you stripped this house of all the valuables you could find harry began again you took a bunch of stuff from the kitchen cupboard there was a locket there harrys mouth was suddenly dry he could sense ron and hermiones tension and excitement too what did you do with it 
 
 why asked mundungus is it valuable 
 
 youve still got it cried hermione 
 
 no he hasnt said ron shrewdly hes wondering whether he should have asked more money for it 
 
 more said mundungus that wouldnt have been effing difficultbleedin gave it away din i no choice 
 
 what do you mean 
 
 i was selling in diagon alley and she come up to me and asks if ive got a license for trading in magical artifacts bleedin snoop she was gonna fine me but she took a fancy to the locket an told me shed take it and let me off that time and to fink meself lucky 
 
 who was this woman asked harry 
 
 i dunno some ministry hag 
 
 mundungus considered for a moment brow wrinkled 
 
 little woman bow on top of er head 
 
 he frowned and then added looked like a toad 
 
 harry dropped his wand it hit mundungus on the nose and shot red sparks into his eyebrows which ignited 
 
 aquamenti screamed hermione and a jet of water streamed from her wand engulfing a spluttering and choking mundungus 
 
 harry looked up and saw his own shock reflected in rons and hermiones faces the scars on the back of his right hand seemed to be tingling again 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the deathly hallows 
 


 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 fairy tales of hans christian andersen 
 delaying is not forgetting 
 by hans christian andersen 
 
 there was an old mansion surrounded by a marshy ditch with a 
 drawbridge which was but seldom let down not all guests are good 
 people under the roof were loopholes to shoot through and to pour 
 down boiling water or even molten lead on the enemy should he 
 approach inside the house the rooms were very high and had ceilings 
 of beams and that was very useful considering the great deal of smoke which rose up from the chimney fire where the large damp logs of wood smouldered on the walls hung pictures of knights in armour and proud ladies in gorgeous dresses the most stately of all walked about alive she was called meta mogen she was the mistress of the house to her belonged the castle 
 
 towards the evening robbers came they killed three of her 
 people and also the and attached mrs meta to the kennel 
 by the chain while they themselves made good cheer in the hall and 
 drank the wine and the good ale out of her cellar mrs meta was now 
 on the chain she could not even bark 
 
 but lo the servant of one of the robbers secretly approached her 
 they must not see it otherwise they would have killed him 
 mrs meta mogen said the fellow do you still remember how 
 my father when your husband was still alive had to ride on the 
 wooden horse you prayed for him but it was no good he was to ride until his limbs were paralysed but you stole down to him as i 
 steal now to you you yourself put little stones under each of his 
 feet that he might have support nobody saw it or they pretended 
 not to see it for you were then the young gracious mistress my 
 father has told me this and i have not forgotten it now i will 
 free you mrs meta mogen 
 
 then they pulled the horses out of the stable and rode off in rain 
 and wind to obtain the assistance of friends 
 
 thus the small service done to the old man was richly rewarded said meta mogen 
 
 delaying is not forgetting said the fellow 
 the robbers were hanged 
 there was an old mansion it is still there it did not belong 
 to mrs meta mogen it belonged to another old noble family 
 we are now in the present time the sun is shining on the gilt 
 knob of the tower little wooded islands lie like bouquets on the 
 water and wild swans are swimming round them in the garden grow 
 roses the mistress of the house is herself the finest rose petal she 
 beams with joy the joy of good deeds however not done in the wide 
 world but in her heart and what is preserved there is not forgotten 
 delaying is not forgetting 
 
 now she goes from the mansion to a little peasant hut in the 
 field therein lives a poor paralysed girl the window of her little 
 room looks northward the sun does not enter here the girl can only 
 see a small piece of field which is surrounded by a high fence but 
 the sun shines here the warm beautiful sun of god is within 
 the little room it comes from the south through the new window where formerly the wall was 
 
 the paralysed girl sits in the warm sunshine and can see the 
 wood and the lake the world had become so large so beautiful and 
 only through a single word from the kind mistress of the mansion 
 the word was so easy the deed so small she said the joy it 
 afforded me was infinitely great and sweet 
 and therefore she does many a good deed thinks of all in the 
 humble cottages and in the rich mansions where there are also 
 afflicted ones it is concealed and hidden but god does not forget 
 it delayed is not forgotten 
 an old house stood there it was in the large town with its busy 
 traffic there are rooms and halls in it but we do not enter them we 
 remain in the kitchen where it is warm and light clean and tidy the 
 copper utensils are shining the table as if polished with beeswax 
 the sink looks like a freshly scoured meatboard all this a single 
 servant has done and yet she has time to spare as if she wished to go 
 to church she wears a bow on her cap a black bow that signifies 
 mourning but she has no one to mourn neither father nor mother 
 neither relations nor sweetheart she is a poor girl one day she 
 was engaged to a poor fellow they loved each other dearly 
 one day he came to her and said 
 
 we both have nothing the rich widow over the way in the basement 
 has made advances to me she will make me rich but you are in my 
 heart what do you advise me to do 
 
 i advise you to do what you think will turn out to your 
 happiness said the girl be kind and good to her but remember 
 this from the hour we part we shall never see each other again 
 years passed then one day she met the old friend and sweetheart 
 in the street he looked ill and miserable and she could not help 
 asking him how are you 
 
 rich and prospering in every respect he said the woman is 
 brave and good but you are in my heart i have fought the battle 
 it will soon be ended we shall not see each other again now until 
 we meet before god 
 
 a week has passed this morning his death was in the newspaper 
 that is the reason of the mourning her old sweetheart is 
 dead and has left a wife and three as the paper says 
 it sounds as if there is a crack but the metal is pure 
 the black bow signifies mourning the face points to the 
 same in a still higher degree it is preserved in the heart and will 
 never be forgotten delaying is not forgetting

 which explains how javert got on the scent 
 the events of which we have just beheld the reverse side so to speak had come about in the simplest possible manner 
 when jean valjean on the evening of the very day when javert had arrested him beside had escaped from the town jail of m sur m the police had supposed that he had betaken himself to paris 
 paris is a maelstrom where everything is lost and everything disappears in this belly of the world as in the belly of the sea 
 no forest hides a man as does that crowd fugitives of every sort know this 
 they go to paris as to an abyss there are gulfs which save 
 the police know it also and it is in paris that they seek what they have lost elsewhere they sought the of m sur m javert was summoned to paris to throw light on their researches 
 javert had in fact rendered powerful assistance in the recapture of jean valjean zeal and intelligence on that occasion had been remarked by m chabouillet secretary of the prefecture under comte angles m chabouillet who had moreover already been patron had the inspector of m sur m attached to the police force of paris there javert rendered himself useful in divers and though the word may seem strange for such services honorable manners 
 he no longer thought of jean wolf of causes these dogs who are always on the chase to forget the wolf of in december he read a newspaper he who never read newspapers but javert a monarchical man had a desire to know the particulars of the triumphal entry of the prince generalissimo into bayonne just as he was finishing the article which interested him a name the name of jean valjean attracted his attention at the bottom of a page 
 the paper announced that the convict jean valjean was dead and published the fact in such formal terms that javert did not doubt it 
 he confined himself to the remark a good entry then he threw aside the paper and thought no more about it 
 some time afterwards it chanced that a police report was transmitted from the prefecture of the to the prefecture of police in paris concerning the abduction of a child which had taken place under peculiar circumstances as it was said in the commune of montfermeil 
 a little girl of seven or eight years of age the report said who had been intrusted by her mother to an of that neighborhood had been stolen by a stranger this child answered to the name of cosette and was the daughter of a girl named fantine who had died in the hospital it was not known where or when 
 this report came under eye and set him to thinking 
 the name of fantine was well known to him 
 he remembered that jean valjean had made him javert burst into laughter by asking him for a respite of three days for the purpose of going to fetch that child 
 he recalled the fact that jean valjean had been arrested in paris at the very moment when he was stepping into the coach for montfermeil 
 some signs had made him suspect at the time that this was the second occasion of his entering that coach and that he had already on the previous day made an excursion to the neighborhood of that village for he had not been seen in the village itself what had he been intending to do in that region of montfermeil it could not even be surmised 
 javert understood it now daughter was there 
 jean valjean was going there in search of her 
 and now this child had been stolen by a stranger who could that stranger be 
 could it be jean valjean 
 but jean valjean was dead 
 javert without saying anything to anybody took the coach from the pewter platter de la planchette and made a trip to montfermeil 
 he expected to find a great deal of light on the subject there he found a great deal of obscurity 
 for the first few days the thenardiers had chattered in their rage the disappearance of the lark had created a sensation in the village he immediately obtained numerous versions of the story which ended in the abduction of a child 
 hence the police report 
 but their first vexation having passed off thenardier with his wonderful instinct had very quickly comprehended that it is never advisable to stir up the prosecutor of the crown and that his complaints with regard to the abduction of cosette would have as their first result to fix upon himself and upon many dark affairs which he had on hand the glittering eye of justice 
 the last thing that owls desire is to have a candle brought to them 
 and in the first place how explain the fifteen hundred francs which he had received he turned squarely round put a gag on his mouth and feigned astonishment when the stolen child was mentioned to him he understood nothing about it no doubt he had grumbled for awhile at having that dear little creature taken from him so hastily he should have liked to keep her two or three days longer out of tenderness but her grandfather had come for her in the most natural way in the world 
 he added the grandfather which produced a good effect 
 this was the story that javert hit upon when he arrived at montfermeil 
 the grandfather caused jean valjean to vanish 
 nevertheless javert dropped a few questions like plummets into history 
 who was that grandfather and what was his name 
 thenardier replied with simplicity 
 he is a wealthy farmer i saw his passport 
 i think his name was m guillaume lambert 
 lambert is a respectable and extremely reassuring name thereupon javert returned to paris 
 jean valjean is certainly dead said he and i am a ninny 
 he had again begun to forget this history when in the course of march he heard of a singular personage who dwelt in the parish of and who had been surnamed the mendicant who gives alms 
 this person the story ran was a man of means whose name no one knew exactly and who lived alone with a little girl of eight years who knew nothing about herself save that she had come from montfermeil 
 montfermeil that name was always coming up and it made javert prick up his ears 
 an old beggar police spy an to whom this person had given alms added a few more details 
 this gentleman of property was very shy never coming out except in the evening speaking to no one except occasionally to the poor and never allowing any one to approach him he wore a horrible old yellow which was worth many millions being all wadded with this piqued curiosity in a decided manner 
 in order to get a close look at this fantastic gentleman without alarming him he borrowed the outfit for a day and the place where the old spy was in the habit of crouching every evening whining orisons through his nose and playing the spy under cover of prayer 
 the suspected individual did indeed approach javert thus disguised and bestow alms on him 
 at that moment javert raised his head and the shock which jean valjean received on recognizing javert was equal to the one received by javert when he thought he recognized jean valjean 
 however the darkness might have misled him jean death was official javert cherished very grave doubts and when in doubt javert the man of scruples never laid a finger on any collar 
 he followed his man to the gorbeau house and got the old woman to talking which was no difficult matter 
 the old woman confirmed the fact regarding the coat lined with millions and narrated to him the episode of the bill 
 she had seen it she had handled it 
 javert hired a room that evening he installed himself in it 
 he came and listened at the mysterious door hoping to catch the sound of his voice but jean valjean saw his candle through the and foiled the spy by keeping silent 
 on the following day jean valjean decamped but the noise made by the fall of the piece was noticed by the old woman who hearing the rattling of coin suspected that he might be intending to leave and made haste to warn javert 
 at night when jean valjean came out javert was waiting for him behind the trees of the boulevard with two men 
 javert had demanded assistance at the prefecture but he had not mentioned the name of the individual whom he hoped to seize that was his secret and he had kept it for three reasons in the first place because the slightest indiscretion might put jean valjean on the alert next because to lay hands on an who had made his escape and was reputed dead on a criminal whom justice had formerly classed forever as among malefactors of the most dangerous sort was a magnificent success which the old members of the parisian police would assuredly not leave to a like javert and he was afraid of being deprived of his convict and lastly because javert being an artist had a taste for the unforeseen 
 he hated those successes which are talked of long in advance and have had the bloom brushed off he preferred to elaborate his masterpieces in the dark and to unveil them suddenly at the last 
 javert had followed jean valjean from tree to tree then from corner to corner of the street and had not lost sight of him for a single instant even at the moments when jean valjean believed himself to be the most secure eye had been on him why had not javert arrested jean valjean 
 because he was still in doubt 
 it must be remembered that at that epoch the police was not precisely at its ease the free press embarrassed it several arbitrary arrests denounced by the newspapers had echoed even as far as the chambers and had rendered the prefecture timid 
 interference with individual liberty was a grave matter 
 the police agents were afraid of making a mistake the prefect laid the blame on them a mistake meant dismissal the reader can imagine the effect which this brief paragraph reproduced by twenty newspapers would have caused in paris yesterday an aged grandfather with white hair a respectable and gentleman who was walking with his grandchild aged eight was arrested and conducted to the agency of the prefecture as an escaped convict 
 let us repeat in addition that javert had scruples of his own injunctions of his conscience were added to the injunctions of the prefect 
 he was really in doubt 
 jean valjean turned his back on him and walked in the dark 
 sadness uneasiness anxiety depression this fresh misfortune of being forced to flee by night to seek a chance refuge in paris for cosette and himself the necessity of regulating his pace to the pace of the this without his being aware of it had altered jean walk and impressed on his bearing such senility that the police themselves incarnate in the person of javert might and did in fact make a mistake 
 the impossibility of approaching too close his costume of an emigre preceptor the declaration of thenardier which made a grandfather of him and finally the belief in his death in prison added still further to the uncertainty which gathered thick in mind 
 for an instant it occurred to him to make an abrupt demand for his papers but if the man was not jean valjean and if this man was not a good honest old fellow living on his income he was probably some merry blade deeply and cunningly implicated in the obscure web of parisian misdeeds some chief of a dangerous band who gave alms to conceal his other talents which was an old dodge he had trusty fellows accomplices retreats in case of emergencies in which he would no doubt take refuge 
 all these turns which he was making through the streets seemed to indicate that he was not a simple and honest man 
 to arrest him too hastily would be to kill the hen that laid the golden eggs 
 where was the inconvenience in waiting 
 javert was very sure that he would not escape 
 thus he proceeded in a tolerably perplexed state of mind putting to himself a hundred questions about this enigmatical personage 
 it was only quite late in the rue de pontoise that thanks to the brilliant light thrown from a he decidedly recognized jean valjean 
 there are in this world two beings who give a profound start the mother who recovers her child and the tiger who recovers his prey javert gave that profound start 
 as soon as he had positively recognized jean valjean the formidable convict he perceived that there were only three of them and he asked for reinforcements at the police station of the rue de pontoise one puts on gloves before grasping a thorn cudgel 
 this delay and the halt at the carrefour rollin to consult with his agents came near causing him to lose the trail he speedily divined however that jean valjean would want to put the river between his pursuers and himself 
 he bent his head and reflected like a who puts his nose to the ground to make sure that he is on the right scent 
 javert with his powerful rectitude of instinct went straight to the bridge of austerlitz a word with the furnished him with the information which he required 
 have you seen a man with a little girl i made him pay two sous replied the javert reached the bridge in season to see jean valjean traverse the small illuminated spot on the other side of the water leading cosette by the hand he saw him enter the rue du he remembered the genrot arranged there like a trap and of the sole exit of the rue into the rue he made sure of his back burrows as huntsmen say he hastily despatched one of his agents by a roundabout way to guard that issue a patrol which was returning to the arsenal post having passed him he made a requisition on it and caused it to accompany him in such games soldiers are aces 
 moreover the principle is that in order to get the best of a wild boar one must employ the science of venery and plenty of dogs 
 these combinations having been effected feeling that jean valjean was caught between the blind alley genrot on the right his agent on the left and himself javert in the rear he took a pinch of snuff 
 then he began the game 
 he experienced one ecstatic and infernal moment he allowed his man to go on ahead knowing that he had him safe but desirous of postponing the moment of arrest as long as possible happy at the thought that he was taken and yet at seeing him free gloating over him with his gaze with that voluptuousness of the spider which allows the fly to flutter and of the cat which lets the mouse run 
 claws and talons possess a monstrous sensuality the obscure movements of the creature imprisoned in their pincers what a delight this strangling is 
 javert was enjoying himself 
 the meshes of his net were stoutly knotted he was sure of success all he had to do now was to close his hand 
 accompanied as he was the very idea of resistance was impossible however vigorous energetic and desperate jean valjean might be 
 javert advanced slowly sounding searching on his way all the nooks of the street like so many pockets of thieves 
 when he reached the centre of the web he found the fly no longer there 
 his exasperation can be imagined 
 he interrogated his sentinel of the rues and that agent who had remained imperturbably at his post had not seen the man pass 
 it sometimes happens that a stag is lost head and horns that is to say he escapes although he has the pack on his very heels and then the oldest huntsmen know not what to say duvivier ligniville and desprez halt short 
 in a discomfiture of this sort artonge exclaims it was not a stag but a sorcerer javert would have liked to utter the same cry 
 his disappointment bordered for a moment on despair and rage 
 it is certain that napoleon made mistakes during the war with russia that alexander committed blunders in the war in india that caesar made mistakes in the war in africa that cyrus was at fault in the war in scythia and that javert blundered in this campaign against jean valjean 
 he was wrong perhaps in hesitating in his recognition of the exconvict 
 the first glance should have sufficed him he was wrong in not arresting him purely and simply in the old building he was wrong in not arresting him when he positively recognized him in the rue de pontoise 
 he was wrong in taking counsel with his auxiliaries in the full light of the moon in the carrefour rollin advice is certainly useful it is a good thing to know and to interrogate those of the dogs who deserve confidence but the hunter cannot be too cautious when he is chasing uneasy animals like the wolf and the convict 
 javert by taking too much thought as to how he should set the bloodhounds of the pack on the trail alarmed the beast by giving him wind of the dart and so made him run above all he was wrong in that after he had picked up the scent again on the bridge of austerlitz he played that formidable and puerile game of keeping such a man at the end of a thread he thought himself stronger than he was and believed that he could play at the game of the mouse and the lion 
 at the same time he reckoned himself as too weak when he judged it necessary to obtain reinforcement 
 fatal precaution waste of precious time javert committed all these blunders and none the less was one of the cleverest and most correct spies that ever existed 
 he was in the full force of the term what is called in venery a knowing dog but what is there that is perfect 
 great strategists have their eclipses 
 the greatest follies are often composed like the largest ropes of a multitude of strands 
 take the cable thread by thread take all the petty determining motives separately and you can break them one after the other and you say that is all there is of it braid them twist them together the result is enormous 
 it is attila hesitating between marcian on the east and valentinian on the west it is hannibal tarrying at capua it is danton falling asleep at 
 however that may be even at the moment when he saw that jean valjean had escaped him javert did not lose his head sure that the convict who had broken his ban could not be far off he established sentinels he organized traps and ambuscades and beat the quarter all that night 
 the first thing he saw was the disorder in the street lantern whose rope had been cut a precious sign which however led him astray since it caused him to turn all his researches in the direction of the genrot in this blind alley there were tolerably low walls which abutted on gardens whose bounds adjoined the immense stretches of waste land jean valjean evidently must have fled in that direction 
 the fact is that had he penetrated a little further in the genrot he would probably have done so and have been lost 
 javert explored these gardens and these waste stretches as though he had been hunting for a needle 
 at daybreak he left two intelligent men on the outlook and returned to the prefecture of police as much ashamed as a police spy who had been captured by a robber might have been

 thus he proceeded in a tolerably perplexed state of mind putting to himself a hundred questions about this enigmatical personage 
 it was only quite late in the rue de pontoise that thanks to the brilliant light thrown from a he decidedly recognized jean valjean 
 there are in this world two beings who give a profound start the mother who recovers her child and the tiger who recovers his prey javert gave that profound start 
 as soon as he had positively recognized jean valjean the formidable convict he perceived that there were only three of them and he asked for reinforcements at the police station of the rue de pontoise one puts on gloves before grasping a thorn cudgel 
 this delay and the halt at the carrefour rollin to consult with his agents came near causing him to lose the trail he speedily divined however that jean valjean would want to put the river between his pursuers and himself 
 he bent his head and reflected like a who puts his nose to the ground to make sure that he is on the right scent 
 javert with his powerful rectitude of instinct went straight to the bridge of austerlitz a word with the furnished him with the information which he required 
 have you seen a man with a little girl i made him pay two sous replied the javert reached the bridge in season to see jean valjean traverse the small illuminated spot on the other side of the water leading cosette by the hand he saw him enter the rue du he remembered the genrot arranged there like a trap and of the sole exit of the rue into the rue he made sure of his back burrows as huntsmen say he hastily despatched one of his agents by a roundabout way to guard that issue a patrol which was returning to the arsenal post having passed him he made a requisition on it and caused it to accompany him in such games soldiers are aces 
 moreover the principle is that in order to get the best of a wild boar one must employ the science of venery and plenty of dogs 
 these combinations having been effected feeling that jean valjean was caught between the blind alley genrot on the right his agent on the left and himself javert in the rear he took a pinch of snuff 
 then he began the game 
 he experienced one ecstatic and infernal moment he allowed his man to go on ahead knowing that he had him safe but desirous of postponing the moment of arrest as long as possible happy at the thought that he was taken and yet at seeing him free gloating over him with his gaze with that voluptuousness of the spider which allows the fly to flutter and of the cat which lets the mouse run 
 claws and talons possess a monstrous sensuality the obscure movements of the creature imprisoned in their pincers what a delight this strangling is 
 javert was enjoying himself 
 the meshes of his net were stoutly knotted he was sure of success all he had to do now was to close his hand 
 accompanied as he was the very idea of resistance was impossible however vigorous energetic and desperate jean valjean might be 
 javert advanced slowly sounding searching on his way all the nooks of the street like so many pockets of thieves 
 when he reached the centre of the web he found the fly no longer there 
 his exasperation can be imagined 
 he interrogated his sentinel of the rues and that agent who had remained imperturbably at his post had not seen the man pass 
 it sometimes happens that a stag is lost head and horns that is to say he escapes although he has the pack on his very heels and then the oldest huntsmen know not what to say duvivier ligniville and desprez halt short 
 in a discomfiture of this sort artonge exclaims it was not a stag but a sorcerer javert would have liked to utter the same cry 
 his disappointment bordered for a moment on despair and rage 
 it is certain that napoleon made mistakes during the war with russia that alexander committed blunders in the war in india that caesar made mistakes in the war in africa that cyrus was at fault in the war in scythia and that javert blundered in this campaign against jean valjean 
 he was wrong perhaps in hesitating in his recognition of the exconvict 
 the first glance should have sufficed him he was wrong in not arresting him purely and simply in the old building he was wrong in not arresting him when he positively recognized him in the rue de pontoise 
 he was wrong in taking counsel with his auxiliaries in the full light of the moon in the carrefour rollin advice is certainly useful it is a good thing to know and to interrogate those of the dogs who deserve confidence but the hunter cannot be too cautious when he is chasing uneasy animals like the wolf and the convict 
 javert by taking too much thought as to how he should set the bloodhounds of the pack on the trail alarmed the beast by giving him wind of the dart and so made him run above all he was wrong in that after he had picked up the scent again on the bridge of austerlitz he played that formidable and puerile game of keeping such a man at the end of a thread he thought himself stronger than he was and believed that he could play at the game of the mouse and the lion 
 at the same time he reckoned himself as too weak when he judged it necessary to obtain reinforcement 
 fatal precaution waste of precious time javert committed all these blunders and none the less was one of the cleverest and most correct spies that ever existed 
 he was in the full force of the term what is called in venery a knowing dog but what is there that is perfect 
 great strategists have their eclipses 
 the greatest follies are often composed like the largest ropes of a multitude of strands 
 take the cable thread by thread take all the petty determining motives separately and you can break them one after the other and you say that is all there is of it braid them twist them together the result is enormous 
 it is attila hesitating between marcian on the east and valentinian on the west it is hannibal tarrying at capua it is danton falling asleep at 
 however that may be even at the moment when he saw that jean valjean had escaped him javert did not lose his head sure that the convict who had broken his ban could not be far off he established sentinels he organized traps and ambuscades and beat the quarter all that night 
 the first thing he saw was the disorder in the street lantern whose rope had been cut a precious sign which however led him astray since it caused him to turn all his researches in the direction of the genrot in this blind alley there were tolerably low walls which abutted on gardens whose bounds adjoined the immense stretches of waste land jean valjean evidently must have fled in that direction 
 the fact is that had he penetrated a little further in the genrot he would probably have done so and have been lost 
 javert explored these gardens and these waste stretches as though he had been hunting for a needle 
 at daybreak he left two intelligent men on the outlook and returned to the prefecture of police as much ashamed as a police spy who had been captured by a robber might have been

 number rue 
 nothing half a century ago more resembled every other carriage gate than the carriage gate of number rue this entrance which usually stood ajar in the most inviting fashion permitted a view of two things neither of which have anything very funereal about courtyard surrounded by walls hung with vines and the face of a lounging porter 
 above the wall at the bottom of the court tall trees were visible 
 when a ray of sunlight enlivened the courtyard when a glass of wine cheered up the porter it was difficult to pass number little picpus street without carrying away a smiling impression of it 
 nevertheless it was a sombre place of which one had had a glimpse 
 the threshold smiled the house prayed and wept 
 if one succeeded in passing the porter which was not easy which was even nearly impossible for every one for there was an open sesame which it was necessary to the porter once passed one entered a little vestibule on the right on which opened a staircase shut in between two walls and so narrow that only one person could ascend it at a time if one did not allow self to be alarmed by a daubing of canary yellow with a dado of chocolate which clothed this staircase if one ventured to ascend it one crossed a first landing then a second and arrived on the first story at a corridor where the yellow wash and the plinth pursued one with a peaceable persistency staircase and corridor were lighted by two beautiful windows the corridor took a turn and became dark 
 if one doubled this cape one arrived a few paces further on in front of a door which was all the more mysterious because it was not fastened 
 if one opened it one found self in a little chamber about six feet square tiled clean cold and hung with nankin paper with green flowers at fifteen sous the roll 
 a white dull light fell from a large window with tiny panes on the left which usurped the whole width of the room 
 one gazed about but saw no one one listened one heard neither a footstep nor a human murmur the walls were bare the chamber was not furnished there was not even a chair 
 one looked again and beheld on the wall facing the door a quadrangular hole about a foot square with a grating of interlacing iron bars black knotted solid which formed squares i had almost said less than an inch and a half in diagonal length 
 the little green flowers of the nankin paper ran in a calm and orderly manner to those iron bars without being startled or thrown into confusion by their funereal contact supposing that a living being had been so wonderfully thin as to essay an entrance or an exit through the square hole this grating would have prevented it 
 it did not allow the passage of the body but it did allow the passage of the eyes that is to say of the mind this seems to have occurred to them for it had been by a sheet of tin inserted in the wall a little in the rear and pierced with a thousand holes more microscopic than the holes of a strainer 
 at the bottom of this plate an aperture had been pierced exactly similar to the orifice of a letter box 
 a bit of tape attached to a hung at the right of the grated opening 
 if the tape was pulled a bell rang and one heard a voice very near at hand which made one start 
 who is there the voice demanded 
 it was a voice a gentle voice so gentle that it was mournful 
 here again there was a magical word which it was necessary to know if one did not know it the voice ceased the wall became silent once more as though the terrified obscurity of the sepulchre had been on the other side of it 
 if one knew the password the voice resumed enter on the right 
 one then perceived on the right facing the window a glass door surmounted by a frame glazed and painted gray 
 on raising the latch and crossing the threshold one experienced precisely the same impression as when one enters at the theatre into a grated baignoire before the grating is lowered and the chandelier is lighted one was in fact in a sort of narrow furnished with two old chairs and a straw matting sparely illuminated by the vague light from the glass door a regular box with its front just of a height to lean upon bearing a tablet of black wood this box was grated only the grating of it was not of gilded wood as at the opera it was a monstrous lattice of iron bars hideously interlaced and riveted to the wall by enormous fastenings which resembled clenched fists 
 the first minutes passed when eyes began to grow used to this one tried to pass the grating but got no further than six inches beyond it 
 there he encountered a barrier of black shutters and fortified with transverse beams of wood painted a gingerbread yellow 
 these shutters were divided into long narrow slats and they masked the entire length of the grating they were always closed 
 at the expiration of a few moments one heard a voice proceeding from behind these shutters and saying 
 i am here 
 what do you wish with me 
 it was a beloved sometimes an adored voice 
 no one was visible hardly the sound of a breath was audible 
 it seemed as though it were a spirit which had been evoked that was speaking to you across the walls of the tomb 
 if one chanced to be within certain prescribed and very rare conditions the slat of one of the shutters opened opposite you the evoked spirit became an apparition 
 behind the grating behind the shutter one perceived so far as the grating permitted sight a head of which only the mouth and the chin were visible the rest was covered with a black veil 
 one caught a glimpse of a black guimpe and a form that was barely defined covered with a black shroud that head spoke with you but did not look at you and never smiled at you 
 the light which came from behind you was adjusted in such a manner that you saw her in the white and she saw you in the black this light was symbolical 
 nevertheless your eyes plunged eagerly through that opening which was made in that place shut off from all glances 
 a profound vagueness enveloped that form clad in mourning 
 your eyes searched that vagueness and sought to make out the surroundings of the apparition at the expiration of a very short time you discovered that you could see nothing 
 what you beheld was night emptiness shadows a wintry mist mingled with a vapor from the tomb a sort of terrible peace a silence from which you could gather nothing not even sighs a gloom in which you could distinguish nothing not even phantoms 
 what you beheld was the interior of a cloister 
 it was the interior of that severe and gloomy edifice which was called the convent of the bernardines of the perpetual adoration the box in which you stood was the parlor 
 the first voice which had addressed you was that of the portress who always sat motionless and silent on the other side of the wall near the square opening screened by the iron grating and the plate with its thousand holes as by a double visor 
 the obscurity which bathed the grated box arose from the fact that the parlor which had a window on the side of the world had none on the side of the convent 
 profane eyes must see nothing of that sacred place 
 nevertheless there was something beyond that shadow there was a light there was life in the midst of that death 
 although this was the most strictly walled of all convents we shall endeavor to make our way into it and to take the reader in and to say without transgressing the proper bounds things which have never seen and have therefore never described

 natasha had not had a moment free since early morning and had not once had time to think of what lay before her 
 in the damp chill air and crowded closeness of the swaying carriage she for the first time vividly imagined what was in store for her there at the ball in those brightly lighted rooms with music flowers dances the emperor and all the brilliant young people of petersburg the prospect was so splendid that she hardly believed it would come true so out of keeping was it with the chill darkness and closeness of the carriage she understood all that awaited her only when after stepping over the red baize at the entrance she entered the hall took off her fur cloak and beside sonya and in front of her mother mounted the brightly illuminated stairs between the flowers only then did she remember how she must behave at a ball and tried to assume the majestic air she considered indispensable for a girl on such an occasion but fortunately for her she felt her eyes growing misty she saw nothing clearly her pulse beat a hundred to the minute and the blood throbbed at her heart she could not assume that pose which would have made her ridiculous and she moved on almost fainting from excitement and trying with all her might to conceal it and this was the very attitude that became her best before and behind them other visitors were entering also talking in low tones and wearing ball dresses the mirrors on the landing reflected ladies in white and pink dresses with diamonds and pearls on their bare necks and arms 
 natasha looked in the mirrors and could not distinguish her reflection from the others all was blended into one brilliant procession on entering the ballroom the regular hum of voices footsteps and greetings deafened natasha and the light and glitter dazzled her still more the host and hostess who had already been standing at the door for half an hour repeating the same words to the various arrivals charme de vous voir greeted the rostovs and peronskaya in the same manner 
 delighted to see you 
 the two girls in their white dresses each with a rose in her black hair both curtsied in the same way but the hostess eye involuntarily rested longer on the slim natasha she looked at her and gave her alone a special smile in addition to her usual smile as hostess looking at her she may have recalled the golden irrecoverable days of her own girlhood and her own first ball the host also followed natasha with his eyes and asked the count which was his daughter 
 charming said he kissing the tips of his fingers 
 in the ballroom guests stood crowding at the entrance doors awaiting the emperor the countess took up a position in one of the front rows of that crowd natasha heard and felt that several people were asking about her and looking at her she realized that those noticing her liked her and this observation helped to calm her 
 there are some like ourselves and some worse she thought 
 peronskaya was pointing out to the countess the most important people at the ball 
 that is the dutch ambassador do you see that man she said indicating an old man with a profusion of curly hair who was surrounded by ladies laughing at something he said 
 ah here she is the queen of petersburg countess bezukhova said peronskaya indicating helene who had just entered how lovely she is quite equal to marya antonovna see how the men young and old pay court to her beautiful and clever they say prince is quite mad about her but see those two though not are even more run after 
 she pointed to a lady who was crossing the room followed by a very plain daughter 
 she is a splendid match a millionairess said peronskaya and look here come her suitors 
 that is brother anatole kuragin she said indicating a handsome officer of the horse guards who passed by them with head erect looking at something over the heads of the ladies handsome he i hear they will marry him to that rich girl but your cousin drubetskoy is also very attentive to her they say she has millions oh yes the french ambassador himself she replied to the countess inquiry about caulaincourt looks as if he were a king all the same the french are charming very charming no one more charming in society ah here she is yes she is still the most beautiful of them all our marya antonovna and how simply she is dressed lovely and that stout one in spectacles is the universal freemason she went on indicating pierre put him beside his wife and he looks a regular buffoon 
 pierre swaying his stout body advanced making way through the crowd and nodding to right and left as casually and as if he were passing through a crowd at a fair he pushed through evidently looking for someone 
 natasha looked joyfully at the familiar face of pierre the buffoon as peronskaya had called him and knew he was looking for them and for her in particular he had promised to be at the ball and introduce partners to her 
 but before he reached them pierre stopped beside a very handsome dark man of middle height and in a white uniform who stood by a window talking to a tall man wearing stars and a ribbon natasha at once recognized the shorter and younger man in the white uniform it was bolkonski who seemed to her to have grown much younger happier and 
 someone else we know bolkonski do you see mamma said natasha pointing out prince andrew you remember he stayed a night with us at otradnoe 
 oh you know him said peronskaya i bear him il fait a present la pluie et le beau temps too proud for anything takes after his father and hand in glove with speranski writing some project or other just look how he treats the ladies one talking to him and he has turned away she said pointing at him give it to him if he treated me as he does those ladies 
 he is all the rage just now

 chapter ii 
 
 the obedience of martin verga 
 this convent which in had already existed for many a long year in the rue was a community of bernardines of the obedience of martin verga 
 these bernardines were attached in consequence not to clairvaux like the bernardine monks but to citeaux like the benedictine monks in other words they were the subjects not of saint bernard but of saint benoit 
 any one who has turned over old folios to any extent knows that martin verga founded in a congregation of with salamanca for the head of the order and alcala as the branch establishment 
 this congregation had sent out branches throughout all the catholic countries of europe 
 there is nothing unusual in the latin church in these grafts of one order on another 
 to mention only a single order of which is here in question 
 there are attached to this order without counting the obedience of martin verga four congregations two in italy and of padua two in france cluny and and nine granmont the celestins the camaldules the carthusians the humilies the olivateurs the silvestrins and lastly citeaux for citeaux itself a trunk for other orders is only an offshoot of citeaux dates from saint robert abbe de molesme in the diocese of langres in 
 now it was in that the devil having retired to the desert of was he turned hermit was chased from the ancient temple of apollo where he dwelt by then aged seventeen 
 after the rule of the carmelites who go barefoot wear a bit of willow on their throats and never sit down the harshest rule is that of the of martin verga they are clothed in black with a guimpe which in accordance with the express command of mounts to the chin a robe of serge with large sleeves a large woollen veil the guimpe which mounts to the chin cut square on the breast the band which descends over their brow to their is their dress all is black except the band which is white 
 the novices wear the same habit but all in white 
 the professed nuns also wear a rosary at their side 
 the of martin verga practise the perpetual adoration like the benedictines called ladies of the holy sacrament who at the beginning of this century had two houses in paris one at the temple the other in the rue however the of the of whom we are speaking were a totally different order from the ladies of the holy sacrament cloistered in the rue and at the temple there were numerous differences in their rule there were some in their costume 
 the of the wore the black guimpe and the benedictines of the holy sacrament and of the rue wore a white one and had besides on their breasts a holy sacrament about three inches long in silver gilt or gilded copper 
 the nuns of the did not wear this holy sacrament 
 the perpetual adoration which was common to the house of the and to the house of the temple leaves those two orders perfectly distinct 
 their only resemblance lies in this practice of the ladies of the holy sacrament and the bernardines of martin verga just as there existed a similarity in the study and the glorification of all the mysteries relating to the infancy the life and death of jesus christ and the virgin between the two orders which were nevertheless widely separated and on occasion even hostile 
 the oratory of italy established at florence by philip de neri and the oratory of france established by pierre de berulle 
 the oratory of france claimed the precedence since philip de neri was only a saint while berulle was a cardinal 
 let us return to the harsh spanish rule of martin verga 
 the of this obedience fast all the year round abstain from meat fast in lent and on many other days which are peculiar to them rise from their first sleep from one to three in the morning to read their breviary and chant matins sleep in all seasons between serge sheets and on straw make no use of the bath never light a fire scourge themselves every friday observe the rule of silence speak to each other only during the recreation hours which are very brief and wear drugget chemises for six months in the year from september th which is the exaltation of the holy cross until easter these six months are a modification 
 the rule says all the year but this drugget chemise intolerable in the heat of summer produced fevers and nervous spasms 
 the use of it had to be restricted even with this palliation when the nuns put on this chemise on the th of september they suffer from fever for three or four days obedience poverty chastity perseverance in their seclusion these are their vows which the rule greatly aggravates 
 the prioress is elected for three years by the mothers who are called meres vocales because they have a voice in the chapter a prioress can only be twice which fixes the longest possible reign of a prioress at nine years 
 they never see the officiating priest who is always hidden from them by a serge curtain nine feet in height 
 during the sermon when the preacher is in the chapel they drop their veils over their faces they must always speak low walk with their eyes on the ground and their heads bowed 
 one man only is allowed to enter the convent the archbishop of the diocese 
 there is really one gardener 
 but he is always an old man and in order that he may always be alone in the garden and that the nuns may be warned to avoid him a bell is attached to his knee 
 their submission to the prioress is absolute and passive it is the canonical subjection in the full force of its abnegation as at the voice of christ ut voci christi at a gesture at the first sign ad nutum ad primum signum immediately with cheerfulness with perseverance with a certain blind obedience prompte hilariter perseveranter et caeca quadam obedientia as the file in the hand of the workman quasi limam in manibus fabri without power to read or to write without express permission legere vel scribere non addiscerit sine expressa superioris licentia 
 each one of them in turn makes what they call reparation the reparation is the prayer for all the sins for all the faults for all the dissensions for all the violations for all the iniquities for all the crimes committed on earth 
 for the space of twelve consecutive hours from four in the afternoon till four in the morning or from four in the morning until four in the afternoon the sister who is making reparation remains on her knees on the stone before the holy sacrament with hands clasped a rope around her neck 
 when her fatigue becomes unendurable she prostrates herself flat on her face against the earth with her arms outstretched in the form of a cross this is her only relief in this attitude she prays for all the guilty in the universe this is great to sublimity 
 as this act is performed in front of a post on which burns a candle it is called without distinction to make reparation or to be at the post 
 the nuns even prefer out of humility this last expression which contains an idea of torture and abasement 
 to make reparation is a function in which the whole soul is absorbed the sister at the post would not turn round were a thunderbolt to fall directly behind her 
 besides this there is always a sister kneeling before the holy sacrament 
 this station lasts an hour 
 they relieve each other like soldiers on guard 
 this is the perpetual adoration 
 the prioresses and the mothers almost always bear names stamped with peculiar solemnity recalling not the saints and martyrs but moments in the life of jesus christ 
 as mother nativity mother conception mother presentation mother passion 
 but the names of saints are not interdicted 
 when one sees them one never sees anything but their mouths 
 all their teeth are yellow 
 no ever entered that convent brushing teeth is at the top of a ladder at whose bottom is the loss of soul 
 they never say my 
 they possess nothing of their own and they must not attach themselves to anything 
 they call everything our thus 
 our veil our chaplet if they were speaking of their chemise they would say our chemise 
 sometimes they grow attached to some petty object to a book of hours a relic a medal that has been blessed 
 as soon as they become aware that they are growing attached to this object they must give it up 
 they recall the words of saint therese to whom a great lady said as she was on the point of entering her order permit me mother to send for a bible to which i am greatly attached 
 ah you are attached to something in that case do not enter our order 
 every person whatever is forbidden to shut herself up to have a place of her own a chamber 
 they live with their cells open when they meet one says blessed and adored be the most holy sacrament of the altar 
 the other responds forever 
 the same ceremony when one taps at the door 
 hardly has she touched the door when a soft voice on the other side is heard to say hastily forever 
 like all practices this becomes mechanical by force of habit and one sometimes says forever before the other has had time to say the rather long sentence praised and adored be the most holy sacrament of the altar 
 among the visitandines the one who enters says 
 ave maria and the one whose cell is entered says gratia plena 
 it is their way of saying good day which is in fact full of grace 
 at each hour of the day three supplementary strokes sound from the church bell of the convent 
 at this signal prioress vocal mothers professed nuns novices postulants interrupt what they are saying what they are doing or what they are thinking and all say in unison if it is five for instance at five and at all hours praised and adored be the most holy sacrament of the altar 
 if it is eight at eight and at all hours and so on according to the hour 
 this custom the object of which is to break the thread of thought and to lead it back constantly to god exists in many communities the formula alone varies 
 thus at the infant jesus they say at this hour and at every hour may the love of jesus kindle my heart the of martin verga cloistered fifty years ago at chant the offices to a solemn psalmody a pure gregorian chant and always with full voice during the whole course of the office 
 everywhere in the missal where an asterisk occurs they pause and say in a low voice for the office of the dead they adopt a tone so low that the voices of women can hardly descend to such a depth 
 the effect produced is striking and tragic 
 the nuns of the had made a vault under their grand altar for the burial of their community 
 the government as they say does not permit this vault to receive coffins so they leave the convent when they die 
 this is an affliction to them and causes them consternation as an infraction of the rules 
 they had obtained a mediocre consolation at to be interred at a special hour and in a special corner in the ancient vaugirard cemetery which was made of land which had formerly belonged to their community 
 on fridays the nuns hear high mass vespers and all the offices as on sunday 
 they scrupulously observe in addition all the little festivals unknown to people of the world of which the church of france was so prodigal in the olden days and of which it is still prodigal in spain and italy 
 their stations in the chapel are interminable as for the number and duration of their prayers we can convey no better idea of them than by quoting the ingenuous remark of one of them the prayers of the postulants are frightful the prayers of the novices are still worse and the prayers of the professed nuns are still worse 
 once a week the chapter assembles 
 the prioress presides the vocal mothers assist 
 each sister kneels in turn on the stones and confesses aloud in the presence of all the faults and sins which she has committed during the week 
 the vocal mothers consult after each confession and inflict the penance aloud 
 besides this confession in a loud tone for which all faults in the least serious are reserved they have for their venial offences what they call the coulpe 
 to make coulpe means to prostrate self flat on face during the office in front of the prioress until the latter who is never called anything but our mother notifies the culprit by a slight tap of her foot against the wood of her stall that she can rise the coulpe or peccavi is made for a very small broken glass a torn veil an involuntary delay of a few seconds at an office a false note in church etc this suffices and the coulpe is made the coulpe is entirely spontaneous it is the culpable person herself the word is etymologically in its place here who judges herself and inflicts it on herself 
 on festival days and sundays four mother precentors intone the offices before a large with four places 
 one day one of the mother precentors intoned a psalm beginning with ecce and instead of ecce she uttered aloud the three notes do si sol for this piece of she underwent a coulpe which lasted during the whole service what rendered the fault enormous was the fact that the chapter had laughed 
 when a nun is summoned to the parlor even were it the prioress herself she drops her veil as will be remembered so that only her mouth is visible 
 the prioress alone can hold communication with strangers the others can see only their immediate family and that very rarely if by chance an outsider presents herself to see a nun or one whom she has known and loved in the outer world a regular series of negotiations is required 
 if it is a woman the authorization may sometimes be granted the nun comes and they talk to her through the shutters which are opened only for a mother or sister it is unnecessary to say that permission is always refused to men 
 such is the rule of aggravated by martin verga 
 these nuns are not gay rosy and fresh as the daughters of other orders often are 
 they are pale and grave 
 between and three of them went mad

 one day one of the mother precentors intoned a psalm beginning with ecce and instead of ecce she uttered aloud the three notes do si sol for this piece of she underwent a coulpe which lasted during the whole service what rendered the fault enormous was the fact that the chapter had laughed 
 when a nun is summoned to the parlor even were it the prioress herself she drops her veil as will be remembered so that only her mouth is visible 
 the prioress alone can hold communication with strangers the others can see only their immediate family and that very rarely if by chance an outsider presents herself to see a nun or one whom she has known and loved in the outer world a regular series of negotiations is required 
 if it is a woman the authorization may sometimes be granted the nun comes and they talk to her through the shutters which are opened only for a mother or sister it is unnecessary to say that permission is always refused to men 
 such is the rule of aggravated by martin verga 
 these nuns are not gay rosy and fresh as the daughters of other orders often are 
 they are pale and grave 
 between and three of them went mad

 suddenly everybody stirred began talking and pressed forward and then back and between the two rows which separated the emperor entered to the sounds of music that had immediately struck up behind him walked his host and hostess he walked in rapidly bowing to right and left as if anxious to get the first moments of the reception over the band played the polonaise in vogue at that time on account of the words that had been set to it beginning alexander elisaveta all our hearts you ravish quite the emperor passed on to the drawing room the crowd made a rush for the doors and several persons with excited faces hurried there and back again then the crowd hastily retired from the door at which the emperor reappeared talking to the hostess a young man looking distraught pounced down on the ladies asking them to move aside some ladies with faces betraying complete forgetfulness of all the rules of decorum pushed forward to the detriment of their toilets the men began to choose partners and take their places for the polonaise 
 everyone moved back and the emperor came smiling out of the drawing room leading his hostess by the hand but not keeping time to the music the host followed with marya antonovna naryshkina then came ambassadors ministers and various generals whom peronskaya diligently named more than half the ladies already had partners and were taking up or preparing to take up their positions for the polonaise natasha felt that she would be left with her mother and sonya among a minority of women who crowded near the wall not having been invited to dance she stood with her slender arms hanging down her scarcely defined bosom rising and falling regularly and with bated breath and glittering frightened eyes gazed straight before her evidently prepared for the height of joy or misery she was not concerned about the emperor or any of those great people whom peronskaya was pointing out she had but one thought is it possible no one will ask me that i shall not be among the first to dance is it possible that not one of all these men will notice me they do not even seem to see me or if they do they look as if they were saying ah not the one after so not worth looking at her no impossible she thought they must know how i long to dance how splendidly i dance and how they would enjoy dancing with me 
 the strains of the polonaise which had continued for a considerable time had begun to sound like a sad reminiscence to ears she wanted to cry peronskaya had left them the count was at the other end of the room she and the countess and sonya were standing by themselves as in the depths of a forest amid that crowd of strangers with no one interested in them and not wanted by anyone prince andrew with a lady passed by evidently not recognizing them the handsome anatole was smilingly talking to a partner on his arm and looked at natasha as one looks at a wall boris passed them twice and each time turned away berg and his wife who were not dancing came up to them 
 this family gathering seemed humiliating to natasha as if there were nowhere else for the family to talk but here at the ball she did not listen to or look at vera who was telling her something about her own green dress 
 at last the emperor stopped beside his last partner he had danced with three and the music ceased a worried ran up to the rostovs requesting them to stand farther back though as it was they were already close to the wall and from the gallery resounded the distinct precise enticingly rhythmical strains of a waltz the emperor looked smilingly down the room a minute passed but no one had yet begun dancing an the master of ceremonies went up to countess bezukhova and asked her to dance she smilingly raised her hand and laid it on his shoulder without looking at him the an adept in his art grasping his partner firmly round her waist with confident deliberation started smoothly gliding first round the edge of the circle then at the corner of the room he caught left hand and turned her the only sound audible apart from the music being the rhythmic click of the spurs on his rapid agile feet while at every third beat his velvet dress spread out and seemed to flash as she whirled round natasha gazed at them and was ready to cry because it was not she who was dancing that first turn of the waltz 
 prince andrew in the white uniform of a cavalry colonel wearing stockings and dancing shoes stood looking animated and bright in the front row of the circle not far from the rostovs baron firhoff was talking to him about the first sitting of the council of state to be held next day prince andrew as one closely connected with speranski and participating in the work of the legislative commission could give reliable information about that sitting concerning which various rumors were current but not listening to what firhoff was saying he was gazing now at the sovereign and now at the men intending to dance who had not yet gathered courage to enter the circle 
 prince andrew was watching these men abashed by the presence and the women who were breathlessly longing to be asked to dance 
 pierre came up to him and caught him by the arm 
 you always dance i have a protegee the young rostova here ask her he said 
 where is she asked bolkonski excuse me he added turning to the baron we will finish this conversation elsewhere at a ball one must dance he stepped forward in the direction pierre indicated the despairing dejected expression of face caught his eye he recognized her guessed her feelings saw that it was her debut remembered her conversation at the window and with an expression of pleasure on his face approached countess rostova 
 allow me to introduce you to my daughter said the countess with heightened color 
 i have the pleasure of being already acquainted if the countess remembers me said prince andrew with a low and courteous bow quite belying remarks about his rudeness and approaching natasha he held out his arm to grasp her waist before he had completed his invitation he asked her to waltz that tremulous expression on face prepared either for despair or rapture suddenly brightened into a happy grateful childlike smile 
 i have long been waiting for you that frightened happy little girl seemed to say by the smile that replaced the threatened tears as she raised her hand to prince shoulder they were the second couple to enter the circle prince andrew was one of the best dancers of his day and natasha danced exquisitely her little feet in their white satin dancing shoes did their work swiftly lightly and independently of herself while her face beamed with ecstatic happiness her slender bare arms and neck were not beautiful compared to her shoulders looked thin and her bosom undeveloped but helene seemed as it were hardened by a varnish left by the thousands of looks that had scanned her person while natasha was like a girl exposed for the first time who would have felt very much ashamed had she not been assured that this was absolutely necessary 
 prince andrew liked dancing and wishing to escape as quickly as possible from the political and clever talk which everyone addressed to him wishing also to break up the circle of restraint he disliked caused by the presence he danced and had chosen natasha because pierre pointed her out to him and because she was the first pretty girl who caught his eye but scarcely had he embraced that slender supple figure and felt her stirring so close to him and smiling so near him than the wine of her charm rose to his head and he felt himself revived and rejuvenated when after leaving her he stood breathing deeply and watching the other dancers

 like all men who have grown up in society prince andrew liked meeting someone there not of the conventional society stamp and such was natasha with her surprise her delight her shyness and even her mistakes in speaking french with her he behaved with special care and tenderness sitting beside her and talking of the simplest and most unimportant matters he admired her shy grace in the middle of the cotillion having completed one of the figures natasha still out of breath was returning to her seat when another dancer chose her she was tired and panting and evidently thought of declining but immediately put her hand gaily on the shoulder smiling at prince andrew 
 be glad to sit beside you and rest tired but you see how they keep asking me and glad of it happy and i love everybody and you and i understand it all and much much more was said in her smile when her partner left her natasha ran across the room to choose two ladies for the figure 
 if she goes to her cousin first and then to another lady she will be my wife said prince andrew to himself quite to his own surprise as he watched her she did go first to her cousin 
 what rubbish sometimes enters head thought prince andrew but what is certain is that that girl is so charming so original that she be dancing here a month before she will be married such as she are rare here he thought as natasha readjusting a rose that was slipping on her bodice settled herself beside him 
 when the cotillion was over the old count in his blue coat came up to the dancers he invited prince andrew to come and see them and asked his daughter whether she was enjoying herself natasha did not answer at once but only looked up with a smile that said reproachfully how can you ask such a question 
 i have never enjoyed myself so much before she said and prince andrew noticed how her thin arms rose quickly as if to embrace her father and instantly dropped again natasha was happier than she had ever been in her life she was at that height of bliss when one becomes completely kind and good and does not believe in the possibility of evil unhappiness or sorrow 
 at that ball pierre for the first time felt humiliated by the position his wife occupied in court circles he was gloomy and a deep furrow ran across his forehead and standing by a window he stared over his spectacles seeing no one 
 on her way to supper natasha passed him 
 gloomy unhappy look struck her she stopped in front of him she wished to help him to bestow on him the superabundance of her own happiness 
 how delightful it is count said she it 
 pierre smiled evidently not grasping what she said 
 yes i am very glad he said 
 how can people be dissatisfied with anything thought natasha especially such a capital fellow as bezukhov in eyes all the people at the ball alike were good kind and splendid people loving one another none of them capable of injuring another and so they ought all to be happy

 gayeties 
 none the less these young girls filled this grave house with charming souvenirs 
 at certain hours childhood sparkled in that cloister 
 the recreation hour struck 
 a door swung on its hinges 
 the birds said good here come the children 
 an irruption of youth inundated that garden intersected with a cross like a shroud 
 radiant faces white foreheads innocent eyes full of merry light all sorts of auroras were scattered about amid these shadows

 there was a wolf in that country there was a great deal of forest and the wolf was in the forest and he ate the little cocks

 next day prince andrew thought of the ball but his mind did not dwell on it long yes it was a very brilliant ball and then yes that little rostova is very charming something fresh original about her that distinguishes her that was all he thought about ball and after his morning tea he set to work 
 but either from fatigue or want of sleep he was for work and could get nothing done he kept criticizing his own work as he often did and was glad when he heard someone coming 
 the visitor was bitski who served on various committees frequented all the societies in petersburg and a passionate devotee of the new ideas and of speranski and a diligent petersburg newsmonger one of those men who choose their opinions like their clothes according to the fashion but who for that very reason appear to be the warmest partisans hardly had he got rid of his hat before he ran into prince room with a preoccupied air and at once began talking he had just heard particulars of that sitting of the council of state opened by the emperor and he spoke of it enthusiastically the speech had been extraordinary it had been a speech such as only constitutional monarchs deliver the sovereign plainly said that the council and senate are estates of the realm he said that the government must rest not on authority but on secure bases the emperor said that the fiscal system must be reorganized and the accounts published recounted bitski emphasizing certain words and opening his eyes significantly 
 ah yes events mark an epoch the greatest epoch in our history he concluded 
 prince andrew listened to the account of the opening of the council of state which he had so impatiently awaited and to which he had attached such importance and was surprised that this event now that it had taken place did not affect him and even seemed quite insignificant he listened with quiet irony to enthusiastic account of it a very simple thought occurred to him what does it matter to me or to bitski what the emperor was pleased to say at the council can all that make me any happier or better 
 and this simple reflection suddenly destroyed all the interest prince andrew had felt in the impending reforms he was going to dine that evening at with only a few friends as the host had said when inviting him the prospect of that dinner in the intimate home circle of the man he so admired had greatly interested prince andrew especially as he had not yet seen speranski in his domestic surroundings but now he felt disinclined to go to it 
 at the appointed hour however he entered the modest house speranski owned in the taurida gardens in the parqueted dining room this small house remarkable for its extreme cleanliness suggesting that of a monastery prince andrew who was rather late found the friendly gathering of intimate acquaintances already assembled at five there were no ladies present except little daughter like her father and her governess the other guests were gervais magnitski and stolypin while still in the anteroom prince andrew heard loud voices and a ringing staccato laugh a laugh such as one hears on the stage someone it sounded like speranski was distinctly ejaculating prince andrew had never before heard famous laugh and this ringing high pitched laughter from a statesman made a strange impression on him 
 he entered the dining room the whole company were standing between two windows at a small table laid with speranski wearing a gray coat with a star on the breast and evidently still the same waistcoat and high white stock he had worn at the meeting of the council of state stood at the table with a beaming countenance his guests surrounded him magnitski addressing himself to speranski was relating an anecdote and speranski was laughing in advance at what magnitski was going to say when prince andrew entered the room words were again crowned by laughter stolypin gave a deep bass guffaw as he munched a piece of bread and cheese gervais laughed softly with a hissing chuckle and speranski in a staccato manner 
 still laughing speranski held out his soft white hand to prince andrew 
 very pleased to see you prince he said one moment he went on turning to magnitski and interrupting his story we have agreed that this is a dinner for recreation with not a word about business and turning again to the narrator he began to laugh afresh 
 prince andrew looked at the laughing speranski with astonishment regret and disillusionment it seemed to him that this was not speranski but someone else everything that had formerly appeared mysterious and fascinating in speranski suddenly became plain and unattractive 
 at dinner the conversation did not cease for a moment and seemed to consist of the contents of a book of funny anecdotes before magnitski had finished his story someone else was anxious to relate something still funnier most of the anecdotes if not relating to the state service related to people in the service it seemed that in this company the insignificance of those people was so definitely accepted that the only possible attitude toward them was one of good humored ridicule speranski related how at the council that morning a deaf dignitary when asked his opinion replied that he thought so too gervais gave a long account of an official revision remarkable for the stupidity of everybody concerned stolypin stuttering broke into the conversation and began excitedly talking of the abuses that existed under the former order of things threatening to give a serious turn to the conversation magnitski starting quizzing stolypin about his vehemence gervais intervened with a joke and the talk reverted to its former lively tone 
 evidently speranski liked to rest after his labors and find amusement in a circle of friends and his guests understanding his wish tried to enliven him and amuse themselves but their gaiety seemed to prince andrew mirthless and tiresome voice struck him unpleasantly and the incessant laughter grated on him like a false note prince andrew did not laugh and feared that he would be a damper on the spirits of the company but no one took any notice of his being out of harmony with the general mood they all seemed very gay 
 he tried several times to join in the conversation but his remarks were tossed aside each time like a cork thrown out of the water and he could not jest with them 
 there was nothing wrong or unseemly in what they said it was witty and might have been funny but it lacked just that something which is the salt of mirth and they were not even aware that such a thing existed 
 after dinner daughter and her governess rose he patted the little girl with his white hand and kissed her and that gesture too seemed unnatural to prince andrew 
 the men remained at table over their port english fashion in the midst of a conversation that was started about spanish affairs which they all agreed in approving prince andrew began to express a contrary opinion speranski smiled and with an evident wish to prevent the conversation from taking an unpleasant course told a story that had no connection with the previous conversation for a few moments all were silent 
 having sat some time at table speranski corked a bottle of wine and remarking nowadays good wine rides in a carriage and pair passed it to the servant and got up all rose and continuing to talk loudly went into the drawing room two letters brought by a courier were handed to speranski and he took them to his study as soon as he had left the room the general merriment stopped and the guests began to converse sensibly and quietly with one another 
 now for the recitation said speranski on returning from his study a wonderful talent he said to prince andrew and magnitski immediately assumed a pose and began reciting some humorous verses in french which he had composed about various petersburg people he was interrupted several times by applause when the verses were finished prince andrew went up to speranski and took his leave 
 where are you off to so early asked speranski 
 i promised to go to a reception 
 they said no more prince andrew looked closely into those mirrorlike impenetrable eyes and felt that it had been ridiculous of him to have expected anything from speranski and from any of his own activities connected with him or ever to have attributed importance to what speranski was doing that precise mirthless laughter rang in prince ears long after he had left the house 
 when he reached home prince andrew began thinking of his life in petersburg during those last four months as if it were something new he recalled his exertions and solicitations and the history of his project of army reform which had been accepted for consideration and which they were trying to pass over in silence simply because another a very poor one had already been prepared and submitted to the emperor he thought of the meetings of a committee of which berg was a member he remembered how carefully and at what length everything relating to form and procedure was discussed at those meetings and how sedulously and promptly all that related to the gist of the business was evaded he recalled his labors on the legal code and how painstakingly he had translated the articles of the roman and french codes into russian and he felt ashamed of himself then he vividly pictured to himself bogucharovo his occupations in the country his journey to ryazan he remembered the peasants and dron the village elder and mentally applying to them the personal rights he had divided into paragraphs he felt astonished that he could have spent so much time on such useless work

 distractions 
 above the door of the refectory this prayer which was called the white paternoster and which possessed the property of bearing people straight to paradise was inscribed in large black letters 
 little white paternoster which god made which god said which god placed in paradise 
 in the evening when i went to bed i found three angels sitting on my bed one at the foot two at the head the good virgin mary in the middle who told me to lie down without hesitation 
 the good god is my father the good virgin is my mother the three apostles are my brothers the three virgins are my sisters 
 the shirt in which god was born envelopes my body saint cross is written on my breast madame the virgin was walking through the meadows weeping for god when she met m saint john 
 monsieur saint john whence come you i come from ave salus 
 you have not seen the good god where is he he is on the tree of the cross his feet hanging his hands nailed a little cap of white thorns on his head 
 whoever shall say this thrice at eventide thrice in the morning shall win paradise at the last 
 in this characteristic orison had disappeared from the wall under a triple coating of daubing paint 
 at the present time it is finally disappearing from the memories of several who were young girls then and who are old women now 
 a large crucifix fastened to the wall completed the decoration of this refectory whose only door as we think we have mentioned opened on the garden 
 two narrow tables each flanked by two wooden benches formed two long parallel lines from one end to the other of the refectory 
 the walls were white the tables were black these two mourning colors constitute the only variety in convents 
 the meals were plain and the food of the children themselves severe 
 a single dish of meat and vegetables combined or salt was their luxury 
 this meagre fare which was reserved for the pupils alone was nevertheless an exception the children ate in silence under the eye of the mother whose turn it was who if a fly took a notion to fly or to hum against the rule opened and shut a wooden book from time to time this silence was seasoned with the lives of the saints read aloud from a little pulpit with a desk which was situated at the foot of the crucifix 
 the reader was one of the big girls in weekly turn at regular distances on the bare tables there were large varnished bowls in which the pupils washed their own silver cups and knives and forks and into which they sometimes threw some scrap of tough meat or spoiled fish this was punished 
 these bowls were called ronds the child who broke the silence made a cross with her tongue 
 where 
 on the ground 
 she licked the pavement the dust that end of all joys was charged with the chastisement of those poor little which had been guilty of chirping 
 there was in the convent a book which has never been printed except as a unique copy and which it is forbidden to read 
 it is the rule of an arcanum which no profane eye must penetrate nemo regulas seu constitutiones nostras externis communicabit 
 the pupils one day succeeded in getting possession of this book and set to reading it with avidity a reading which was often interrupted by the fear of being caught which caused them to close the volume precipitately 
 from the great danger thus incurred they derived but a very moderate amount of pleasure 
 the most interesting thing they found were some unintelligible pages about the sins of young boys 
 they played in an alley of the garden bordered with a few shabby in spite of the extreme surveillance and the severity of the punishments administered when the wind had shaken the trees they sometimes succeeded in picking up a green apple or a spoiled apricot or an inhabited pear on the sly 
 i will now cede the privilege of speech to a letter which lies before me a letter written five and twenty years ago by an old pupil now madame la duchesse de one of the most elegant women in paris 
 i quote literally one hides pear or apple as best one may when one goes up stairs to put the veil on the bed before supper one stuffs them under pillow and at night one eats them in bed and when one cannot do that one eats them in the closet that was one of their greatest luxuries 
 was at the epoch of the visit from the archbishop to the convent one of the young girls mademoiselle bouchard who was connected with the montmorency family laid a wager that she would ask for a leave of enormity in so austere a community the wager was accepted but not one of those who bet believed that she would do it 
 when the moment came as the archbishop was passing in front of the pupils mademoiselle bouchard to the indescribable terror of her companions stepped out of the ranks and said monseigneur a leave of absence 
 mademoiselle bouchard was tall blooming with the prettiest little rosy face in the world m de quelen smiled and said what my dear child a leave of absence 
 three days if you like 
 i grant you three days the prioress could do nothing the archbishop had spoken horror of the convent but joy of the pupil 
 the effect may be imagined 
 this stern cloister was not so well walled off however but that the life of the passions of the outside world drama and even romance did not make their way in 
 to prove this we will confine ourselves to recording here and to briefly mentioning a real and incontestable fact which however bears no reference in itself to and is not connected by any thread whatever with the story which we are relating 
 we mention the fact for the sake of completing the physiognomy of the convent in the mind 
 about this time there was in the convent a mysterious person who was not a nun who was treated with great respect and who was addressed as madame albertine 
 nothing was known about her save that she was mad and that in the world she passed for dead beneath this history it was said there lay the arrangements of fortune necessary for a great marriage 
 this woman hardly thirty years of age of dark complexion and tolerably pretty had a vague look in her large black eyes could she see 
 there was some doubt about this 
 she glided rather than walked she never spoke it was not quite known whether she breathed 
 her nostrils were livid and pinched as after yielding up their last sigh 
 to touch her hand was like touching snow she possessed a strange spectral grace 
 wherever she entered people felt cold 
 one day a sister on seeing her pass said to another sister she passes for a dead woman 
 perhaps she is one replied the other 
 a hundred tales were told of madame albertine 
 this arose from the eternal curiosity of the pupils 
 in the chapel there was a gallery called de boeuf 
 it was in this gallery which had only a circular bay an oeil de boeuf that madame albertine listened to the offices 
 she always occupied it alone because this gallery being on the level of the first story the preacher or the officiating priest could be seen which was interdicted to the nuns one day the pulpit was occupied by a young priest of high rank m le duc de rohan peer of france officer of the red musketeers in when he was prince de leon and who died afterward in as cardinal and archbishop of besancon 
 it was the first time that m de rohan had preached at the convent madame albertine usually preserved perfect calmness and complete immobility during the sermons and services 
 that day as soon as she caught sight of m de rohan she half rose and said in a loud voice amid the silence of the chapel ah 
 auguste 
 the whole community turned their heads in amazement the preacher raised his eyes but madame albertine had relapsed into her immobility a breath from the outer world a flash of life had passed for an instant across that cold and lifeless face and had then vanished and the mad woman had become a corpse again 
 those two words however had set every one in the convent who had the privilege of speech to chattering 
 how many things were contained in that ah 
 auguste what revelations 
 m de name really was auguste 
 it was evident that madame albertine belonged to the very highest society since she knew m de rohan and that her own rank there was of the highest since she spoke thus familiarly of so great a lord and that there existed between them some connection of relationship perhaps but a very close one in any case since she knew his pet name 
 two very severe duchesses mesdames de choiseul and de serent often visited the community whither they penetrated no doubt in virtue of the privilege magnates mulieres and caused great consternation in the when these two old ladies passed by all the poor young girls trembled and dropped their eyes 
 moreover m de rohan quite unknown to himself was an object of attention to the at that epoch he had just been made while waiting for the episcopate of the archbishop of paris 
 it was one of his habits to come tolerably often to celebrate the offices in the chapel of the nuns of the not one of the young recluses could see him because of the serge curtain but he had a sweet and rather shrill voice which they had come to know and to distinguish 
 he had been a mousquetaire and then he was said to be very coquettish that his handsome brown hair was very well dressed in a roll around his head and that he had a broad girdle of magnificent moire and that his black cassock was of the most elegant cut in the world 
 he held a great place in all these imaginations of sixteen years 
 not a sound from without made its way into the convent 
 but there was one year when the sound of a flute penetrated thither this was an event and the girls who were at school there at the time still recall it 
 it was a flute which was played in the neighborhood 
 this flute always played the same air an air which is very far away zetulbe come reign my it was heard two or three times a day 
 the young girls passed hours in listening to it the vocal mothers were upset by it brains were busy punishments descended in showers 
 this lasted for several months the girls were all more or less in love with the unknown musician each one dreamed that she was zetulbe 
 the sound of the flute proceeded from the direction of the rue and they would have given anything compromised everything attempted anything for the sake of seeing of catching a glance if only for a second of the young man who played that flute so deliciously and who no doubt played on all these souls at the same time 
 there were some who made their escape by a back door and ascended to the third story on the rue side in order to attempt to catch a glimpse through the gaps 
 impossible 
 one even went so far as to thrust her arm through the grating and to wave her white handkerchief two were still bolder 
 they found means to climb on a roof and risked their lives there and succeeded at last in seeing the young man he was an old emigre gentleman blind and penniless who was playing his flute in his attic in order to pass the time

 above the door of the refectory this prayer which was called the white paternoster and which possessed the property of bearing people straight to paradise was inscribed in large black letters 
 little white paternoster which god made which god said which god placed in paradise 
 in the evening when i went to bed i found three angels sitting on my bed one at the foot two at the head the good virgin mary in the middle who told me to lie down without hesitation 
 the good god is my father the good virgin is my mother the three apostles are my brothers the three virgins are my sisters 
 the shirt in which god was born envelopes my body saint cross is written on my breast madame the virgin was walking through the meadows weeping for god when she met m saint john 
 monsieur saint john whence come you i come from ave salus 
 you have not seen the good god where is he he is on the tree of the cross his feet hanging his hands nailed a little cap of white thorns on his head 
 whoever shall say this thrice at eventide thrice in the morning shall win paradise at the last 
 in this characteristic orison had disappeared from the wall under a triple coating of daubing paint 
 at the present time it is finally disappearing from the memories of several who were young girls then and who are old women now 
 a large crucifix fastened to the wall completed the decoration of this refectory whose only door as we think we have mentioned opened on the garden 
 two narrow tables each flanked by two wooden benches formed two long parallel lines from one end to the other of the refectory 
 the walls were white the tables were black these two mourning colors constitute the only variety in convents 
 the meals were plain and the food of the children themselves severe 
 a single dish of meat and vegetables combined or salt was their luxury 
 this meagre fare which was reserved for the pupils alone was nevertheless an exception the children ate in silence under the eye of the mother whose turn it was who if a fly took a notion to fly or to hum against the rule opened and shut a wooden book from time to time this silence was seasoned with the lives of the saints read aloud from a little pulpit with a desk which was situated at the foot of the crucifix 
 the reader was one of the big girls in weekly turn at regular distances on the bare tables there were large varnished bowls in which the pupils washed their own silver cups and knives and forks and into which they sometimes threw some scrap of tough meat or spoiled fish this was punished 
 these bowls were called ronds the child who broke the silence made a cross with her tongue 
 where 
 on the ground 
 she licked the pavement the dust that end of all joys was charged with the chastisement of those poor little which had been guilty of chirping 
 there was in the convent a book which has never been printed except as a unique copy and which it is forbidden to read 
 it is the rule of an arcanum which no profane eye must penetrate nemo regulas seu constitutiones nostras externis communicabit 
 the pupils one day succeeded in getting possession of this book and set to reading it with avidity a reading which was often interrupted by the fear of being caught which caused them to close the volume precipitately 
 from the great danger thus incurred they derived but a very moderate amount of pleasure 
 the most interesting thing they found were some unintelligible pages about the sins of young boys 
 they played in an alley of the garden bordered with a few shabby in spite of the extreme surveillance and the severity of the punishments administered when the wind had shaken the trees they sometimes succeeded in picking up a green apple or a spoiled apricot or an inhabited pear on the sly 
 i will now cede the privilege of speech to a letter which lies before me a letter written five and twenty years ago by an old pupil now madame la duchesse de one of the most elegant women in paris 
 i quote literally one hides pear or apple as best one may when one goes up stairs to put the veil on the bed before supper one stuffs them under pillow and at night one eats them in bed and when one cannot do that one eats them in the closet that was one of their greatest luxuries 
 was at the epoch of the visit from the archbishop to the convent one of the young girls mademoiselle bouchard who was connected with the montmorency family laid a wager that she would ask for a leave of enormity in so austere a community the wager was accepted but not one of those who bet believed that she would do it 
 when the moment came as the archbishop was passing in front of the pupils mademoiselle bouchard to the indescribable terror of her companions stepped out of the ranks and said monseigneur a leave of absence 
 mademoiselle bouchard was tall blooming with the prettiest little rosy face in the world m de quelen smiled and said what my dear child a leave of absence 
 three days if you like 
 i grant you three days the prioress could do nothing the archbishop had spoken horror of the convent but joy of the pupil 
 the effect may be imagined 
 this stern cloister was not so well walled off however but that the life of the passions of the outside world drama and even romance did not make their way in 
 to prove this we will confine ourselves to recording here and to briefly mentioning a real and incontestable fact which however bears no reference in itself to and is not connected by any thread whatever with the story which we are relating 
 we mention the fact for the sake of completing the physiognomy of the convent in the mind 
 about this time there was in the convent a mysterious person who was not a nun who was treated with great respect and who was addressed as madame albertine 
 nothing was known about her save that she was mad and that in the world she passed for dead beneath this history it was said there lay the arrangements of fortune necessary for a great marriage 
 this woman hardly thirty years of age of dark complexion and tolerably pretty had a vague look in her large black eyes could she see 
 there was some doubt about this 
 she glided rather than walked she never spoke it was not quite known whether she breathed 
 her nostrils were livid and pinched as after yielding up their last sigh 
 to touch her hand was like touching snow she possessed a strange spectral grace 
 wherever she entered people felt cold 
 one day a sister on seeing her pass said to another sister she passes for a dead woman 
 perhaps she is one replied the other 
 a hundred tales were told of madame albertine 
 this arose from the eternal curiosity of the pupils

 chapter xx 
 
 one morning colonel berg whom pierre knew as he knew everybody in moscow and petersburg came to see him berg arrived in an immaculate uniform with his hair pomaded and brushed forward over his temples as the emperor alexander wore his hair 
 i have just been to see the countess your wife unfortunately she could not grant my request but i hope count i shall be more fortunate with you he said with a smile 
 what is it you wish colonel i am at your service 
 i have now quite settled in my new rooms count berg said this with perfect conviction that this information could not but be agreeable and so i wish to arrange just a small party for my own and my friends he smiled still more pleasantly i wished to ask the countess and you to do me the honor of coming to tea and to supper 
 only countess helene considering the society of such people as the bergs beneath her could be cruel enough to refuse such an invitation berg explained so clearly why he wanted to collect at his house a small but select company and why this would give him pleasure and why though he grudged spending money on cards or anything harmful he was prepared to run into some expense for the sake of good society that pierre could not refuse and promised to come 
 but be late count if i may venture to ask about ten minutes to eight please we shall make up a rubber our general is coming he is very good to me we shall have supper count so you will do me the favor 
 contrary to his habit of being late pierre on that day arrived at the bergs house not at ten but at fifteen minutes to eight 
 having prepared everything necessary for the party the bergs were really for their guests arrival 
 in their new clean and light study with its small busts and pictures and new furniture sat berg and his wife berg closely buttoned up in his new uniform sat beside his wife explaining to her that one always could and should be acquainted with people above one because only then does one get satisfaction from acquaintances 
 you can get to know something you can ask for something see how i managed from my first promotion berg measured his life not by years but by promotions my comrades are still nobodies while i am only waiting for a vacancy to command a regiment and have the happiness to be your husband he rose and kissed hand and on the way to her straightened out a corner of the carpet and how have i obtained all this chiefly by knowing how to choose my aquaintances it goes without saying that one must be conscientious and methodical 
 berg smiled with a sense of his superiority over a weak woman and paused reflecting that this dear wife of his was after all but a weak woman who could not understand all that constitutes a dignity what it was ein mann zu sein vera at the same time smiling with a sense of superiority over her good conscientious husband who all the same understood life wrongly as according to vera all men did berg judging by his wife thought all women weak and foolish vera judging only by her husband and generalizing from that observation supposed that all men though they understand nothing and are conceited and selfish ascribe common sense to themselves alone 
 to be a man 
 berg rose and embraced his wife carefully so as not to crush her lace fichu for which he had paid a good price kissing her straight on the lips 
 the only thing is we have children too soon he continued following an unconscious sequence of ideas 
 yes answered vera i at all want that we must live for society

 one morning colonel berg whom pierre knew as he knew everybody in moscow and petersburg came to see him berg arrived in an immaculate uniform with his hair pomaded and brushed forward over his temples as the emperor alexander wore his hair 
 i have just been to see the countess your wife unfortunately she could not grant my request but i hope count i shall be more fortunate with you he said with a smile 
 what is it you wish colonel i am at your service 
 i have now quite settled in my new rooms count berg said this with perfect conviction that this information could not but be agreeable and so i wish to arrange just a small party for my own and my friends he smiled still more pleasantly i wished to ask the countess and you to do me the honor of coming to tea and to supper 
 only countess helene considering the society of such people as the bergs beneath her could be cruel enough to refuse such an invitation berg explained so clearly why he wanted to collect at his house a small but select company and why this would give him pleasure and why though he grudged spending money on cards or anything harmful he was prepared to run into some expense for the sake of good society that pierre could not refuse and promised to come 
 but be late count if i may venture to ask about ten minutes to eight please we shall make up a rubber our general is coming he is very good to me we shall have supper count so you will do me the favor 
 contrary to his habit of being late pierre on that day arrived at the bergs house not at ten but at fifteen minutes to eight 
 having prepared everything necessary for the party the bergs were really for their guests arrival 
 in their new clean and light study with its small busts and pictures and new furniture sat berg and his wife berg closely buttoned up in his new uniform sat beside his wife explaining to her that one always could and should be acquainted with people above one because only then does one get satisfaction from acquaintances 
 you can get to know something you can ask for something see how i managed from my first promotion berg measured his life not by years but by promotions my comrades are still nobodies while i am only waiting for a vacancy to command a regiment and have the happiness to be your husband he rose and kissed hand and on the way to her straightened out a corner of the carpet and how have i obtained all this chiefly by knowing how to choose my aquaintances it goes without saying that one must be conscientious and methodical 
 berg smiled with a sense of his superiority over a weak woman and paused reflecting that this dear wife of his was after all but a weak woman who could not understand all that constitutes a dignity what it was ein mann zu sein vera at the same time smiling with a sense of superiority over her good conscientious husband who all the same understood life wrongly as according to vera all men did berg judging by his wife thought all women weak and foolish vera judging only by her husband and generalizing from that observation supposed that all men though they understand nothing and are conceited and selfish ascribe common sense to themselves alone 
 to be a man 
 berg rose and embraced his wife carefully so as not to crush her lace fichu for which he had paid a good price kissing her straight on the lips 
 the only thing is we have children too soon he continued following an unconscious sequence of ideas 
 yes answered vera i at all want that we must live for society 
 princess yusupova wore one exactly like this said berg pointing to the fichu with a happy and kindly smile

 pierre as one of the principal guests had to sit down to boston with count rostov the general and the colonel at the card table he happened to be directly facing natasha and was struck by a curious change that had come over her since the ball she was silent and not only less pretty than at the ball but only redeemed from plainness by her look of gentle indifference to everything around 
 the matter with her thought pierre glancing at her she was sitting by her sister at the tea table and reluctantly without looking at him made some reply to boris who sat down beside her after playing out a whole suit and to his delight taking five tricks pierre hearing greetings and the steps of someone who had entered the room while he was picking up his tricks glanced again at natasha 
 what has happened to her he asked himself with still greater surprise 
 prince andrew was standing before her saying something to her with a look of tender solicitude she having raised her head was looking up at him flushed and evidently trying to master her rapid breathing and the bright glow of some inner fire that had been suppressed was again alight in her she was completely transformed and from a plain girl had again become what she had been at the ball 
 prince andrew went up to pierre and the latter noticed a new and youthful expression in his face 
 pierre changed places several times during the game sitting now with his back to natasha and now facing her but during the whole of the six rubbers he watched her and his friend 
 something very important is happening between them thought pierre and a feeling that was both joyful and painful agitated him and made him neglect the game 
 after six rubbers the general got up saying that it was no use playing like that and pierre was released natasha on one side was talking with sonya and boris and vera with a subtle smile was saying something to prince andrew pierre went up to his friend and asking whether they were talking secrets sat down beside them vera having noticed prince attentions to natasha decided that at a party a real evening party subtle allusions to the tender passion were absolutely necessary and seizing a moment when prince andrew was alone began a conversation with him about feelings in general and about her sister with so intellectual a guest as she considered prince andrew to be she felt that she had to employ her diplomatic tact 
 when pierre went up to them he noticed that vera was being carried away by her talk but that prince andrew seemed embarrassed a thing that rarely happened with him 
 what do you think vera was saying with an arch smile you are so discerning prince and understand characters so well at a glance what do you think of natalie could she be constant in her attachments could she like other women vera meant herself love a man once for all and remain true to him forever that is what i consider true love what do you think prince 
 i know your sister too little replied prince andrew with a sarcastic smile under which he wished to hide his embarrassment to be able to solve so delicate a question and then i have noticed that the less attractive a woman is the more constant she is likely to be he added and looked up pierre who was just approaching them 
 yes that is true prince in our days continued vera mentioning our days as people of limited intelligence are fond of doing imagining that they have discovered and appraised the peculiarities of our days and that human characteristics change with the times in our days a girl has so much freedom that the pleasure of being courted often stifles real feeling in her and it must be confessed that natalie is very susceptible this return to the subject of natalie caused prince andrew to knit his brows with discomfort he was about to rise but vera continued with a still more subtle smile 
 i think no one has been more courted than she she went on but till quite lately she never cared seriously for anyone now you know count she said to pierre even our dear cousin boris who between ourselves was very far gone in the land of tenderness alluding to a map of love much in vogue at that time 
 prince andrew frowned and remained silent 
 you are friendly with boris you asked vera 
 yes i know him 
 i expect he has told you of his childish love for natasha 
 oh there was childish love suddenly asked prince andrew blushing unexpectedly 
 yes you know between cousins intimacy often leads to love le cousinage est un dangereux voisinage you think so 
 cousinhood is a dangerous neighborhood 
 oh undoubtedly said prince andrew and with sudden and unnatural liveliness he began chaffing pierre about the need to be very careful with his moscow cousins and in the midst of these jesting remarks he rose taking pierre by the arm and drew him aside 
 well asked pierre seeing his strange animation with surprise and noticing the glance he turned on natasha as he rose 
 i must i must have a talk with you said prince andrew you know that pair of gloves he referred to the masonic gloves given to a newly initiated brother to present to the woman he loved i but no i will talk to you later on and with a strange light in his eyes and restlessness in his movements prince andrew approached natasha and sat down beside her pierre saw how prince andrew asked her something and how she flushed as she replied 
 but at that moment berg came to pierre and began insisting that he should take part in an argument between the general and the colonel on the affairs in spain 
 berg was satisfied and happy the smile of pleasure never left his face the party was very successful and quite like other parties he had seen everything was similar the ladies subtle talk the cards the general raising his voice at the card table and the samovar and the tea cakes only one thing was lacking that he had always seen at the evening parties he wished to imitate they had not yet had a loud conversation among the men and a dispute about something important and clever now the general had begun such a discussion and so berg drew pierre to it

 chapter xxii 
 next day having been invited by the count prince andrew dined with the rostovs and spent the rest of the day there 
 everyone in the house realized for whose sake prince andrew came and without concealing it he tried to be with natasha all day not only in the soul of the frightened yet happy and enraptured natasha but in the whole house there was a feeling of awe at something important that was bound to happen the countess looked with sad and sternly serious eyes at prince andrew when he talked to natasha and timidly started some artificial conversation about trifles as soon as he looked her way sonya was afraid to leave natasha and afraid of being in the way when she was with them natasha grew pale in a panic of expectation when she remained alone with him for a moment prince andrew surprised her by his timidity she felt that he wanted to say something to her but could not bring himself to do so 
 in the evening when prince andrew had left the countess went up to natasha and whispered well what 
 mamma for sake ask me anything now one talk about that said natasha 
 but all the same that night natasha now agitated and now frightened lay long time in her bed gazing straight before her she told her how he had complimented her how he told her he was going abroad asked her where they were going to spend the summer and then how he had asked her about boris 
 but such a such a never happened to me before she said only i feel afraid in his presence i am always afraid when with him what does that mean does it mean that the real thing yes mamma are you asleep 
 no my love i am frightened myself answered her mother now go 
 all the same i sleep what silliness to sleep mummy mummy such a thing never happened to me before she said surprised and alarmed at the feeling she was aware of in herself and could we ever have thought 
 it seemed to natasha that even at the time she first saw prince andrew at otradnoe she had fallen in love with him it was as if she feared this strange unexpected happiness of meeting again the very man she had then chosen she was firmly convinced she had done so and of finding him as it seemed not indifferent to her 
 and it had to happen that he should come specially to petersburg while we are here and it had to happen that we should meet at that ball it is fate clearly it is fate that everything led up to this already then directly i saw him i felt something peculiar 
 what else did he say to you what are those verses read them said her mother thoughtfully referring to some verses prince andrew had written in album 
 mamma one need not be ashamed of his being a widower 
 natasha pray to god marriages are made in heaven said her mother 
 darling mummy how i love you how happy i am cried natasha shedding tears of joy and excitement and embracing her mother 
 at that very time prince andrew was sitting with pierre and telling him of his love for natasha and his firm resolve to make her his wife 
 that day countess helene had a reception at her house the french ambassador was there and a foreign prince of the blood who had of late become a frequent visitor of hers and many brilliant ladies and gentlemen pierre who had come downstairs walked through the rooms and struck everyone by his preoccupied and morose air 
 since the ball he had felt the approach of a fit of nervous depression and had made desperate efforts to combat it since the intimacy of his wife with the royal prince pierre had unexpectedly been made a gentleman of the bedchamber and from that time he had begun to feel oppressed and ashamed in court society and dark thoughts of the vanity of all things human came to him oftener than before at the same time the feeling he had noticed between his protegee natasha and prince andrew accentuated his gloom by the contrast between his own position and his he tried equally to avoid thinking about his wife and about natasha and prince andrew and again everything seemed to him insignificant in comparison with eternity again the question for what presented itself and he forced himself to work day and night at masonic labors hoping to drive away the evil spirit that threatened him toward midnight after he had left the countess apartments he was sitting upstairs in a shabby dressing gown copying out the original transaction of the scottish lodge of freemasons at a table in his low room cloudy with tobacco smoke when someone came in it was prince andrew 
 ah you said pierre with a preoccupied dissatisfied air and i you see am hard at it he pointed to his manuscript book with that air of escaping from the ills of life with which unhappy people look at their work 
 prince andrew with a beaming ecstatic expression of renewed life on his face paused in front of pierre and not noticing his sad look smiled at him with the egotism of joy 
 well dear heart said he i wanted to tell you about it yesterday and i have come to do so today i never experienced anything like it before i am in love my friend 
 suddenly pierre heaved a deep sigh and dumped his heavy person down on the sofa beside prince andrew 
 with natasha rostova yes said he 
 yes yes who else should it be i should never have believed it but the feeling is stronger than i yesterday i tormented myself and suffered but i would not exchange even that torment for anything in the world i have not lived till now at last i live but i live without her but can she love me i am too old for her why you speak 
 i i what did i tell you said pierre suddenly rising and beginning to pace up and down the room i always thought it that girl is such a treasure she is a rare girl my dear friend i entreat you philosophize doubt marry marry marry and i am sure there will not be a happier man than you 
 but what of her 
 she loves you 
 talk rubbish said prince andrew smiling and looking into eyes 
 she does i know pierre cried fiercely 
 but do listen returned prince andrew holding him by the arm do you know the condition i am in i must talk about it to someone 
 well go on go on i am very glad said pierre and his face really changed his brow became smooth and he listened gladly to prince andrew prince andrew seemed and really was quite a different quite a new man where was his spleen his contempt for life his disillusionment pierre was the only person to whom he made up his mind to speak openly and to him he told all that was in his soul now he boldly and lightly made plans for an extended future said he could not sacrifice his own happiness to his caprice and spoke of how he would either make his father consent to this marriage and love her or would do without his consent then he marveled at the feeling that had mastered him as at something strange apart from and independent of himself 
 i should not have believed anyone who told me that i was capable of such love said prince andrew it is not at all the same feeling that i knew in the past the whole world is now for me divided into two halves one half is she and there all is joy hope light the other half is everything where she is not and there is all gloom and darkness 
 darkness and gloom reiterated pierre yes yes i understand that 
 i cannot help loving the light it is not my fault and i am very happy you understand me i know you are glad for my sake 
 yes yes pierre assented looking at his friend with a touched and sad expression in his eyes the brighter prince lot appeared to him the gloomier seemed his own

 next day having been invited by the count prince andrew dined with the rostovs and spent the rest of the day there 
 everyone in the house realized for whose sake prince andrew came and without concealing it he tried to be with natasha all day not only in the soul of the frightened yet happy and enraptured natasha but in the whole house there was a feeling of awe at something important that was bound to happen the countess looked with sad and sternly serious eyes at prince andrew when he talked to natasha and timidly started some artificial conversation about trifles as soon as he looked her way sonya was afraid to leave natasha and afraid of being in the way when she was with them natasha grew pale in a panic of expectation when she remained alone with him for a moment prince andrew surprised her by his timidity she felt that he wanted to say something to her but could not bring himself to do so 
 in the evening when prince andrew had left the countess went up to natasha and whispered well what 
 mamma for sake ask me anything now one talk about that said natasha 
 but all the same that night natasha now agitated and now frightened lay long time in her bed gazing straight before her she told her how he had complimented her how he told her he was going abroad asked her where they were going to spend the summer and then how he had asked her about boris

 since we are engaged in giving details as to what the convent of the was in former times and since we have ventured to open a window on that discreet retreat the reader will permit us one other little digression utterly foreign to this book but characteristic and useful since it shows that the cloister even has its original figures 
 in the little convent there was a centenarian who came from the abbey of fontevrault 
 she had even been in society before the revolution she talked a great deal of m de miromesnil keeper of the seals under louis xvi 
 and of a presidentess duplat with whom she had been very intimate 
 it was her pleasure and her vanity to drag in these names on every pretext 
 she told wonders of the abbey of fontevrault that it was like a city and that there were streets in the monastery 
 she talked with a picard accent which amused the pupils 
 every year she solemnly renewed her vows and at the moment of taking the oath she said to the priest monseigneur gave it to monseigneur monseigneur gave it to monseigneur monseigneur gave it to monseigneur etc etc and thus i give it to you father 
 and the would begin to laugh not in their sleeves but under their veils charming little stifled laughs which made the vocal mothers frown 
 on another occasion the centenarian was telling stories 
 she said that in her youth the bernardine monks were every whit as good as the mousquetaires 
 it was a century which spoke through her but it was the eighteenth century 
 she told about the custom of the four wines which existed before the revolution in champagne and bourgogne when a great personage a marshal of france a prince a duke and a peer traversed a town in burgundy or champagne the city fathers came out to harangue him and presented him with four silver gondolas into which they had poured four different sorts of wine on the first goblet this inscription could be read monkey wine on the second lion wine on the third sheep wine on the fourth hog wine 
 these four legends express the four stages descended by the drunkard the first intoxication which enlivens the second that which irritates the third that which dulls and the fourth that which brutalizes 
 in a cupboard under lock and key she kept a mysterious object of which she thought a great deal 
 the rule of fontevrault did not forbid this 
 she would not show this object to anyone she shut herself up which her rule allowed her to do and hid herself every time that she desired to contemplate it if she heard a footstep in the corridor she closed the cupboard again as hastily as it was possible with her aged hands 
 as soon as it was mentioned to her she became silent she who was so fond of talking 
 the most curious were baffled by her silence and the most tenacious by her obstinacy 
 thus it furnished a subject of comment for all those who were unoccupied or bored in the convent what could that treasure of the centenarian be which was so precious and so secret 
 some holy book no doubt 
 some unique chaplet some authentic relic 
 they lost themselves in conjectures when the poor old woman died they rushed to her cupboard more hastily than was fitting perhaps and opened it 
 they found the object beneath a triple linen cloth like some consecrated paten it was a faenza platter representing little loves flitting away pursued by apothecary lads armed with enormous syringes the chase abounds in grimaces and in comical postures

 chapter xxiii 
 
 prince andrew needed his consent to his marriage and to obtain this he started for the country next day 
 his father received his communication with external composure but inward wrath he could not comprehend how anyone could wish to alter his life or introduce anything new into it when his own life was already ending if only they would let me end my days as i want to thought the old man then they might do as they please with his son however he employed the diplomacy he reserved for important occasions and adopting a quiet tone discussed the whole matter 
 in the first place the marriage was not a brilliant one as regards birth wealth or rank secondly prince andrew was no longer as young as he had been and his health was poor the old man laid special stress on this while she was very young thirdly he had a son whom it would be a pity to entrust to a chit of a girl fourthly and finally the father said looking ironically at his son i beg you to put it off for a year go abroad take a cure look out as you wanted to for a german tutor for prince nicholas then if your love or passion or obstinacy as you please is still as great marry and my last word on it mind the last concluded the prince in a tone which showed that nothing would make him alter his decision 
 prince andrew saw clearly that the old man hoped that his feelings or his would not stand a test or that he the old prince himself would die before then and he decided to conform to his wish to propose and postpone the wedding for a year 
 three weeks after the last evening he had spent with the rostovs prince andrew returned to petersburg 
 next day after her talk with her mother natasha expected bolkonski all day but he did not come on the second and third day it was the same pierre did not come either and natasha not knowing that prince andrew had gone to see his father could not explain his absence to herself 
 three weeks passed in this way natasha had no desire to go out anywhere and wandered from room to room like a shadow idle and listless she wept secretly at night and did not go to her mother in the evenings she blushed continually and was irritable it seemed to her that everybody knew about her disappointment and was laughing at her and pitying her strong as was her inward grief this wound to her vanity intensified her misery 
 once she came to her mother tried to say something and suddenly began to cry her tears were those of an offended child who does not know why it is being punished 
 the countess began to soothe natasha who after first listening to her words suddenly interrupted her 
 leave off mamma i think and want to think about it he just came and then left off left off 
 her voice trembled and she again nearly cried but recovered and went on quietly 
 and i at all want to get married and i am afraid of him i have now become quite calm quite calm 
 the day after this conversation natasha put on the old dress which she knew had the peculiar property of conducing to cheerfulness in the mornings and that day she returned to the old way of life which she had abandoned since the ball having finished her morning tea she went to the ballroom which she particularly liked for its loud resonance and began singing her solfeggio when she had finished her first exercise she stood still in the middle of the room and sang a musical phrase that particularly pleased her she listened joyfully as though she had not expected it to the charm of the notes reverberating filling the whole empty ballroom and slowly dying away and all at once she felt cheerful the good of making so much of it things are nice as it is she said to herself and she began walking up and down the room not stepping simply on the resounding parquet but treading with each step from the heel to the toe she had on a new and favorite pair of shoes and listening to the regular tap of the heel and creak of the toe as gladly as she had to the sounds of her own voice passing a mirror she glanced into it there me the expression of her face seemed to say as she caught sight of herself well and very nice too i need nobody 
 a footman wanted to come in to clear away something in the room but she would not let him and having closed the door behind him continued her walk that morning she had returned to her favorite mood love of and delight in herself how charming that natasha is she said again speaking as some third collective male person pretty a good voice young and in way if only they leave her in peace but however much they left her in peace she could not now be at peace and immediately felt this 
 in the hall the porch door opened and someone asked at home and then footsteps were heard natasha was looking at the mirror but did not see herself she listened to the sounds in the hall when she saw herself her face was pale it was he she knew this for certain though she hardly heard his voice through the closed doors 
 pale and agitated natasha ran into the drawing room 
 mamma bolkonski has come she said mamma it is awful it is unbearable i want to be tormented what am i to do 
 before the countess could answer prince andrew entered the room with an agitated and serious face as soon as he saw natasha his face brightened he kissed the countess hand and and sat down beside the sofa 
 it is long since we had the pleasure began the countess but prince andrew interrupted her by answering her intended question obviously in haste to say what he had to 
 i have not been to see all this time because i have been at my i had to talk over a very important matter with him i only got back last night he said glancing at natasha i want to have a talk with you countess he added after a pause 
 the countess lowered her eyes sighing deeply 
 i am at your disposal she murmured 
 natasha knew that she ought to go away but was unable to do so something gripped her throat and regardless of manners she stared straight at prince andrew with eyes 
 at once this instant no it be she thought 
 again he glanced at her and that glance convinced her that she was not mistaken yes at once that very instant her fate would be decided 
 go natasha i will call you said the countess in a whisper 
 natasha glanced with frightened imploring eyes at prince andrew and at her mother and went out 
 i have come countess to ask for your hand said prince andrew 
 the countess face flushed hotly but she said nothing 
 your offer she began at last sedately he remained silent looking into her eyes your offer she grew confused is agreeable to us and i accept your offer i am glad and my husband i hope but it will depend on her 
 i will speak to her when i have your consent do you give it to me said prince andrew 
 yes replied the countess she held out her hand to him and with a mixed feeling of estrangement and tenderness pressed her lips to his forehead as he stooped to kiss her hand she wished to love him as a son but felt that to her he was a stranger and a terrifying man i am sure my husband will consent said the countess but your father 
 my father to whom i have told my plans has made it an express condition of his consent that the wedding is not to take place for a year and i wished to tell you of that said prince andrew 
 it is true that natasha is still young but so long as that 
 it is unavoidable said prince andrew with a sigh 
 i will send her to you said the countess and left the room 
 lord have mercy upon us she repeated while seeking her daughter 
 sonya said that natasha was in her bedroom natasha was sitting on the bed pale and dry eyed and was gazing at the icons and whispering something as she rapidly crossed herself seeing her mother she jumped up and flew to her 
 well mamma well 
 go go to him he is asking for your hand said the countess coldly it seemed to natasha go go said the mother sadly and reproachfully with a deep sigh as her daughter ran away 
 natasha never remembered how she entered the drawing room when she came in and saw him she paused is it possible that this stranger has now become everything to me she asked herself and immediately answered yes everything he alone is now dearer to me than everything in the world prince andrew came up to her with downcast eyes 
 i have loved you from the very first moment i saw you may i hope 
 he looked at her and was struck by the serious impassioned expression of her face her face said why ask why doubt what you cannot but know why speak when words cannot express what one feels 
 she drew near to him and stopped he took her hand and kissed it 
 do you love me 
 yes yes natasha murmured as if in vexation then she sighed loudly and catching her breath more and more quickly began to sob 
 what is it the matter 
 oh i am so happy she replied smiled through her tears bent over closer to him paused for an instant as if asking herself whether she might and then kissed him 
 prince andrew held her hands looked into her eyes and did not find in his heart his former love for her something in him had suddenly changed there was no longer the former poetic and mystic charm of desire but there was pity for her feminine and childish weakness fear at her devotion and trustfulness and an oppressive yet joyful sense of the duty that now bound him to her forever the present feeling though not so bright and poetic as the former was stronger and more serious 
 did your mother tell you that it cannot be for a year asked prince andrew still looking into her eyes 
 is it possible that i the chit of a girl as everybody called me thought natasha is it possible that i am now to be the wife and the equal of this strange dear clever man whom even my father looks up to can it be true can it be true that there can be no more playing with life that now i am grown up that on me now lies a responsibility for my every word and deed yes but what did he ask me 
 no she replied but she had not understood his question 
 forgive me he said but you are so young and i have already been through so much in life i am afraid for you you do not yet know yourself 
 natasha listened with concentrated attention trying but failing to take in the meaning of his words 
 hard as this year which delays my happiness will be continued prince andrew it will give you time to be sure of yourself i ask you to make me happy in a year but you are free our engagement shall remain a secret and should you find that you do not love me or should you come to love said prince andrew with an unnatural smile 
 why do you say that natasha interrupted him you know that from the very day you first came to otradnoe i have loved you she cried quite convinced that she spoke the truth 
 in a year you will learn to know yourself 
 a whole year natasha repeated suddenly only now realizing that the marriage was to be postponed for a year but why a year why a year 
 prince andrew began to explain to her the reasons for this delay natasha did not hear him 
 and it be helped she asked prince andrew did not reply but his face expressed the impossibility of altering that decision 
 awful oh awful awful natasha suddenly cried and again burst into sobs i shall die waiting a year impossible awful she looked into her face and saw in it a look of commiseration and perplexity 
 no no do anything she said suddenly checking her tears i am so happy 
 the father and mother came into the room and gave the betrothed couple their blessing 
 from that day prince andrew began to frequent the rostovs as affianced lover

 a footman wanted to come in to clear away something in the room but she would not let him and having closed the door behind him continued her walk that morning she had returned to her favorite mood love of and delight in herself how charming that natasha is she said again speaking as some third collective male person pretty a good voice young and in way if only they leave her in peace but however much they left her in peace she could not now be at peace and immediately felt this 
 in the hall the porch door opened and someone asked at home and then footsteps were heard natasha was looking at the mirror but did not see herself she listened to the sounds in the hall when she saw herself her face was pale it was he she knew this for certain though she hardly heard his voice through the closed doors 
 pale and agitated natasha ran into the drawing room 
 mamma bolkonski has come she said mamma it is awful it is unbearable i want to be tormented what am i to do 
 before the countess could answer prince andrew entered the room with an agitated and serious face as soon as he saw natasha his face brightened he kissed the countess hand and and sat down beside the sofa 
 it is long since we had the pleasure began the countess but prince andrew interrupted her by answering her intended question obviously in haste to say what he had to 
 i have not been to see all this time because i have been at my i had to talk over a very important matter with him i only got back last night he said glancing at natasha i want to have a talk with you countess he added after a pause 
 the countess lowered her eyes sighing deeply 
 i am at your disposal she murmured 
 natasha knew that she ought to go away but was unable to do so something gripped her throat and regardless of manners she stared straight at prince andrew with eyes 
 at once this instant no it be she thought 
 again he glanced at her and that glance convinced her that she was not mistaken yes at once that very instant her fate would be decided 
 go natasha i will call you said the countess in a whisper 
 natasha glanced with frightened imploring eyes at prince andrew and at her mother and went out 
 i have come countess to ask for your hand said prince andrew 
 the countess face flushed hotly but she said nothing 
 your offer she began at last sedately he remained silent looking into her eyes your offer she grew confused is agreeable to us and i accept your offer i am glad and my husband i hope but it will depend on her 
 i will speak to her when i have your consent do you give it to me said prince andrew 
 yes replied the countess she held out her hand to him and with a mixed feeling of estrangement and tenderness pressed her lips to his forehead as he stooped to kiss her hand she wished to love him as a son but felt that to her he was a stranger and a terrifying man i am sure my husband will consent said the countess but your father 
 my father to whom i have told my plans has made it an express condition of his consent that the wedding is not to take place for a year and i wished to tell you of that said prince andrew 
 it is true that natasha is still young but so long as that 
 it is unavoidable said prince andrew with a sigh 
 i will send her to you said the countess and left the room 
 lord have mercy upon us she repeated while seeking her daughter 
 sonya said that natasha was in her bedroom natasha was sitting on the bed pale and dry eyed and was gazing at the icons and whispering something as she rapidly crossed herself seeing her mother she jumped up and flew to her 
 well mamma well 
 go go to him he is asking for your hand said the countess coldly it seemed to natasha go go said the mother sadly and reproachfully with a deep sigh as her daughter ran away 
 natasha never remembered how she entered the drawing room when she came in and saw him she paused is it possible that this stranger has now become everything to me she asked herself and immediately answered yes everything he alone is now dearer to me than everything in the world prince andrew came up to her with downcast eyes 
 i have loved you from the very first moment i saw you may i hope 
 he looked at her and was struck by the serious impassioned expression of her face her face said why ask why doubt what you cannot but know why speak when words cannot express what one feels 
 she drew near to him and stopped he took her hand and kissed it 
 do you love me 
 yes yes natasha murmured as if in vexation then she sighed loudly and catching her breath more and more quickly began to sob 
 what is it the matter 
 oh i am so happy she replied smiled through her tears bent over closer to him paused for an instant as if asking herself whether she might and then kissed him 
 prince andrew held her hands looked into her eyes and did not find in his heart his former love for her something in him had suddenly changed there was no longer the former poetic and mystic charm of desire but there was pity for her feminine and childish weakness fear at her devotion and trustfulness and an oppressive yet joyful sense of the duty that now bound him to her forever the present feeling though not so bright and poetic as the former was stronger and more serious 
 did your mother tell you that it cannot be for a year asked prince andrew still looking into her eyes 
 is it possible that i the chit of a girl as everybody called me thought natasha is it possible that i am now to be the wife and the equal of this strange dear clever man whom even my father looks up to can it be true can it be true that there can be no more playing with life that now i am grown up that on me now lies a responsibility for my every word and deed yes but what did he ask me 
 no she replied but she had not understood his question 
 forgive me he said but you are so young and i have already been through so much in life i am afraid for you you do not yet know yourself 
 natasha listened with concentrated attention trying but failing to take in the meaning of his words 
 hard as this year which delays my happiness will be continued prince andrew it will give you time to be sure of yourself i ask you to make me happy in a year but you are free our engagement shall remain a secret and should you find that you do not love me or should you come to love said prince andrew with an unnatural smile 
 why do you say that natasha interrupted him you know that from the very day you first came to otradnoe i have loved you she cried quite convinced that she spoke the truth 
 in a year you will learn to know yourself 
 a whole year natasha repeated suddenly only now realizing that the marriage was to be postponed for a year but why a year why a year 
 prince andrew began to explain to her the reasons for this delay natasha did not hear him 
 and it be helped she asked prince andrew did not reply but his face expressed the impossibility of altering that decision 
 awful oh awful awful natasha suddenly cried and again burst into sobs i shall die waiting a year impossible awful she looked into her face and saw in it a look of commiseration and perplexity 
 no no do anything she said suddenly checking her tears i am so happy 
 the father and mother came into the room and gave the betrothed couple their blessing 
 from that day prince andrew began to frequent the rostovs as affianced lover

 book just man 
 chapter xi 
 
 a restriction 
 we should incur a great risk of deceiving ourselves were we to conclude from this that monseigneur welcome was a philosophical bishop or a patriotic cure 
 his meeting which may almost be designated as his union with conventionary g left behind it in his mind a sort of astonishment which rendered him still more gentle that is all 
 although monseigneur bienvenu was far from being a politician this is perhaps the place to indicate very briefly what his attitude was in the events of that epoch supposing that monseigneur bienvenu ever dreamed of having an attitude 
 let us then go back a few years 
 some time after the elevation of m myriel to the episcopate the emperor had made him a baron of the empire in company with many other bishops 
 the arrest of the pope took place as every one knows on the night of the th to the th of july on this occasion m myriel was summoned by napoleon to the synod of the bishops of france and italy convened at paris 
 this synod was held at and assembled for the first time on the th of june under the presidency of cardinal fesch 
 m myriel was one of the bishops who attended it 
 but he was present only at one sitting and at three or four private conferences bishop of a mountain diocese living so very close to nature in rusticity and deprivation it appeared that he imported among these eminent personages ideas which altered the temperature of the assembly 
 he very soon returned to d he was interrogated as to this speedy return and he replied 
 i embarrassed them the outside air penetrated to them through me 
 i produced on them the effect of an open door 
 on another occasion he said what would you have 
 those gentlemen are princes 
 i am only a poor peasant bishop 
 the fact is that he displeased them 
 among other strange things it is said that he chanced to remark one evening when he found himself at the house of one of his most notable colleagues 
 what beautiful clocks 
 what beautiful carpets 
 what beautiful liveries they must be a great trouble 
 i would not have all those superfluities crying incessantly in my ears 
 there are people who are hungry there are people who are cold 
 there are poor people 
 there are poor people 
 let us remark by the way that the hatred of luxury is not an intelligent hatred 
 this hatred would involve the hatred of the arts 
 nevertheless in churchmen luxury is wrong except in connection with representations and ceremonies 
 it seems to reveal habits which have very little that is charitable about them an opulent priest is a contradiction 
 the priest must keep close to the poor 
 now can one come in contact incessantly night and day with all this distress all these misfortunes and this poverty without having about own person a little of that misery like the dust of labor 
 is it possible to imagine a man near a brazier who is not warm 
 can one imagine a workman who is working near a furnace and who has neither a singed hair nor blackened nails nor a drop of sweat nor a speck of ashes on his face 
 the first proof of charity in the priest in the bishop especially is poverty 
 this is no doubt what the bishop of d thought 
 it must not be supposed however that he shared what we call the ideas of the century on certain delicate points 
 he took very little part in the theological quarrels of the moment and maintained silence on questions in which church and state were implicated but if he had been strongly pressed it seems that he would have been found to be an ultramontane rather than a gallican 
 since we are making a portrait and since we do not wish to conceal anything we are forced to add that he was glacial towards napoleon in his decline beginning with he gave in his adherence to or applauded all hostile manifestations 
 he refused to see him as he passed through on his return from the island of elba and he abstained from ordering public prayers for the emperor in his diocese during the hundred days 
 besides his sister mademoiselle baptistine he had two brothers one a general the other a prefect 
 he wrote to both with tolerable frequency 
 he was harsh for a time towards the former because holding a command in provence at the epoch of the disembarkation at cannes the general had put himself at the head of twelve hundred men and had pursued the emperor as though the latter had been a person whom one is desirous of allowing to escape 
 his correspondence with the other brother the a fine worthy man who lived in retirement at paris rue cassette remained more affectionate 
 thus monseigneur bienvenu also had his hour of party spirit his hour of bitterness his cloud 
 the shadow of the passions of the moment traversed this grand and gentle spirit occupied with eternal things certainly such a man would have done well not to entertain any political opinions 
 let there be no mistake as to our meaning we are not confounding what is called political opinions with the grand aspiration for progress with the sublime faith patriotic democratic humane which in our day should be the very foundation of every generous intellect 
 without going deeply into questions which are only indirectly connected with the subject of this book we will simply say this 
 it would have been well if monseigneur bienvenu had not been a royalist and if his glance had never been for a single instant turned away from that serene contemplation in which is distinctly discernible above the fictions and the hatreds of this world above the stormy vicissitudes of human things the beaming of those three pure radiances truth justice and charity 
 while admitting that it was not for a political office that god created monseigneur welcome we should have understood and admired his protest in the name of right and liberty his proud opposition his just but perilous resistance to the napoleon but that which pleases us in people who are rising pleases us less in the case of people who are falling 
 we only love the fray so long as there is danger and in any case the combatants of the first hour have alone the right to be the exterminators of the last 
 he who has not been a stubborn accuser in prosperity should hold his peace in the face of ruin 
 the denunciator of success is the only legitimate executioner of the fall as for us when providence intervenes and strikes we let it work commenced to disarm us 
 in the cowardly breach of silence of that taciturn legislative body emboldened by catastrophe possessed only traits which aroused indignation 
 and it was a crime to applaud in in the presence of those marshals who betrayed in the presence of that senate which passed from one dunghill to another insulting after having deified in the presence of that idolatry which was loosing its footing and spitting on its idol it was a duty to turn aside the head 
 in when the supreme disasters filled the air when france was seized with a shiver at their sinister approach when waterloo could be dimly discerned opening before napoleon the mournful acclamation of the army and the people to the condemned of destiny had nothing laughable in it and after making all allowance for the despot a heart like that of the bishop of d ought not perhaps to have failed to recognize the august and touching features presented by the embrace of a great nation and a great man on the brink of the abyss 
 with this exception he was in all things just true equitable intelligent humble and dignified beneficent and kindly which is only another sort of benevolence 
 he was a priest a sage and a man 
 it must be admitted that even in the political views with which we have just reproached him and which we are disposed to judge almost with severity he was tolerant and easy more so perhaps than we who are speaking here 
 the porter of the had been placed there by the emperor 
 he was an old officer of the old guard a member of the legion of honor at austerlitz as much of a bonapartist as the eagle this poor fellow occasionally let slip inconsiderate remarks which the law then stigmatized as seditious speeches 
 after the imperial profile disappeared from the legion of honor he never dressed himself in his regimentals as he said so that he should not be obliged to wear his cross 
 he had himself devoutly removed the imperial effigy from the cross which napoleon had given him this made a hole and he would not put anything in its place i will die he said rather than wear the three frogs upon my heart 
 he liked to scoff aloud at louis xviii 
 the gouty old creature in english gaiters he said let him take himself off to prussia with that queue of his

 chapter xi 
 
 a restriction 
 we should incur a great risk of deceiving ourselves were we to conclude from this that monseigneur welcome was a philosophical bishop or a patriotic cure 
 his meeting which may almost be designated as his union with conventionary g left behind it in his mind a sort of astonishment which rendered him still more gentle that is all 
 although monseigneur bienvenu was far from being a politician this is perhaps the place to indicate very briefly what his attitude was in the events of that epoch supposing that monseigneur bienvenu ever dreamed of having an attitude 
 let us then go back a few years 
 some time after the elevation of m myriel to the episcopate the emperor had made him a baron of the empire in company with many other bishops 
 the arrest of the pope took place as every one knows on the night of the th to the th of july on this occasion m myriel was summoned by napoleon to the synod of the bishops of france and italy convened at paris 
 this synod was held at and assembled for the first time on the th of june under the presidency of cardinal fesch 
 m myriel was one of the bishops who attended it 
 but he was present only at one sitting and at three or four private conferences bishop of a mountain diocese living so very close to nature in rusticity and deprivation it appeared that he imported among these eminent personages ideas which altered the temperature of the assembly 
 he very soon returned to d he was interrogated as to this speedy return and he replied 
 i embarrassed them the outside air penetrated to them through me 
 i produced on them the effect of an open door 
 on another occasion he said what would you have 
 those gentlemen are princes 
 i am only a poor peasant bishop 
 the fact is that he displeased them 
 among other strange things it is said that he chanced to remark one evening when he found himself at the house of one of his most notable colleagues 
 what beautiful clocks 
 what beautiful carpets 
 what beautiful liveries they must be a great trouble 
 i would not have all those superfluities crying incessantly in my ears 
 there are people who are hungry there are people who are cold 
 there are poor people 
 there are poor people 
 let us remark by the way that the hatred of luxury is not an intelligent hatred 
 this hatred would involve the hatred of the arts 
 nevertheless in churchmen luxury is wrong except in connection with representations and ceremonies 
 it seems to reveal habits which have very little that is charitable about them an opulent priest is a contradiction 
 the priest must keep close to the poor 
 now can one come in contact incessantly night and day with all this distress all these misfortunes and this poverty without having about own person a little of that misery like the dust of labor 
 is it possible to imagine a man near a brazier who is not warm 
 can one imagine a workman who is working near a furnace and who has neither a singed hair nor blackened nails nor a drop of sweat nor a speck of ashes on his face 
 the first proof of charity in the priest in the bishop especially is poverty 
 this is no doubt what the bishop of d thought 
 it must not be supposed however that he shared what we call the ideas of the century on certain delicate points 
 he took very little part in the theological quarrels of the moment and maintained silence on questions in which church and state were implicated but if he had been strongly pressed it seems that he would have been found to be an ultramontane rather than a gallican 
 since we are making a portrait and since we do not wish to conceal anything we are forced to add that he was glacial towards napoleon in his decline beginning with he gave in his adherence to or applauded all hostile manifestations 
 he refused to see him as he passed through on his return from the island of elba and he abstained from ordering public prayers for the emperor in his diocese during the hundred days 
 besides his sister mademoiselle baptistine he had two brothers one a general the other a prefect 
 he wrote to both with tolerable frequency 
 he was harsh for a time towards the former because holding a command in provence at the epoch of the disembarkation at cannes the general had put himself at the head of twelve hundred men and had pursued the emperor as though the latter had been a person whom one is desirous of allowing to escape 
 his correspondence with the other brother the a fine worthy man who lived in retirement at paris rue cassette remained more affectionate 
 thus monseigneur bienvenu also had his hour of party spirit his hour of bitterness his cloud 
 the shadow of the passions of the moment traversed this grand and gentle spirit occupied with eternal things certainly such a man would have done well not to entertain any political opinions 
 let there be no mistake as to our meaning we are not confounding what is called political opinions with the grand aspiration for progress with the sublime faith patriotic democratic humane which in our day should be the very foundation of every generous intellect 
 without going deeply into questions which are only indirectly connected with the subject of this book we will simply say this 
 it would have been well if monseigneur bienvenu had not been a royalist and if his glance had never been for a single instant turned away from that serene contemplation in which is distinctly discernible above the fictions and the hatreds of this world above the stormy vicissitudes of human things the beaming of those three pure radiances truth justice and charity 
 while admitting that it was not for a political office that god created monseigneur welcome we should have understood and admired his protest in the name of right and liberty his proud opposition his just but perilous resistance to the napoleon but that which pleases us in people who are rising pleases us less in the case of people who are falling 
 we only love the fray so long as there is danger and in any case the combatants of the first hour have alone the right to be the exterminators of the last 
 he who has not been a stubborn accuser in prosperity should hold his peace in the face of ruin 
 the denunciator of success is the only legitimate executioner of the fall as for us when providence intervenes and strikes we let it work commenced to disarm us 
 in the cowardly breach of silence of that taciturn legislative body emboldened by catastrophe possessed only traits which aroused indignation 
 and it was a crime to applaud in in the presence of those marshals who betrayed in the presence of that senate which passed from one dunghill to another insulting after having deified in the presence of that idolatry which was loosing its footing and spitting on its idol it was a duty to turn aside the head 
 in when the supreme disasters filled the air when france was seized with a shiver at their sinister approach when waterloo could be dimly discerned opening before napoleon the mournful acclamation of the army and the people to the condemned of destiny had nothing laughable in it and after making all allowance for the despot a heart like that of the bishop of d ought not perhaps to have failed to recognize the august and touching features presented by the embrace of a great nation and a great man on the brink of the abyss 
 with this exception he was in all things just true equitable intelligent humble and dignified beneficent and kindly which is only another sort of benevolence 
 he was a priest a sage and a man 
 it must be admitted that even in the political views with which we have just reproached him and which we are disposed to judge almost with severity he was tolerant and easy more so perhaps than we who are speaking here 
 the porter of the had been placed there by the emperor 
 he was an old officer of the old guard a member of the legion of honor at austerlitz as much of a bonapartist as the eagle this poor fellow occasionally let slip inconsiderate remarks which the law then stigmatized as seditious speeches 
 after the imperial profile disappeared from the legion of honor he never dressed himself in his regimentals as he said so that he should not be obliged to wear his cross 
 he had himself devoutly removed the imperial effigy from the cross which napoleon had given him this made a hole and he would not put anything in its place i will die he said rather than wear the three frogs upon my heart 
 he liked to scoff aloud at louis xviii 
 the gouty old creature in english gaiters he said let him take himself off to prussia with that queue of his 
 he was happy to combine in the same imprecation the two things which he most detested prussia and england 
 he did it so often that he lost his place there he was turned out of the house with his wife and children and without bread 
 the bishop sent for him reproved him gently and appointed him beadle in the cathedral 
 in the course of nine years monseigneur bienvenu had by dint of holy deeds and gentle manners filled the town of d with a sort of tender and filial reverence 
 even his conduct towards napoleon had been accepted and tacitly pardoned as it were by the people the good and weakly flock who adored their emperor but loved their bishop

 what do you think sweetheart solo inquired well pleased with a bad bit of rescuing you know sometimes i amaze even myself 
 that sound too hard she admitted readily the important thing isnot my safety but the fact that the information in the r droid is still intact 
 that droid carrying so important anyway 
 leia considered the blazing starfield forward complete technical schematicsof the battle station i only hope that when the data is analyzed a weakness can befound until then until the station itself is destroyed we must go on this over yet 
 it is for me objected the pilot not on this mission for your interest me not politics business to be done under anygovernment and not doing it for you princess i expect to be well paid forrisking my ship and my hide 
 you worry about your reward she assured him sadly turning to money is what you what you will receive 
 on leaving the cockpit she saw luke coming forward and she spoke softly tohim in passing your friend is indeed a mercenary i wonder if he really caresabout anybody 
 luke stared after her until she disappeared into the main hold area thenwhispered i doi care then he moved into the cockpit and sat in the seatchewbacca had just vacated 
 what do you think of her han 
 solo hesitate i try not to 
 luke probably intended his response to be audible but solo overheard hismurmur of good none the less 
 still solo ventured thoughtfully got a lot of spirit to go with her know do you think possible for a princess and a guy like me 
 no luke cut him off sharply he turned and looked away 
 solo smiled at the younger jealousy uncertain in his own mind whether hehad added the comment to bait his because it was the truth 
 yavin was not a habitable world the huge gas giant was patterned with cloud formations here and there the softly lambent atmosphere wasmolded by cyclonic storms composed of winds whichboiled rolling gases up form the yavinesque troposphere it was a world of lingeringbeauty and quick death for any who might try to penetrate to its comparatively smallcore of frozen liquids 
 several of the giant numerous moons however were and of these three could support humanoid life particularly invitingwas the satellite designated by the discoverers as number four it shone likean emerald in necklace of moons rich with plant and animal life but it wasnot listed among those worlds supporting human settlement yavin was located toofar from settled regions of the galaxy 
 perhaps the latter reason or both or a combination of causes still unknown hadbeen responsible for whatever race had once risen from satellite jungles only todisappear quietly long before the first human explorer set foot on the tiny was known of them save that they left a number of impressive monuments andthat they were one of the many races which had aspired to the stars only to have theirdesperate reach fall short 
 now all that remained were the mounds and clumps formed buildings but thought they had sunk back into the dust theirartifacts and their world continued to serve an important purpose 
 strange cries and barely perceptible moans sounded from every tree and and growls and strange mutterings issued from creatures content to remainconcealed in the dense undergrowth whenever dawn broke over moon the one of its long days an especially feral chorus of shrieks and weirdlymodulated screams would resound through the thick mist 
 even stranger sounds surged continually from one particular place here laythe most impressive of those edifices which a vanished race had raised toward theheavens it was a temple a roughly pyramidal structure so colossal that it seemedimpossible it could have been built without the aid of modern gravitonic constructiontechniques yet all evidence pointed only to simple machines hand perhaps devices alien and long lost 
 while the science of this inhabitants had led them to a dead end as far asoffworld travel was concerned they had produced several discoveries which in certainways surpassed similar imperial of which involved a stillunexplained method of cutting and transporting gargantuan blocks of stone from thecrust of the moon 
 from these monstrous blocks of solid rock the massive temple had beenconstructed the jungle had scaled even its soaring crest clothing it in rich greenand brown only near its base in the temple front did the jungle slide awaycompletely to reveal a long dark entrance cut by its builders and enlarged to suit theneeds of the present occupants 
 a tiny machine its smooth metal sides and silvery hue incongruous amidst green appeared in the forest it hummed like a fat swollen beetle as itconveyed its cluster of passengers toward the open temple base crossing aconsiderable clearing it was soon swallowed up by the dark maw in the front of themassive structure leaving the jungle once more in the paws and claws of invisiblesquallers and screechers 
 the original builders would never have recognized the interior of their metal had replaced rock and poured paneling did service for chamberdivision in place of wood nor would they have been able to see the buried layersexcavated into the rock below layers which contained hangar upon hanger linked bypowerful elevators 
 a landspeeder came to a gradual stop within the temple whose first level wasthe uppermost of the hangars its engine died obediently as the vehiclesettled to the ground a noisy cluster of humans waiting nearby ceased theirconversation and rushed toward the craft 
 fortunately leia organa quickly emerged from the speeder or the man whoreached it first might have pulled her bodily from it so great was his delight at thesight of her he settled for giving her a smothering hug as his companion calledtheir own greetings 
 safe feared been killed abruptly he composed away from her and executed a formal bow when we heard aboutalderaan we were afraid that you werelost along with the rest of the population 
 all that is past history commander willard she said we have a future tolive for alderaan and its people are gone her voice turned bitter in so a person we must see that such does not happenagain 
 we have time for our sorrows commander she continued battle station has surely tracked us here 
 solo started to protest but she shut him up with logic and a stern look 
 the only explanation for the ease of our escape they sent only four tiefighters after us they could as easily have launched a hundred 
 solo had no reply for that but continued to fume silently then leia gesturedat artoo detoo 
 you must use the information locked in this r droid to form a plan of our only hope the station itself is more powerful than anyone suspected hervoice dropped if the data does not yield a weakness there will be no stoppingthem 
 luke was then treated to a sight unique in his experience unique in most rebel technicians walked up to artoo detoo positioned themselves aroundhim and gently hoisted him in their arms this was the first and probably the lasttime he would ever see a robot being carried respectfully by men 
 theoretically no weapon could penetrate the exceptionally dense stone of theancient temple but luke had seen the shattered remains of alderaan and knew thatfor those in the incredible battle station the entire moon would present simply anotherabstract problem in conversion 
 little artoo detoo rested comfortably in a place of honor his body radiatingcomputer and hookups like a metal hairdo on an array of screens andreadouts nearby the technical information stored on the submicroscopic record tapewithin the brain was being played out hours of 
 first the rush of materials was slowed and digested by more sophisticatedcomputer minds then the most critical information was turned over to humananalysts for detailed evaluation 
 all the while see threepio stood close to artoo marveling at how so muchcomplex data could be stored in the mind of so simple a droid 
 the central briefing room was located deep within the bowels of the long auditorium was dominated by a raised dais and huge electronicdisplay screen at its far end pilots navigators and a sprinkling of artoo units filledthe seats impatient and feeling very out of place han solo and chewbacca stoodas far away from the stage with its assemblage of officers and senators as scanned the crowd searching for luke despite some common sense crazy kid had gone and joined the regular pilots he see luke but herecognized the princess as she talked somberly with some bemedaled oldster 
 when a tall dignified gentleman with too many deaths on his soul moved tostand by the far side of the screen solo turned his attention to him as did everyoneelse in the room as soon as an expectant silence had gripped the crowd generaljan dodonna adjusted the tiny mike on his chest and indicated the small group seatedclose to him 
 you all know these people he intoned with quiet power they are thesenators and generals whose worlds have given us support whether open or have come to be with us in what may well prove to be the decisive let his gaze touch many in the crowd and none who were so favored remainedunmoved 
 the imperial battle station you know all have heard of is approaching from thefar side of yavin and its sun that gives us a little extra time but it must and for it can reach this moon before it can bring itsweaponry to bear on us as it did on alderaan a murmur ran through the crowd atthe mention of that world so callously obliterated 
 the station dodonna went on is heavily shielded and mounts morefirepower than half the imperial fleet but its defenses were designed to fend capital ship assaults a small one or fighter should be able toslip through its defensive screens 
 a slim supple man who resembled an older version of han solo acknowledged his presence what is it red leader 
 the man gestured toward the display screen which showed a computer portraitof the battle station pardon me for asking sir but what good are our snub fightersgoing to be against that 
 dodonna considered well the empire think a fighter is anythreat to anything except another small ship like a tie fighter or they would haveprovided tighter screens apparently convinced that their defensiveweaponry can fend off any light attacks 
 but an analysis of the plans provided by princess leia has revealed what wethink is a weakness in the design a big ship get near it but an fighter might 
 a small thermal exhaust port its size belies its importance as it appears tobe an unshielded shaft that runs directly into the main reactor system powering thestation since this serves as an emergency outlet for waste heat in the event ofreactor overproduction its usefulness would be eliminated by particle shielding adirect hit would initiate a chain reaction that will destroy the station 
 mutterings of disbelief ran through the room the more experienced the greater his expressed disbelief 
 i say your approach would be easy dodonna admonished them hegestured at the screen you must maneuver straight in down this shaft level off inthe trench and skim the surface point the target is only two meters will take a precise hit at exactly ninety degree to reach the reactor only a direct hit will start the complete reaction 
 i said the port however it is completely means no energy beams have to use proton torpedoes 
 a few of the pilots laughed humorlessly one of them was a teenaged fighterjockey seated next to luke who bore the unlikely name of wedge antilles artoodetoo was there also seated next to another artoo unit who emitted a long whistle ofhopelessness 
 a target at maximum a torpedo yet antilles impossible even for the computer 
 but not impossible protested luke i used to in myt back home not much bigger than two meters 
 is that so the rakishly uniformed youth noted derisively tell me when youwere going after your particular varmint were there a thousand other what did youcall it armed with power rifles firing up at you he shook his headsadly 
 with all that firepower on the station directed at us this will take a little morethan barnyard marksmanship believe me 
 as if to confirm antilles pessimism dodonna indicated a string of lights on schematic take special not of these emplacements aheavy concentration of firepower on the latitudinal axes was well as several densecircumpolar clusters 
 also their field generators will probably create a lot of distortion especially inand around the trench i figure that maneuverability in that sector will be less thanpoint three this produced more murmurs and a few groans from the assembly 
 remember the general went on you must achieve a direct hit yellowsquadron will cover for red on the first run green will cover blue on the questions 
 a muted buzz filled the room one man stood lean and muchso it seemed to be ready to throw away his life for something as abstract as freedom 
 what if both runs fail what happens after that 
 dodonna smiled tightly there be any after that the man noddedslowly understandingly and sat down anyone else silence now pregnantwith expectation 
 then man your ships and may the force be with you 
 like oil draining from shallow pot the seated ranks of men women andmachines rose and flowed toward the exits 
 elevators hummed busily lifting more and more deadly shapes from burieddepths to the staging area in the primary temple hangar as luke threepio and artoodetoo walked toward the hangar entrance 
 neither the bustling flight crews nor the pilots performing final checkouts northe massive sparks thrown off as power couplings were disconnected captured at the moment instead it was held by the activity of two far more familiarfigures 
 solo and chewbacca were loading a pile of small strongboxes onto an armoredlandspeeder they were completely absorbed with this activity ignoring thepreparations going all around them 
 solo glanced up briefly as luke and the robots approached then returned to hisloading luke simply watched sadly conflicting emotions careening confusedly offone another inside him solo was cocky reckless intolerant and smug he wasalso brave to a fault instructive and unfailingly cheery the combination made fora confusing a friend nonetheless 
 you got your reward luke finally observed indicating the boxes solonodded once and leaving then 
 right kid got some old debts to pay off and even if i think be fool enough to stick around here he eyed luke pretty good in a scrap kid why you come with us i could useyou 
 the mercenary gleam in eyes only made luke mad why youlook around you and see something besides yourself for a change you know to happen here what up against they could use a good pilot turning your back on them 
 solo appear upset at tirade what a reward if notaround to spend it attacking that battle station my idea of likesuicide 
 yeahtake care of yourself han luke said quietly turning to leave but iguess what best at it he started back into the hangar by the two droids 
 solo stared after him hesitated then called hey lukemay the force be withyou luke looked back to see solo wink at him he of then hewas swallowed up by moving mechanics and machinery 
 solo returned to his work lifting a stopped to see chewbacca gazingfixedly at him 
 what are you staring at gruesome i know what doing get back towork 
 slowly still eyeing his partner the wookie returned to the task of loading theheavy crates 
 sorrowful thoughts of solo vanished when luke saw the petite slim figurestanding by his ship he had been granted 
 are you sure this is what you want princess leia asked him it could be adeadly reward 
 eyes were filled with the sleek venomous metal shape more thananything 
 then wrong 
 luke looked back at her and shrugged han i thought change hismind i thought join us 
 a man must follow his own path she told him sounding now like a one can choose it for him han priorities differ from ours i wish itwere otherwise but i find it in my heart to condemn him she stood ontiptoes gave him a quick almost embarrassed kiss and turned to go may the forcebe with you 
 i only wish luke murmured to himself as he started back to his ship benwere here 
 so intent was he on thoughts of kenobi the princess and han that he the larger figure which tightly locked on to his arm he turned his initialanger gone instantly in astonishment as he recognized the figure 
 luke the slightly older man exclaimed i believe it you gethere are you going out with us 
 biggs luke embraced his friend warmly of course be up there withyou his smile faded slightly i got a choice anymore then hebrightened again listen have i got some stories to tell you 
 the steady whooping and laughing the two made was in marked contrast to thesolemnity with which the other men and women in the hangar went about theirbusiness the commotion attracted the attention of an older man knownto the younger pilot only as blue leader 
 his face wrinkled with curiosity as he approached the two younger men it wasa face scorched by the same fire that flickered in his eyes a blaze kindled not byrevolutionary fervor but by years of living through and witnessing far too muchinjustice behind that fatherly visage a raging demon fought to escape soon verysoon he would be free to let it loose 
 now he was interested in these two young men who in a few hours were likelyto be particles of frozen meat floating about yavin one of them he recognized 
 you luke skywalker have you been checked out on the incom t 
 sir biggs put in before his friend could reply the best bush pilot inthe territories 
 the older man patted luke reassuringly on the back as they studied his waitingship something to be proud of got over a thousand hours in an incomskyhopper myself he paused a moment before going on 
 i met your father once when i was just a boy luke he was a great do all right out there if got half your skill do a damnsight better than all right 
 thank you sir try 
 no much difference between an t blueleader went on and a skyhopper his smile turned ferocious except of somewhat different nature 
 he left them and hurried toward his own ship luke had a hundred questions toask him and no time for even one 
 got to get aboard my own boat luke listen tell me your storieswhen we come back all right 
 all right i told you make it here someday biggs 
 you did his friend was moving toward a cluster of waiting fighter adjustinghis flight suit going to be like old time luke a couple of shootingstars that be stopped 
 luke laughed they used to reassure themselves with that cry when theypiloted starships of sandhills and dead logs behind the flaking pitted buildings ofanchorheadyears and years ago 
 once more luke turned toward his ship admiring its deadly lines despiteblue assurances he had to admit that it look much like an incomskyhopper artoo detoo was being snuggled into the r socket behind the fightercockpit a forlorn metal figure stood below watching the operation and shufflingnervously about 
 hold on tight see threepio was cautioning the smaller robot got tocome back if you come back who am i going to have to yell at forthreepio that query amounted to an overwhelming outburst of emotion 
 artoo beeped confidently down at his friend however as luke mounted thecockpit entry farther down the hangar he saw blue leader already set in hisacceleration chair and signaling to his ground crew another roar was added to themonstrous din filling the hangar area as ship after ship activated its engines in thatenclosed rectangle of temple the steady thunder was overpowering 
 slipping into the cockpit seat luke studied the various controls as groundattendants began wiring him via cords and umbilicals into the ship his confidenceincreased steadily the instrumentation was necessarily simplified and as blueleader had indicated much like his old skyhopper 
 something patted his helmet and he glanced left to see the crew chief leaningclose he had to shout to be heard above the deafening howl of multiple r unit of yours seems a little do you want a new one 
 luke glanced briefly back at the secured droid before replying artoo detoolooked like a permanent piece of the fighter 
 not on your life that droid and i have been through a lot together allsecure artoo the droid replied with a reassuring beep 
 as the ground chief jumped clear luke commenced the final checkout of allinstruments it slowly occurred to him what he and the others were about to that his personal feelings could override his decision to join them he was nolonger an individual functioning solely to satisfy his personal needs somethingnow bound him to every other man and woman in this hangar 
 all around him scattered scenes of were taking kidding all with the true emotion of the moment masked by efficiency luketurned away from where one pilot left a mechanic possibly a sister or wife or just afriend with a sharp passionate kiss 
 he wondered how many of them had their own little debts to settle with theempire something crackled in his helmet in response he touched a small ship began to roll forward slowly but with increasing speed toward the gapingmouth of the temple

 it is for me objected the pilot not on this mission for your interest me not politics business to be done under anygovernment and not doing it for you princess i expect to be well paid forrisking my ship and my hide 
 you worry about your reward she assured him sadly turning to money is what you what you will receive 
 on leaving the cockpit she saw luke coming forward and she spoke softly tohim in passing your friend is indeed a mercenary i wonder if he really caresabout anybody 
 luke stared after her until she disappeared into the main hold area thenwhispered i doi care then he moved into the cockpit and sat in the seatchewbacca had just vacated 
 what do you think of her han 
 solo hesitate i try not to 
 luke probably intended his response to be audible but solo overheard hismurmur of good none the less 
 still solo ventured thoughtfully got a lot of spirit to go with her know do you think possible for a princess and a guy like me 
 no luke cut him off sharply he turned and looked away 
 solo smiled at the younger jealousy uncertain in his own mind whether hehad added the comment to bait his because it was the truth 
 yavin was not a habitable world the huge gas giant was patterned with cloud formations here and there the softly lambent atmosphere wasmolded by cyclonic storms composed of winds whichboiled rolling gases up form the yavinesque troposphere it was a world of lingeringbeauty and quick death for any who might try to penetrate to its comparatively smallcore of frozen liquids 
 several of the giant numerous moons however were and of these three could support humanoid life particularly invitingwas the satellite designated by the discoverers as number four it shone likean emerald in necklace of moons rich with plant and animal life but it wasnot listed among those worlds supporting human settlement yavin was located toofar from settled regions of the galaxy 
 perhaps the latter reason or both or a combination of causes still unknown hadbeen responsible for whatever race had once risen from satellite jungles only todisappear quietly long before the first human explorer set foot on the tiny was known of them save that they left a number of impressive monuments andthat they were one of the many races which had aspired to the stars only to have theirdesperate reach fall short 
 now all that remained were the mounds and clumps formed buildings but thought they had sunk back into the dust theirartifacts and their world continued to serve an important purpose 
 strange cries and barely perceptible moans sounded from every tree and and growls and strange mutterings issued from creatures content to remainconcealed in the dense undergrowth whenever dawn broke over moon the one of its long days an especially feral chorus of shrieks and weirdlymodulated screams would resound through the thick mist 
 even stranger sounds surged continually from one particular place here laythe most impressive of those edifices which a vanished race had raised toward theheavens it was a temple a roughly pyramidal structure so colossal that it seemedimpossible it could have been built without the aid of modern gravitonic constructiontechniques yet all evidence pointed only to simple machines hand perhaps devices alien and long lost 
 while the science of this inhabitants had led them to a dead end as far asoffworld travel was concerned they had produced several discoveries which in certainways surpassed similar imperial of which involved a stillunexplained method of cutting and transporting gargantuan blocks of stone from thecrust of the moon 
 from these monstrous blocks of solid rock the massive temple had beenconstructed the jungle had scaled even its soaring crest clothing it in rich greenand brown only near its base in the temple front did the jungle slide awaycompletely to reveal a long dark entrance cut by its builders and enlarged to suit theneeds of the present occupants 
 a tiny machine its smooth metal sides and silvery hue incongruous amidst green appeared in the forest it hummed like a fat swollen beetle as itconveyed its cluster of passengers toward the open temple base crossing aconsiderable clearing it was soon swallowed up by the dark maw in the front of themassive structure leaving the jungle once more in the paws and claws of invisiblesquallers and screechers 
 the original builders would never have recognized the interior of their metal had replaced rock and poured paneling did service for chamberdivision in place of wood nor would they have been able to see the buried layersexcavated into the rock below layers which contained hangar upon hanger linked bypowerful elevators 
 a landspeeder came to a gradual stop within the temple whose first level wasthe uppermost of the hangars its engine died obediently as the vehiclesettled to the ground a noisy cluster of humans waiting nearby ceased theirconversation and rushed toward the craft 
 fortunately leia organa quickly emerged from the speeder or the man whoreached it first might have pulled her bodily from it so great was his delight at thesight of her he settled for giving her a smothering hug as his companion calledtheir own greetings 
 safe feared been killed abruptly he composed away from her and executed a formal bow when we heard aboutalderaan we were afraid that you werelost along with the rest of the population 
 all that is past history commander willard she said we have a future tolive for alderaan and its people are gone her voice turned bitter in so a person we must see that such does not happenagain 
 we have time for our sorrows commander she continued battle station has surely tracked us here 
 solo started to protest but she shut him up with logic and a stern look 
 the only explanation for the ease of our escape they sent only four tiefighters after us they could as easily have launched a hundred 
 solo had no reply for that but continued to fume silently then leia gesturedat artoo detoo 
 you must use the information locked in this r droid to form a plan of our only hope the station itself is more powerful than anyone suspected hervoice dropped if the data does not yield a weakness there will be no stoppingthem 
 luke was then treated to a sight unique in his experience unique in most rebel technicians walked up to artoo detoo positioned themselves aroundhim and gently hoisted him in their arms this was the first and probably the lasttime he would ever see a robot being carried respectfully by men 
 theoretically no weapon could penetrate the exceptionally dense stone of theancient temple but luke had seen the shattered remains of alderaan and knew thatfor those in the incredible battle station the entire moon would present simply anotherabstract problem in conversion 
 little artoo detoo rested comfortably in a place of honor his body radiatingcomputer and hookups like a metal hairdo on an array of screens andreadouts nearby the technical information stored on the submicroscopic record tapewithin the brain was being played out hours of 
 first the rush of materials was slowed and digested by more sophisticatedcomputer minds then the most critical information was turned over to humananalysts for detailed evaluation 
 all the while see threepio stood close to artoo marveling at how so muchcomplex data could be stored in the mind of so simple a droid 
 the central briefing room was located deep within the bowels of the long auditorium was dominated by a raised dais and huge electronicdisplay screen at its far end pilots navigators and a sprinkling of artoo units filledthe seats impatient and feeling very out of place han solo and chewbacca stoodas far away from the stage with its assemblage of officers and senators as scanned the crowd searching for luke despite some common sense crazy kid had gone and joined the regular pilots he see luke but herecognized the princess as she talked somberly with some bemedaled oldster 
 when a tall dignified gentleman with too many deaths on his soul moved tostand by the far side of the screen solo turned his attention to him as did everyoneelse in the room as soon as an expectant silence had gripped the crowd generaljan dodonna adjusted the tiny mike on his chest and indicated the small group seatedclose to him 
 you all know these people he intoned with quiet power they are thesenators and generals whose worlds have given us support whether open or have come to be with us in what may well prove to be the decisive let his gaze touch many in the crowd and none who were so favored remainedunmoved 
 the imperial battle station you know all have heard of is approaching from thefar side of yavin and its sun that gives us a little extra time but it must and for it can reach this moon before it can bring itsweaponry to bear on us as it did on alderaan a murmur ran through the crowd atthe mention of that world so callously obliterated 
 the station dodonna went on is heavily shielded and mounts morefirepower than half the imperial fleet but its defenses were designed to fend capital ship assaults a small one or fighter should be able toslip through its defensive screens 
 a slim supple man who resembled an older version of han solo acknowledged his presence what is it red leader 
 the man gestured toward the display screen which showed a computer portraitof the battle station pardon me for asking sir but what good are our snub fightersgoing to be against that 
 dodonna considered well the empire think a fighter is anythreat to anything except another small ship like a tie fighter or they would haveprovided tighter screens apparently convinced that their defensiveweaponry can fend off any light attacks 
 but an analysis of the plans provided by princess leia has revealed what wethink is a weakness in the design a big ship get near it but an fighter might 
 a small thermal exhaust port its size belies its importance as it appears tobe an unshielded shaft that runs directly into the main reactor system powering thestation since this serves as an emergency outlet for waste heat in the event ofreactor overproduction its usefulness would be eliminated by particle shielding adirect hit would initiate a chain reaction that will destroy the station 
 mutterings of disbelief ran through the room the more experienced the greater his expressed disbelief 
 i say your approach would be easy dodonna admonished them hegestured at the screen you must maneuver straight in down this shaft level off inthe trench and skim the surface point the target is only two meters will take a precise hit at exactly ninety degree to reach the reactor only a direct hit will start the complete reaction 
 i said the port however it is completely means no energy beams have to use proton torpedoes 
 a few of the pilots laughed humorlessly one of them was a teenaged fighterjockey seated next to luke who bore the unlikely name of wedge antilles artoodetoo was there also seated next to another artoo unit who emitted a long whistle ofhopelessness 
 a target at maximum a torpedo yet antilles impossible even for the computer 
 but not impossible protested luke i used to in myt back home not much bigger than two meters 
 is that so the rakishly uniformed youth noted derisively tell me when youwere going after your particular varmint were there a thousand other what did youcall it armed with power rifles firing up at you he shook his headsadly 
 with all that firepower on the station directed at us this will take a little morethan barnyard marksmanship believe me 
 as if to confirm antilles pessimism dodonna indicated a string of lights on schematic take special not of these emplacements aheavy concentration of firepower on the latitudinal axes was well as several densecircumpolar clusters 
 also their field generators will probably create a lot of distortion especially inand around the trench i figure that maneuverability in that sector will be less thanpoint three this produced more murmurs and a few groans from the assembly 
 remember the general went on you must achieve a direct hit yellowsquadron will cover for red on the first run green will cover blue on the questions 
 a muted buzz filled the room one man stood lean and muchso it seemed to be ready to throw away his life for something as abstract as freedom 
 what if both runs fail what happens after that 
 dodonna smiled tightly there be any after that the man noddedslowly understandingly and sat down anyone else silence now pregnantwith expectation 
 then man your ships and may the force be with you 
 like oil draining from shallow pot the seated ranks of men women andmachines rose and flowed toward the exits 
 elevators hummed busily lifting more and more deadly shapes from burieddepths to the staging area in the primary temple hangar as luke threepio and artoodetoo walked toward the hangar entrance 
 neither the bustling flight crews nor the pilots performing final checkouts northe massive sparks thrown off as power couplings were disconnected captured at the moment instead it was held by the activity of two far more familiarfigures 
 solo and chewbacca were loading a pile of small strongboxes onto an armoredlandspeeder they were completely absorbed with this activity ignoring thepreparations going all around them 
 solo glanced up briefly as luke and the robots approached then returned to hisloading luke simply watched sadly conflicting emotions careening confusedly offone another inside him solo was cocky reckless intolerant and smug he wasalso brave to a fault instructive and unfailingly cheery the combination made fora confusing a friend nonetheless 
 you got your reward luke finally observed indicating the boxes solonodded once and leaving then 
 right kid got some old debts to pay off and even if i think be fool enough to stick around here he eyed luke pretty good in a scrap kid why you come with us i could useyou 
 the mercenary gleam in eyes only made luke mad why youlook around you and see something besides yourself for a change you know to happen here what up against they could use a good pilot turning your back on them 
 solo appear upset at tirade what a reward if notaround to spend it attacking that battle station my idea of likesuicide 
 yeahtake care of yourself han luke said quietly turning to leave but iguess what best at it he started back into the hangar by the two droids 
 solo stared after him hesitated then called hey lukemay the force be withyou luke looked back to see solo wink at him he of then hewas swallowed up by moving mechanics and machinery 
 solo returned to his work lifting a stopped to see chewbacca gazingfixedly at him 
 what are you staring at gruesome i know what doing get back towork 
 slowly still eyeing his partner the wookie returned to the task of loading theheavy crates 
 sorrowful thoughts of solo vanished when luke saw the petite slim figurestanding by his ship he had been granted 
 are you sure this is what you want princess leia asked him it could be adeadly reward 
 eyes were filled with the sleek venomous metal shape more thananything 
 then wrong 
 luke looked back at her and shrugged han i thought change hismind i thought join us 
 a man must follow his own path she told him sounding now like a one can choose it for him han priorities differ from ours i wish itwere otherwise but i find it in my heart to condemn him she stood ontiptoes gave him a quick almost embarrassed kiss and turned to go may the forcebe with you 
 i only wish luke murmured to himself as he started back to his ship benwere here 
 so intent was he on thoughts of kenobi the princess and han that he the larger figure which tightly locked on to his arm he turned his initialanger gone instantly in astonishment as he recognized the figure 
 luke the slightly older man exclaimed i believe it you gethere are you going out with us 
 biggs luke embraced his friend warmly of course be up there withyou his smile faded slightly i got a choice anymore then hebrightened again listen have i got some stories to tell you 
 the steady whooping and laughing the two made was in marked contrast to thesolemnity with which the other men and women in the hangar went about theirbusiness the commotion attracted the attention of an older man knownto the younger pilot only as blue leader 
 his face wrinkled with curiosity as he approached the two younger men it wasa face scorched by the same fire that flickered in his eyes a blaze kindled not byrevolutionary fervor but by years of living through and witnessing far too muchinjustice behind that fatherly visage a raging demon fought to escape soon verysoon he would be free to let it loose 
 now he was interested in these two young men who in a few hours were likelyto be particles of frozen meat floating about yavin one of them he recognized 
 you luke skywalker have you been checked out on the incom t 
 sir biggs put in before his friend could reply the best bush pilot inthe territories 
 the older man patted luke reassuringly on the back as they studied his waitingship something to be proud of got over a thousand hours in an incomskyhopper myself he paused a moment before going on 
 i met your father once when i was just a boy luke he was a great do all right out there if got half your skill do a damnsight better than all right 
 thank you sir try 
 no much difference between an t blueleader went on and a skyhopper his smile turned ferocious except of somewhat different nature 
 he left them and hurried toward his own ship luke had a hundred questions toask him and no time for even one 
 got to get aboard my own boat luke listen tell me your storieswhen we come back all right 
 all right i told you make it here someday biggs 
 you did his friend was moving toward a cluster of waiting fighter adjustinghis flight suit going to be like old time luke a couple of shootingstars that be stopped 
 luke laughed they used to reassure themselves with that cry when theypiloted starships of sandhills and dead logs behind the flaking pitted buildings ofanchorheadyears and years ago 
 once more luke turned toward his ship admiring its deadly lines despiteblue assurances he had to admit that it look much like an incomskyhopper artoo detoo was being snuggled into the r socket behind the fightercockpit a forlorn metal figure stood below watching the operation and shufflingnervously about 
 hold on tight see threepio was cautioning the smaller robot got tocome back if you come back who am i going to have to yell at forthreepio that query amounted to an overwhelming outburst of emotion 
 artoo beeped confidently down at his friend however as luke mounted thecockpit entry farther down the hangar he saw blue leader already set in hisacceleration chair and signaling to his ground crew another roar was added to themonstrous din filling the hangar area as ship after ship activated its engines in thatenclosed rectangle of temple the steady thunder was overpowering 
 slipping into the cockpit seat luke studied the various controls as groundattendants began wiring him via cords and umbilicals into the ship his confidenceincreased steadily the instrumentation was necessarily simplified and as blueleader had indicated much like his old skyhopper 
 something patted his helmet and he glanced left to see the crew chief leaningclose he had to shout to be heard above the deafening howl of multiple r unit of yours seems a little do you want a new one 
 luke glanced briefly back at the secured droid before replying artoo detoolooked like a permanent piece of the fighter 
 not on your life that droid and i have been through a lot together allsecure artoo the droid replied with a reassuring beep 
 as the ground chief jumped clear luke commenced the final checkout of allinstruments it slowly occurred to him what he and the others were about to that his personal feelings could override his decision to join them he was nolonger an individual functioning solely to satisfy his personal needs somethingnow bound him to every other man and woman in this hangar 
 all around him scattered scenes of were taking kidding all with the true emotion of the moment masked by efficiency luketurned away from where one pilot left a mechanic possibly a sister or wife or just afriend with a sharp passionate kiss 
 he wondered how many of them had their own little debts to settle with theempire something crackled in his helmet in response he touched a small ship began to roll forward slowly but with increasing speed toward the gapingmouth of the temple

 the only young people remaining in the drawing room not counting the young lady visitor and the countess eldest daughter who was four years older than her sister and behaved already like a person were nicholas and sonya the niece sonya was a slender little brunette with a tender look in her eyes which were veiled by long lashes thick black plaits coiling twice round her head and a tawny tint in her complexion and especially in the color of her slender but graceful and muscular arms and neck by the grace of her movements by the softness and flexibility of her small limbs and by a certain coyness and reserve of manner she reminded one of a pretty kitten which promises to become a beautiful little cat she evidently considered it proper to show an interest in the general conversation by smiling but in spite of herself her eyes under their thick long lashes watched her cousin who was going to join the army with such passionate girlish adoration that her smile could not for a single instant impose upon anyone and it was clear that the kitten had settled down only to spring up with more energy and again play with her cousin as soon as they too could like natasha and boris escape from the drawing room 
 ah yes my dear said the count addressing the visitor and pointing to nicholas his friend boris has become an officer and so for sake he is leaving the university and me his old father and entering the military service my dear and there was a place and everything waiting for him in the archives department that friendship remarked the count in an inquiring tone 
 but they say that war has been declared replied the visitor 
 been saying so a long while said the count and say so again and again and that will be the end of it my dear friendship for you he repeated joining the hussars 
 the visitor not knowing what to say shook her head 
 not at all from friendship declared nicholas flaring up and turning away as if from a shameful aspersion it is not from friendship at all i simply feel that the army is my vocation 
 he glanced at his cousin and the young lady visitor and they were both regarding him with a smile of approbation 
 schubert the colonel of the pavlograd hussars is dining with us today he has been here on leave and is taking nicholas back with him it be helped said the count shrugging his shoulders and speaking playfully of a matter that evidently distressed him 
 i have already told you papa said his son that if you wish to let me go stay but i know i am no use anywhere except in the army i am not a diplomat or a government clerk i know how to hide what i feel as he spoke he kept glancing with the flirtatiousness of a handsome youth at sonya and the young lady visitor 
 the little kitten feasting her eyes on him seemed ready at any moment to start her gambols again and display her kittenish nature 
 all right all right said the old count he always flares up this buonaparte has turned all their heads they all think of how he rose from an ensign and became emperor well well god grant it he added not noticing his sarcastic smile 
 the elders began talking about bonaparte julie karagina turned to young rostov 
 what a pity you at the arkharovs on thursday it was so dull without you said she giving him a tender smile 
 the young man flattered sat down nearer to her with a coquettish smile and engaged the smiling julie in a confidential conversation without at all noticing that his involuntary smile had stabbed the heart of sonya who blushed and smiled unnaturally in the midst of his talk he glanced round at her she gave him a passionately angry glance and hardly able to restrain her tears and maintain the artificial smile on her lips she got up and left the room all nicholas animation vanished he waited for the first pause in the conversation and then with a distressed face left the room to find sonya 
 how plainly all these young people wear their hearts on their sleeves said anna mikhaylovna pointing to nicholas as he went out cousinage dangereux voisinage she added 
 cousinhood is a dangerous neighborhood 
 yes said the countess when the brightness these young people had brought into the room had vanished and as if answering a question no one had put but which was always in her mind and how much suffering how much anxiety one has had to go through that we might rejoice in them now and yet really the anxiety is greater now than the joy one is always always anxious especially just at this age so dangerous both for girls and boys 
 it all depends on the bringing up remarked the visitor 
 yes quite right continued the countess till now i have always thank god been my friend and had their full confidence said she repeating the mistake of so many parents who imagine that their children have no secrets from them i know i shall always be my daughters first confidante and that if nicholas with his impulsive nature does get into mischief a boy help it he will all the same never be like those petersburg young men 
 yes they are splendid splendid youngsters chimed in the count who always solved questions that seemed to him perplexing by deciding that everything was splendid just fancy wants to be an hussar one to do my dear 
 what a charming creature your younger girl is said the visitor a little volcano 
 yes a regular volcano said the count takes after me and what a voice she has though my daughter i tell the truth when i say be a singer a second salomoni we have engaged an italian to give her lessons 
 she too young i have heard that it harms the voice to train it at that age 
 oh no not at all too young replied the count why our mothers used to be married at twelve or thirteen 
 and in love with boris already just fancy said the countess with a gentle smile looking at boris and went on evidently concerned with a thought that always occupied her now you see if i were to be severe with her and to forbid it goodness knows what they might be up to on the sly she meant that they would be kissing but as it is i know every word she utters she will come running to me of her own accord in the evening and tell me everything perhaps i spoil her but really that seems the best plan with her elder sister i was stricter 
 yes i was brought up quite differently remarked the handsome elder daughter countess vera with a smile 
 but the smile did not enhance beauty as smiles generally do on the contrary it gave her an unnatural and therefore unpleasant expression vera was not at all stupid quick at learning was well brought up and had a pleasant voice what she said was true and appropriate yet strange to say everyone the visitors and countess alike turned to look at her as if wondering why she had said it and they all felt awkward 
 people are always too clever with their eldest children and try to make something exceptional of them said the visitor 
 the good of denying it my dear our dear countess was too clever with vera said the count well what of that turned out splendidly all the same he added winking at vera
