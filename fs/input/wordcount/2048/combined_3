 chapter 
 
 into the primitive 
 
 
 old longings nomadic leap 
 chafing at chain 
 again from its brumal sleep 
 wakens the ferine strain 
 
 buck did not read the newspapers or he would have known that trouble was brewing not alone for himself but for every tidewater dog strong of muscle and with warm long hair from puget sound to san diego because men groping in the arctic darkness had found a yellow metal and because steamship and transportation companies were booming the find thousands of men were rushing into the northland these men wanted dogs and the dogs they wanted were heavy dogs with strong muscles by which to toil and furry coats to protect them from the frost 
 buck lived at a big house in the santa clara valley judge place it was called it stood back from the road among the trees through which glimpses could be caught of the wide cool veranda that ran around its four sides the house was approached by graveled driveways which wound about through lawns and under the interlacing boughs of tall poplars at the rear things were on even a more spacious scale than at the front there were great stables where a dozen grooms and boys held forth rows of servants cottages an endless and orderly array of outhouses long grape arbors green pastures orchards and berry patches then there was the pumping plant for the artesian well and the big cement tank where judge boys took their morning plunge and kept cool in the hot afternoon 
 and over this great demesne buck ruled here he was born and here he had lived the four years of his life it was true there were other dogs there could not but be other dogs on so vast a place but they did not count they came and went resided in the populous kennels or lived obscurely in the recesses of the house after the fashion of toots the japanese pug or ysabel the mexican hairless strange creatures that rarely put nose out of doors or set foot to ground on the other hand there were the fox terriers a score of them at least who yelped fearful promises at toots and ysabel looking out of the windows at them and protected by a legion of housemaids armed with brooms and mops 
 but buck was neither house dog nor kennel dog the whole realm was his he plunged into the swimming tank or went hunting with the sons he escorted mollie and alice the daughters on long twilight or early morning rambles on wintry nights he lay at the feet before the roaring library fire he carried the grandsons on his back or rolled them in the grass and guarded their footsteps through wild adventures down to the fountain in the stable yard and even beyond where the paddocks were and the berry patches among the terriers he stalked imperiously and toots and ysabel he utterly ignored for he was over all creeping crawling flying things of judge place humans included 
 his father elmo a huge st bernard had been the inseparable companion and buck bid fair to follow in the way of his father he was not so weighed only one hundred and forty his mother she had been a scotch shepherd dog nevertheless one hundred and forty pounds to which was added the dignity that comes of good living and universal respect enabled him to carry himself in right royal fashion during the four years since his puppyhood he had lived the life of a sated aristocrat he had a fine pride in himself was even a trifle egotistical as country gentlemen sometimes become because of their insular situation but he had saved himself by not becoming a mere pampered house dog hunting and kindred outdoor delights had kept down the fat and hardened his muscles and to him as to the races the love of water had been a tonic and a health preserver 
 and this was the manner of dog buck was in the fall of when the klondike strike dragged men from all the world into the frozen north but buck did not read the newspapers and he did not know that manuel one of the helpers was an undesirable acquaintance manuel had one besetting sin he loved to play chinese lottery also in his gambling he had one besetting in a system and this made his damnation certain for to play a system requires money while the wages of a helper do not lap over the needs of a wife and numerous progeny 
 the judge was at a meeting of the raisin growers association and the boys were busy organizing an athletic club on the memorable night of treachery no one saw him and buck go off through the orchard on what buck imagined was merely a stroll and with the exception of a solitary man no one saw them arrive at the little flag station known as college park this man talked with manuel and money chinked between them 
 you might wrap up the goods before you deliver them the stranger said gruffly and manuel doubled a piece of stout rope around neck under the collar 
 twist it and choke him plenty said manuel and the stranger grunted a ready affirmative 
 buck had accepted the rope with quiet dignity to be sure it was an unwonted performance but he had learned to trust in men he knew and to give them credit for a wisdom that outreached his own but when the ends of the rope were placed in the hands he growled menacingly he had merely intimated his displeasure in his pride believing that to intimate was to command but to his surprise the rope tightened around his neck shutting off his breath in a quick rage he sprang at the man who met him halfway grappled him close by the throat and with a deft twist threw him over on his back then the rope tightened mercilessly while buck struggled in a fury his tongue lolling out of his mouth and his great chest panting futilely never in all his life had he been so vilely treated and never in all his life had he been so angry but his strength ebbed his eyes glazed and he knew nothing when the train was flagged and the two men threw him into the baggage car 
 the next he knew he was dimly aware that his tongue was hurting and that he was being jolted along in some kind of a conveyance the hoarse shriek of a locomotive whistling a crossing told him where he was he had traveled too often with the judge not to know the sensation of riding in a baggage car he opened his eyes and into them came the unbridled anger of a kidnaped king the man sprang for his throat but buck was too quick for him his jaws closed on the hand nor did they relax till his senses were choked out of him once more 
 yep has fits the man said hiding his mangled hand from the baggage man who had been attracted by the sounds of struggle taking him up for the boss to frisco a crack dog doctor there thinks that he can cure him 
 concerning that ride the man spoke most eloquently for himself in a little shed back of a saloon on the san francisco water front 
 all i get is fifty for it he grumbled and i do it over for a thousand cold cash 
 his hand was wrapped in a bloody handkerchief and the right trouser leg was ripped from knee to ankle 
 how much did the other mug get the demanded 
 a hundred was the reply take a sou less so help me 
 that makes a hundred and fifty the calculated and worth it or a squarehead 
 the kidnaper undid the bloody wrappings and looked at his lacerated hand if i get hydrophobia 
 be because you was born to hang laughed the here lend me a hand before you pull your freight he added 
 dazed suffering intolerable pain from throat and tongue with the life half throttled out of him buck attempted to face his tormentors but he was thrown down and choked repeatedly till they succeeded in filing the heavy brass collar from off his neck then the rope was removed and he was flung into a crate 
 there he lay for the remainder of the weary night nursing his wrath and wounded pride he could not understand what it all meant what did they want with him these strange men why were they keeping him pent up in this narrow crate he did not know why but he felt oppressed by the vague sense of impending calamity several times during the night he sprang to his feet when the shed door rattled open expecting to see the judge or the boys at least but each time it was the bulging face of the that peered in at him by the sickly light of a tallow candle and each time the joyful bark that trembled in throat was twisted into a savage growl 
 but the let him alone and in the morning four men entered and picked up the crate more tormentors buck decided for they were creatures ragged and unkempt and he stormed and raged at them through the bars they only laughed and poked sticks at him which he promptly assailed with his teeth till he realized that was what they wanted whereupon he lay down sullenly and allowed the crate to be lifted into a wagon then he and the crate in which he was imprisoned began a passage through many hands clerks in the express office took charge of him he was carted about in another wagon a truck carried him with an assortment of boxes and parcels upon a ferry steamer he was trucked off the steamer into a great railway depot and finally he was deposited in an express car 
 for two days and nights this express car was dragged along at the tail of shrieking locomotives and for two days and nights buck neither ate nor drank in his anger he had met the first advances of the express messengers with growls and they had retaliated by teasing him when he flung himself against the bars quivering and frothing they laughed at him and taunted him they growled and barked like detestable dogs mewed and flapped their arms and crowed it was all very silly he knew but therefore the more outrage to his dignity and his anger waxed and waxed he did not mind the hunger so much but the lack of water caused him severe suffering and fanned his wrath to for that matter and finely sensitive the ill treatment had flung him into a fever which was fed by the inflammation of his parched and swollen throat and tongue 
 he was glad for one thing the rope was off his neck that had given them an unfair advantage but now that it was off he would show them they would never get another rope around his neck upon that he was resolved for two days and nights he neither ate nor drank and during those two days and nights of torment he accumulated a fund of wrath that boded ill for whoever first fell foul of him his eyes turned bloodshot and he was metamorphosed into a raging fiend so changed was he that the judge himself would not have recognized him and the express messengers breathed with relief when they bundled him off the train at seattle 
 four men gingerly carried the crate from the wagon into a small back yard a stout man with a red sweater that sagged generously at the neck came out and signed the book for the driver that was the man buck divined the next tormentor and he hurled himself savagely against the bars the man smiled grimly and brought a hatchet and a club 
 you going to take him out now the driver asked 
 sure the man replied driving the hatchet into the crate for a pry 
 there was an instantaneous scattering of the four men who had carried it in and from safe perches on top the wall they prepared to watch the performance 
 buck rushed at the splintering wood sinking his teeth into it surging and wrestling with it wherever the hatchet fell on the outside he was there on the inside snarling and growling as furiously anxious to get out as the man in the red sweater was calmly intent on getting him out 
 now you devil he said when he had made an opening sufficient for the passage of body at the same time he dropped the hatchet and shifted the club to his right hand 
 and buck was truly a devil as he drew himself together for the spring hair bristling mouth foaming a mad glitter in his bloodshot eyes straight at the man he launched his one hundred and forty pounds of fury surcharged with the pent passion of two days and nights in just as his jaws were about to close on the man he received a shock that checked his body and brought his teeth together with an agonizing clip he whirled over fetching the ground on his back and side he had never been struck by a club in his life and did not understand with a snarl that was part bark and more scream he was again on his feet and launched into the air and again the shock came and he was brought crushingly to the ground this time he was aware that it was the club but his madness knew no caution a dozen times he charged and as often the club broke the charge and smashed him down 
 after a particularly fierce blow he crawled to his feet too dazed to rush he staggered limply about the blood flowing from nose and mouth and ears his beautiful coat sprayed and flecked with bloody slaver then the man advanced and deliberately dealt him a frightful blow on the nose all the pain he had endured was nothing compared with the exquisite agony of this with a roar that was almost in its ferocity he again hurled himself at the man but the man shifting the club from right to left cooly caught him by the under jaw at the same time wrenching downward and backward buck described a complete circle in the air and half of another then crashed to the ground on his head and chest 
 for the last time he rushed the man struck the shrewd blow he had purposely withheld for so long and buck crumpled up and went down knocked utterly senseless 
 no slouch at what i say one of the men on the wall cried with enthusiasm 
 druther break cayuses any day and twice on sundays was the reply of the driver as he climbed on the wagon and started the horses 
 senses came back to him but not his strength he lay where he had fallen and from there he watched the man in the red sweater 
 answers to the name of buck the man soliloquized quoting from the letter which had announced the consignment of the crate and contents well buck my boy he went on in a genial voice had our little ruction and the best thing we can do is to let it go at that learned your place and i know mine be a good dog and all will go well and the goose hang high be a bad dog and whale the stuffing outa you understand 
 as he spoke he fearlessly patted the head he had so mercilessly pounded and though hair involuntarily bristled at touch of the hand he endured it without protest when the man brought him water he drank eagerly and later bolted a generous meal of raw meat chuck by chunk from the hand 
 he was beaten he knew that but he was not broken he saw once for all that he stood no chance against a man with a club he had learned the lesson and in all his afterlife he never forgot it that club was a revelation it was his introduction to the reign of primitive law and he met the introduction halfway the facts of life took on a fiercer aspect and while he faced that aspect uncowed he faced it with all the latent cunning of his nature aroused as the days went by other dogs came in crates and at the ends of ropes some docilely and some raging and roaring as he had come and one and all he watched them pass under the dominion of the man in the red sweater again and again as he looked at each brutal performance the lesson was driven home to buck a man with a club was a lawgiver a master to be obeyed though not necessarily conciliated of this last buck was never guilty though he did see beaten dogs that fawned upon the man and wagged their tails and licked his hand also he saw one dog that would neither conciliate nor obey finally killed in the struggle for mastery 
 now and again men came strangers who talked excitedly wheedlingly and in all kinds of fashions to the man in the red sweater and at such times that money passed between them the strangers took one or more of the dogs away with them buck wondered where they went for they never came back but the fear of the future was strong upon him and he was glad each time when he was not selected 
 yet his time came in the end in the form of a little weazened man who spat broken english and many strange and uncouth exclamations which buck could not understand

 chapter 
 
 into the primitive 
 
 
 old longings nomadic leap 
 chafing at chain 
 again from its brumal sleep 
 wakens the ferine strain 
 
 buck did not read the newspapers or he would have known that trouble was brewing not alone for himself but for every tidewater dog strong of muscle and with warm long hair from puget sound to san diego because men groping in the arctic darkness had found a yellow metal and because steamship and transportation companies were booming the find thousands of men were rushing into the northland these men wanted dogs and the dogs they wanted were heavy dogs with strong muscles by which to toil and furry coats to protect them from the frost 
 buck lived at a big house in the santa clara valley judge place it was called it stood back from the road among the trees through which glimpses could be caught of the wide cool veranda that ran around its four sides the house was approached by graveled driveways which wound about through lawns and under the interlacing boughs of tall poplars at the rear things were on even a more spacious scale than at the front there were great stables where a dozen grooms and boys held forth rows of servants cottages an endless and orderly array of outhouses long grape arbors green pastures orchards and berry patches then there was the pumping plant for the artesian well and the big cement tank where judge boys took their morning plunge and kept cool in the hot afternoon 
 and over this great demesne buck ruled here he was born and here he had lived the four years of his life it was true there were other dogs there could not but be other dogs on so vast a place but they did not count they came and went resided in the populous kennels or lived obscurely in the recesses of the house after the fashion of toots the japanese pug or ysabel the mexican hairless strange creatures that rarely put nose out of doors or set foot to ground on the other hand there were the fox terriers a score of them at least who yelped fearful promises at toots and ysabel looking out of the windows at them and protected by a legion of housemaids armed with brooms and mops 
 but buck was neither house dog nor kennel dog the whole realm was his he plunged into the swimming tank or went hunting with the sons he escorted mollie and alice the daughters on long twilight or early morning rambles on wintry nights he lay at the feet before the roaring library fire he carried the grandsons on his back or rolled them in the grass and guarded their footsteps through wild adventures down to the fountain in the stable yard and even beyond where the paddocks were and the berry patches among the terriers he stalked imperiously and toots and ysabel he utterly ignored for he was over all creeping crawling flying things of judge place humans included 
 his father elmo a huge st bernard had been the inseparable companion and buck bid fair to follow in the way of his father he was not so weighed only one hundred and forty his mother she had been a scotch shepherd dog nevertheless one hundred and forty pounds to which was added the dignity that comes of good living and universal respect enabled him to carry himself in right royal fashion during the four years since his puppyhood he had lived the life of a sated aristocrat he had a fine pride in himself was even a trifle egotistical as country gentlemen sometimes become because of their insular situation but he had saved himself by not becoming a mere pampered house dog hunting and kindred outdoor delights had kept down the fat and hardened his muscles and to him as to the races the love of water had been a tonic and a health preserver 
 and this was the manner of dog buck was in the fall of when the klondike strike dragged men from all the world into the frozen north but buck did not read the newspapers and he did not know that manuel one of the helpers was an undesirable acquaintance manuel had one besetting sin he loved to play chinese lottery also in his gambling he had one besetting in a system and this made his damnation certain for to play a system requires money while the wages of a helper do not lap over the needs of a wife and numerous progeny 
 the judge was at a meeting of the raisin growers association and the boys were busy organizing an athletic club on the memorable night of treachery no one saw him and buck go off through the orchard on what buck imagined was merely a stroll and with the exception of a solitary man no one saw them arrive at the little flag station known as college park this man talked with manuel and money chinked between them 
 you might wrap up the goods before you deliver them the stranger said gruffly and manuel doubled a piece of stout rope around neck under the collar 
 twist it and choke him plenty said manuel and the stranger grunted a ready affirmative 
 buck had accepted the rope with quiet dignity to be sure it was an unwonted performance but he had learned to trust in men he knew and to give them credit for a wisdom that outreached his own but when the ends of the rope were placed in the hands he growled menacingly he had merely intimated his displeasure in his pride believing that to intimate was to command but to his surprise the rope tightened around his neck shutting off his breath in a quick rage he sprang at the man who met him halfway grappled him close by the throat and with a deft twist threw him over on his back then the rope tightened mercilessly while buck struggled in a fury his tongue lolling out of his mouth and his great chest panting futilely never in all his life had he been so vilely treated and never in all his life had he been so angry but his strength ebbed his eyes glazed and he knew nothing when the train was flagged and the two men threw him into the baggage car 
 the next he knew he was dimly aware that his tongue was hurting and that he was being jolted along in some kind of a conveyance the hoarse shriek of a locomotive whistling a crossing told him where he was he had traveled too often with the judge not to know the sensation of riding in a baggage car he opened his eyes and into them came the unbridled anger of a kidnaped king the man sprang for his throat but buck was too quick for him his jaws closed on the hand nor did they relax till his senses were choked out of him once more 
 yep has fits the man said hiding his mangled hand from the baggage man who had been attracted by the sounds of struggle taking him up for the boss to frisco a crack dog doctor there thinks that he can cure him 
 concerning that ride the man spoke most eloquently for himself in a little shed back of a saloon on the san francisco water front 
 all i get is fifty for it he grumbled and i do it over for a thousand cold cash 
 his hand was wrapped in a bloody handkerchief and the right trouser leg was ripped from knee to ankle 
 how much did the other mug get the demanded 
 a hundred was the reply take a sou less so help me 
 that makes a hundred and fifty the calculated and worth it or a squarehead 
 the kidnaper undid the bloody wrappings and looked at his lacerated hand if i get hydrophobia 
 be because you was born to hang laughed the here lend me a hand before you pull your freight he added 
 dazed suffering intolerable pain from throat and tongue with the life half throttled out of him buck attempted to face his tormentors but he was thrown down and choked repeatedly till they succeeded in filing the heavy brass collar from off his neck then the rope was removed and he was flung into a crate 
 there he lay for the remainder of the weary night nursing his wrath and wounded pride he could not understand what it all meant what did they want with him these strange men why were they keeping him pent up in this narrow crate he did not know why but he felt oppressed by the vague sense of impending calamity several times during the night he sprang to his feet when the shed door rattled open expecting to see the judge or the boys at least but each time it was the bulging face of the that peered in at him by the sickly light of a tallow candle and each time the joyful bark that trembled in throat was twisted into a savage growl 
 but the let him alone and in the morning four men entered and picked up the crate more tormentors buck decided for they were creatures ragged and unkempt and he stormed and raged at them through the bars they only laughed and poked sticks at him which he promptly assailed with his teeth till he realized that was what they wanted whereupon he lay down sullenly and allowed the crate to be lifted into a wagon then he and the crate in which he was imprisoned began a passage through many hands clerks in the express office took charge of him he was carted about in another wagon a truck carried him with an assortment of boxes and parcels upon a ferry steamer he was trucked off the steamer into a great railway depot and finally he was deposited in an express car 
 for two days and nights this express car was dragged along at the tail of shrieking locomotives and for two days and nights buck neither ate nor drank in his anger he had met the first advances of the express messengers with growls and they had retaliated by teasing him when he flung himself against the bars quivering and frothing they laughed at him and taunted him they growled and barked like detestable dogs mewed and flapped their arms and crowed it was all very silly he knew but therefore the more outrage to his dignity and his anger waxed and waxed he did not mind the hunger so much but the lack of water caused him severe suffering and fanned his wrath to for that matter and finely sensitive the ill treatment had flung him into a fever which was fed by the inflammation of his parched and swollen throat and tongue 
 he was glad for one thing the rope was off his neck that had given them an unfair advantage but now that it was off he would show them they would never get another rope around his neck upon that he was resolved for two days and nights he neither ate nor drank and during those two days and nights of torment he accumulated a fund of wrath that boded ill for whoever first fell foul of him his eyes turned bloodshot and he was metamorphosed into a raging fiend so changed was he that the judge himself would not have recognized him and the express messengers breathed with relief when they bundled him off the train at seattle 
 four men gingerly carried the crate from the wagon into a small back yard a stout man with a red sweater that sagged generously at the neck came out and signed the book for the driver that was the man buck divined the next tormentor and he hurled himself savagely against the bars the man smiled grimly and brought a hatchet and a club 
 you going to take him out now the driver asked 
 sure the man replied driving the hatchet into the crate for a pry 
 there was an instantaneous scattering of the four men who had carried it in and from safe perches on top the wall they prepared to watch the performance 
 buck rushed at the splintering wood sinking his teeth into it surging and wrestling with it wherever the hatchet fell on the outside he was there on the inside snarling and growling as furiously anxious to get out as the man in the red sweater was calmly intent on getting him out 
 now you devil he said when he had made an opening sufficient for the passage of body at the same time he dropped the hatchet and shifted the club to his right hand 
 and buck was truly a devil as he drew himself together for the spring hair bristling mouth foaming a mad glitter in his bloodshot eyes straight at the man he launched his one hundred and forty pounds of fury surcharged with the pent passion of two days and nights in just as his jaws were about to close on the man he received a shock that checked his body and brought his teeth together with an agonizing clip he whirled over fetching the ground on his back and side he had never been struck by a club in his life and did not understand with a snarl that was part bark and more scream he was again on his feet and launched into the air and again the shock came and he was brought crushingly to the ground this time he was aware that it was the club but his madness knew no caution a dozen times he charged and as often the club broke the charge and smashed him down 
 after a particularly fierce blow he crawled to his feet too dazed to rush he staggered limply about the blood flowing from nose and mouth and ears his beautiful coat sprayed and flecked with bloody slaver then the man advanced and deliberately dealt him a frightful blow on the nose all the pain he had endured was nothing compared with the exquisite agony of this with a roar that was almost in its ferocity he again hurled himself at the man but the man shifting the club from right to left cooly caught him by the under jaw at the same time wrenching downward and backward buck described a complete circle in the air and half of another then crashed to the ground on his head and chest 
 for the last time he rushed the man struck the shrewd blow he had purposely withheld for so long and buck crumpled up and went down knocked utterly senseless 
 no slouch at what i say one of the men on the wall cried with enthusiasm 
 druther break cayuses any day and twice on sundays was the reply of the driver as he climbed on the wagon and started the horses 
 senses came back to him but not his strength he lay where he had fallen and from there he watched the man in the red sweater 
 answers to the name of buck the man soliloquized quoting from the letter which had announced the consignment of the crate and contents well buck my boy he went on in a genial voice had our little ruction and the best thing we can do is to let it go at that learned your place and i know mine be a good dog and all will go well and the goose hang high be a bad dog and whale the stuffing outa you understand 
 as he spoke he fearlessly patted the head he had so mercilessly pounded and though hair involuntarily bristled at touch of the hand he endured it without protest when the man brought him water he drank eagerly and later bolted a generous meal of raw meat chuck by chunk from the hand 
 he was beaten he knew that but he was not broken he saw once for all that he stood no chance against a man with a club he had learned the lesson and in all his afterlife he never forgot it that club was a revelation it was his introduction to the reign of primitive law and he met the introduction halfway the facts of life took on a fiercer aspect and while he faced that aspect uncowed he faced it with all the latent cunning of his nature aroused as the days went by other dogs came in crates and at the ends of ropes some docilely and some raging and roaring as he had come and one and all he watched them pass under the dominion of the man in the red sweater again and again as he looked at each brutal performance the lesson was driven home to buck a man with a club was a lawgiver a master to be obeyed though not necessarily conciliated of this last buck was never guilty though he did see beaten dogs that fawned upon the man and wagged their tails and licked his hand also he saw one dog that would neither conciliate nor obey finally killed in the struggle for mastery 
 now and again men came strangers who talked excitedly wheedlingly and in all kinds of fashions to the man in the red sweater and at such times that money passed between them the strangers took one or more of the dogs away with them buck wondered where they went for they never came back but the fear of the future was strong upon him and he was glad each time when he was not selected 
 yet his time came in the end in the form of a little weazened man who spat broken english and many strange and uncouth exclamations which buck could not understand 
 sacredam he cried when his eyes lit upon buck dat one dam bully dog eh how much 
 three hundred and a present at that was the prompt reply of the man in the red sweater and seeing government money you got no kick coming eh perrault 
 perrault grinned considering that the price of dogs had been boomed skyward by the unwonted demand it was not an unfair sum for so fine an animal the canadian government would be no loser nor would its dispatches travel the slower perrault knew dogs when he looked at buck he knew that he was one in a in ten thousand he commented mentally

 part 
 
 int cabin night 
 a dark empty room 
 the door bursts open a man and woman enter drunk and giggling horny as hell no sooner is the door shut than all over each other ripping at clothes pawing at flesh mouths locked together 
 he gropes for a lamp tries to turn it on knocks it over instead hell with it got more urgent things to do like getting her blouse open and his hands on her breasts she arches moaning fumbling with his fly he slams her against the wall ripping her skirt we hear fabric tear 
 he enters her right then and there roughly up against the wall she cries out hitting her head against the wall but not caring grinding against him clawing his back shivering with the sensations running through her he carries her across the room with her legs wrapped around him they fall onto the bed 
 camera pulls back exiting through the window traveling smoothly outside 
 ext cabin night 
 to reveal the bungalow remote in a wooded area the lovers cries spilling into the night 
 and we drift down a wooded path the sounds of rutting passion growing fainter mingling now with the night sounds of crickets and hoot owls 
 and we begin to hear faint music in the woods tinny and incongruous and still we keep pulling back until 
 a car is revealed a plymouth parked in a clearing 
 int plymouth night 
 andy dufresne wire rim glasses suit under normal circumstances a respectable solid citizen hardly dangerous perhaps even meek but these circumstances are far from normal he is disheveled unshaven and very drunk a cigarette smolders in his mouth his eyes flinty and hard are riveted to the bungalow up the path 
 he can hear them fucking from here 
 he raises a bottle of bourbon and knocks it back the radio 
 plays softly painfully romantic taunting him 
 you stepped out of a dream you are too wonderful to be what you seem 
 he opens the glove compartment pulls out an object wrapped in a rag he lays it in his lap and unwraps it carefully 
 revealing a revolver oily black evil 
 he grabs a box of bullets spills them everywhere all over the seats and floor clumsy he picks bullets off his lap loading them into the gun one by one methodical and grim six in the chamber his gaze goes back to the bungalow 
 he shuts off the radio abrupt silence except for the distant lovers moans he takes another shot of bourbon courage then opens the door and steps from the car 
 ext plymouth night 
 his wingtip shoes crunch on gravel loose bullets scatter to the ground the bourbon bottle drops and shatters 
 he starts up the path unsteady on his feet the closer he gets the louder the lovemaking becomes louder and more frenzied the lovers are reaching a climax their sounds of passion degenerating into rhythmic gasps and grunts 
 woman 
 oh god 
 andy lurches to a stop listening the woman cries out in 
 orgasm the sound slams into brain like an icepick he 
 shuts his eyes tightly wishing the sound would stop 
 it finally does dying away like a siren until all left 
 is the shallow gasping and panting of we hear 
 languorous laughter moans of satisfaction 
 woman 
 oh sooo the best i ever had 
 andy just stands and listens devastated he look like much of a killer now just a sad little man on a dirt path in the woods tears streaming down his face a loaded gun held loosely at his side a pathetic figure really

 int cabin night 
 a dark empty room 
 the door bursts open a man and woman enter drunk and giggling horny as hell no sooner is the door shut than all over each other ripping at clothes pawing at flesh mouths locked together 
 he gropes for a lamp tries to turn it on knocks it over instead hell with it got more urgent things to do like getting her blouse open and his hands on her breasts she arches moaning fumbling with his fly he slams her against the wall ripping her skirt we hear fabric tear 
 he enters her right then and there roughly up against the wall she cries out hitting her head against the wall but not caring grinding against him clawing his back shivering with the sensations running through her he carries her across the room with her legs wrapped around him they fall onto the bed 
 camera pulls back exiting through the window traveling smoothly outside 
 ext cabin night 
 to reveal the bungalow remote in a wooded area the lovers cries spilling into the night 
 and we drift down a wooded path the sounds of rutting passion growing fainter mingling now with the night sounds of crickets and hoot owls 
 and we begin to hear faint music in the woods tinny and incongruous and still we keep pulling back until 
 a car is revealed a plymouth parked in a clearing 
 int plymouth night 
 andy dufresne wire rim glasses suit under normal circumstances a respectable solid citizen hardly dangerous perhaps even meek but these circumstances are far from normal he is disheveled unshaven and very drunk a cigarette smolders in his mouth his eyes flinty and hard are riveted to the bungalow up the path 
 he can hear them fucking from here 
 he raises a bottle of bourbon and knocks it back the radio 
 plays softly painfully romantic taunting him 
 you stepped out of a dream you are too wonderful to be what you seem 
 he opens the glove compartment pulls out an object wrapped in a rag he lays it in his lap and unwraps it carefully 
 revealing a revolver oily black evil 
 he grabs a box of bullets spills them everywhere all over the seats and floor clumsy he picks bullets off his lap loading them into the gun one by one methodical and grim six in the chamber his gaze goes back to the bungalow 
 he shuts off the radio abrupt silence except for the distant lovers moans he takes another shot of bourbon courage then opens the door and steps from the car 
 ext plymouth night 
 his wingtip shoes crunch on gravel loose bullets scatter to the ground the bourbon bottle drops and shatters 
 he starts up the path unsteady on his feet the closer he gets the louder the lovemaking becomes louder and more frenzied the lovers are reaching a climax their sounds of passion degenerating into rhythmic gasps and grunts 
 woman 
 oh god 
 andy lurches to a stop listening the woman cries out in 
 orgasm the sound slams into brain like an icepick he 
 shuts his eyes tightly wishing the sound would stop 
 it finally does dying away like a siren until all left 
 is the shallow gasping and panting of we hear 
 languorous laughter moans of satisfaction 
 woman 
 oh sooo the best i ever had 
 andy just stands and listens devastated he look like much of a killer now just a sad little man on a dirt path in the woods tears streaming down his face a loaded gun held loosely at his side a pathetic figure really

 the republic 
 by plato 
 translated by benjamin jowett 
 the introduction 
 
 the republic of plato is the longest of his works with the exceptionof the laws and is certainly the greatest of them there are nearerapproaches to modern metaphysics in the philebus and in the politicus or statesman is more ideal the form and institutions ofthe state are more clearly drawn out in the laws as works of art thesymposium and the protagoras are of higher excellence but no otherdialogue of plato has the same largeness of view and the sameperfection of style no other shows an equal knowledge of the contains more of those thoughts which are new as well as old andnot of one age only but of all nowhere in plato is there a deeperirony or a greater wealth of humor or imagery or more dramatic in any other of his writings is the attempt made to interweavelife and speculation or to connect politics with philosophy therepublic is the centre around which the other dialogues may begrouped here philosophy reaches the highest point to which ancientthinkers ever attained plato among the greeks like bacon among themoderns was the first who conceived a method of knowledge althoughneither of them always distinguished the bare outline or form from thesubstance of truth and both of them had to be content with anabstraction of science which was not yet realized he was the greatestmetaphysical genius whom the world has seen and in him more thanin any other ancient thinker the germs of future knowledge arecontained the sciences of logic and psychology which have suppliedso many instruments of thought to are based upon theanalyses of socrates and plato the principles of definition thelaw of contradiction the fallacy of arguing in a circle thedistinction between the essence and accidents of a thing or means and ends between causes and conditions also thedivision of the mind into the rational concupiscent and irascibleelements or of pleasures and desires into necessary and and other great forms of thought are all of them to be foundin the republic and were probably first invented by plato thegreatest of all logical truths and the one of which writers onphilosophy are most apt to lose sight the difference between wordsand things has been most strenuously insisted on by him althoughhe has not always avoided the confusion of them in his own he does not bind up truth in logical formulae logic is stillveiled in metaphysics and the science which he imagines all truth and all existence is very unlike thedoctrine of the syllogism which aristotle claims to have discovered 
 neither must we forget that the republic is but the third part ofa still larger design which was to have included an ideal history ofathens as well as a political and physical philosophy the fragmentof the critias has given birth to a fiction secondonly in importance to the tale of troy and the legend of arthur andis said as a fact to have inspired some of the early navigators of thesixteenth century this mythical tale of which the subject was ahistory of the wars of the athenians against the island of supposed to be founded upon an unfinished poem of solon to whichit would have stood in the same relation as the writings of thelogographers to the poems of homer it would have told of a strugglefor liberty intended to represent the conflict of persia andhellas we may judge from the noble commencement of the the fragment of the critias itself and from the third book ofthe laws in what manner plato would have treated this highargument we can only guess why the great design was because plato became sensible of some incongruity in afictitious history or because he had lost his interest in it orbecause advancing years forbade the completion of it and we mayplease ourselves with the fancy that had this imaginary narrative everbeen finished we should have found plato himself sympathizing withthe struggle for hellenic independence singing a hymn of triumph overmarathon and salamis perhaps making the reflection of herodotus wherehe contemplates the growth of the athenian brave athing is freedom of speech which has made the athenians so far exceedevery other state of hellas in greatness or more the victory to the ancient good order of athens and to thefavor of apollo and athene 
 again plato may be regarded as the captain arhchegoz orleader of a goodly band of followers for in the republic is to befound the original of de republica of st cityof god of the utopia of sir thomas more and of the numerous otherimaginary states which are framed upon the same model the extent towhich aristotle or the aristotelian school were indebted to him in thepolitics has been little recognized and the recognition is the morenecessary because it is not made by aristotle himself the twophilosophers had more in common than they were conscious of andprobably some elements of plato remain still undetected inaristotle in english philosophy too many affinities may be only in the works of the cambridge platonists but in greatoriginal writers like berkeley or coleridge to plato and his there is a truth higher than experience of which the mindbears witness to herself is a conviction which in our owngeneration has been enthusiastically asserted and is perhapsgaining ground of the greek authors who at the renaissance broughta new life into the world plato has had the greatest influence therepublic of plato is also the first treatise upon education ofwhich the writings of milton and locke rousseau jean paul andgoethe are the legitimate descendants like dante or bunyan he hasa revelation of another life like bacon he is profoundly impressedwith the un unity of knowledge in the early church he exercised areal influence on theology and at the revival of literature onpolitics even the fragments of his words when repeated have in all ages ravished the hearts of men who haveseen reflected in them their own higher nature he is the father ofidealism in philosophy in politics in literature and many of thelatest conceptions of modern thinkers and statesmen such as the unityof knowledge the reign of law and the equality of the sexes havebeen anticipated in a dream by him 
 argument 
 the argument of the republic is the search after justice the natureof which is first hinted at by cephalus the just and blameless oldman then discussed on the basis of proverbial morality by socratesand polemarchus then caricatured by thrasymachus and partiallyexplained by socrates reduced to an abstraction by glaucon andadeimantus and having become invisible in the individual reappears atlength in the ideal state which is constructed by socrates thefirst care of the rulers is to be education of which an outline isdrawn after the old hellenic model providing only for an improvedreligion and morality and more simplicity in music and gymnastic amanlier strain of poetry and greater harmony of the individual andthe state we are thus led on to the conception of a higher which no man calls anything his own and in which there isneither marrying nor giving in marriage and kings arephilosophers and philosophers are kings and there is another andhigher education intellectual as well as moral and religious ofscience as well as of art and not of youth only but of the whole oflife such a state is hardly to be realized in this world and wouldquickly degenerate to the perfect ideal succeeds the government ofthe soldier and the lover of honor this again declining intodemocracy and democracy into tyranny in an imaginary but regularorder having not much resemblance to the actual facts when the wheelhas come full circle we do not begin again with a new period of humanlife but we have passed from the best to the worst and there we subject is then changed and the old quarrel of poetry andphilosophy which had been more lightly treated in the earlier books ofthe republic is now resumed and fought out to a conclusion poetryis discovered to be an imitation thrice removed from the truth andhomer as well as the dramatic poets having been condemned as animitator is sent into banishment along with them and the idea of thestate is supplemented by the revelation of a future life 
 the division into books like all similar divisions is probablylater than the age of plato the natural divisions are five in number book i and the first half of book ii down to the paragraphbeginning i had always admired the genius of glaucon andadeimantus which is introductory the first book containing arefutation of the popular and sophistical notions of justice andconcluding like some of the earlier dialogues without arriving atany definite result to this is appended a restatement of the natureof justice according to common opinion and an answer is demanded tothe question what is justice stripped of appearances the seconddivision includes the remainder of the second and the whole of thethird and fourth books which are mainly occupied with theconstruction of the first state and the first education the thirddivision consists of the fifth sixth and seventh books in whichphilosophy rather than justice is the subject of inquiry and thesecond state is constructed on principles of communism and ruled byphilosophers and the contemplation of the idea of good takes theplace of the social and political virtues in the eighth and ninthbooks the perversions of states and of the individuals whocorrespond to them are reviewed in succession and the nature ofpleasure and the principle of tyranny are further analyzed in theindividual man the tenth book is the conclusion of the which the relations of philosophy to poetry are finally the happiness of the citizens in this life which has now beenassured is crowned by the vision of another 
 or a more general division into two parts may be adopted thefirst books i iv containing the description of a state framedgenerally in accordance with hellenic notions of religion andmorality while in the second books v x the hellenic state istransformed into an ideal kingdom of philosophy of which all othergovernments are the perversions these two points of view are reallyopposed and the opposition is only veiled by the genius of plato therepublic like the phaedrus is an imperfect whole the higher lightof philosophy breaks through the regularity of the hellenic at last fades away into the heavens whether this imperfectionof structure arises from an enlargement of the plan or from theimperfect reconcilement in the own mind of the strugglingelements of thought which are now first brought together by him from the composition of the work at different times arequestions like the similar question about the iliad and theodyssey which are worth asking but which cannot have a distinctanswer in the age of plato there was no regular mode ofpublication and an author would have the less scruple in alteringor adding to a work which was known only to a few of his is no absurdity in supposing that he may have laid his laborsaside for a time or turned from one work to another and suchinterruptions would be more likely to occur in the case of a long thanof a short writing in all attempts to determine the chronologicalhe order of the platonic writings on internal evidence thisuncertainty about any single dialogue being composed at one time isa disturbing element which must be admitted to affect longer as the republic and the laws more than shorter ones but on theother hand the seeming discrepancies of the republic may only ariseout of the discordant elements which the philosopher has attemptedto unite in a single whole perhaps without being himself able torecognize the inconsistency which is obvious to us for there is ajudgment of after ages which few great writers have ever been ableto anticipate for themselves they do not perceive the want ofconnection in their own writings or the gaps in their systems whichare visible enough to those who come after them in the beginningsof literature and philosophy amid the first efforts of thought andlanguage more inconsistencies occur than now when the paths ofspeculation are well worn and the meaning of words preciselydefined for consistency too is the growth of time and some ofthe greatest creations of the human mind have been wanting in by this test several of the platonic dialogues according toour modern ideas appear to be defective but the deficiency is noproof that they were composed at different times or by differenthands and the supposition that the republic was writtenuninterruptedly and by a continuous effort is in some degree confirmedby the numerous references from one part of the work to another 
 the second title concerning justice is not the one by whichthe republic is quoted either by aristotle or generally in like the other second titles of the platonic dialogues maytherefore be assumed to be of later date morgenstern and othershave asked whether the definition of justice which is the professedaim or the construction of the state is the principal argument of thework the answer is that the two blend in one and are two faces ofthe same truth for justice is the order of the state and the stateis the visible embodiment of justice under the conditions of humansociety the one is the soul and the other is the body and thegreek ideal of the state as of the individual is a fair mind in afair body in hegelian phraseology the state is the reality of whichjustice is the ideal or described in christian language the kingdomof god is within and yet develops into a church or externalkingdom the house not made with hands eternal in the heavens isreduced to the proportions of an earthly building or to use aplatonic image justice and the state are the warp and the woofwhich run through the whole texture and when the constitution ofthe state is completed the conception of justice is not reappears under the same or different names throughout the as the inner law of the individual soul and finally as theprinciple of rewards and punishments in another life the virtuesare based on justice of which common honesty in buying and selling isthe shadow and justice is based on the idea of good which is theharmony of the world and is reflected both in the institutions ofstates and in motions of the heavenly bodies the timaeus which takesup the political rather than the ethical side of the republic andis chiefly occupied with hypotheses concerning the outward contains many indications that the same law is supposed to reignover the state over nature and over man 
 too much however has been made of this question both in ancientand in modern times there is a stage of criticism in which all of nature or of art are referred to design now in ancientwritings and indeed in literature generally there remains often alarge element which was not comprehended in the original design forthe plan grows under the hand new thoughts occur to him inthe act of writing he has not worked out the argument to the endbefore he begins the reader who seeks to find some one idea underwhich the whole may be conceived must necessarily seize on thevaguest and most general thus stallbaum who is dissatisfied with theordinary explanations of the argument of the republic imagineshimself to have found the true argument in the representation ofhuman life in a state perfected by justice and governed according tothe idea of good there may be some use in such general they can hardly be said to express the design of the writer thetruth is that we may as well speak of many designs as of one norneed anything be excluded from the plan of a great work to which themind is naturally led by the association of ideas and which doesnot interfere with the general purpose what kind or degree of unityis to be sought after in a building in the plastic arts in prose is a problem which has to be determined relatively to to plato himself the inquiry what was theintention of the writer or what was the principal argument of therepublic would have been hardly intelligible and therefore hadbetter be at once dismissed 
 is not the republic the vehicle of three or four great truths own mind are most naturally represented in the form of thestate just as in the jewish prophets the reign of messiah or theday of the lord or the suffering servant or people of god or of righteousness with healing in his wings only convey to us atleast their great spiritual ideals so through the greek stateplato reveals to us his own thoughts about divine perfection which isthe idea of good like the sun in the visible world about humanperfection which is justice about education beginning in youthand continuing in later years about poets and sophists and tyrantswho are the false teachers and evil rulers of mankind about theworld which is the embodiment of them about a kingdom whichexists nowhere upon earth but is laid up in heaven to be the patternand rule of human life no such inspired creation is at unity withitself any more than the clouds of heaven when the sun piercesthrough them every shade of light and dark of truth and offiction which is the veil of truth is allowable in a work ofphilosophical imagination it is not all on the same plane iteasily passes from ideas to myths and fancies from facts to figuresof speech it is not prose but poetry at least a great part of ought not to be judged by the rules of logic or theprobabilities of history the writer is not fashioning his ideasinto an artistic whole they take possession of him and are too muchfor him we have no need therefore to discuss whether a state suchas plato has conceived is practicable or not or whether the outwardform or the inward life came first into the mind of the writer forthe practicability of his ideas has nothing to do with their the highest thoughts to which he attains may be truly said to bearthe greatest marks of design justice more than the of the state the idea of good more than justice the greatscience of dialectic or the organization of ideas has no real is only a type of the method or spirit in which the higherknowledge is to be pursued by the spectator of all time and allexistence it is in the fifth sixth and seventh books that platoreaches the summit of speculation and these although they failto satisfy the requirements of a modern thinker may therefore beregarded as the most important as they are also the most of the work 
 it is not necessary to discuss at length a minor question whichhas been raised by boeckh respecting the imaginary date at whichthe conversation was held the year b c which is proposed by himwill do as well as any other for a writer of fiction and especiallya writer who like plato is notoriously careless of aims at general probability whether all the persons mentioned inthe republic could ever have met at any one time is not a difficultywhich would have occurred to an athenian reading the work fortyyears later or to plato himself at the time of writing any more thanto shakespeare respecting one of his own dramas and need not greatlytrouble us now yet this may be a question having no answer whichis still worth asking because the investigation shows that we cannot argue historically from the dates in plato it would be uselesstherefore to waste time in inventing reconcilements ofthem in order avoid chronological difficulties such for the conjecture of c f hermann that glaucon and adeimantus arenot the brothers but the uncles of plato or the fancy of stallbaumthat plato intentionally left anachronisms indicating the dates atwhich some of his dialogues were written 
 characters 
 the principal characters in the republic are thrasymachus socrates glaucon and adeimantus cephalusappears in the introduction only polemarchus drops at the end ofthe first argument and thrasymachus is reduced to silence at theclose of the first book the main discussion is carried on bysocrates glaucon and adeimantus among the company are lysias theorator and euthydemus the sons of cephalus and brothers ofpolemarchus an unknown charmantides these are mute auditors alsothere is cleitophon who once interrupts where as in the dialoguewhich bears his name he appears as the friend and ally ofthrasymachus 
 cephalus the patriarch of house has been appropriately engagedin offering a sacrifice he is the pattern of an old man who hasalmost done with life and is at peace with himself and with allmankind he feels that he is drawing nearer to the world below andseems to linger around the memory of the past he is eager thatsocrates should come to visit him fond of the poetry of the lastgeneration happy in the consciousness of a life glad athaving escaped from the tyranny of youthful lusts his love ofconversation his affection his indifference to riches even hisgarrulity are interesting traits of character he is not one of thosewho have nothing to say because their whole mind has been absorbed inmaking money yet he acknowledges that riches have the advantage ofplacing men above the temptation to dishonesty or falsehood therespectful attention shown to him by socrates whose love ofconversation no less than the mission imposed upon him by the him to ask questions of all men young and old alike shouldalso be noted who better suited to raise the question of justice thancephalus whose life might seem to be the expression of it themoderation with which old age is pictured by cephalus as a verytolerable portion of existence is characteristic not only of him butof greek feeling generally and contrasts with the exaggeration ofcicero in the de senectute the evening of life is described byplato in the most expressive manner yet with the fewest possibletouches as cicero remarks ep ad attic iv the aged cephaluswould have been out of place in the discussion which follows andwhich he could neither have understood nor taken part in without aviolation of dramatic propriety 
 his son and heir polemarchus has the frankness and impetuousnessof youth he is for detaining socrates by force in the openingscene and will not let him off on the subject of women andchildren like cephalus he is limited in his point of view andrepresents the proverbial stage of morality which has rules of liferather than principles and he quotes simonides as his father hadquoted pindar but after this he has no more to say the answers whichhe makes are only elicited from him by the dialectic of socrates hehas not yet experienced the influence of the sophists like glaucon andadeimantus nor is he sensible of the necessity of refuting them hebelongs to the or age he is incapable ofarguing and is bewildered by socrates to such a degree that he doesnot know what he is saying he is made to admit that justice is athief and that the virtues follow the analogy of the arts from hisbrother lysias we learn that he fell a victim to the thirty no allusion is here made to his fate nor to the circumstance thatcephalus and his family were of syracusan origin and had migratedfrom thurii to athens 
 the chalcedonian giant thrasymachus of whom we have alreadyheard in the phaedrus is the personification of the to conception of them in some of their worstcharacteristics he is vain and blustering refusing to discourseunless he is paid fond of making an oration and hoping thereby toescape the inevitable socrates but a mere child in argument andunable to foresee that the next move to use a platonicexpression will shut him up he has reached the stage of framinggeneral notions and in this respect is in advance of cephalus andpolemarchus but he is incapable of defending them in a vainly tries to cover his confusion in banter and such doctrines as are attributed to him by plato were reallyheld either by him or by any other sophist is uncertain in theinfancy of philosophy serious errors about morality might easilygrow up they are certainly put into the mouths of speakers inthucydides but we are concerned at present with descriptionof him and not with the historical reality the inequality of thecontest adds greatly to the humor of the scene the pompous andempty sophist is utterly helpless in the hands of the great masterof dialectic who knows how to touch all the springs of vanity andweakness in him he is greatly irritated by the irony of socrates buthis noisy and imbecile rage only lays him more and more open to thethrusts of his assailant his determination to cram down theirthroats or put bodily into their souls his own words elicits a cryof horror from socrates the state of his temper is quite as worthy ofremark as the process of the argument nothing is more amusing thanhis complete submission when he has been once thoroughly beaten atfirst he seems to continue the discussion with reluctance but soonwith apparent and he even testifies his interest at a laterstage by one or two occasional remarks when attacked by glaucon he ishumorously protected by socrates as one who has never been hisenemy and is now his friend from cicero and quintilian and rhetoric we learn that the sophist whom plato has madeso ridiculous was a man of note whose writings were preserved in laterages the play on his name which was made by his contemporaryherodicus thou wast ever bold in battle seems to show that thedescription of him is not devoid of verisimilitude 
 when thrasymachus has been silenced the two principalrespondents glaucon and adeimantus appear on the scene here asin greek tragedy three actors are introduced at first sight thetwo sons of ariston may seem to wear a family likeness like the twofriends simmias and cebes in the phaedo but on a nearer examinationof them the similarity vanishes and they are seen to be distinctcharacters glaucon is the impetuous youth who can just never haveenough of fechting cf the character of him in xen mem iii the man of pleasure who is acquainted with the mysteries of juvenis qui gaudet canibus and who improves the breed ofanimals the lover of art and music who has all the experiences ofyouthful life he is full of quickness and penetration piercingeasily below the clumsy platitudes of thrasymachus to the realdifficulty he turns out to the light the seamy side of human yet does not lose faith in the just and true it is glaucon whoseizes what may be termed the ludicrous relation of the philosopher tothe world to whom a state of simplicity is a city of pigs who isalways prepared with a jest when the argument offers him anopportunity and who is ever ready to second the humor of socrates andto appreciate the ridiculous whether in the connoisseurs of music orin the lovers of theatricals or in the fantastic behavior of thecitizens of democracy his weaknesses are several times alluded toby socrates who however will not allow him to be attacked by hisbrother adeimantus he is a soldier and like adeimantus has beendistinguished at the battle of megara 
 the character of adeimantus is deeper and graver and the profounderobjections are commonly put into his mouth glaucon is moredemonstrative and generally opens the game adeimantus pursues theargument further glaucon has more of the liveliness and quicksympathy of youth adeimantus has the maturer judgment of a of the world in the second book when glaucon insists thatjustice and injustice shall be considered without regard to theirconsequences adeimantus remarks that they are regarded by mankindin general only for the sake of their consequences and in a similarvein of reflection he urges at the beginning of the fourth book thatsocrates falls in making his citizens happy and is answered thathappiness is not the first but the second thing not the direct aimbut the indirect consequence of the good government of a state in thediscussion about religion and mythology adeimantus is the glaucon breaks in with a slight jest and carries on theconversation in a lighter tone about music and gymnastic to the end ofthe book it is adeimantus again who volunteers the criticism ofcommon sense on the socratic method of argument and who refuses tolet socrates pass lightly over the question of women and is adeimantus who is the respondent in the more argumentative asglaucon in the lighter and more imaginative portions of thedialogue for example throughout the greater part of the sixthbook the causes of the corruption of philosophy and the conception ofthe idea of good are discussed with adeimantus then glaucon resumeshis place of principal respondent but he has a difficulty inapprehending the higher education of socrates and makes some falsehits in the course of the discussion once more adeimantus returnswith the allusion to his brother glaucon whom he compares to thecontentious state in the next book he is again superseded andglaucon continues to the end 
 thus in a succession of characters plato represents the successivestages of morality beginning with the athenian gentleman of the oldentime who is followed by the practical man of that day regulatinghis life by proverbs and saws to him succeeds the wild generalizationof the sophists and lastly come the young disciples of the greatteacher who know the sophistical arguments but will not beconvinced by them and desire to go deeper into the nature ofthings these too like cephalus polemarchus thrasymachus areclearly distinguished from one another neither in the republic norin any other dialogue of plato is a single character repeated 
 the delineation of socrates in the republic is not whollyconsistent in the first book we have more of the real as he is depicted in the memorabilia of xenophon in the earliestdialogues of plato and in the apology he is ironical the old enemy of the sophists ready to put on the maskof silenus as well as to argue seriously but in the sixth book hisenmity towards the sophists abates he acknowledges that they arethe representatives rather than the corrupters of the world he alsobecomes more dogmatic and constructive passing beyond the rangeeither of the political or the speculative ideas of the real one passage plato himself seems to intimate that the time had nowcome for socrates who had passed his whole life in philosophy togive his own opinion and not to be always repeating the notions ofother men there is no evidence that either the idea of good or theconception of a perfect state were comprehended in the socraticteaching though he certainly dwelt on the nature of the universal andof final causes cp xen mem i phaedo and a deep thinkerlike him in his thirty or forty years of public teaching could hardlyhave falled to touch on the nature of family relations for whichthere is also some positive evidence in the memorabilia mem i foll the socratic method is nominally retained and everyinference is either put into the mouth of the respondent orrepresented as the common discovery of him and socrates but any onecan see that this is a mere form of which the affectation growswearisome as the work advances the method of inquiry has passedinto a method of teaching in which by the help of interlocutors thesame thesis is looked at from various points of view 
 the nature of the process is truly characterized by glaucon when hedescribes himself as a companion who is not good for much in aninvestigation but can see what he is shown and may perhaps givethe answer to a question more fluently than another 
 neither can we be absolutely certain that socrates himself taughtthe immortality of the soul which is unknown to his discipleglaucon in the republic nor is there any reason to suppose that heused myths or revelations of another world as a vehicle ofinstruction or that he would have banished poetry or have denouncedthe greek mythology his favorite oath is retained and a slightmention is made of the daemonium or internal sign which is alludedto by socrates as a phenomenon peculiar to himself a real elementof socratic teaching which is more prominent in the republic thanin any of the other dialogues of plato is the use of example andillustration taphorhtika auto prhospherhontez let us apply thetest of common instances you says adeimantus ironically inthe sixth book are so unaccustomed to speak in images and this useof examples or images though truly socratic in origin is enlarged bythe genius of plato into the form of an allegory or parable whichembodies in the concrete what has been already described or isabout to be described in the abstract thus the figure of the cave inbook vii is a recapitulation of the divisions of knowledge in book composite animal in book ix is an allegory of the parts of thesoul the noble captain and the ship and the true pilot in book vi area figure of the relation of the people to the philosophers in thestate which has been described other figures such as the dog inthe second third and fourth books or the marriage of theportionless maiden in the sixth book or the drones and wasps in theeighth and ninth books also form links of connection in longpassages or are used to recall previous discussions 
 plato is most true to the character of his master when hedescribes him as not of this world and with this representationof him the ideal state and the other paradoxes of the republic arequite in accordance though they can not be shown to have beenspeculations of socrates to him as to other great teachers bothphilosophical and religious when they looked upward the world seemedto be the embodiment of error and evil the common sense of mankindhas revolted against this view or has only partially admitted it andeven in socrates himself the sterner judgment of the multitude attimes passes into a sort of ironical pity or love men in generalare incapable of philosophy and are therefore at enmity with thephilosopher but their misunderstanding of him is unavoidable forthey have never seen him as he truly is in his own image they areonly acquainted with artificial systems possessing no native forceof truth words which admit of many applications their leadershave nothing to measure with and are therefore ignorant of theirown stature but they are to be pitied or laughed at not to bequarrelled with they mean well with their nostrums if they couldonly learn that they are cutting off a head this moderationtowards those who are in error is one of the most characteristicfeatures of socrates in the republic in all the differentrepresentations of socrates whether of xenophon or plato and thedifferences of the earlier or later dialogues he always retains thecharacter of the unwearied and disinterested seeker after which he would have ceased to be socrates 
 leaving the characters we may now analyze the contents of therepublic and then proceed to consider 
 the general aspects of thishellenic ideal of the state 
 the modern lights in which thethoughts of plato may be read

 the republic 
 by plato 
 translated by benjamin jowett 
 the introduction 
 
 the republic of plato is the longest of his works with the exceptionof the laws and is certainly the greatest of them there are nearerapproaches to modern metaphysics in the philebus and in the politicus or statesman is more ideal the form and institutions ofthe state are more clearly drawn out in the laws as works of art thesymposium and the protagoras are of higher excellence but no otherdialogue of plato has the same largeness of view and the sameperfection of style no other shows an equal knowledge of the contains more of those thoughts which are new as well as old andnot of one age only but of all nowhere in plato is there a deeperirony or a greater wealth of humor or imagery or more dramatic in any other of his writings is the attempt made to interweavelife and speculation or to connect politics with philosophy therepublic is the centre around which the other dialogues may begrouped here philosophy reaches the highest point to which ancientthinkers ever attained plato among the greeks like bacon among themoderns was the first who conceived a method of knowledge althoughneither of them always distinguished the bare outline or form from thesubstance of truth and both of them had to be content with anabstraction of science which was not yet realized he was the greatestmetaphysical genius whom the world has seen and in him more thanin any other ancient thinker the germs of future knowledge arecontained the sciences of logic and psychology which have suppliedso many instruments of thought to are based upon theanalyses of socrates and plato the principles of definition thelaw of contradiction the fallacy of arguing in a circle thedistinction between the essence and accidents of a thing or means and ends between causes and conditions also thedivision of the mind into the rational concupiscent and irascibleelements or of pleasures and desires into necessary and and other great forms of thought are all of them to be foundin the republic and were probably first invented by plato thegreatest of all logical truths and the one of which writers onphilosophy are most apt to lose sight the difference between wordsand things has been most strenuously insisted on by him althoughhe has not always avoided the confusion of them in his own he does not bind up truth in logical formulae logic is stillveiled in metaphysics and the science which he imagines all truth and all existence is very unlike thedoctrine of the syllogism which aristotle claims to have discovered 
 neither must we forget that the republic is but the third part ofa still larger design which was to have included an ideal history ofathens as well as a political and physical philosophy the fragmentof the critias has given birth to a fiction secondonly in importance to the tale of troy and the legend of arthur andis said as a fact to have inspired some of the early navigators of thesixteenth century this mythical tale of which the subject was ahistory of the wars of the athenians against the island of supposed to be founded upon an unfinished poem of solon to whichit would have stood in the same relation as the writings of thelogographers to the poems of homer it would have told of a strugglefor liberty intended to represent the conflict of persia andhellas we may judge from the noble commencement of the the fragment of the critias itself and from the third book ofthe laws in what manner plato would have treated this highargument we can only guess why the great design was because plato became sensible of some incongruity in afictitious history or because he had lost his interest in it orbecause advancing years forbade the completion of it and we mayplease ourselves with the fancy that had this imaginary narrative everbeen finished we should have found plato himself sympathizing withthe struggle for hellenic independence singing a hymn of triumph overmarathon and salamis perhaps making the reflection of herodotus wherehe contemplates the growth of the athenian brave athing is freedom of speech which has made the athenians so far exceedevery other state of hellas in greatness or more the victory to the ancient good order of athens and to thefavor of apollo and athene 
 again plato may be regarded as the captain arhchegoz orleader of a goodly band of followers for in the republic is to befound the original of de republica of st cityof god of the utopia of sir thomas more and of the numerous otherimaginary states which are framed upon the same model the extent towhich aristotle or the aristotelian school were indebted to him in thepolitics has been little recognized and the recognition is the morenecessary because it is not made by aristotle himself the twophilosophers had more in common than they were conscious of andprobably some elements of plato remain still undetected inaristotle in english philosophy too many affinities may be only in the works of the cambridge platonists but in greatoriginal writers like berkeley or coleridge to plato and his there is a truth higher than experience of which the mindbears witness to herself is a conviction which in our owngeneration has been enthusiastically asserted and is perhapsgaining ground of the greek authors who at the renaissance broughta new life into the world plato has had the greatest influence therepublic of plato is also the first treatise upon education ofwhich the writings of milton and locke rousseau jean paul andgoethe are the legitimate descendants like dante or bunyan he hasa revelation of another life like bacon he is profoundly impressedwith the un unity of knowledge in the early church he exercised areal influence on theology and at the revival of literature onpolitics even the fragments of his words when repeated have in all ages ravished the hearts of men who haveseen reflected in them their own higher nature he is the father ofidealism in philosophy in politics in literature and many of thelatest conceptions of modern thinkers and statesmen such as the unityof knowledge the reign of law and the equality of the sexes havebeen anticipated in a dream by him 
 argument 
 the argument of the republic is the search after justice the natureof which is first hinted at by cephalus the just and blameless oldman then discussed on the basis of proverbial morality by socratesand polemarchus then caricatured by thrasymachus and partiallyexplained by socrates reduced to an abstraction by glaucon andadeimantus and having become invisible in the individual reappears atlength in the ideal state which is constructed by socrates thefirst care of the rulers is to be education of which an outline isdrawn after the old hellenic model providing only for an improvedreligion and morality and more simplicity in music and gymnastic amanlier strain of poetry and greater harmony of the individual andthe state we are thus led on to the conception of a higher which no man calls anything his own and in which there isneither marrying nor giving in marriage and kings arephilosophers and philosophers are kings and there is another andhigher education intellectual as well as moral and religious ofscience as well as of art and not of youth only but of the whole oflife such a state is hardly to be realized in this world and wouldquickly degenerate to the perfect ideal succeeds the government ofthe soldier and the lover of honor this again declining intodemocracy and democracy into tyranny in an imaginary but regularorder having not much resemblance to the actual facts when the wheelhas come full circle we do not begin again with a new period of humanlife but we have passed from the best to the worst and there we subject is then changed and the old quarrel of poetry andphilosophy which had been more lightly treated in the earlier books ofthe republic is now resumed and fought out to a conclusion poetryis discovered to be an imitation thrice removed from the truth andhomer as well as the dramatic poets having been condemned as animitator is sent into banishment along with them and the idea of thestate is supplemented by the revelation of a future life 
 the division into books like all similar divisions is probablylater than the age of plato the natural divisions are five in number book i and the first half of book ii down to the paragraphbeginning i had always admired the genius of glaucon andadeimantus which is introductory the first book containing arefutation of the popular and sophistical notions of justice andconcluding like some of the earlier dialogues without arriving atany definite result to this is appended a restatement of the natureof justice according to common opinion and an answer is demanded tothe question what is justice stripped of appearances the seconddivision includes the remainder of the second and the whole of thethird and fourth books which are mainly occupied with theconstruction of the first state and the first education the thirddivision consists of the fifth sixth and seventh books in whichphilosophy rather than justice is the subject of inquiry and thesecond state is constructed on principles of communism and ruled byphilosophers and the contemplation of the idea of good takes theplace of the social and political virtues in the eighth and ninthbooks the perversions of states and of the individuals whocorrespond to them are reviewed in succession and the nature ofpleasure and the principle of tyranny are further analyzed in theindividual man the tenth book is the conclusion of the which the relations of philosophy to poetry are finally the happiness of the citizens in this life which has now beenassured is crowned by the vision of another 
 or a more general division into two parts may be adopted thefirst books i iv containing the description of a state framedgenerally in accordance with hellenic notions of religion andmorality while in the second books v x the hellenic state istransformed into an ideal kingdom of philosophy of which all othergovernments are the perversions these two points of view are reallyopposed and the opposition is only veiled by the genius of plato therepublic like the phaedrus is an imperfect whole the higher lightof philosophy breaks through the regularity of the hellenic at last fades away into the heavens whether this imperfectionof structure arises from an enlargement of the plan or from theimperfect reconcilement in the own mind of the strugglingelements of thought which are now first brought together by him from the composition of the work at different times arequestions like the similar question about the iliad and theodyssey which are worth asking but which cannot have a distinctanswer in the age of plato there was no regular mode ofpublication and an author would have the less scruple in alteringor adding to a work which was known only to a few of his is no absurdity in supposing that he may have laid his laborsaside for a time or turned from one work to another and suchinterruptions would be more likely to occur in the case of a long thanof a short writing in all attempts to determine the chronologicalhe order of the platonic writings on internal evidence thisuncertainty about any single dialogue being composed at one time isa disturbing element which must be admitted to affect longer as the republic and the laws more than shorter ones but on theother hand the seeming discrepancies of the republic may only ariseout of the discordant elements which the philosopher has attemptedto unite in a single whole perhaps without being himself able torecognize the inconsistency which is obvious to us for there is ajudgment of after ages which few great writers have ever been ableto anticipate for themselves they do not perceive the want ofconnection in their own writings or the gaps in their systems whichare visible enough to those who come after them in the beginningsof literature and philosophy amid the first efforts of thought andlanguage more inconsistencies occur than now when the paths ofspeculation are well worn and the meaning of words preciselydefined for consistency too is the growth of time and some ofthe greatest creations of the human mind have been wanting in by this test several of the platonic dialogues according toour modern ideas appear to be defective but the deficiency is noproof that they were composed at different times or by differenthands and the supposition that the republic was writtenuninterruptedly and by a continuous effort is in some degree confirmedby the numerous references from one part of the work to another 
 the second title concerning justice is not the one by whichthe republic is quoted either by aristotle or generally in like the other second titles of the platonic dialogues maytherefore be assumed to be of later date morgenstern and othershave asked whether the definition of justice which is the professedaim or the construction of the state is the principal argument of thework the answer is that the two blend in one and are two faces ofthe same truth for justice is the order of the state and the stateis the visible embodiment of justice under the conditions of humansociety the one is the soul and the other is the body and thegreek ideal of the state as of the individual is a fair mind in afair body in hegelian phraseology the state is the reality of whichjustice is the ideal or described in christian language the kingdomof god is within and yet develops into a church or externalkingdom the house not made with hands eternal in the heavens isreduced to the proportions of an earthly building or to use aplatonic image justice and the state are the warp and the woofwhich run through the whole texture and when the constitution ofthe state is completed the conception of justice is not reappears under the same or different names throughout the as the inner law of the individual soul and finally as theprinciple of rewards and punishments in another life the virtuesare based on justice of which common honesty in buying and selling isthe shadow and justice is based on the idea of good which is theharmony of the world and is reflected both in the institutions ofstates and in motions of the heavenly bodies the timaeus which takesup the political rather than the ethical side of the republic andis chiefly occupied with hypotheses concerning the outward contains many indications that the same law is supposed to reignover the state over nature and over man 
 too much however has been made of this question both in ancientand in modern times there is a stage of criticism in which all of nature or of art are referred to design now in ancientwritings and indeed in literature generally there remains often alarge element which was not comprehended in the original design forthe plan grows under the hand new thoughts occur to him inthe act of writing he has not worked out the argument to the endbefore he begins the reader who seeks to find some one idea underwhich the whole may be conceived must necessarily seize on thevaguest and most general thus stallbaum who is dissatisfied with theordinary explanations of the argument of the republic imagineshimself to have found the true argument in the representation ofhuman life in a state perfected by justice and governed according tothe idea of good there may be some use in such general they can hardly be said to express the design of the writer thetruth is that we may as well speak of many designs as of one norneed anything be excluded from the plan of a great work to which themind is naturally led by the association of ideas and which doesnot interfere with the general purpose what kind or degree of unityis to be sought after in a building in the plastic arts in prose is a problem which has to be determined relatively to to plato himself the inquiry what was theintention of the writer or what was the principal argument of therepublic would have been hardly intelligible and therefore hadbetter be at once dismissed 
 is not the republic the vehicle of three or four great truths own mind are most naturally represented in the form of thestate just as in the jewish prophets the reign of messiah or theday of the lord or the suffering servant or people of god or of righteousness with healing in his wings only convey to us atleast their great spiritual ideals so through the greek stateplato reveals to us his own thoughts about divine perfection which isthe idea of good like the sun in the visible world about humanperfection which is justice about education beginning in youthand continuing in later years about poets and sophists and tyrantswho are the false teachers and evil rulers of mankind about theworld which is the embodiment of them about a kingdom whichexists nowhere upon earth but is laid up in heaven to be the patternand rule of human life no such inspired creation is at unity withitself any more than the clouds of heaven when the sun piercesthrough them every shade of light and dark of truth and offiction which is the veil of truth is allowable in a work ofphilosophical imagination it is not all on the same plane iteasily passes from ideas to myths and fancies from facts to figuresof speech it is not prose but poetry at least a great part of ought not to be judged by the rules of logic or theprobabilities of history the writer is not fashioning his ideasinto an artistic whole they take possession of him and are too muchfor him we have no need therefore to discuss whether a state suchas plato has conceived is practicable or not or whether the outwardform or the inward life came first into the mind of the writer forthe practicability of his ideas has nothing to do with their the highest thoughts to which he attains may be truly said to bearthe greatest marks of design justice more than the of the state the idea of good more than justice the greatscience of dialectic or the organization of ideas has no real is only a type of the method or spirit in which the higherknowledge is to be pursued by the spectator of all time and allexistence it is in the fifth sixth and seventh books that platoreaches the summit of speculation and these although they failto satisfy the requirements of a modern thinker may therefore beregarded as the most important as they are also the most of the work 
 it is not necessary to discuss at length a minor question whichhas been raised by boeckh respecting the imaginary date at whichthe conversation was held the year b c which is proposed by himwill do as well as any other for a writer of fiction and especiallya writer who like plato is notoriously careless of aims at general probability whether all the persons mentioned inthe republic could ever have met at any one time is not a difficultywhich would have occurred to an athenian reading the work fortyyears later or to plato himself at the time of writing any more thanto shakespeare respecting one of his own dramas and need not greatlytrouble us now yet this may be a question having no answer whichis still worth asking because the investigation shows that we cannot argue historically from the dates in plato it would be uselesstherefore to waste time in inventing reconcilements ofthem in order avoid chronological difficulties such for the conjecture of c f hermann that glaucon and adeimantus arenot the brothers but the uncles of plato or the fancy of stallbaumthat plato intentionally left anachronisms indicating the dates atwhich some of his dialogues were written 
 characters 
 the principal characters in the republic are thrasymachus socrates glaucon and adeimantus cephalusappears in the introduction only polemarchus drops at the end ofthe first argument and thrasymachus is reduced to silence at theclose of the first book the main discussion is carried on bysocrates glaucon and adeimantus among the company are lysias theorator and euthydemus the sons of cephalus and brothers ofpolemarchus an unknown charmantides these are mute auditors alsothere is cleitophon who once interrupts where as in the dialoguewhich bears his name he appears as the friend and ally ofthrasymachus 
 cephalus the patriarch of house has been appropriately engagedin offering a sacrifice he is the pattern of an old man who hasalmost done with life and is at peace with himself and with allmankind he feels that he is drawing nearer to the world below andseems to linger around the memory of the past he is eager thatsocrates should come to visit him fond of the poetry of the lastgeneration happy in the consciousness of a life glad athaving escaped from the tyranny of youthful lusts his love ofconversation his affection his indifference to riches even hisgarrulity are interesting traits of character he is not one of thosewho have nothing to say because their whole mind has been absorbed inmaking money yet he acknowledges that riches have the advantage ofplacing men above the temptation to dishonesty or falsehood therespectful attention shown to him by socrates whose love ofconversation no less than the mission imposed upon him by the him to ask questions of all men young and old alike shouldalso be noted who better suited to raise the question of justice thancephalus whose life might seem to be the expression of it themoderation with which old age is pictured by cephalus as a verytolerable portion of existence is characteristic not only of him butof greek feeling generally and contrasts with the exaggeration ofcicero in the de senectute the evening of life is described byplato in the most expressive manner yet with the fewest possibletouches as cicero remarks ep ad attic iv the aged cephaluswould have been out of place in the discussion which follows andwhich he could neither have understood nor taken part in without aviolation of dramatic propriety 
 his son and heir polemarchus has the frankness and impetuousnessof youth he is for detaining socrates by force in the openingscene and will not let him off on the subject of women andchildren like cephalus he is limited in his point of view andrepresents the proverbial stage of morality which has rules of liferather than principles and he quotes simonides as his father hadquoted pindar but after this he has no more to say the answers whichhe makes are only elicited from him by the dialectic of socrates hehas not yet experienced the influence of the sophists like glaucon andadeimantus nor is he sensible of the necessity of refuting them hebelongs to the or age he is incapable ofarguing and is bewildered by socrates to such a degree that he doesnot know what he is saying he is made to admit that justice is athief and that the virtues follow the analogy of the arts from hisbrother lysias we learn that he fell a victim to the thirty no allusion is here made to his fate nor to the circumstance thatcephalus and his family were of syracusan origin and had migratedfrom thurii to athens 
 the chalcedonian giant thrasymachus of whom we have alreadyheard in the phaedrus is the personification of the to conception of them in some of their worstcharacteristics he is vain and blustering refusing to discourseunless he is paid fond of making an oration and hoping thereby toescape the inevitable socrates but a mere child in argument andunable to foresee that the next move to use a platonicexpression will shut him up he has reached the stage of framinggeneral notions and in this respect is in advance of cephalus andpolemarchus but he is incapable of defending them in a vainly tries to cover his confusion in banter and such doctrines as are attributed to him by plato were reallyheld either by him or by any other sophist is uncertain in theinfancy of philosophy serious errors about morality might easilygrow up they are certainly put into the mouths of speakers inthucydides but we are concerned at present with descriptionof him and not with the historical reality the inequality of thecontest adds greatly to the humor of the scene the pompous andempty sophist is utterly helpless in the hands of the great masterof dialectic who knows how to touch all the springs of vanity andweakness in him he is greatly irritated by the irony of socrates buthis noisy and imbecile rage only lays him more and more open to thethrusts of his assailant his determination to cram down theirthroats or put bodily into their souls his own words elicits a cryof horror from socrates the state of his temper is quite as worthy ofremark as the process of the argument nothing is more amusing thanhis complete submission when he has been once thoroughly beaten atfirst he seems to continue the discussion with reluctance but soonwith apparent and he even testifies his interest at a laterstage by one or two occasional remarks when attacked by glaucon he ishumorously protected by socrates as one who has never been hisenemy and is now his friend from cicero and quintilian and rhetoric we learn that the sophist whom plato has madeso ridiculous was a man of note whose writings were preserved in laterages the play on his name which was made by his contemporaryherodicus thou wast ever bold in battle seems to show that thedescription of him is not devoid of verisimilitude 
 when thrasymachus has been silenced the two principalrespondents glaucon and adeimantus appear on the scene here asin greek tragedy three actors are introduced at first sight thetwo sons of ariston may seem to wear a family likeness like the twofriends simmias and cebes in the phaedo but on a nearer examinationof them the similarity vanishes and they are seen to be distinctcharacters glaucon is the impetuous youth who can just never haveenough of fechting cf the character of him in xen mem iii the man of pleasure who is acquainted with the mysteries of juvenis qui gaudet canibus and who improves the breed ofanimals the lover of art and music who has all the experiences ofyouthful life he is full of quickness and penetration piercingeasily below the clumsy platitudes of thrasymachus to the realdifficulty he turns out to the light the seamy side of human yet does not lose faith in the just and true it is glaucon whoseizes what may be termed the ludicrous relation of the philosopher tothe world to whom a state of simplicity is a city of pigs who isalways prepared with a jest when the argument offers him anopportunity and who is ever ready to second the humor of socrates andto appreciate the ridiculous whether in the connoisseurs of music orin the lovers of theatricals or in the fantastic behavior of thecitizens of democracy his weaknesses are several times alluded toby socrates who however will not allow him to be attacked by hisbrother adeimantus he is a soldier and like adeimantus has beendistinguished at the battle of megara 
 the character of adeimantus is deeper and graver and the profounderobjections are commonly put into his mouth glaucon is moredemonstrative and generally opens the game adeimantus pursues theargument further glaucon has more of the liveliness and quicksympathy of youth adeimantus has the maturer judgment of a of the world in the second book when glaucon insists thatjustice and injustice shall be considered without regard to theirconsequences adeimantus remarks that they are regarded by mankindin general only for the sake of their consequences and in a similarvein of reflection he urges at the beginning of the fourth book thatsocrates falls in making his citizens happy and is answered thathappiness is not the first but the second thing not the direct aimbut the indirect consequence of the good government of a state in thediscussion about religion and mythology adeimantus is the glaucon breaks in with a slight jest and carries on theconversation in a lighter tone about music and gymnastic to the end ofthe book it is adeimantus again who volunteers the criticism ofcommon sense on the socratic method of argument and who refuses tolet socrates pass lightly over the question of women and is adeimantus who is the respondent in the more argumentative asglaucon in the lighter and more imaginative portions of thedialogue for example throughout the greater part of the sixthbook the causes of the corruption of philosophy and the conception ofthe idea of good are discussed with adeimantus then glaucon resumeshis place of principal respondent but he has a difficulty inapprehending the higher education of socrates and makes some falsehits in the course of the discussion once more adeimantus returnswith the allusion to his brother glaucon whom he compares to thecontentious state in the next book he is again superseded andglaucon continues to the end 
 thus in a succession of characters plato represents the successivestages of morality beginning with the athenian gentleman of the oldentime who is followed by the practical man of that day regulatinghis life by proverbs and saws to him succeeds the wild generalizationof the sophists and lastly come the young disciples of the greatteacher who know the sophistical arguments but will not beconvinced by them and desire to go deeper into the nature ofthings these too like cephalus polemarchus thrasymachus areclearly distinguished from one another neither in the republic norin any other dialogue of plato is a single character repeated 
 the delineation of socrates in the republic is not whollyconsistent in the first book we have more of the real as he is depicted in the memorabilia of xenophon in the earliestdialogues of plato and in the apology he is ironical the old enemy of the sophists ready to put on the maskof silenus as well as to argue seriously but in the sixth book hisenmity towards the sophists abates he acknowledges that they arethe representatives rather than the corrupters of the world he alsobecomes more dogmatic and constructive passing beyond the rangeeither of the political or the speculative ideas of the real one passage plato himself seems to intimate that the time had nowcome for socrates who had passed his whole life in philosophy togive his own opinion and not to be always repeating the notions ofother men there is no evidence that either the idea of good or theconception of a perfect state were comprehended in the socraticteaching though he certainly dwelt on the nature of the universal andof final causes cp xen mem i phaedo and a deep thinkerlike him in his thirty or forty years of public teaching could hardlyhave falled to touch on the nature of family relations for whichthere is also some positive evidence in the memorabilia mem i foll the socratic method is nominally retained and everyinference is either put into the mouth of the respondent orrepresented as the common discovery of him and socrates but any onecan see that this is a mere form of which the affectation growswearisome as the work advances the method of inquiry has passedinto a method of teaching in which by the help of interlocutors thesame thesis is looked at from various points of view 
 the nature of the process is truly characterized by glaucon when hedescribes himself as a companion who is not good for much in aninvestigation but can see what he is shown and may perhaps givethe answer to a question more fluently than another 
 neither can we be absolutely certain that socrates himself taughtthe immortality of the soul which is unknown to his discipleglaucon in the republic nor is there any reason to suppose that heused myths or revelations of another world as a vehicle ofinstruction or that he would have banished poetry or have denouncedthe greek mythology his favorite oath is retained and a slightmention is made of the daemonium or internal sign which is alludedto by socrates as a phenomenon peculiar to himself a real elementof socratic teaching which is more prominent in the republic thanin any of the other dialogues of plato is the use of example andillustration taphorhtika auto prhospherhontez let us apply thetest of common instances you says adeimantus ironically inthe sixth book are so unaccustomed to speak in images and this useof examples or images though truly socratic in origin is enlarged bythe genius of plato into the form of an allegory or parable whichembodies in the concrete what has been already described or isabout to be described in the abstract thus the figure of the cave inbook vii is a recapitulation of the divisions of knowledge in book composite animal in book ix is an allegory of the parts of thesoul the noble captain and the ship and the true pilot in book vi area figure of the relation of the people to the philosophers in thestate which has been described other figures such as the dog inthe second third and fourth books or the marriage of theportionless maiden in the sixth book or the drones and wasps in theeighth and ninth books also form links of connection in longpassages or are used to recall previous discussions 
 plato is most true to the character of his master when hedescribes him as not of this world and with this representationof him the ideal state and the other paradoxes of the republic arequite in accordance though they can not be shown to have beenspeculations of socrates to him as to other great teachers bothphilosophical and religious when they looked upward the world seemedto be the embodiment of error and evil the common sense of mankindhas revolted against this view or has only partially admitted it andeven in socrates himself the sterner judgment of the multitude attimes passes into a sort of ironical pity or love men in generalare incapable of philosophy and are therefore at enmity with thephilosopher but their misunderstanding of him is unavoidable forthey have never seen him as he truly is in his own image they areonly acquainted with artificial systems possessing no native forceof truth words which admit of many applications their leadershave nothing to measure with and are therefore ignorant of theirown stature but they are to be pitied or laughed at not to bequarrelled with they mean well with their nostrums if they couldonly learn that they are cutting off a head this moderationtowards those who are in error is one of the most characteristicfeatures of socrates in the republic in all the differentrepresentations of socrates whether of xenophon or plato and thedifferences of the earlier or later dialogues he always retains thecharacter of the unwearied and disinterested seeker after which he would have ceased to be socrates 
 leaving the characters we may now analyze the contents of therepublic and then proceed to consider 
 the general aspects of thishellenic ideal of the state 
 the modern lights in which thethoughts of plato may be read

 book i 
 
 socrates glaucon 
 i went down yesterday to the piraeus with glaucon the son ofariston that i might offer up my prayers to the goddess and alsobecause i wanted to see in what manner they would celebrate thefestival which was a new thing i was delighted with the processionof the inhabitants but that of the thracians was equally if notmore beautiful when we had finished our prayers and viewed thespectacle we turned in the direction of the city and at that instantpolemarchus the son of cephalus chanced to catch sight of us from adistance as we were starting on our way home and told his servantto run and bid us wait for him the servant took hold of me by thecloak behind and said polemarchus desires you to wait 
 i turned round and asked him where his master was 
 there he is said the youth coming after you if you will onlywait 
 certainly we will said glaucon and in a few minutes polemarchusappeared and with him adeimantus brother niceratus theson of nicias and several others who had been at the procession 
 socrates polemarchus glaucon adeimantus 
 polemarchus said to me i perceive socrates that you and ourcompanion are already on your way to the city 
 you are not far wrong i said 
 but do you see he rejoined how many we are 
 of course 
 and are you stronger than all these for if not you will have toremain where you are 
 may there not be the alternative i said that we may persuade youto let us go 
 but can you persuade us if we refuse to listen to you he said 
 certainly not replied glaucon 
 then we are not going to listen of that you may be assured 
 adeimantus added has no one told you of the on horsebackin honour of the goddess which will take place in the evening 
 with horses i replied that is a novelty will horsemen carrytorches and pass them one to another during the race 
 yes said polemarchus and not only so but a festival will hecelebrated at night which you certainly ought to see let us risesoon after supper and see this festival there will be a gatheringof young men and we will have a good talk stay then and do not beperverse 
 glaucon said i suppose since you insist that we must 
 very good i replied 
 glaucon cephalus socrates 
 accordingly we went with polemarchus to his house and there wefound his brothers lysias and euthydemus and with them thrasymachusthe chalcedonian charmantides the paeanian and cleitophon the son ofaristonymus there too was cephalus the father of polemarchus whomi had not seen for a long time and i thought him very much aged hewas seated on a cushioned chair and had a garland on his head for hehad been sacrificing in the court and there were some other chairs inthe room arranged in a semicircle upon which we sat down by him hesaluted me eagerly and then he said 
 you come to see me socrates as often as you ought if i werestill able to go and see you i would not ask you to come to me but atmy age i can hardly get to the city and therefore you should comeoftener to the piraeus for let me tell you that the more thepleasures of the body fade away the greater to me is the pleasure andcharm of conversation do not then deny my request but make our houseyour resort and keep company with these young men we are old you will be quite at home with us 
 i replied there is nothing which for my part i like than conversing with aged men for i regard them astravellers who have gone a journey which i too may have to go andof whom i ought to enquire whether the way is smooth and easy orrugged and difficult and this is a question which i should like toask of you who have arrived at that time which the poets call of old age is life harder towards the end or whatreport do you give of it 
 i will tell you socrates he said what my own feeling is men ofmy age flock together we are birds of a feather as the old proverbsays and at our meetings the tale of my acquaintance commonly cannot eat i cannot drink the pleasures of youth and love arefled away there was a good time once but now that is gone andlife is no longer life some complain of the slights which are putupon them by relations and they will tell you sadly of how many evilstheir old age is the cause but to me socrates these complainersseem to blame that which is not really in fault for if old age werethe cause i too being old and every other old man would have feltas they do but this is not my own experience nor that of others whomi have known how well i remember the aged poet sophocles when inanswer to the question how does love suit with age you still the man you were peace he replied most gladlyhave i escaped the thing of which you speak i feel as if i hadescaped from a mad and furious master his words have often occurredto my mind since and they seem as good to me now as at the timewhen he uttered them for certainly old age has a great sense ofcalm and freedom when the passions relax their hold then assophocles says we are freed from the grasp not of one mad masteronly but of many the truth is socrates that these regrets andalso the complaints about relations are to be attributed to thesame cause which is not old age but characters and he who is of a calm and happy nature will hardly feel the pressureof age but to him who is of an opposite disposition youth and age areequally a burden 
 i listened in admiration and wanting to draw him out that he mightgo on yes cephalus i said but i rather suspect that people ingeneral are not convinced by you when you speak thus they thinkthat old age sits lightly upon you not because of your happydisposition but because you are rich and wealth is well known tobe a great comforter 
 you are right he replied they are not convinced and there issomething in what they say not however so much as they imagine imight answer them as themistocles answered the seriphian who wasabusing him and saying that he was famous not for his own meritsbut because he was an athenian if you had been a native of mycountry or i of yours neither of us would have been famous and tothose who are not rich and are impatient of old age the same replymay be made for to the good poor man old age cannot be a lightburden nor can a bad rich man ever have peace with himself 
 may i ask cephalus whether your fortune was for the most partinherited or acquired by you 
 acquired socrates do you want to know how much i acquired inthe art of making money i have been midway between my father andgrandfather for my grandfather whose name i bear doubled andtrebled the value of his patrimony that which he inherited being muchwhat i possess now but my father lysanias reduced the propertybelow what it is at present and i shall be satisfied if i leave tothese my sons not less but a little more than i received 
 that was why i asked you the question i replied because i see thatyou are indifferent about money which is a characteristic rather ofthose who have inherited their fortunes than of those who haveacquired them the makers of fortunes have a second love of money as acreation of their own resembling the affection of authors for theirown poems or of parents for their children besides that natural loveof it for the sake of use and profit which is common to them and allmen and hence they are very bad company for they can talk aboutnothing but the praises of wealth that is true he said 
 yes that is very true but may i ask another question what doyou consider to be the greatest blessing which you have reaped fromyour wealth 
 one he said of which i could not expect easily to convince let me tell you socrates that when a man thinks himself to benear death fears and cares enter into his mind which he never hadbefore the tales of a world below and the punishment which is exactedthere of deeds done here were once a laughing matter to him but nowhe is tormented with the thought that they may be true either fromthe weakness of age or because he is now drawing nearer to that otherplace he has a clearer view of these things suspicions and alarmscrowd thickly upon him and he begins to reflect and consider whatwrongs he has done to others and when he finds that the sum of histransgressions is great he will many a time like a child start up inhis sleep for fear and he is filled with dark forebodings but to himwho is conscious of no sin sweet hope as pindar charmingly the kind nurse of his age 
 hope he says cherishes the soul of him who lives in justice andholiness and is the nurse of his age and the companion of his which is mightiest to sway the restless soul of man 
 how admirable are his words and the great blessing of riches ido not say to every man but to a good man is that he has had nooccasion to deceive or to defraud others either intentionally orunintentionally and when he departs to the world below he is not inany apprehension about offerings due to the gods or debts which heowes to men now to this peace of mind the possession of wealthgreatly contributes and therefore i say that setting one thingagainst another of the many advantages which wealth has to give to aman of sense this is in my opinion the greatest 
 well said cephalus i replied but as concerning justice what isit to speak the truth and to pay your debts no more than even to this are there not exceptions suppose that a friendwhen in his right mind has deposited arms with me and he asks for themwhen he is not in his right mind ought i to give them back to him noone would say that i ought or that i should be right in doing more than they would say that i ought always to speak the truth toone who is in his condition 
 you are quite right he replied 
 but then i said speaking the truth and paying your debts is nota correct definition of justice 
 cephalus socrates polemarchus 
 quite correct socrates if simonides is to be believed saidpolemarchus interposing 
 i fear said cephalus that i must go now for i have to lookafter the sacrifices and i hand over the argument to polemarchusand the company 
 is not polemarchus your heir i said 
 to be sure he answered and went away laughing to the sacrifices 
 socrates polemarchus 
 tell me then o thou heir of the argument what did simonides according to you truly say about justice 
 he said that the repayment of a debt is just and in saying so heappears to me to be right 
 i should be sorry to doubt the word of such a wise and inspired his meaning though probably clear to you is the reverse of clearto me for he certainly does not mean as we were now saying that iought to return a return a deposit of arms or of anything else toone who asks for it when he is not in his right senses and yet adeposit cannot be denied to be a debt 
 true 
 then when the person who asks me is not in his right mind i am by nomeans to make the return 
 certainly not 
 when simonides said that the repayment of a debt was justice he didnot mean to include that case 
 certainly not for he thinks that a friend ought always to do goodto a friend and never evil 
 you mean that the return of a deposit of gold which is to the injuryof the receiver if the two parties are friends is not therepayment of a debt that is what you would imagine him to say 
 yes 
 and are enemies also to receive what we owe to them 
 to be sure he said they are to receive what we owe them and anenemy as i take it owes to an enemy that which is due or proper tohim that is to say evil 
 simonides then after the manner of poets would seem to havespoken darkly of the nature of justice for he really meant to saythat justice is the giving to each man what is proper to him and thishe termed a debt 
 that must have been his meaning he said 
 by heaven i replied and if we asked him what due or proper thingis given by medicine and to whom what answer do you think that hewould make to us 
 he would surely reply that medicine gives drugs and meat and drinkto human bodies 
 and what due or proper thing is given by cookery and to what 
 seasoning to food 
 and what is that which justice gives and to whom 
 if socrates we are to be guided at all by the analogy of thepreceding instances then justice is the art which gives good tofriends and evil to enemies 
 that is his meaning then 
 i think so 
 and who is best able to do good to his friends and evil to hisenemies in time of sickness 
 the physician 
 or when they are on a voyage amid the perils of the sea 
 the pilot 
 and in what sort of actions or with a view to what result is thejust man most able to do harm to his enemy and good to his friends 
 in going to war against the one and in making alliances with theother 
 but when a man is well my dear polemarchus there is no need of aphysician 
 no 
 and he who is not on a voyage has no need of a pilot 
 no 
 then in time of peace justice will be of no use 
 i am very far from thinking so 
 you think that justice may be of use in peace as well as in war 
 yes 
 like husbandry for the acquisition of corn 
 yes 
 or like shoemaking for the acquisition of shoes that is whatyou mean 
 yes 
 and what similar use or power of acquisition has justice in timeof peace 
 in contracts socrates justice is of use 
 and by contracts you mean partnerships 
 exactly 
 but is the just man or the skilful player a more useful and betterpartner at a game of draughts 
 the skilful player 
 and in the laying of bricks and stones is the just man a more usefulor better partner than the builder 
 quite the reverse 
 then in what sort of partnership is the just man a better partnerthan the as in playing the harp the iscertainly a better partner than the just man 
 in a money partnership 
 yes polemarchus but surely not in the use of money for you do notwant a just man to be your counsellor the purchase or sale of a man who is knowing about horses would be better for that would henot 
 certainly 
 and when you want to buy a ship the shipwright or the pilot wouldbe better 
 true 
 then what is that joint use of silver or gold in which the justman is to be preferred 
 when you want a deposit to be kept safely 
 you mean when money is not wanted but allowed to lie 
 precisely 
 that is to say justice is useful when money is useless 
 that is the inference 
 and when you want to keep a safe then justice isuseful to the individual and to the state but when you want to useit then the art of the 
 clearly 
 and when you want to keep a shield or a lyre and not to use would say that justice is useful but when you want to use the art of the soldier or of the musician 
 certainly 
 and so of all the other things justice is useful when they areuseless and useless when they are useful 
 that is the inference 
 then justice is not good for much but let us consider thisfurther point is not he who can best strike a blow in a boxingmatch or in any kind of fighting best able to ward off a blow 
 certainly 
 and he who is most skilful in preventing or escaping from adisease is best able to create one 
 true 
 and he is the best guard of a camp who is best able to steal a marchupon the enemy 
 certainly 
 then he who is a good keeper of anything is also a good thief 
 that i suppose is to be inferred 
 then if the just man is good at keeping money he is good atstealing it 
 that is implied in the argument 
 then after all the just man has turned out to be a thief and thisis a lesson which i suspect you must have learnt out of homer for of autolycus the maternal grandfather of odysseus who isa favourite of his affirms that 
 he was excellent above all men in theft and so you and homer and simonides are agreed that justice is anart of theft to be practised however for the good of friends and forthe harm of enemies that was what you were saying 
 no certainly not that though i do not now know what i did say buti still stand by the latter words 
 well there is another question by friends and enemies do we meanthose who are so really or only in seeming 
 surely he said a man may be expected to love those whom hethinks good and to hate those whom he thinks evil 
 yes but do not persons often err about good and evil many whoare not good seem to be so and conversely 
 that is true 
 then to them the good will be enemies and the evil will be theirfriends true 
 and in that case they will be right in doing good to the evil andevil to the good 
 clearly 
 but the good are just and would not do an injustice 
 true 
 then according to your argument it is just to injure those who do nowrong 
 nay socrates the doctrine is immoral 
 then i suppose that we ought to do good to the just and harm tothe unjust 
 i like that better 
 but see the consequence many a man who is ignorant of humannature has friends who are bad friends and in that case he ought todo harm to them and he has good enemies whom he ought to if so we shall be saying the very opposite of that which weaffirmed to be the meaning of simonides 
 very true he said and i think that we had better correct anerror into which we seem to have fallen in the use of the and enemy 
 what was the error polemarchus i asked 
 we assumed that he is a friend who seems to be or who is thoughtgood 
 and how is the error to be corrected 
 we should rather say that he is a friend who is as well as and that he who seems only and is not good only seems to beand is not a friend and of an enemy the same may be said 
 you would argue that the good are our friends and the bad ourenemies 
 yes 
 and instead of saying simply as we did at first that it is justto do good to our friends and harm to our enemies we should furthersay it is just to do good to our friends when they are good andharm to our enemies when they are evil 
 yes that appears to me to be the truth 
 but ought the just to injure any one at all 
 undoubtedly he ought to injure those who are both wicked and hisenemies 
 when horses are injured are they improved or deteriorated 
 the latter 
 deteriorated that is to say in the good qualities of horses notof dogs 
 yes of horses 
 and dogs are deteriorated in the good qualities of dogs and notof horses 
 of course 
 and will not men who are injured be deteriorated in that which isthe proper virtue of man 
 certainly 
 and that human virtue is justice 
 to be sure 
 then men who are injured are of necessity made unjust 
 that is the result 
 but can the musician by his art make men unmusical 
 certainly not 
 or the horseman by his art make them bad horsemen 
 impossible 
 and can the just by justice make men unjust or speaking general canthe good by virtue make them bad 
 assuredly not 
 any more than heat can produce cold 
 it cannot 
 or drought moisture 
 clearly not 
 nor can the good harm any one 
 impossible 
 and the just is the good 
 certainly 
 then to injure a friend or any one else is not the act of a justman but of the opposite who is the unjust 
 i think that what you say is quite true socrates 
 then if a man says that justice consists in the repayment ofdebts and that good is the debt which a man owes to his evil the debt which he owes to his enemies to say this is notwise for it is not true if as has been clearly shown theinjuring of another can be in no case just 
 i agree with you said polemarchus 
 then you and i are prepared to take up arms against any one whoattributes such a saying to simonides or bias or pittacus or anyother wise man or seer 
 i am quite ready to do battle at your side he said 
 shall i tell you whose i believe the saying to be 
 whose 
 i believe that periander or perdiccas or xerxes or ismenias thetheban or some other rich and mighty man who had a great opinionof his own power was the first to say that justice is doing goodto your friends and harm to your enemies 
 most true he said 
 yes i said but if this definition of justice also breaks other can be offered 
 several times in the course of the discussion thrasymachus hadmade an attempt to get the argument into his own hands and had beenput down by the rest of the company who wanted to hear the end butwhen polemarchus and i had done speaking and there was a pause hecould no longer hold his peace and gathering himself up he cameat us like a wild beast seeking to devour us we were at the sight of him 
 socrates polemarchus thrasymachus 
 he roared out to the whole company what folly socrates hastaken possession of you all and why sillybillies do you knock underto one another i say that if you want really to know what justice should not only ask but answer and you should not seek honourto yourself from the refutation of an opponent but have your ownanswer for there is many a one who can ask and cannot answer and nowi will not have you say that justice is duty or advantage or profit orgain or interest for this sort of nonsense will not do for me i musthave clearness and accuracy 
 i was at his words and could not look at him withouttrembling indeed i believe that if i had not fixed my eye upon him ishould have been struck dumb but when i saw his fury rising i lookedat him first and was therefore able to reply to him 
 thrasymachus i said with a quiver be hard upon and i may have been guilty of a little mistake in theargument but i can assure you that the error was not we were seeking for a piece of gold you would not imagine thatwe were knocking under to one another and so losing our chance offinding it and why when we are seeking for justice a thing moreprecious than many pieces of gold do you say that we are weaklyyielding to one another and not doing our utmost to get at thetruth nay my good friend we are most willing and anxious to doso but the fact is that we cannot and if so you people who know allthings should pity us and not be angry with us 
 how characteristic of socrates he replied with a bitter your ironical style did i not foresee have i not alreadytold you that whatever he was asked he would refuse to answer andtry irony or any other shuffle in order that he might avoidanswering 
 you are a philosopher thrasymachus i replied and well know thatif you ask a person what numbers make up twelve taking care toprohibit him whom you ask from answering twice six or three timesfour or six times two or four times three for this sort ofnonsense will not do for me then obviously that is your way ofputting the question no one can answer you but suppose that hewere to retort thrasymachus what do you mean if one of thesenumbers which you interdict be the true answer to the question am ifalsely to say some other number which is not the right one is thatyour meaning how would you answer him 
 just as if the two cases were at all alike he said 
 why should they not be i replied and even if they are not butonly appear to be so to the person who is asked ought he not to saywhat he thinks whether you and i forbid him or not 
 i presume then that you are going to make one of the interdictedanswers 
 i dare say that i may notwithstanding the danger if uponreflection i approve of any of them 
 but what if i give you an answer about justice other and said than any of these what do you deserve to have done to you 
 done to me as becomes the ignorant i must learn from the is what i deserve to have done to me 
 what and no payment a pleasant notion 
 i will pay when i have the money i replied 
 socrates thrasymachus glaucon 
 but you have socrates said glaucon and you thrasymachus need beunder no anxiety about money for we will all make a contributionfor socrates 
 yes he replied and then socrates will do as he always to answer himself but take and pull to pieces the answerof some one else 
 why my good friend i said how can any one answer who knows andsays that he knows just nothing and who even if he has some faintnotions of his own is told by a man of authority not to utter natural thing is that the speaker should be some one likeyourself who professes to know and can tell what he knows will youthen kindly answer for the edification of the company and of myself 
 glaucon and the rest of the company joined in my request andthrasymachus as any one might see was in reality eager to speak forhe thought that he had an excellent answer and would distinguishhimself but at first he to insist on my answering at length heconsented to begin behold he said the wisdom of socrates herefuses to teach himself and goes about learning of others to whomhe never even says thank you 
 that i learn of others i replied is quite true but that i amungrateful i wholly deny money i have none and therefore i pay inpraise which is all i have and how ready i am to praise any onewho appears to me to speak well you will very soon find out when youanswer for i expect that you will answer well 
 listen then he said i proclaim that justice is nothing elsethan the interest of the stronger and now why do you not me but ofcourse you 
 let me first understand you i replied justice as you say isthe interest of the stronger what thrasymachus is the meaning ofthis you cannot mean to say that because polydamas thepancratiast is stronger than we are and finds the eating of beefconducive to his bodily strength that to eat beef is thereforeequally for our good who are weaker than he is and right and just forus 
 abominable of you socrates you take the words in thesense which is most damaging to the argument 
 not at all my good sir i said i am trying to understand them andi wish that you would be a little clearer 
 well he said have you never heard that forms of government are tyrannies and there are democracies and there arearistocracies 
 yes i know 
 and the government is the ruling power in each state 
 certainly 
 and the different forms of government make laws tyrannical with a view to their several these laws which are made by them for their own interests arethe justice which they deliver to their subjects and him whotransgresses them they punish as a breaker of the law and unjust andthat is what i mean when i say that in all states there is the sameprinciple of justice which is the interest of the government andas the government must be supposed to have power the onlyreasonable conclusion is that everywhere there is one principle ofjustice which is the interest of the stronger 
 now i understand you i said and whether you are right or not iwill try to discover but let me remark that in defining justiceyou have yourself used the word interest which you forbade me touse it is true however that in your definition the words of thestronger are added 
 a small addition you must allow he said 
 great or small never mind about that we must first enquire whetherwhat you are saying is the truth now we are both agreed thatjustice is interest of some sort but you go on to say of thestronger about this addition i am not so sure and must thereforeconsider further 
 proceed 
 i will and first tell me do you admit that it is just orsubjects to obey their rulers 
 i do 
 but are the rulers of states absolutely infallible or are theysometimes liable to err 
 to be sure he replied they are liable to err 
 then in making their laws they may sometimes make them sometimes not 
 true 
 when they make them rightly they make them agreeably to theirinterest when they are mistaken contrary to their interest youadmit that 
 yes 
 and the laws which they make must be obeyed by their subjects andthat is what you call justice 
 doubtless 
 then justice according to your argument is not only obedience tothe interest of the stronger but the reverse 
 what is that you are saying he asked 
 i am only repeating what you are saying i believe but let usconsider have we not admitted that the rulers may be mistaken abouttheir own interest in what they command and also that to obey them isjustice has not that been admitted 
 yes 
 then you must also have acknowledged justice not to be for theinterest of the stronger when the rulers unintentionally commandthings to be done which are to their own injury for if as you is the obedience which the subject renders to theircommands in that case o wisest of men is there any escape fromthe conclusion that the weaker are commanded to do not what is forthe interest but what is for the injury of the stronger 
 nothing can be clearer socrates said polemarchus 
 socrates cleitophon polemarchus thrasymachus 
 yes said cleitophon interposing if you are allowed to be hiswitness 
 but there is no need of any witness said polemarchus forthrasymachus himself acknowledges that rulers may sometimes commandwhat is not for their own interest and that for subjects to obey themis justice 
 yes polemarchus thrasymachus said that for subjects to do whatwas commanded by their rulers is just 
 yes cleitophon but he also said that justice is the interest ofthe stronger and while admitting both these propositions he furtheracknowledged that the stronger may command the weaker who are hissubjects to do what is not for his own interest whence follows thatjustice is the injury quite as much as the interest of the stronger 
 but said cleitophon he meant by the interest of the strongerwhat the stronger thought to be his interest this was what theweaker had to do and this was affirmed by him to be justice 
 those were not his words rejoined polemarchus 
 socrates thrasymachus 
 never mind i replied if he now says that they are let us accepthis statement tell me thrasymachus i said did you mean byjustice what the stronger thought to be his interest whether reallyso or not 
 certainly not he said do you suppose that i call him who ismistaken the stronger at the time when he is mistaken 
 yes i said my impression was that you did so when you admittedthat the ruler was not infallible but might be sometimes mistaken 
 you argue like an informer socrates do you mean for example thathe who is mistaken about the sick is a physician in that he ismistaken or that he who errs in arithmetic or grammar is anarithmetician or grammarian at the me when he is making the respect of the mistake true we say that the physician orarithmetician or grammarian has made a mistake but this is only a wayof speaking for the fact is that neither the grammarian nor any otherperson of skill ever makes a mistake in so far as he is what hisname implies they none of them err unless their skill fails them andthen they cease to be skilled artists no artist or sage or ruler errsat the time when he is what his name implies though he is commonlysaid to err and i adopted the common mode of speaking but to beperfectly accurate since you are such a lover of accuracy weshould say that the ruler in so far as he is the ruler isunerring and being unerring always commands that which is for hisown interest and the subject is required to execute his commands andtherefore as i said at first and now repeat justice is theinterest of the stronger 
 indeed thrasymachus and do i really appear to you to argue like aninformer 
 certainly he replied 
 and you suppose that i ask these questions with any design ofinjuring you in the argument 
 nay he replied suppose is not the word i know it but you willbe found out and by sheer force of argument you will never prevail 
 i shall not make the attempt my dear man but to avoid anymisunderstanding occurring between us in future let me ask in whatsense do you speak of a ruler or stronger whose interest as youwere saying he being the superior it is just that the inferiorshould execute is he a ruler in the popular or in the strict senseof the term 
 in the strictest of all senses he said and now cheat and playthe informer if you can i ask no quarter at your hands but you neverwill be able never 
 and do you imagine i said that i am such a madman as to try andcheat thrasymachus i might as well shave a lion 
 why he said you made the attempt a minute ago and you failed 
 enough i said of these civilities it will be better that i shouldask you a question is the physician taken in that strict sense ofwhich you are speaking a healer of the sick or a maker of remember that i am now speaking of the true physician 
 a healer of the sick he replied 
 and the pilot that is to say the true pilot is he a captainof sailors or a mere sailor 
 a captain of sailors 
 the circumstance that he sails in the ship is not to be taken intoaccount neither is he to be called a sailor the name pilot bywhich he is distinguished has nothing to do with sailing but issignificant of his skill and of his authority over the sailors 
 very true he said 
 now i said every art has an interest 
 certainly 
 for which the art has to consider and provide 
 yes that is the aim of art 
 and the interest of any art is the perfection of it this andnothing else 
 what do you mean 
 i mean what i may illustrate negatively by the example of thebody suppose you were to ask me whether the body is orhas wants i should reply certainly the body has wants for thebody may be ill and require to be cured and has therefore intereststo which the art of medicine ministers and this is the origin andintention of medicine as you will acknowledge am i not right 
 quite right he replied 
 but is the art of medicine or any other art faulty or deficient inany quality in the same way that the eye may be deficient in sightor the ear fail of hearing and therefore requires another art toprovide for the interests of seeing and hearing has art in itself isay any similar liability to fault or defect and does every artrequire another supplementary art to provide for its interests andthat another and another without end or have the arts to look onlyafter their own interests or have they no need either of themselvesor of another having no faults or defects they have no need tocorrect them either by the exercise of their own art or of any have only to consider the interest of their forevery art remains pure and faultless while remaining true that is tosay while perfect and unimpaired take the words in your precisesense and tell me whether i am not right 
 yes clearly 
 then medicine does not consider the interest of medicine but theinterest of the body 
 true he said 
 nor does the art of horsemanship consider the interests of the artof horsemanship but the interests of the horse neither do anyother arts care for themselves for they have no needs they care onlyfor that which is the subject of their art 
 true he said 
 but surely thrasymachus the arts are the superiors and rulers oftheir own subjects 
 to this he assented with a good deal of reluctance 
 then i said no science or art considers or enjoins the interest ofthe stronger or superior but only the interest of the subject andweaker 
 he made an attempt to contest this proposition also but finallyacquiesced 
 then i continued no physician in so far as he is a his own good in what he prescribes but the good of hispatient for the true physician is also a ruler having the humanbody as a subject and is not a mere that has beenadmitted 
 yes 
 and the pilot likewise in the strict sense of the term is aruler of sailors and not a mere sailor 
 that has been admitted 
 and such a pilot and ruler will provide and prescribe for theinterest of the sailor who is under him and not for his own or interest 
 he gave a reluctant yes 
 then i said thrasymachus there is no one in any rule who in sofar as he is a ruler considers or enjoins what is for his owninterest but always what is for the interest of his subject orsuitable to his art to that he looks and that alone he considersin everything which he says and does 
 when we had got to this point in the argument and every one sawthat the definition of justice had been completely instead of replying to me said tell me socrates haveyou got a nurse 
 why do you ask such a question i said when you ought rather tobe answering 
 because she leaves you to snivel and never wipes your nose she hasnot even taught you to know the shepherd from the sheep 
 what makes you say that i replied 
 because you fancy that the shepherd or neatherd fattens of tends thesheep or oxen with a view to their own good and not to the good ofhimself or his master and you further imagine that the rulers ofstates if they are true rulers never think of their subjects assheep and that they are not studying their own advantage day andnight oh no and so entirely astray are you in your ideas aboutthe just and unjust as not even to know that justice and the justare in reality good that is to say the interest of theruler and stronger and the loss of the subject and servant andinjustice the opposite for the unjust is lord over the truly simpleand just he is the stronger and his subjects do what is for hisinterest and minister to his happiness which is very far frombeing their own consider further most foolish socrates that thejust is always a loser in comparison with the unjust first of all inprivate contracts wherever the unjust is the partner of the justyou will find that when the partnership is dissolved the unjustman has always more and the just less secondly in their dealingswith the state when there is an income tax the just man will paymore and the unjust less on the same amount of income and whenthere is anything to be received the one gains nothing and the othermuch observe also what happens when they take an office there is thejust man neglecting his affairs and perhaps suffering other getting nothing out of the public because he is just moreover heis hated by his friends and acquaintance for refusing to serve them inunlawful ways but all this is reversed in the case of the unjust am speaking as before of injustice on a large scale in which theadvantage of the unjust is more apparent and my meaning will bemost clearly seen if we turn to that highest form of injustice inwhich the criminal is the happiest of men and the sufferers orthose who refuse to do injustice are the most miserable that is tosay tyranny which by fraud and force takes away the property ofothers not little by little but wholesale comprehending in sacred as well as profane private and public for which actsof wrong if he were detected perpetrating any one of them would be punished and incur great disgrace they who do such wrongin particular cases are called robbers of temples and burglars and swindlers and thieves but when a man besidestaking away the money of the citizens has made slaves of them of these names of reproach he is termed happy and only by the citizens but by all who hear of his having achievedthe consummation of injustice for mankind censure that they may be the victims of it and not because they shrinkfrom committing it and thus as i have shown socrates on a sufficient scale has more strength and freedom andmastery than justice and as i said at first justice is the interestof the stronger whereas injustice is a own profit and interest 
 thrasymachus when he had thus spoken having like a our ears with his words had a mind to go away but thecompany would not let him they insisted that he should remain anddefend his position and i myself added my own humble request thathe would not leave us thrasymachus i said to him excellent man howsuggestive are your remarks and are you going to run away beforeyou have fairly taught or learned whether they are true or not is theattempt to determine the way of life so small a matter in youreyes to determine how life may be passed by each one of us to thegreatest advantage 
 and do i differ from you he said as to the importance of theenquiry 
 you appear rather i replied to have no care or thought about whether we live better or worse from not knowing whatyou say you know is to you a matter of indifference prithee not keep your knowledge to yourself we are a large party andany benefit which you confer upon us will be amply rewarded for myown part i openly declare that i am not convinced and that i do notbelieve injustice to be more gainful than justice even ifuncontrolled and allowed to have free play for granting that theremay be an unjust man who is able to commit injustice either by fraudor force still this does not convince me of the superior advantage ofinjustice and there may be others who are in the same predicamentwith myself perhaps we may be wrong if so you in your wisdom shouldconvince us that we are mistaken in preferring justice to injustice 
 and how am i to convince you he said if you are not alreadyconvinced by what i have just said what more can i do for you have me put the proof bodily into your souls 
 heaven forbid i said i would only ask you to be consistent or ifyou change change openly and let there be no deception for i mustremark thrasymachus if you will recall what was previously although you began by defining the true physician in an exactsense you did not observe a like exactness when speaking of theshepherd you thought that the shepherd as a shepherd tends thesheep not with a view to their own good but like a mere diner orbanqueter with a view to the pleasures of the table or again as atrader for sale in the market and not as a shepherd yet surely theart of the shepherd is concerned only with the good of his has only to provide the best for them since the perfection ofthe art is already ensured whenever all the requirements of it aresatisfied and that was what i was saying just now about the conceived that the art of the ruler considered as ruler whether ina state or in private life could only regard the good of his flock orsubjects whereas you seem to think that the rulers in states that isto say the true rulers like being in authority 
 think nay i am sure of it 
 then why in the case of lesser offices do men never take themwillingly without payment unless under the idea that they governfor the advantage not of themselves but of others let me ask you aquestion are not the several arts different by reason of theireach having a separate function and my dear illustrious friend dosay what you think that we may make a little progress 
 yes that is the difference he replied 
 and each art gives us a particular good and not merely a general for example gives us health navigation safety at so on 
 yes he said 
 and the art of payment has the special function of giving pay butwe do not confuse this with other arts any more than the art of thepilot is to be confused with the art of medicine because the healthof the pilot may be improved by a sea voyage you would not beinclined to say would you that navigation is the art of medicine atleast if we are to adopt your exact use of language 
 certainly not 
 or because a man is in good health when he receives pay you wouldnot say that the art of payment is medicine 
 i should say not 
 nor would you say that medicine is the art of receiving paybecause a man takes fees when he is engaged in healing 
 certainly not 
 and we have admitted i said that the good of each art is speciallyconfined to the art 
 yes 
 then if there be any good which all artists have in common that isto be attributed to something of which they all have the common use 
 true he replied 
 and when the artist is benefited by receiving pay the advantage isgained by an additional use of the art of pay which is not the artprofessed by him 
 he gave a reluctant assent to this 
 then the pay is not derived by the several artists from theirrespective arts but the truth is that while the art of medicinegives health and the art of the builder builds a house another artattends them which is the art of pay the various arts may be doingtheir own business and benefiting that over which they preside butwould the artist receive any benefit from his art unless he werepaid as well 
 i suppose not 
 but does he therefore confer no benefit when he works for nothing 
 certainly he confers a benefit 
 then now thrasymachus there is no longer any doubt that neitherarts nor governments provide for their own interests but as wewere before saying they rule and provide for the interests of theirsubjects who are the weaker and not the stronger to their goodthey attend and not to the good of the superior 
 and this is the reason my dear thrasymachus why as i was just nowsaying no one is willing to govern because no one likes to take inhand the reformation of evils which are not his concern withoutremuneration for in the execution of his work and in giving hisorders to another the true artist does not regard his own always that of his subjects and therefore in order that rulersmay be willing to rule they must be paid in one of three modes ofpayment money or honour or a penalty for refusing 
 socrates glaucon 
 what do you mean socrates said glaucon the first two modes ofpayment are intelligible enough but what the penalty is i do notunderstand or how a penalty can be a payment 
 you mean that you do not understand the nature of this payment whichto the best men is the great inducement to rule of course you knowthat ambition and avarice are held to be as indeed they are adisgrace 
 very true 
 and for this reason i said money and honour have no attraction forthem good men do not wish to be openly demanding payment forgoverning and so to get the name of hirelings nor by secretly helpingthemselves out of the public revenues to get the name of not being ambitious they do not care about honour whereforenecessity must be laid upon them and they must be induced to servefrom the fear of punishment and this as i imagine is the reason whythe forwardness to take office instead of waiting to be been deemed dishonourable now the worst part of the punishment isthat he who refuses to rule is liable to be ruled by one who isworse than himself and the fear of this as i conceive induces thegood to take office not because they would but because they cannothelp not under the idea that they are going to have any benefit orenjoyment themselves but as a necessity and because they are notable to commit the task of ruling to any one who is better thanthemselves or indeed as good for there is reason to think that ifa city were composed entirely of good men then to avoid officewould be as much an object of contention as to obtain office is atpresent then we should have plain proof that the true ruler is notmeant by nature to regard his own interest but that of hissubjects and every one who knew this would choose rather to receive abenefit from another than to have the trouble of conferring one sofar am i from agreeing with thrasymachus that justice is theinterest of the stronger this latter question need not be furtherdiscussed at present but when thrasymachus says that the life ofthe unjust is more advantageous than that of the just his newstatement appears to me to be of a far more serious character whichof us has spoken truly and which sort of life glaucon do youprefer 
 i for my part deem the life of the just to be the more answered 
 did you hear all the advantages of the unjust which thrasymachus wasrehearsing 
 yes i heard him he replied but he has not convinced me 
 then shall we try to find some way of convincing him if we he is saying what is not true 
 most certainly he replied 
 if i said he makes a set speech and we make another recounting allthe advantages of being just and he answers and we rejoin there mustbe a numbering and measuring of the goods which are claimed oneither side and in the end we shall want judges to decide but ifwe proceed in our enquiry as we lately did by making admissions toone another we shall unite the offices of judge and advocate in ourown persons 
 very good he said 
 and which method do i understand you to prefer i said 
 that which you propose 
 well then thrasymachus i said suppose you begin at the beginningand answer me you say that perfect injustice is more gainful thanperfect justice 
 socrates glaucon thrasymachus 
 yes that is what i say and i have given you my reasons 
 and what is your view about them would you call one of themvirtue and the other vice 
 certainly 
 i suppose that you would call justice virtue and injustice vice 
 what a charming notion so likely too seeing that i affirminjustice to be profitable and justice not 
 what else then would you say 
 the opposite he replied 
 and would you call justice vice 
 no i would rather say sublime simplicity 
 then would you call injustice malignity 
 no i would rather say discretion 
 and do the unjust appear to you to be wise and good 
 yes he said at any rate those of them who are able to be perfectlyunjust and who have the power of subduing states and nations butperhaps you imagine me to be talking of cutpurses 
 even this profession if undetected has advantages though they arenot to be compared with those of which i was just now speaking 
 i do not think that i misapprehend your meaning thrasymachus ireplied but still i cannot hear without amazement that you classinjustice with wisdom and virtue and justice with the opposite 
 certainly i do so class them 
 now i said you are on more substantial and almost unanswerableground for if the injustice which you were maintaining to beprofitable had been admitted by you as by others to be vice anddeformity an answer might have been given to you on receivedprinciples but now i perceive that you will call injustice honourableand strong and to the unjust you will attribute all the qualitieswhich were attributed by us before to the just seeing that you do nothesitate to rank injustice with wisdom and virtue 
 you have guessed most infallibly he replied 
 then i certainly ought not to shrink from going through with theargument so long as i have reason to think that you thrasymachus arespeaking your real mind for i do believe that you are now inearnest and are not amusing yourself at our expense 
 i may be in earnest or not but what is that to you to refute theargument is your business 
 very true i said that is what i have to do but will you be sogood as answer yet one more question does the just man try to gainany advantage over the just 
 far otherwise if he did would not be the simple amusing creaturewhich he is 
 and would he try to go beyond just action 
 he would not 
 and how would he regard the attempt to gain an advantage over theunjust would that be considered by him as just or unjust 
 he would think it just and would try to gain the advantage buthe would not be able 
 whether he would or would not be able i said is not to thepoint my question is only whether the just man while refusing tohave more than another just man would wish and claim to have morethan the unjust 
 yes he would 
 and what of the unjust does he claim to have more than the justman and to do more than is just 
 of course he said for he claims to have more than all men 
 and the unjust man will strive and struggle to obtain more thanthe unjust man or action in order that he may have more than all 
 true 
 we may put the matter thus i said the just does not desire morethan his like but more than his unlike whereas the unjust desiresmore than both his like and his unlike 
 nothing he said can be better than that statement 
 and the unjust is good and wise and the just is neither 
 good again he said 
 and is not the unjust like the wise and good and the just unlikethem 
 of course he said he who is of a certain nature is like those whoare of a certain nature he who is not not 
 each of them i said is such as his like is 
 certainly he replied 
 very good thrasymachus i said and now to take the case of thearts you would admit that one man is a musician and another not amusician 
 yes 
 and which is wise and which is foolish 
 clearly the musician is wise and he who is not a musician isfoolish 
 and he is good in as far as he is wise and bad in as far as he isfoolish 
 yes 
 and you would say the same sort of thing of the physician 
 yes 
 and do you think my excellent friend that a musician when headjusts the lyre would desire or claim to exceed or go beyond amusician in the tightening and loosening the strings 
 i do not think that he would 
 but he would claim to exceed the 
 of course 
 and what would you say of the physician in prescribing meats anddrinks would he wish to go beyond another physician or beyond thepractice of medicine 
 he would not 
 but he would wish to go beyond the 
 yes 
 and about knowledge and ignorance in general see whether youthink that any man who has knowledge ever would wish to have thechoice of saying or doing more than another man who has he not rather say or do the same as his like in the same case 
 that i suppose can hardly be denied 
 and what of the ignorant would he not desire to have more thaneither the knowing or the ignorant 
 i dare say 
 and the knowing is wise 
 yes 
 and the wise is good 
 true 
 then the wise and good will not desire to gain more than his more than his unlike and opposite 
 i suppose so 
 whereas the bad and ignorant will desire to gain more than both 
 yes 
 but did we not say thrasymachus that the unjust goes beyond bothhis like and unlike were not these your words they were 
 they were 
 and you also said that the lust will not go beyond his like buthis unlike 
 yes 
 then the just is like the wise and good and the unjust like theevil and ignorant 
 that is the inference 
 and each of them is such as his like is 
 that was admitted 
 then the just has turned out to be wise and good and the unjust eviland ignorant 
 thrasymachus made all these admissions not fluently as i repeatthem but with extreme reluctance it was a hot day andthe perspiration poured from him in torrents and then i saw what ihad never seen before thrasymachus blushing as we were now agreedthat justice was virtue and wisdom and injustice vice andignorance i proceeded to another point 
 well i said thrasymachus that matter is now settled but werewe not also saying that injustice had strength do you remember 
 yes i remember he said but do not suppose that i approve ofwhat you are saying or have no answer if however i were to would be quite certain to accuse me of haranguing thereforeeither permit me to have my say out or if you would rather ask doso and i will answer very good as they say to oldwomen and will nod yes and no 
 certainly not i said if contrary to your real opinion 
 yes he said i will to please you since you will not let mespeak what else would you have 
 nothing in the world i said and if you are so disposed i willask and you shall answer 
 proceed 
 then i will repeat the question which i asked before in orderthat our examination of the relative nature of justice and injusticemay be carried on regularly a statement was made that injustice isstronger and more powerful than justice but now justice havingbeen identified with wisdom and virtue is easily shown to be strongerthan injustice if injustice is ignorance this can no longer bequestioned by any one but i want to view the matter thrasymachus ina different way you would not deny that a state may be unjust and maybe unjustly attempting to enslave other states or may have alreadyenslaved them and may be holding many of them in subjection 
 true he replied and i will add the best and perfectly unjust statewill be most likely to do so 
 i know i said that such was your position but what i wouldfurther consider is whether this power which is possessed by thesuperior state can exist or be exercised without justice 
 if you are right in you view and justice is wisdom then onlywith justice but if i am right then without justice 
 i am delighted thrasymachus to see you not only nodding assent anddissent but making answers which are quite excellent 
 that is out of civility to you he replied 
 you are very kind i said and would you have the goodness also toinform me whether you think that a state or an army or a band ofrobbers and thieves or any other gang of could act atall if they injured one another 
 no indeed he said they could not 
 but if they abstained from injuring one another then they might acttogether better 
 yes 
 and this is because injustice creates divisions and hatreds andfighting and justice imparts harmony and friendship is not thattrue thrasymachus 
 i agree he said because i do not wish to quarrel with you 
 how good of you i said but i should like to know also whetherinjustice having this tendency to arouse hatred wherever slaves or among freemen will not make them hate one another andset them at variance and render them incapable of common action 
 certainly 
 and even if injustice be found in two only will they not quarreland fight and become enemies to one another and to the just 
 they will 
 and suppose injustice abiding in a single person would yourwisdom say that she loses or that she retains her natural power 
 let us assume that she retains her power 
 yet is not the power which injustice exercises of such a nature thatwherever she takes up her abode whether in a city in an army in afamily or in any other body that body is to begin with renderedincapable of united action by reason of sedition and does it not become its own enemy and at variance with all thatopposes it and with the just is not this the case 
 yes certainly 
 and is not injustice equally fatal when existing in a single the first place rendering him incapable of action because he is notat unity with himself and in the second place making him an enemyto himself and the just is not that true thrasymachus 
 yes 
 and o my friend i said surely the gods are just 
 granted that they are 
 but if so the unjust will be the enemy of the gods and the justwill be their friend 
 feast away in triumph and take your fill of the argument i willnot oppose you lest i should displease the company 
 well then proceed with your answers and let me have theremainder of my repast for we have already shown that the just areclearly wiser and better and abler than the unjust and that theunjust are incapable of common action nay ing at more that tospeak as we did of men who are evil acting at any time vigorouslytogether is not strictly true for if they had been perfectly would have laid hands upon one another but it is evident thatthere must have been some remnant of justice in them which enabledthem to combine if there had not been they would have injured oneanother as well as their victims they were but half villains intheir enterprises for had they been whole villains and utterlyunjust they would have been utterly incapable of action that as ibelieve is the truth of the matter and not what you said at whether the just have a better and happier life than the unjust isa further question which we also proposed to consider i think thatthey have and for the reasons which to have given but still i shouldlike to examine further for no light matter is at stake nothing lessthan the rule of human life 
 proceed 
 i will proceed by asking a question would you not say that ahorse has some end 
 i should 
 and the end or use of a horse or of anything would be that whichcould not be accomplished or not so well accomplished by any otherthing 
 i do not understand he said 
 let me explain can you see except with the eye 
 certainly not 
 or hear except with the ear 
 no 
 these then may be truly said to be the ends of these organs 
 they may 
 but you can cut off a with a dagger or with a in many other ways 
 of course 
 and yet not so well as with a made for the purpose 
 true 
 may we not say that this is the end of a 
 we may 
 then now i think you will have no difficulty in understanding mymeaning when i asked the question whether the end of anything would bethat which could not be accomplished or not so well any other thing 
 i understand your meaning he said and assent 
 and that to which an end is appointed has also an excellence need iask again whether the eye has an end 
 it has 
 and has not the eye an excellence 
 yes 
 and the ear has an end and an excellence also 
 true 
 and the same is true of all other things they have each of theman end and a special excellence 
 that is so 
 well and can the eyes fulfil their end if they are wanting in theirown proper excellence and have a defect instead 
 how can they he said if they are blind and cannot see 
 you mean to say if they have lost their proper excellence which issight but i have not arrived at that point yet i would rather askthe question more generally and only enquire whether the things whichfulfil their ends fulfil them by their own proper excellence and fallof fulfilling them by their own defect 
 certainly he replied 
 i might say the same of the ears when deprived of their ownproper excellence they cannot fulfil their end 
 true 
 and the same observation will apply to all other things 
 i agree 
 well and has not the soul an end which nothing else can fulfil forexample to superintend and command and deliberate and the like arenot these functions proper to the soul and can they rightly beassigned to any other 
 to no other 
 and is not life to be reckoned among the ends of the soul 
 assuredly he said 
 and has not the soul an excellence also 
 yes 
 and can she or can she not fulfil her own ends when deprived of thatexcellence 
 she cannot 
 then an evil soul must necessarily be an evil ruler andsuperintendent and the good soul a good ruler 
 yes necessarily 
 and we have admitted that justice is the excellence of the soul andinjustice the defect of the soul 
 that has been admitted 
 then the just soul and the just man will live well and the unjustman will live ill 
 that is what your argument proves 
 and he who lives well is blessed and happy and he who lives ill thereverse of happy 
 certainly 
 then the just is happy and the unjust miserable 
 so be it 
 but happiness and not misery is profitable 
 of course 
 then my blessed thrasymachus injustice can never be moreprofitable than justice 
 let this socrates he said be your entertainment at the bendidea 
 for which i am indebted to you i said now that you have growngentle towards me and have left off scolding nevertheless i have notbeen well entertained but that was my own fault and not yours asan epicure snatches a taste of every dish which is successivelybrought to table he not having allowed himself time to enjoy theone before so have i gone from one subject to another withouthaving discovered what i sought at first the nature of justice ileft that enquiry and turned away to consider whether justice isvirtue and wisdom or evil and folly and when there arose a furtherquestion about the comparative advantages of justice and could not refrain from passing on to that and the result of thewhole discussion has been that i know nothing at all for i know notwhat justice is and therefore i am not likely to know whether it isor is not a virtue nor can i say whether the just man is happy or unhappy

 book i 
 
 socrates glaucon 
 i went down yesterday to the piraeus with glaucon the son ofariston that i might offer up my prayers to the goddess and alsobecause i wanted to see in what manner they would celebrate thefestival which was a new thing i was delighted with the processionof the inhabitants but that of the thracians was equally if notmore beautiful when we had finished our prayers and viewed thespectacle we turned in the direction of the city and at that instantpolemarchus the son of cephalus chanced to catch sight of us from adistance as we were starting on our way home and told his servantto run and bid us wait for him the servant took hold of me by thecloak behind and said polemarchus desires you to wait 
 i turned round and asked him where his master was 
 there he is said the youth coming after you if you will onlywait 
 certainly we will said glaucon and in a few minutes polemarchusappeared and with him adeimantus brother niceratus theson of nicias and several others who had been at the procession 
 socrates polemarchus glaucon adeimantus 
 polemarchus said to me i perceive socrates that you and ourcompanion are already on your way to the city 
 you are not far wrong i said 
 but do you see he rejoined how many we are 
 of course 
 and are you stronger than all these for if not you will have toremain where you are 
 may there not be the alternative i said that we may persuade youto let us go 
 but can you persuade us if we refuse to listen to you he said 
 certainly not replied glaucon 
 then we are not going to listen of that you may be assured 
 adeimantus added has no one told you of the on horsebackin honour of the goddess which will take place in the evening 
 with horses i replied that is a novelty will horsemen carrytorches and pass them one to another during the race 
 yes said polemarchus and not only so but a festival will hecelebrated at night which you certainly ought to see let us risesoon after supper and see this festival there will be a gatheringof young men and we will have a good talk stay then and do not beperverse 
 glaucon said i suppose since you insist that we must 
 very good i replied 
 glaucon cephalus socrates 
 accordingly we went with polemarchus to his house and there wefound his brothers lysias and euthydemus and with them thrasymachusthe chalcedonian charmantides the paeanian and cleitophon the son ofaristonymus there too was cephalus the father of polemarchus whomi had not seen for a long time and i thought him very much aged hewas seated on a cushioned chair and had a garland on his head for hehad been sacrificing in the court and there were some other chairs inthe room arranged in a semicircle upon which we sat down by him hesaluted me eagerly and then he said 
 you come to see me socrates as often as you ought if i werestill able to go and see you i would not ask you to come to me but atmy age i can hardly get to the city and therefore you should comeoftener to the piraeus for let me tell you that the more thepleasures of the body fade away the greater to me is the pleasure andcharm of conversation do not then deny my request but make our houseyour resort and keep company with these young men we are old you will be quite at home with us 
 i replied there is nothing which for my part i like than conversing with aged men for i regard them astravellers who have gone a journey which i too may have to go andof whom i ought to enquire whether the way is smooth and easy orrugged and difficult and this is a question which i should like toask of you who have arrived at that time which the poets call of old age is life harder towards the end or whatreport do you give of it 
 i will tell you socrates he said what my own feeling is men ofmy age flock together we are birds of a feather as the old proverbsays and at our meetings the tale of my acquaintance commonly cannot eat i cannot drink the pleasures of youth and love arefled away there was a good time once but now that is gone andlife is no longer life some complain of the slights which are putupon them by relations and they will tell you sadly of how many evilstheir old age is the cause but to me socrates these complainersseem to blame that which is not really in fault for if old age werethe cause i too being old and every other old man would have feltas they do but this is not my own experience nor that of others whomi have known how well i remember the aged poet sophocles when inanswer to the question how does love suit with age you still the man you were peace he replied most gladlyhave i escaped the thing of which you speak i feel as if i hadescaped from a mad and furious master his words have often occurredto my mind since and they seem as good to me now as at the timewhen he uttered them for certainly old age has a great sense ofcalm and freedom when the passions relax their hold then assophocles says we are freed from the grasp not of one mad masteronly but of many the truth is socrates that these regrets andalso the complaints about relations are to be attributed to thesame cause which is not old age but characters and he who is of a calm and happy nature will hardly feel the pressureof age but to him who is of an opposite disposition youth and age areequally a burden 
 i listened in admiration and wanting to draw him out that he mightgo on yes cephalus i said but i rather suspect that people ingeneral are not convinced by you when you speak thus they thinkthat old age sits lightly upon you not because of your happydisposition but because you are rich and wealth is well known tobe a great comforter 
 you are right he replied they are not convinced and there issomething in what they say not however so much as they imagine imight answer them as themistocles answered the seriphian who wasabusing him and saying that he was famous not for his own meritsbut because he was an athenian if you had been a native of mycountry or i of yours neither of us would have been famous and tothose who are not rich and are impatient of old age the same replymay be made for to the good poor man old age cannot be a lightburden nor can a bad rich man ever have peace with himself 
 may i ask cephalus whether your fortune was for the most partinherited or acquired by you 
 acquired socrates do you want to know how much i acquired inthe art of making money i have been midway between my father andgrandfather for my grandfather whose name i bear doubled andtrebled the value of his patrimony that which he inherited being muchwhat i possess now but my father lysanias reduced the propertybelow what it is at present and i shall be satisfied if i leave tothese my sons not less but a little more than i received 
 that was why i asked you the question i replied because i see thatyou are indifferent about money which is a characteristic rather ofthose who have inherited their fortunes than of those who haveacquired them the makers of fortunes have a second love of money as acreation of their own resembling the affection of authors for theirown poems or of parents for their children besides that natural loveof it for the sake of use and profit which is common to them and allmen and hence they are very bad company for they can talk aboutnothing but the praises of wealth that is true he said 
 yes that is very true but may i ask another question what doyou consider to be the greatest blessing which you have reaped fromyour wealth 
 one he said of which i could not expect easily to convince let me tell you socrates that when a man thinks himself to benear death fears and cares enter into his mind which he never hadbefore the tales of a world below and the punishment which is exactedthere of deeds done here were once a laughing matter to him but nowhe is tormented with the thought that they may be true either fromthe weakness of age or because he is now drawing nearer to that otherplace he has a clearer view of these things suspicions and alarmscrowd thickly upon him and he begins to reflect and consider whatwrongs he has done to others and when he finds that the sum of histransgressions is great he will many a time like a child start up inhis sleep for fear and he is filled with dark forebodings but to himwho is conscious of no sin sweet hope as pindar charmingly the kind nurse of his age 
 hope he says cherishes the soul of him who lives in justice andholiness and is the nurse of his age and the companion of his which is mightiest to sway the restless soul of man 
 how admirable are his words and the great blessing of riches ido not say to every man but to a good man is that he has had nooccasion to deceive or to defraud others either intentionally orunintentionally and when he departs to the world below he is not inany apprehension about offerings due to the gods or debts which heowes to men now to this peace of mind the possession of wealthgreatly contributes and therefore i say that setting one thingagainst another of the many advantages which wealth has to give to aman of sense this is in my opinion the greatest 
 well said cephalus i replied but as concerning justice what isit to speak the truth and to pay your debts no more than even to this are there not exceptions suppose that a friendwhen in his right mind has deposited arms with me and he asks for themwhen he is not in his right mind ought i to give them back to him noone would say that i ought or that i should be right in doing more than they would say that i ought always to speak the truth toone who is in his condition 
 you are quite right he replied 
 but then i said speaking the truth and paying your debts is nota correct definition of justice 
 cephalus socrates polemarchus 
 quite correct socrates if simonides is to be believed saidpolemarchus interposing 
 i fear said cephalus that i must go now for i have to lookafter the sacrifices and i hand over the argument to polemarchusand the company 
 is not polemarchus your heir i said 
 to be sure he answered and went away laughing to the sacrifices 
 socrates polemarchus 
 tell me then o thou heir of the argument what did simonides according to you truly say about justice 
 he said that the repayment of a debt is just and in saying so heappears to me to be right 
 i should be sorry to doubt the word of such a wise and inspired his meaning though probably clear to you is the reverse of clearto me for he certainly does not mean as we were now saying that iought to return a return a deposit of arms or of anything else toone who asks for it when he is not in his right senses and yet adeposit cannot be denied to be a debt 
 true 
 then when the person who asks me is not in his right mind i am by nomeans to make the return 
 certainly not 
 when simonides said that the repayment of a debt was justice he didnot mean to include that case 
 certainly not for he thinks that a friend ought always to do goodto a friend and never evil 
 you mean that the return of a deposit of gold which is to the injuryof the receiver if the two parties are friends is not therepayment of a debt that is what you would imagine him to say 
 yes 
 and are enemies also to receive what we owe to them 
 to be sure he said they are to receive what we owe them and anenemy as i take it owes to an enemy that which is due or proper tohim that is to say evil 
 simonides then after the manner of poets would seem to havespoken darkly of the nature of justice for he really meant to saythat justice is the giving to each man what is proper to him and thishe termed a debt 
 that must have been his meaning he said 
 by heaven i replied and if we asked him what due or proper thingis given by medicine and to whom what answer do you think that hewould make to us 
 he would surely reply that medicine gives drugs and meat and drinkto human bodies 
 and what due or proper thing is given by cookery and to what 
 seasoning to food 
 and what is that which justice gives and to whom 
 if socrates we are to be guided at all by the analogy of thepreceding instances then justice is the art which gives good tofriends and evil to enemies 
 that is his meaning then 
 i think so 
 and who is best able to do good to his friends and evil to hisenemies in time of sickness 
 the physician 
 or when they are on a voyage amid the perils of the sea 
 the pilot 
 and in what sort of actions or with a view to what result is thejust man most able to do harm to his enemy and good to his friends 
 in going to war against the one and in making alliances with theother 
 but when a man is well my dear polemarchus there is no need of aphysician 
 no 
 and he who is not on a voyage has no need of a pilot 
 no 
 then in time of peace justice will be of no use 
 i am very far from thinking so 
 you think that justice may be of use in peace as well as in war 
 yes 
 like husbandry for the acquisition of corn 
 yes 
 or like shoemaking for the acquisition of shoes that is whatyou mean 
 yes 
 and what similar use or power of acquisition has justice in timeof peace 
 in contracts socrates justice is of use 
 and by contracts you mean partnerships 
 exactly 
 but is the just man or the skilful player a more useful and betterpartner at a game of draughts 
 the skilful player 
 and in the laying of bricks and stones is the just man a more usefulor better partner than the builder 
 quite the reverse 
 then in what sort of partnership is the just man a better partnerthan the as in playing the harp the iscertainly a better partner than the just man 
 in a money partnership 
 yes polemarchus but surely not in the use of money for you do notwant a just man to be your counsellor the purchase or sale of a man who is knowing about horses would be better for that would henot 
 certainly 
 and when you want to buy a ship the shipwright or the pilot wouldbe better 
 true 
 then what is that joint use of silver or gold in which the justman is to be preferred 
 when you want a deposit to be kept safely 
 you mean when money is not wanted but allowed to lie 
 precisely 
 that is to say justice is useful when money is useless 
 that is the inference 
 and when you want to keep a safe then justice isuseful to the individual and to the state but when you want to useit then the art of the 
 clearly 
 and when you want to keep a shield or a lyre and not to use would say that justice is useful but when you want to use the art of the soldier or of the musician 
 certainly 
 and so of all the other things justice is useful when they areuseless and useless when they are useful 
 that is the inference 
 then justice is not good for much but let us consider thisfurther point is not he who can best strike a blow in a boxingmatch or in any kind of fighting best able to ward off a blow 
 certainly 
 and he who is most skilful in preventing or escaping from adisease is best able to create one 
 true 
 and he is the best guard of a camp who is best able to steal a marchupon the enemy 
 certainly 
 then he who is a good keeper of anything is also a good thief 
 that i suppose is to be inferred 
 then if the just man is good at keeping money he is good atstealing it 
 that is implied in the argument 
 then after all the just man has turned out to be a thief and thisis a lesson which i suspect you must have learnt out of homer for of autolycus the maternal grandfather of odysseus who isa favourite of his affirms that 
 he was excellent above all men in theft and so you and homer and simonides are agreed that justice is anart of theft to be practised however for the good of friends and forthe harm of enemies that was what you were saying 
 no certainly not that though i do not now know what i did say buti still stand by the latter words 
 well there is another question by friends and enemies do we meanthose who are so really or only in seeming 
 surely he said a man may be expected to love those whom hethinks good and to hate those whom he thinks evil 
 yes but do not persons often err about good and evil many whoare not good seem to be so and conversely 
 that is true 
 then to them the good will be enemies and the evil will be theirfriends true 
 and in that case they will be right in doing good to the evil andevil to the good 
 clearly 
 but the good are just and would not do an injustice 
 true 
 then according to your argument it is just to injure those who do nowrong 
 nay socrates the doctrine is immoral 
 then i suppose that we ought to do good to the just and harm tothe unjust 
 i like that better 
 but see the consequence many a man who is ignorant of humannature has friends who are bad friends and in that case he ought todo harm to them and he has good enemies whom he ought to if so we shall be saying the very opposite of that which weaffirmed to be the meaning of simonides 
 very true he said and i think that we had better correct anerror into which we seem to have fallen in the use of the and enemy 
 what was the error polemarchus i asked 
 we assumed that he is a friend who seems to be or who is thoughtgood 
 and how is the error to be corrected 
 we should rather say that he is a friend who is as well as and that he who seems only and is not good only seems to beand is not a friend and of an enemy the same may be said 
 you would argue that the good are our friends and the bad ourenemies 
 yes 
 and instead of saying simply as we did at first that it is justto do good to our friends and harm to our enemies we should furthersay it is just to do good to our friends when they are good andharm to our enemies when they are evil 
 yes that appears to me to be the truth 
 but ought the just to injure any one at all 
 undoubtedly he ought to injure those who are both wicked and hisenemies 
 when horses are injured are they improved or deteriorated 
 the latter 
 deteriorated that is to say in the good qualities of horses notof dogs 
 yes of horses 
 and dogs are deteriorated in the good qualities of dogs and notof horses 
 of course 
 and will not men who are injured be deteriorated in that which isthe proper virtue of man 
 certainly 
 and that human virtue is justice 
 to be sure 
 then men who are injured are of necessity made unjust 
 that is the result 
 but can the musician by his art make men unmusical 
 certainly not 
 or the horseman by his art make them bad horsemen 
 impossible 
 and can the just by justice make men unjust or speaking general canthe good by virtue make them bad 
 assuredly not 
 any more than heat can produce cold 
 it cannot 
 or drought moisture 
 clearly not 
 nor can the good harm any one 
 impossible 
 and the just is the good 
 certainly 
 then to injure a friend or any one else is not the act of a justman but of the opposite who is the unjust 
 i think that what you say is quite true socrates 
 then if a man says that justice consists in the repayment ofdebts and that good is the debt which a man owes to his evil the debt which he owes to his enemies to say this is notwise for it is not true if as has been clearly shown theinjuring of another can be in no case just 
 i agree with you said polemarchus 
 then you and i are prepared to take up arms against any one whoattributes such a saying to simonides or bias or pittacus or anyother wise man or seer 
 i am quite ready to do battle at your side he said 
 shall i tell you whose i believe the saying to be 
 whose 
 i believe that periander or perdiccas or xerxes or ismenias thetheban or some other rich and mighty man who had a great opinionof his own power was the first to say that justice is doing goodto your friends and harm to your enemies 
 most true he said 
 yes i said but if this definition of justice also breaks other can be offered 
 several times in the course of the discussion thrasymachus hadmade an attempt to get the argument into his own hands and had beenput down by the rest of the company who wanted to hear the end butwhen polemarchus and i had done speaking and there was a pause hecould no longer hold his peace and gathering himself up he cameat us like a wild beast seeking to devour us we were at the sight of him 
 socrates polemarchus thrasymachus 
 he roared out to the whole company what folly socrates hastaken possession of you all and why sillybillies do you knock underto one another i say that if you want really to know what justice should not only ask but answer and you should not seek honourto yourself from the refutation of an opponent but have your ownanswer for there is many a one who can ask and cannot answer and nowi will not have you say that justice is duty or advantage or profit orgain or interest for this sort of nonsense will not do for me i musthave clearness and accuracy 
 i was at his words and could not look at him withouttrembling indeed i believe that if i had not fixed my eye upon him ishould have been struck dumb but when i saw his fury rising i lookedat him first and was therefore able to reply to him 
 thrasymachus i said with a quiver be hard upon and i may have been guilty of a little mistake in theargument but i can assure you that the error was not we were seeking for a piece of gold you would not imagine thatwe were knocking under to one another and so losing our chance offinding it and why when we are seeking for justice a thing moreprecious than many pieces of gold do you say that we are weaklyyielding to one another and not doing our utmost to get at thetruth nay my good friend we are most willing and anxious to doso but the fact is that we cannot and if so you people who know allthings should pity us and not be angry with us 
 how characteristic of socrates he replied with a bitter your ironical style did i not foresee have i not alreadytold you that whatever he was asked he would refuse to answer andtry irony or any other shuffle in order that he might avoidanswering 
 you are a philosopher thrasymachus i replied and well know thatif you ask a person what numbers make up twelve taking care toprohibit him whom you ask from answering twice six or three timesfour or six times two or four times three for this sort ofnonsense will not do for me then obviously that is your way ofputting the question no one can answer you but suppose that hewere to retort thrasymachus what do you mean if one of thesenumbers which you interdict be the true answer to the question am ifalsely to say some other number which is not the right one is thatyour meaning how would you answer him 
 just as if the two cases were at all alike he said 
 why should they not be i replied and even if they are not butonly appear to be so to the person who is asked ought he not to saywhat he thinks whether you and i forbid him or not 
 i presume then that you are going to make one of the interdictedanswers 
 i dare say that i may notwithstanding the danger if uponreflection i approve of any of them 
 but what if i give you an answer about justice other and said than any of these what do you deserve to have done to you 
 done to me as becomes the ignorant i must learn from the is what i deserve to have done to me 
 what and no payment a pleasant notion 
 i will pay when i have the money i replied 
 socrates thrasymachus glaucon 
 but you have socrates said glaucon and you thrasymachus need beunder no anxiety about money for we will all make a contributionfor socrates 
 yes he replied and then socrates will do as he always to answer himself but take and pull to pieces the answerof some one else 
 why my good friend i said how can any one answer who knows andsays that he knows just nothing and who even if he has some faintnotions of his own is told by a man of authority not to utter natural thing is that the speaker should be some one likeyourself who professes to know and can tell what he knows will youthen kindly answer for the edification of the company and of myself 
 glaucon and the rest of the company joined in my request andthrasymachus as any one might see was in reality eager to speak forhe thought that he had an excellent answer and would distinguishhimself but at first he to insist on my answering at length heconsented to begin behold he said the wisdom of socrates herefuses to teach himself and goes about learning of others to whomhe never even says thank you 
 that i learn of others i replied is quite true but that i amungrateful i wholly deny money i have none and therefore i pay inpraise which is all i have and how ready i am to praise any onewho appears to me to speak well you will very soon find out when youanswer for i expect that you will answer well 
 listen then he said i proclaim that justice is nothing elsethan the interest of the stronger and now why do you not me but ofcourse you 
 let me first understand you i replied justice as you say isthe interest of the stronger what thrasymachus is the meaning ofthis you cannot mean to say that because polydamas thepancratiast is stronger than we are and finds the eating of beefconducive to his bodily strength that to eat beef is thereforeequally for our good who are weaker than he is and right and just forus 
 abominable of you socrates you take the words in thesense which is most damaging to the argument 
 not at all my good sir i said i am trying to understand them andi wish that you would be a little clearer 
 well he said have you never heard that forms of government are tyrannies and there are democracies and there arearistocracies 
 yes i know 
 and the government is the ruling power in each state 
 certainly 
 and the different forms of government make laws tyrannical with a view to their several these laws which are made by them for their own interests arethe justice which they deliver to their subjects and him whotransgresses them they punish as a breaker of the law and unjust andthat is what i mean when i say that in all states there is the sameprinciple of justice which is the interest of the government andas the government must be supposed to have power the onlyreasonable conclusion is that everywhere there is one principle ofjustice which is the interest of the stronger 
 now i understand you i said and whether you are right or not iwill try to discover but let me remark that in defining justiceyou have yourself used the word interest which you forbade me touse it is true however that in your definition the words of thestronger are added 
 a small addition you must allow he said 
 great or small never mind about that we must first enquire whetherwhat you are saying is the truth now we are both agreed thatjustice is interest of some sort but you go on to say of thestronger about this addition i am not so sure and must thereforeconsider further 
 proceed 
 i will and first tell me do you admit that it is just orsubjects to obey their rulers 
 i do 
 but are the rulers of states absolutely infallible or are theysometimes liable to err 
 to be sure he replied they are liable to err 
 then in making their laws they may sometimes make them sometimes not 
 true 
 when they make them rightly they make them agreeably to theirinterest when they are mistaken contrary to their interest youadmit that 
 yes 
 and the laws which they make must be obeyed by their subjects andthat is what you call justice 
 doubtless 
 then justice according to your argument is not only obedience tothe interest of the stronger but the reverse 
 what is that you are saying he asked 
 i am only repeating what you are saying i believe but let usconsider have we not admitted that the rulers may be mistaken abouttheir own interest in what they command and also that to obey them isjustice has not that been admitted 
 yes 
 then you must also have acknowledged justice not to be for theinterest of the stronger when the rulers unintentionally commandthings to be done which are to their own injury for if as you is the obedience which the subject renders to theircommands in that case o wisest of men is there any escape fromthe conclusion that the weaker are commanded to do not what is forthe interest but what is for the injury of the stronger 
 nothing can be clearer socrates said polemarchus 
 socrates cleitophon polemarchus thrasymachus 
 yes said cleitophon interposing if you are allowed to be hiswitness 
 but there is no need of any witness said polemarchus forthrasymachus himself acknowledges that rulers may sometimes commandwhat is not for their own interest and that for subjects to obey themis justice 
 yes polemarchus thrasymachus said that for subjects to do whatwas commanded by their rulers is just 
 yes cleitophon but he also said that justice is the interest ofthe stronger and while admitting both these propositions he furtheracknowledged that the stronger may command the weaker who are hissubjects to do what is not for his own interest whence follows thatjustice is the injury quite as much as the interest of the stronger 
 but said cleitophon he meant by the interest of the strongerwhat the stronger thought to be his interest this was what theweaker had to do and this was affirmed by him to be justice 
 those were not his words rejoined polemarchus 
 socrates thrasymachus 
 never mind i replied if he now says that they are let us accepthis statement tell me thrasymachus i said did you mean byjustice what the stronger thought to be his interest whether reallyso or not 
 certainly not he said do you suppose that i call him who ismistaken the stronger at the time when he is mistaken 
 yes i said my impression was that you did so when you admittedthat the ruler was not infallible but might be sometimes mistaken 
 you argue like an informer socrates do you mean for example thathe who is mistaken about the sick is a physician in that he ismistaken or that he who errs in arithmetic or grammar is anarithmetician or grammarian at the me when he is making the respect of the mistake true we say that the physician orarithmetician or grammarian has made a mistake but this is only a wayof speaking for the fact is that neither the grammarian nor any otherperson of skill ever makes a mistake in so far as he is what hisname implies they none of them err unless their skill fails them andthen they cease to be skilled artists no artist or sage or ruler errsat the time when he is what his name implies though he is commonlysaid to err and i adopted the common mode of speaking but to beperfectly accurate since you are such a lover of accuracy weshould say that the ruler in so far as he is the ruler isunerring and being unerring always commands that which is for hisown interest and the subject is required to execute his commands andtherefore as i said at first and now repeat justice is theinterest of the stronger 
 indeed thrasymachus and do i really appear to you to argue like aninformer 
 certainly he replied 
 and you suppose that i ask these questions with any design ofinjuring you in the argument 
 nay he replied suppose is not the word i know it but you willbe found out and by sheer force of argument you will never prevail 
 i shall not make the attempt my dear man but to avoid anymisunderstanding occurring between us in future let me ask in whatsense do you speak of a ruler or stronger whose interest as youwere saying he being the superior it is just that the inferiorshould execute is he a ruler in the popular or in the strict senseof the term 
 in the strictest of all senses he said and now cheat and playthe informer if you can i ask no quarter at your hands but you neverwill be able never 
 and do you imagine i said that i am such a madman as to try andcheat thrasymachus i might as well shave a lion 
 why he said you made the attempt a minute ago and you failed 
 enough i said of these civilities it will be better that i shouldask you a question is the physician taken in that strict sense ofwhich you are speaking a healer of the sick or a maker of remember that i am now speaking of the true physician 
 a healer of the sick he replied 
 and the pilot that is to say the true pilot is he a captainof sailors or a mere sailor 
 a captain of sailors 
 the circumstance that he sails in the ship is not to be taken intoaccount neither is he to be called a sailor the name pilot bywhich he is distinguished has nothing to do with sailing but issignificant of his skill and of his authority over the sailors 
 very true he said 
 now i said every art has an interest 
 certainly 
 for which the art has to consider and provide 
 yes that is the aim of art 
 and the interest of any art is the perfection of it this andnothing else 
 what do you mean 
 i mean what i may illustrate negatively by the example of thebody suppose you were to ask me whether the body is orhas wants i should reply certainly the body has wants for thebody may be ill and require to be cured and has therefore intereststo which the art of medicine ministers and this is the origin andintention of medicine as you will acknowledge am i not right 
 quite right he replied 
 but is the art of medicine or any other art faulty or deficient inany quality in the same way that the eye may be deficient in sightor the ear fail of hearing and therefore requires another art toprovide for the interests of seeing and hearing has art in itself isay any similar liability to fault or defect and does every artrequire another supplementary art to provide for its interests andthat another and another without end or have the arts to look onlyafter their own interests or have they no need either of themselvesor of another having no faults or defects they have no need tocorrect them either by the exercise of their own art or of any have only to consider the interest of their forevery art remains pure and faultless while remaining true that is tosay while perfect and unimpaired take the words in your precisesense and tell me whether i am not right 
 yes clearly 
 then medicine does not consider the interest of medicine but theinterest of the body 
 true he said 
 nor does the art of horsemanship consider the interests of the artof horsemanship but the interests of the horse neither do anyother arts care for themselves for they have no needs they care onlyfor that which is the subject of their art 
 true he said 
 but surely thrasymachus the arts are the superiors and rulers oftheir own subjects 
 to this he assented with a good deal of reluctance 
 then i said no science or art considers or enjoins the interest ofthe stronger or superior but only the interest of the subject andweaker 
 he made an attempt to contest this proposition also but finallyacquiesced 
 then i continued no physician in so far as he is a his own good in what he prescribes but the good of hispatient for the true physician is also a ruler having the humanbody as a subject and is not a mere that has beenadmitted 
 yes 
 and the pilot likewise in the strict sense of the term is aruler of sailors and not a mere sailor 
 that has been admitted 
 and such a pilot and ruler will provide and prescribe for theinterest of the sailor who is under him and not for his own or interest 
 he gave a reluctant yes 
 then i said thrasymachus there is no one in any rule who in sofar as he is a ruler considers or enjoins what is for his owninterest but always what is for the interest of his subject orsuitable to his art to that he looks and that alone he considersin everything which he says and does 
 when we had got to this point in the argument and every one sawthat the definition of justice had been completely instead of replying to me said tell me socrates haveyou got a nurse 
 why do you ask such a question i said when you ought rather tobe answering 
 because she leaves you to snivel and never wipes your nose she hasnot even taught you to know the shepherd from the sheep 
 what makes you say that i replied 
 because you fancy that the shepherd or neatherd fattens of tends thesheep or oxen with a view to their own good and not to the good ofhimself or his master and you further imagine that the rulers ofstates if they are true rulers never think of their subjects assheep and that they are not studying their own advantage day andnight oh no and so entirely astray are you in your ideas aboutthe just and unjust as not even to know that justice and the justare in reality good that is to say the interest of theruler and stronger and the loss of the subject and servant andinjustice the opposite for the unjust is lord over the truly simpleand just he is the stronger and his subjects do what is for hisinterest and minister to his happiness which is very far frombeing their own consider further most foolish socrates that thejust is always a loser in comparison with the unjust first of all inprivate contracts wherever the unjust is the partner of the justyou will find that when the partnership is dissolved the unjustman has always more and the just less secondly in their dealingswith the state when there is an income tax the just man will paymore and the unjust less on the same amount of income and whenthere is anything to be received the one gains nothing and the othermuch observe also what happens when they take an office there is thejust man neglecting his affairs and perhaps suffering other getting nothing out of the public because he is just moreover heis hated by his friends and acquaintance for refusing to serve them inunlawful ways but all this is reversed in the case of the unjust am speaking as before of injustice on a large scale in which theadvantage of the unjust is more apparent and my meaning will bemost clearly seen if we turn to that highest form of injustice inwhich the criminal is the happiest of men and the sufferers orthose who refuse to do injustice are the most miserable that is tosay tyranny which by fraud and force takes away the property ofothers not little by little but wholesale comprehending in sacred as well as profane private and public for which actsof wrong if he were detected perpetrating any one of them would be punished and incur great disgrace they who do such wrongin particular cases are called robbers of temples and burglars and swindlers and thieves but when a man besidestaking away the money of the citizens has made slaves of them of these names of reproach he is termed happy and only by the citizens but by all who hear of his having achievedthe consummation of injustice for mankind censure that they may be the victims of it and not because they shrinkfrom committing it and thus as i have shown socrates on a sufficient scale has more strength and freedom andmastery than justice and as i said at first justice is the interestof the stronger whereas injustice is a own profit and interest 
 thrasymachus when he had thus spoken having like a our ears with his words had a mind to go away but thecompany would not let him they insisted that he should remain anddefend his position and i myself added my own humble request thathe would not leave us thrasymachus i said to him excellent man howsuggestive are your remarks and are you going to run away beforeyou have fairly taught or learned whether they are true or not is theattempt to determine the way of life so small a matter in youreyes to determine how life may be passed by each one of us to thegreatest advantage 
 and do i differ from you he said as to the importance of theenquiry 
 you appear rather i replied to have no care or thought about whether we live better or worse from not knowing whatyou say you know is to you a matter of indifference prithee not keep your knowledge to yourself we are a large party andany benefit which you confer upon us will be amply rewarded for myown part i openly declare that i am not convinced and that i do notbelieve injustice to be more gainful than justice even ifuncontrolled and allowed to have free play for granting that theremay be an unjust man who is able to commit injustice either by fraudor force still this does not convince me of the superior advantage ofinjustice and there may be others who are in the same predicamentwith myself perhaps we may be wrong if so you in your wisdom shouldconvince us that we are mistaken in preferring justice to injustice 
 and how am i to convince you he said if you are not alreadyconvinced by what i have just said what more can i do for you have me put the proof bodily into your souls 
 heaven forbid i said i would only ask you to be consistent or ifyou change change openly and let there be no deception for i mustremark thrasymachus if you will recall what was previously although you began by defining the true physician in an exactsense you did not observe a like exactness when speaking of theshepherd you thought that the shepherd as a shepherd tends thesheep not with a view to their own good but like a mere diner orbanqueter with a view to the pleasures of the table or again as atrader for sale in the market and not as a shepherd yet surely theart of the shepherd is concerned only with the good of his has only to provide the best for them since the perfection ofthe art is already ensured whenever all the requirements of it aresatisfied and that was what i was saying just now about the conceived that the art of the ruler considered as ruler whether ina state or in private life could only regard the good of his flock orsubjects whereas you seem to think that the rulers in states that isto say the true rulers like being in authority 
 think nay i am sure of it 
 then why in the case of lesser offices do men never take themwillingly without payment unless under the idea that they governfor the advantage not of themselves but of others let me ask you aquestion are not the several arts different by reason of theireach having a separate function and my dear illustrious friend dosay what you think that we may make a little progress 
 yes that is the difference he replied 
 and each art gives us a particular good and not merely a general for example gives us health navigation safety at so on 
 yes he said 
 and the art of payment has the special function of giving pay butwe do not confuse this with other arts any more than the art of thepilot is to be confused with the art of medicine because the healthof the pilot may be improved by a sea voyage you would not beinclined to say would you that navigation is the art of medicine atleast if we are to adopt your exact use of language 
 certainly not 
 or because a man is in good health when he receives pay you wouldnot say that the art of payment is medicine 
 i should say not 
 nor would you say that medicine is the art of receiving paybecause a man takes fees when he is engaged in healing 
 certainly not 
 and we have admitted i said that the good of each art is speciallyconfined to the art 
 yes 
 then if there be any good which all artists have in common that isto be attributed to something of which they all have the common use 
 true he replied 
 and when the artist is benefited by receiving pay the advantage isgained by an additional use of the art of pay which is not the artprofessed by him 
 he gave a reluctant assent to this 
 then the pay is not derived by the several artists from theirrespective arts but the truth is that while the art of medicinegives health and the art of the builder builds a house another artattends them which is the art of pay the various arts may be doingtheir own business and benefiting that over which they preside butwould the artist receive any benefit from his art unless he werepaid as well 
 i suppose not 
 but does he therefore confer no benefit when he works for nothing 
 certainly he confers a benefit 
 then now thrasymachus there is no longer any doubt that neitherarts nor governments provide for their own interests but as wewere before saying they rule and provide for the interests of theirsubjects who are the weaker and not the stronger to their goodthey attend and not to the good of the superior 
 and this is the reason my dear thrasymachus why as i was just nowsaying no one is willing to govern because no one likes to take inhand the reformation of evils which are not his concern withoutremuneration for in the execution of his work and in giving hisorders to another the true artist does not regard his own always that of his subjects and therefore in order that rulersmay be willing to rule they must be paid in one of three modes ofpayment money or honour or a penalty for refusing 
 socrates glaucon 
 what do you mean socrates said glaucon the first two modes ofpayment are intelligible enough but what the penalty is i do notunderstand or how a penalty can be a payment 
 you mean that you do not understand the nature of this payment whichto the best men is the great inducement to rule of course you knowthat ambition and avarice are held to be as indeed they are adisgrace 
 very true 
 and for this reason i said money and honour have no attraction forthem good men do not wish to be openly demanding payment forgoverning and so to get the name of hirelings nor by secretly helpingthemselves out of the public revenues to get the name of not being ambitious they do not care about honour whereforenecessity must be laid upon them and they must be induced to servefrom the fear of punishment and this as i imagine is the reason whythe forwardness to take office instead of waiting to be been deemed dishonourable now the worst part of the punishment isthat he who refuses to rule is liable to be ruled by one who isworse than himself and the fear of this as i conceive induces thegood to take office not because they would but because they cannothelp not under the idea that they are going to have any benefit orenjoyment themselves but as a necessity and because they are notable to commit the task of ruling to any one who is better thanthemselves or indeed as good for there is reason to think that ifa city were composed entirely of good men then to avoid officewould be as much an object of contention as to obtain office is atpresent then we should have plain proof that the true ruler is notmeant by nature to regard his own interest but that of hissubjects and every one who knew this would choose rather to receive abenefit from another than to have the trouble of conferring one sofar am i from agreeing with thrasymachus that justice is theinterest of the stronger this latter question need not be furtherdiscussed at present but when thrasymachus says that the life ofthe unjust is more advantageous than that of the just his newstatement appears to me to be of a far more serious character whichof us has spoken truly and which sort of life glaucon do youprefer 
 i for my part deem the life of the just to be the more answered 
 did you hear all the advantages of the unjust which thrasymachus wasrehearsing 
 yes i heard him he replied but he has not convinced me 
 then shall we try to find some way of convincing him if we he is saying what is not true 
 most certainly he replied 
 if i said he makes a set speech and we make another recounting allthe advantages of being just and he answers and we rejoin there mustbe a numbering and measuring of the goods which are claimed oneither side and in the end we shall want judges to decide but ifwe proceed in our enquiry as we lately did by making admissions toone another we shall unite the offices of judge and advocate in ourown persons 
 very good he said 
 and which method do i understand you to prefer i said 
 that which you propose 
 well then thrasymachus i said suppose you begin at the beginningand answer me you say that perfect injustice is more gainful thanperfect justice 
 socrates glaucon thrasymachus 
 yes that is what i say and i have given you my reasons 
 and what is your view about them would you call one of themvirtue and the other vice 
 certainly 
 i suppose that you would call justice virtue and injustice vice 
 what a charming notion so likely too seeing that i affirminjustice to be profitable and justice not 
 what else then would you say 
 the opposite he replied 
 and would you call justice vice 
 no i would rather say sublime simplicity 
 then would you call injustice malignity 
 no i would rather say discretion 
 and do the unjust appear to you to be wise and good 
 yes he said at any rate those of them who are able to be perfectlyunjust and who have the power of subduing states and nations butperhaps you imagine me to be talking of cutpurses 
 even this profession if undetected has advantages though they arenot to be compared with those of which i was just now speaking 
 i do not think that i misapprehend your meaning thrasymachus ireplied but still i cannot hear without amazement that you classinjustice with wisdom and virtue and justice with the opposite 
 certainly i do so class them 
 now i said you are on more substantial and almost unanswerableground for if the injustice which you were maintaining to beprofitable had been admitted by you as by others to be vice anddeformity an answer might have been given to you on receivedprinciples but now i perceive that you will call injustice honourableand strong and to the unjust you will attribute all the qualitieswhich were attributed by us before to the just seeing that you do nothesitate to rank injustice with wisdom and virtue 
 you have guessed most infallibly he replied 
 then i certainly ought not to shrink from going through with theargument so long as i have reason to think that you thrasymachus arespeaking your real mind for i do believe that you are now inearnest and are not amusing yourself at our expense 
 i may be in earnest or not but what is that to you to refute theargument is your business 
 very true i said that is what i have to do but will you be sogood as answer yet one more question does the just man try to gainany advantage over the just 
 far otherwise if he did would not be the simple amusing creaturewhich he is 
 and would he try to go beyond just action 
 he would not 
 and how would he regard the attempt to gain an advantage over theunjust would that be considered by him as just or unjust 
 he would think it just and would try to gain the advantage buthe would not be able 
 whether he would or would not be able i said is not to thepoint my question is only whether the just man while refusing tohave more than another just man would wish and claim to have morethan the unjust 
 yes he would 
 and what of the unjust does he claim to have more than the justman and to do more than is just 
 of course he said for he claims to have more than all men 
 and the unjust man will strive and struggle to obtain more thanthe unjust man or action in order that he may have more than all 
 true 
 we may put the matter thus i said the just does not desire morethan his like but more than his unlike whereas the unjust desiresmore than both his like and his unlike 
 nothing he said can be better than that statement 
 and the unjust is good and wise and the just is neither 
 good again he said 
 and is not the unjust like the wise and good and the just unlikethem 
 of course he said he who is of a certain nature is like those whoare of a certain nature he who is not not 
 each of them i said is such as his like is 
 certainly he replied 
 very good thrasymachus i said and now to take the case of thearts you would admit that one man is a musician and another not amusician 
 yes 
 and which is wise and which is foolish 
 clearly the musician is wise and he who is not a musician isfoolish 
 and he is good in as far as he is wise and bad in as far as he isfoolish 
 yes 
 and you would say the same sort of thing of the physician 
 yes 
 and do you think my excellent friend that a musician when headjusts the lyre would desire or claim to exceed or go beyond amusician in the tightening and loosening the strings 
 i do not think that he would 
 but he would claim to exceed the 
 of course 
 and what would you say of the physician in prescribing meats anddrinks would he wish to go beyond another physician or beyond thepractice of medicine 
 he would not 
 but he would wish to go beyond the 
 yes 
 and about knowledge and ignorance in general see whether youthink that any man who has knowledge ever would wish to have thechoice of saying or doing more than another man who has he not rather say or do the same as his like in the same case 
 that i suppose can hardly be denied 
 and what of the ignorant would he not desire to have more thaneither the knowing or the ignorant 
 i dare say 
 and the knowing is wise 
 yes 
 and the wise is good 
 true 
 then the wise and good will not desire to gain more than his more than his unlike and opposite 
 i suppose so 
 whereas the bad and ignorant will desire to gain more than both 
 yes 
 but did we not say thrasymachus that the unjust goes beyond bothhis like and unlike were not these your words they were 
 they were 
 and you also said that the lust will not go beyond his like buthis unlike 
 yes 
 then the just is like the wise and good and the unjust like theevil and ignorant 
 that is the inference 
 and each of them is such as his like is 
 that was admitted 
 then the just has turned out to be wise and good and the unjust eviland ignorant 
 thrasymachus made all these admissions not fluently as i repeatthem but with extreme reluctance it was a hot day andthe perspiration poured from him in torrents and then i saw what ihad never seen before thrasymachus blushing as we were now agreedthat justice was virtue and wisdom and injustice vice andignorance i proceeded to another point 
 well i said thrasymachus that matter is now settled but werewe not also saying that injustice had strength do you remember 
 yes i remember he said but do not suppose that i approve ofwhat you are saying or have no answer if however i were to would be quite certain to accuse me of haranguing thereforeeither permit me to have my say out or if you would rather ask doso and i will answer very good as they say to oldwomen and will nod yes and no 
 certainly not i said if contrary to your real opinion 
 yes he said i will to please you since you will not let mespeak what else would you have 
 nothing in the world i said and if you are so disposed i willask and you shall answer 
 proceed 
 then i will repeat the question which i asked before in orderthat our examination of the relative nature of justice and injusticemay be carried on regularly a statement was made that injustice isstronger and more powerful than justice but now justice havingbeen identified with wisdom and virtue is easily shown to be strongerthan injustice if injustice is ignorance this can no longer bequestioned by any one but i want to view the matter thrasymachus ina different way you would not deny that a state may be unjust and maybe unjustly attempting to enslave other states or may have alreadyenslaved them and may be holding many of them in subjection 
 true he replied and i will add the best and perfectly unjust statewill be most likely to do so 
 i know i said that such was your position but what i wouldfurther consider is whether this power which is possessed by thesuperior state can exist or be exercised without justice 
 if you are right in you view and justice is wisdom then onlywith justice but if i am right then without justice 
 i am delighted thrasymachus to see you not only nodding assent anddissent but making answers which are quite excellent 
 that is out of civility to you he replied 
 you are very kind i said and would you have the goodness also toinform me whether you think that a state or an army or a band ofrobbers and thieves or any other gang of could act atall if they injured one another 
 no indeed he said they could not 
 but if they abstained from injuring one another then they might acttogether better 
 yes 
 and this is because injustice creates divisions and hatreds andfighting and justice imparts harmony and friendship is not thattrue thrasymachus 
 i agree he said because i do not wish to quarrel with you 
 how good of you i said but i should like to know also whetherinjustice having this tendency to arouse hatred wherever slaves or among freemen will not make them hate one another andset them at variance and render them incapable of common action 
 certainly 
 and even if injustice be found in two only will they not quarreland fight and become enemies to one another and to the just 
 they will 
 and suppose injustice abiding in a single person would yourwisdom say that she loses or that she retains her natural power 
 let us assume that she retains her power 
 yet is not the power which injustice exercises of such a nature thatwherever she takes up her abode whether in a city in an army in afamily or in any other body that body is to begin with renderedincapable of united action by reason of sedition and does it not become its own enemy and at variance with all thatopposes it and with the just is not this the case 
 yes certainly 
 and is not injustice equally fatal when existing in a single the first place rendering him incapable of action because he is notat unity with himself and in the second place making him an enemyto himself and the just is not that true thrasymachus 
 yes 
 and o my friend i said surely the gods are just 
 granted that they are 
 but if so the unjust will be the enemy of the gods and the justwill be their friend 
 feast away in triumph and take your fill of the argument i willnot oppose you lest i should displease the company 
 well then proceed with your answers and let me have theremainder of my repast for we have already shown that the just areclearly wiser and better and abler than the unjust and that theunjust are incapable of common action nay ing at more that tospeak as we did of men who are evil acting at any time vigorouslytogether is not strictly true for if they had been perfectly would have laid hands upon one another but it is evident thatthere must have been some remnant of justice in them which enabledthem to combine if there had not been they would have injured oneanother as well as their victims they were but half villains intheir enterprises for had they been whole villains and utterlyunjust they would have been utterly incapable of action that as ibelieve is the truth of the matter and not what you said at whether the just have a better and happier life than the unjust isa further question which we also proposed to consider i think thatthey have and for the reasons which to have given but still i shouldlike to examine further for no light matter is at stake nothing lessthan the rule of human life 
 proceed 
 i will proceed by asking a question would you not say that ahorse has some end 
 i should 
 and the end or use of a horse or of anything would be that whichcould not be accomplished or not so well accomplished by any otherthing 
 i do not understand he said 
 let me explain can you see except with the eye 
 certainly not 
 or hear except with the ear 
 no 
 these then may be truly said to be the ends of these organs 
 they may 
 but you can cut off a with a dagger or with a in many other ways 
 of course 
 and yet not so well as with a made for the purpose 
 true 
 may we not say that this is the end of a 
 we may 
 then now i think you will have no difficulty in understanding mymeaning when i asked the question whether the end of anything would bethat which could not be accomplished or not so well any other thing 
 i understand your meaning he said and assent 
 and that to which an end is appointed has also an excellence need iask again whether the eye has an end 
 it has 
 and has not the eye an excellence 
 yes 
 and the ear has an end and an excellence also 
 true 
 and the same is true of all other things they have each of theman end and a special excellence 
 that is so 
 well and can the eyes fulfil their end if they are wanting in theirown proper excellence and have a defect instead 
 how can they he said if they are blind and cannot see 
 you mean to say if they have lost their proper excellence which issight but i have not arrived at that point yet i would rather askthe question more generally and only enquire whether the things whichfulfil their ends fulfil them by their own proper excellence and fallof fulfilling them by their own defect 
 certainly he replied 
 i might say the same of the ears when deprived of their ownproper excellence they cannot fulfil their end 
 true 
 and the same observation will apply to all other things 
 i agree 
 well and has not the soul an end which nothing else can fulfil forexample to superintend and command and deliberate and the like arenot these functions proper to the soul and can they rightly beassigned to any other 
 to no other 
 and is not life to be reckoned among the ends of the soul 
 assuredly he said 
 and has not the soul an excellence also 
 yes 
 and can she or can she not fulfil her own ends when deprived of thatexcellence 
 she cannot 
 then an evil soul must necessarily be an evil ruler andsuperintendent and the good soul a good ruler 
 yes necessarily 
 and we have admitted that justice is the excellence of the soul andinjustice the defect of the soul 
 that has been admitted 
 then the just soul and the just man will live well and the unjustman will live ill 
 that is what your argument proves 
 and he who lives well is blessed and happy and he who lives ill thereverse of happy 
 certainly 
 then the just is happy and the unjust miserable 
 so be it 
 but happiness and not misery is profitable 
 of course 
 then my blessed thrasymachus injustice can never be moreprofitable than justice 
 let this socrates he said be your entertainment at the bendidea 
 for which i am indebted to you i said now that you have growngentle towards me and have left off scolding nevertheless i have notbeen well entertained but that was my own fault and not yours asan epicure snatches a taste of every dish which is successivelybrought to table he not having allowed himself time to enjoy theone before so have i gone from one subject to another withouthaving discovered what i sought at first the nature of justice ileft that enquiry and turned away to consider whether justice isvirtue and wisdom or evil and folly and when there arose a furtherquestion about the comparative advantages of justice and could not refrain from passing on to that and the result of thewhole discussion has been that i know nothing at all for i know notwhat justice is and therefore i am not likely to know whether it isor is not a virtue nor can i say whether the just man is happy or unhappy

 socrates glaucon 
 with these words i was thinking that i had made an end of the discussion but the end in truth proved to be only a beginning for glaucon who is always the most pugnacious of men was dissatisfied at thrasymachus retirement he wanted to have the battle out so he said to me socrates do you wish really to persuade us or only to seem to have persuaded us that to be just is always better than to be unjust 
 i should wish really to persuade you i replied if i could 
 then you certainly have not succeeded let me ask you now how would you arrange goods are there not some which we welcome for their own sakes and independently of their consequences as for example harmless pleasures and enjoyments which delight us at the time although nothing follows from them 
 i agree in thinking that there is such a class i replied 
 is there not also a second class of goods such as knowledge sight health which are desirable not only in themselves but also for their results 
 certainly i said 
 and would you not recognize a third class such as gymnastic and the care of the sick and the art also the various ways of these do us good but we regard them as disagreeable and no one would choose them for their own sakes but only for the sake of some reward or result which flows from them 
 there is i said this third class also but why do you ask 
 because i want to know in which of the three classes you would place justice 
 in the highest class i replied among those goods which he who would be happy desires both for their own sake and for the sake of their results 
 then the many are of another mind they think that justice is to be reckoned in the troublesome class among goods which are to be pursued for the sake of rewards and of reputation but in themselves are disagreeable and rather to be avoided 
 i know i said that this is their manner of thinking and that this was the thesis which thrasymachus was maintaining just now when he censured justice and praised injustice but i am too stupid to be convinced by him 
 i wish he said that you would hear me as well as him and then i shall see whether you and i agree for thrasymachus seems to me like a snake to have been charmed by your voice sooner than he ought to have been but to my mind the nature of justice and injustice have not yet been made clear setting aside their rewards and results i want to know what they are in themselves and how they inwardly work in the soul if you please then i will revive the argument of thrasymachus and first i will speak of the nature and origin of justice according to the common view of them secondly i will show that all men who practise justice do so against their will of necessity but not as a good and thirdly i will argue that there is reason in this view for the life of the unjust is after all better far than the life of the just if what they say is true socrates since i myself am not of their opinion but still i acknowledge that i am perplexed when i hear the voices of thrasymachus and myriads of others dinning in my ears and on the other hand i have never yet heard the superiority of justice to injustice maintained by any one in a satisfactory way i want to hear justice praised in respect of itself then i shall be satisfied and you are the person from whom i think that i am most likely to hear this and therefore i will praise the unjust life to the utmost of my power and my manner of speaking will indicate the manner in which i desire to hear you too praising justice and censuring injustice will you say whether you approve of my proposal 
 indeed i do nor can i imagine any theme about which a man of sense would oftener wish to converse 
 i am delighted he replied to hear you say so and shall begin by speaking as i proposed of the nature and origin of justice 
 glaucon 
 they say that to do injustice is by nature good to suffer injustice evil but that the evil is greater than the good and so when men have both done and suffered injustice and have had experience of both not being able to avoid the one and obtain the other they think that they had better agree among themselves to have neither hence there arise laws and mutual covenants and that which is ordained by law is termed by them lawful and just this they affirm to be the origin and nature of justice it is a mean or compromise between the best of all which is to do injustice and not be punished and the worst of all which is to suffer injustice without the power of retaliation and justice being at a middle point between the two is tolerated not as a good but as the lesser evil and honoured by reason of the inability of men to do injustice for no man who is worthy to be called a man would ever submit to such an agreement if he were able to resist he would be mad if he did such is the received account socrates of the nature and origin of justice 
 now that those who practise justice do so involuntarily and because they have not the power to be unjust will best appear if we imagine something of this kind having given both to the just and the unjust power to do what they will let us watch and see whither desire will lead them then we shall discover in the very act the just and unjust man to be proceeding along the same road following their interest which all natures deem to be their good and are only diverted into the path of justice by the force of law the liberty which we are supposing may be most completely given to them in the form of such a power as is said to have been possessed by gyges the ancestor of croesus the lydian according to the tradition gyges was a shepherd in the service of the king of lydia there was a great storm and an earthquake made an opening in the earth at the place where he was feeding his flock amazed at the sight he descended into the opening where among other marvels he beheld a hollow brazen horse having doors at which he stooping and looking in saw a dead body of stature as appeared to him more than human and having nothing on but a gold ring this he took from the finger of the dead and reascended now the shepherds met together according to custom that they might send their monthly report about the flocks to the king into their assembly he came having the ring on his finger and as he was sitting among them he chanced to turn the collet of the ring inside his hand when instantly he became invisible to the rest of the company and they began to speak of him as if he were no longer present he was astonished at this and again touching the ring he turned the collet outwards and reappeared he made several trials of the ring and always with the same he turned the collet inwards he became invisible when outwards he reappeared whereupon he contrived to be chosen one of the messengers who were sent to the court where as soon as he arrived he seduced the queen and with her help conspired against the king and slew him and took the kingdom suppose now that there were two such magic rings and the just put on one of them and the unjust the man can be imagined to be of such an iron nature that he would stand fast in justice no man would keep his hands off what was not his own when he could safely take what he liked out of the market or go into houses and lie with any one at his pleasure or kill or release from prison whom he would and in all respects be like a god among men then the actions of the just would be as the actions of the unjust they would both come at last to the same point and this we may truly affirm to be a great proof that a man is just not willingly or because he thinks that justice is any good to him individually but of necessity for wherever any one thinks that he can safely be unjust there he is unjust for all men believe in their hearts that injustice is far more profitable to the individual than justice and he who argues as i have been supposing will say that they are right if you could imagine any one obtaining this power of becoming invisible and never doing any wrong or touching what was he would be thought by the to be a most wretched idiot although they would praise him to one faces and keep up appearances with one another from a fear that they too might suffer injustice enough of this 
 now if we are to form a real judgment of the life of the just and unjust we must isolate them there is no other way and how is the isolation to be effected i answer let the unjust man be entirely unjust and the just man entirely just nothing is to be taken away from either of them and both are to be perfectly furnished for the work of their respective lives first let the unjust be like other distinguished masters of craft like the skilful pilot or physician who knows intuitively his own powers and keeps within their limits and who if he fails at any point is able to recover himself so let the unjust make his unjust attempts in the right way and lie hidden if he means to be great in his injustice he who is found out is nobody for the highest reach of injustice is to be deemed just when you are not therefore i say that in the perfectly unjust man we must assume the most perfect injustice there is to be no deduction but we must allow him while doing the most unjust acts to have acquired the greatest reputation for justice if he have taken a false step he must be able to recover himself he must be one who can speak with effect if any of his deeds come to light and who can force his way where force is required his courage and strength and command of money and friends and at his side let us place the just man in his nobleness and simplicity wishing as aeschylus says to be and not to seem good there must be no seeming for if he seem to be just he will be honoured and rewarded and then we shall not know whether he is just for the sake of justice or for the sake of honours and rewards therefore let him be clothed in justice only and have no other covering and he must be imagined in a state of life the opposite of the former let him be the best of men and let him be thought the worst then he will have been put to the proof and we shall see whether he will be affected by the fear of infamy and its consequences and let him continue thus to the hour of death being just and seeming to be unjust when both have reached the uttermost extreme the one of justice and the other of injustice let judgment be given which of them is the happier of the two

 heavens my dear glaucon i said how energetically you polish them up for the decision first one and then the other as if they were two statues 
 i do my best he said and now that we know what they are like there is no difficulty in tracing out the sort of life which awaits either of them this i will proceed to describe but as you may think the description a little too coarse i ask you to suppose socrates that the words which follow are not mine let me put them into the mouths of the eulogists of injustice they will tell you that the just man who is thought unjust will be scourged racked bound will have his eyes burnt out and at last after suffering every kind of evil he will be impaled then he will understand that he ought to seem only and not to be just the words of aeschylus may be more truly spoken of the unjust than of the just for the unjust is pursuing a reality he does not live with a view to appearances he wants to be really unjust and not to seem only 
 his mind has a soil deep and fertile 
 out of which spring his prudent counsels in the first place he is thought just and therefore bears rule in the city he can marry whom he will and give in marriage to whom he will also he can trade and deal where he likes and always to his own advantage because he has no misgivings about injustice and at every contest whether in public or private he gets the better of his antagonists and gains at their expense and is rich and out of his gains he can benefit his friends and harm his enemies moreover he can offer sacrifices and dedicate gifts to the gods abundantly and magnificently and can honour the gods or any man whom he wants to honour in a far better style than the just and therefore he is likely to be dearer than they are to the gods and thus socrates gods and men are said to unite in making the life of the unjust better than the life of the just 
 adeimantus socrates 
 i was going to say something in answer to glaucon when adeimantus his brother interposed socrates he said you do not suppose that there is nothing more to be urged 
 why what else is there i answered 
 the strongest point of all has not been even mentioned he replied 
 well then according to the proverb let brother help brother if he fails in any part do you assist him although i must confess that glaucon has already said quite enough to lay me in the dust and take from me the power of helping justice 
 adeimantus 
 nonsense he replied but let me add something more there is another side to argument about the praise and censure of justice and injustice which is equally required in order to bring out what i believe to be his meaning parents and tutors are always telling their sons and their wards that they are to be just but why not for the sake of justice but for the sake of character and reputation in the hope of obtaining for him who is reputed just some of those offices marriages and the like which glaucon has enumerated among the advantages accruing to the unjust from the reputation of justice more however is made of appearances by this class of persons than by the others for they throw in the good opinion of the gods and will tell you of a shower of benefits which the heavens as they say rain upon the pious and this accords with the testimony of the noble hesiod and homer the first of whom says that the gods make the oaks of the just 
 to hear acorns at their summit and bees i the middle 
 and the sheep the bowed down bowed the with the their fleeces and many other blessings of a like kind are provided for them and homer has a very similar strain for he speaks of one whose fame is 
 as the fame of some blameless king who like a god 
 maintains justice to whom the black earth brings forth 
 wheat and barley whose trees are bowed with fruit 
 and his sheep never fail to bear and the sea gives him fish still grander are the gifts of heaven which musaeus and his son vouchsafe to the just they take them down into the world below where they have the saints lying on couches at a feast everlastingly drunk crowned with garlands their idea seems to be that an immortality of drunkenness is the highest meed of virtue some extend their rewards yet further the posterity as they say of the faithful and just shall survive to the third and fourth generation this is the style in which they praise justice but about the wicked there is another strain they bury them in a slough in hades and make them carry water in a sieve also while they are yet living they bring them to infamy and inflict upon them the punishments which glaucon described as the portion of the just who are reputed to be unjust nothing else does their invention supply such is their manner of praising the one and censuring the other 
 once more socrates i will ask you to consider another way of speaking about justice and injustice which is not confined to the poets but is found in prose writers the universal voice of mankind is always declaring that justice and virtue are honourable but grievous and toilsome and that the pleasures of vice and injustice are easy of attainment and are only censured by law and opinion they say also that honesty is for the most part less profitable than dishonesty and they are quite ready to call wicked men happy and to honour them both in public and private when they are rich or in any other way influential while they despise and overlook those who may be weak and poor even though acknowledging them to be better than the others but most extraordinary of all is their mode of speaking about virtue and the gods they say that the gods apportion calamity and misery to many good men and good and happiness to the wicked and mendicant prophets go to rich doors and persuade them that they have a power committed to them by the gods of making an atonement for a own or his sins by sacrifices or charms with rejoicings and feasts and they promise to harm an enemy whether just or unjust at a small cost with magic arts and incantations binding heaven as they say to execute their will and the poets are the authorities to whom they appeal now smoothing the path of vice with the words of hesiod 
 vice may be had in abundance without trouble the way is smooth and her is near but before virtue the gods have set toil and a tedious and uphill road then citing homer as a witness that the gods may be influenced by men for he also says 
 the gods too may he turned from their purpose and men pray to them and avert their wrath by sacrifices and soothing entreaties and by libations and the odour of fat when they have sinned and transgressed and they produce a host of books written by musaeus and orpheus who were children of the moon and the muses that is what they say according to which they perform their ritual and persuade not only individuals but whole cities that expiations and atonements for sin may be made by sacrifices and amusements which fill a vacant hour and are equally at the service of the living and the dead the latter sort they call mysteries and they redeem us from the pains of hell but if we neglect them no one knows what awaits us 
 he proceeded and now when the young hear all this said about virtue and vice and the way in which gods and men regard them how are their minds likely to be affected my dear socrates those of them i mean who are quickwitted and like bees on the wing light on every flower and from all that they hear are prone to draw conclusions as to what manner of persons they should be and in what way they should walk if they would make the best of life probably the youth will say to himself in the words of pindar 
 can i by justice or by crooked ways of deceit ascend a loftier tower which may he a fortress to me all my days for what men say is that if i am really just and am not also thought just profit there is none but the pain and loss on the other hand are unmistakable but if though unjust i acquire the reputation of justice a heavenly life is promised to me since then as philosophers prove appearance tyrannizes over truth and is lord of happiness to appearance i must devote myself i will describe around me a picture and shadow of virtue to be the vestibule and exterior of my house behind i will trail the subtle and crafty fox as archilochus greatest of sages recommends but i hear some one exclaiming that the concealment of wickedness is often difficult to which i answer nothing great is easy nevertheless the argument indicates this if we would be happy to be the path along which we should proceed with a view to concealment we will establish secret brotherhoods and political clubs and there are professors of rhetoric who teach the art of persuading courts and assemblies and so partly by persuasion and partly by force i shall make unlawful gains and not be punished still i hear a voice saying that the gods cannot be deceived neither can they be compelled but what if there are no gods or suppose them to have no care of human things why in either case should we mind about concealment and even if there are gods and they do care about us yet we know of them only from tradition and the genealogies of the poets and these are the very persons who say that they may be influenced and turned by sacrifices and soothing entreaties and by offerings let us be consistent then and believe both or neither if the poets speak truly why then we had better be unjust and offer of the fruits of injustice for if we are just although we may escape the vengeance of heaven we shall lose the gains of injustice but if we are unjust we shall keep the gains and by our sinning and praying and praying and sinning the gods will be propitiated and we shall not be punished but there is a world below in which either we or our posterity will suffer for our unjust deeds yes my friend will be the reflection but there are mysteries and atoning deities and these have great power that is what mighty cities declare and the children of the gods who were their poets and prophets bear a like testimony 
 on what principle then shall we any longer choose justice rather than the worst injustice when if we only unite the latter with a deceitful regard to appearances we shall fare to our mind both with gods and men in life and after death as the most numerous and the highest authorities tell us knowing all this socrates how can a man who has any superiority of mind or person or rank or wealth be willing to honour justice or indeed to refrain from laughing when he hears justice praised and even if there should be some one who is able to disprove the truth of my words and who is satisfied that justice is best still he is not angry with the unjust but is very ready to forgive them because he also knows that men are not just of their own free will unless peradventure there be some one whom the divinity within him may have inspired with a hatred of injustice or who has attained knowledge of the truth but no other man he only blames injustice who owing to cowardice or age or some weakness has not the power of being unjust and this is proved by the fact that when he obtains the power he immediately becomes unjust as far as he can be 
 the cause of all this socrates was indicated by us at the beginning of the argument when my brother and i told you how astonished we were to find that of all the professing panegyrists of justice beginning with the ancient heroes of whom any memorial has been preserved to us and ending with the men of our own time no one has ever blamed injustice or praised justice except with a view to the glories honours and benefits which flow from them no one has ever adequately described either in verse or prose the true essential nature of either of them abiding in the soul and invisible to any human or divine eye or shown that of all the things of a soul which he has within him justice is the greatest good and injustice the greatest evil had this been the universal strain had you sought to persuade us of this from our youth upwards we should not have been on the watch to keep one another from doing wrong but every one would have been his own watchman because afraid if he did wrong of harbouring in himself the greatest of evils i dare say that thrasymachus and others would seriously hold the language which i have been merely repeating and words even stronger than these about justice and injustice grossly as i conceive perverting their true nature but i speak in this vehement manner as i must frankly confess to you because i want to hear from you the opposite side and i would ask you to show not only the superiority which justice has over injustice but what effect they have on the possessor of them which makes the one to be a good and the other an evil to him and please as glaucon requested of you to exclude reputations for unless you take away from each of them his true reputation and add on the false we shall say that you do not praise justice but the appearance of it we shall think that you are only exhorting us to keep injustice dark and that you really agree with thrasymachus in thinking that justice is good and the interest of the stronger and that injustice is a own profit and interest though injurious to the weaker now as you have admitted that justice is one of that highest class of goods which are desired indeed for their results but in a far greater degree for their own sakes like sight or hearing or knowledge or health or any other real and natural and not merely conventional good i would ask you in your praise of justice to regard one point only i mean the essential good and evil which justice and injustice work in the possessors of them let others praise justice and censure injustice magnifying the rewards and honours of the one and abusing the other that is a manner of arguing which coming from them i am ready to tolerate but from you who have spent your whole life in the consideration of this question unless i hear the contrary from your own lips i expect something better and therefore i say not only prove to us that justice is better than injustice but show what they either of them do to the possessor of them which makes the one to be a good and the other an evil whether seen or unseen by gods and men 
 socrates adeimantus 
 i had always admired the genius of glaucon and adeimantus but on hearing these words i was quite delighted and said sons of an illustrious father that was not a bad beginning of the elegiac verses which the admirer of glaucon made in honour of you after you had distinguished yourselves at the battle of megara 
 sons of ariston he sang divine offspring of an illustrious hero the epithet is very appropriate for there is something truly divine in being able to argue as you have done for the superiority of injustice and remaining unconvinced by your own arguments and i do believe that you are not convinced this i infer from your general character for had i judged only from your speeches i should have mistrusted you but now the greater my confidence in you the greater is my difficulty in knowing what to say for i am in a strait between two on the one hand i feel that i am unequal to the task and my inability is brought home to me by the fact that you were not satisfied with the answer which i made to thrasymachus proving as i thought the superiority which justice has over injustice and yet i cannot refuse to help while breath and speech remain to me i am afraid that there would be an impiety in being present when justice is evil spoken of and not lifting up a hand in her defence and therefore i had best give such help as i can 
 glaucon and the rest entreated me by all means not to let the question drop but to proceed in the investigation they wanted to arrive at the truth first about the nature of justice and injustice and secondly about their relative advantages i told them what i really thought that the enquiry would be of a serious nature and would require very good eyes seeing then i said that we are no great wits i think that we had better adopt a method which i may illustrate thus suppose that a person had been asked by some one to read small letters from a distance and it occurred to some one else that they might be found in another place which was larger and in which the letters were larger if they were the same and he could read the larger letters first and then proceed to the lesser this would have been thought a rare piece of good fortune 
 very true said adeimantus but how does the illustration apply to our enquiry 
 i will tell you i replied justice which is the subject of our enquiry is as you know sometimes spoken of as the virtue of an individual and sometimes as the virtue of a state 
 true he replied 
 and is not a state larger than an individual 
 it is 
 then in the larger the quantity of justice is likely to be larger and more easily discernible i propose therefore that we enquire into the nature of justice and injustice first as they appear in the state and secondly in the individual proceeding from the greater to the lesser and comparing them 
 that he said is an excellent proposal 
 and if we imagine the state in process of creation we shall see the justice and injustice of the state in process of creation also 
 i dare say 
 when the state is completed there may be a hope that the object of our search will be more easily discovered 
 yes far more easily 
 but ought we to attempt to construct one i said for to do so as i am inclined to think will be a very serious task reflect therefore 
 i have reflected said adeimantus and am anxious that you should proceed 
 a state i said arises as i conceive out of the needs of mankind no one is but all of us have many wants can any other origin of a state be imagined 
 there can i be no other 
 then as we have many wants and many persons are needed to supply them one takes a helper for one purpose and another for another and when these partners and helpers are gathered together in one habitation the body of inhabitants is termed a state 
 true he said 
 and they exchange with one another and one gives and another receives under the idea that the exchange will be for their good 
 very true 
 then i said let us begin and create in idea a state and yet the true creator is necessity who is the mother of our invention 
 of course he replied 
 now the first and greatest of necessities is food which is the condition of life and existence 
 certainly 
 the second is a dwelling and the third clothing and the like 
 true 
 and now let us see how our city will be able to supply this great demand we may suppose that one man is a husbandman another a builder some one else a weaver shall we add to them a shoemaker or perhaps some other purveyor to our bodily wants 
 quite right 
 the barest notion of a state must include four or five men 
 clearly 
 and how will they proceed will each bring the result of his labours into a common stock the individual husbandman for example producing for four and labouring four times as long and as much as he need in the provision of food with which he supplies others as well as himself or will he have nothing to do with others and not be at the trouble of producing for them but provide for himself alone a fourth of the food in a fourth of the time and in the remaining of his time be employed in making a house or a coat or a pair of shoes having no partnership with others but supplying himself all his own wants 
 adeimantus thought that he should aim at producing food only and not at producing everything 
 probably i replied that would be the better way and when i hear you say this i am myself reminded that we are not all alike there are diversities of natures among us which are adapted to different occupations 
 very true 
 and will you have a work better done when the workman has many occupations or when he has only one 
 when he has only one 
 further there can be no doubt that a work is spoilt when not done at the right time 
 no doubt 
 for business is not disposed to wait until the doer of the business is at leisure but the doer must follow up what he is doing and make the business his first object 
 he must 
 and if so we must infer that all things are produced more plentifully and easily and of a better quality when one man does one thing which is natural to him and does it at the right time and leaves other things 
 undoubtedly 
 then more than four citizens will be required for the husbandman will not make his own plough or mattock or other implements of agriculture if they are to be good for anything neither will the builder make his tools and he too needs many and in like manner the weaver and shoemaker 
 true 
 then carpenters and smiths and many other artisans will be sharers in our little state which is already beginning to grow 
 true 
 yet even if we add neatherds shepherds and other herdsmen in order that our husbandmen may have oxen to plough with and builders as well as husbandmen may have draught cattle and curriers and weavers fleeces and hides still our state will not be very large 
 that is true yet neither will it be a very small state which contains all these 
 then again there is the situation of the city to find a place where nothing need be imported is impossible 
 impossible 
 then there must be another class of citizens who will bring the required supply from another city 
 there must 
 but if the trader goes having nothing which they require who would supply his need he will come back 
 that is certain 
 and therefore what they produce at home must be not only enough for themselves but such both in quantity and quality as to accommodate those from whom their wants are supplied 
 very true 
 then more husbandmen and more artisans will be required 
 they will 
 not to mention the importers and exporters who are called merchants 
 yes 
 then we shall want merchants 
 we shall 
 and if merchandise is to be carried over the sea skilful sailors will also be needed and in considerable numbers 
 yes in considerable numbers 
 then again within the city how will they exchange their productions to secure such an exchange was as you will remember one of our principal objects when we formed them into a society and constituted a state 
 clearly they will buy and sell 
 then they will need a and a for purposes of exchange 
 certainly 
 suppose now that a husbandman or an artisan brings some production to market and he comes at a time when there is no one to exchange with him is he to leave his calling and sit idle in the 
 not at all he will find people there who seeing the want undertake the office of salesmen in states they are commonly those who are the weakest in bodily strength and therefore of little use for any other purpose their duty is to be in the market and to give money in exchange for goods to those who desire to sell and to take money from those who desire to buy 
 this want then creates a class of in our state is not retailer the term which is applied to those who sit in the engaged in buying and selling while those who wander from one city to another are called merchants 
 yes he said 
 and there is another class of servants who are intellectually hardly on the level of companionship still they have plenty of bodily strength for labour which accordingly they sell and are called if i do not mistake hirelings hire being the name which is given to the price of their labour 
 true 
 then hirelings will help to make up our population 
 yes 
 and now adeimantus is our state matured and perfected 
 i think so 
 where then is justice and where is injustice and in what part of the state did they spring up 
 probably in the dealings of these citizens with one another cannot imagine that they are more likely to be found anywhere else 
 i dare say that you are right in your suggestion i said we had better think the matter out and not shrink from the enquiry 
 let us then consider first of all what will be their way of life now that we have thus established them will they not produce corn and wine and clothes and shoes and build houses for themselves and when they are housed they will work in summer commonly stripped and barefoot but in winter substantially clothed and shod they will feed on and flour of wheat baking and kneading them making noble cakes and loaves these they will serve up on a mat of reeds or on clean leaves themselves reclining the while upon beds strewn with yew or myrtle and they and their children will feast drinking of the wine which they have made wearing garlands on their heads and hymning the praises of the gods in happy converse with one another and they will take care that their families do not exceed their means having an eye to poverty or war 
 socrates glaucon 
 but said glaucon interposing you have not given them a relish to their meal 
 true i replied i had forgotten of course they must have a and olives and cheese and they will boil roots and herbs such as country people prepare for a dessert we shall give them figs and peas and beans and they will roast and acorns at the fire drinking in moderation and with such a diet they may be expected to live in peace and health to a good old age and bequeath a similar life to their children after them 
 yes socrates he said and if you were providing for a city of pigs how else would you feed the beasts 
 but what would you have glaucon i replied 
 why he said you should give them the ordinary conveniences of life people who are to be comfortable are accustomed to lie on sofas and dine off tables and they should have sauces and sweets in the modern style 
 yes i said now i understand the question which you would have me consider is not only how a state but how a luxurious state is created and possibly there is no harm in this for in such a state we shall be more likely to see how justice and injustice originate in my opinion the true and healthy constitution of the state is the one which i have described but if you wish also to see a state at fever heat i have no objection for i suspect that many will not be satisfied with the simpler way of way they will be for adding sofas and tables and other furniture also dainties and perfumes and incense and courtesans and cakes all these not of one sort only but in every variety we must go beyond the necessaries of which i was at first speaking such as houses and clothes and shoes the arts of the painter and the embroiderer will have to be set in motion and gold and ivory and all sorts of materials must be procured 
 true he said 
 then we must enlarge our borders for the original healthy state is no longer sufficient now will the city have to fill and swell with a multitude of callings which are not required by any natural want such as the whole tribe of hunters and actors of whom one large class have to do with forms and colours another will be the votaries of music poets and their attendant train of rhapsodists players dancers contractors also makers of divers kinds of articles including dresses and we shall want more servants will not tutors be also in request and nurses wet and dry tirewomen and barbers as well as confectioners and cooks and swineherds too who were not needed and therefore had no place in the former edition of our state but are needed now they must not be forgotten and there will be animals of many other kinds if people eat them 
 certainly 
 and living in this way we shall have much greater need of physicians than before 
 much greater 
 and the country which was enough to support the original inhabitants will be too small now and not enough 
 quite true 
 then a slice of our neighbours land will be wanted by us for pasture and tillage and they will want a slice of ours if like ourselves they exceed the limit of necessity and give themselves up to the unlimited accumulation of wealth 
 that socrates will be inevitable 
 and so we shall go to war glaucon shall we not 
 most certainly he replied 
 then without determining as yet whether war does good or harm thus much we may affirm that now we have discovered war to be derived from causes which are also the causes of almost all the evils in states private as well as public 
 undoubtedly 
 and our state must once more enlarge and this time the will be nothing short of a whole army which will have to go out and fight with the invaders for all that we have as well as for the things and persons whom we were describing above 
 why he said are they not capable of defending themselves 
 no i said not if we were right in the principle which was acknowledged by all of us when we were framing the state the principle as you will remember was that one man cannot practise many arts with success 
 very true he said 
 but is not war an art 
 certainly 
 and an art requiring as much attention as shoemaking 
 quite true 
 and the shoemaker was not allowed by us to be husbandman or a weaver a builder in order that we might have our shoes well made but to him and to every other worker was assigned one work for which he was by nature fitted and at that he was to continue working all his life long and at no other he was not to let opportunities slip and then he would become a good workman now nothing can be more important than that the work of a soldier should be well done but is war an art so easily acquired that a man may be a warrior who is also a husbandman or shoemaker or other artisan although no one in the world would be a good dice or draught player who merely took up the game as a recreation and had not from his earliest years devoted himself to this and nothing else 
 no tools will make a man a skilled workman or master of defence nor be of any use to him who has not learned how to handle them and has never bestowed any attention upon them how then will he who takes up a shield or other implement of war become a good fighter all in a day whether with or any other kind of troops 
 yes he said the tools which would teach men their own use would be beyond price 
 and the higher the duties of the guardian i said the more time and skill and art and application will be needed by him 
 no doubt he replied 
 will he not also require natural aptitude for his calling 
 certainly 
 then it will be our duty to select if we can natures which are fitted for the task of guarding the city 
 it will 
 and the selection will be no easy matter i said but we must be brave and do our best 
 we must 
 is not the noble youth very like a dog in respect of guarding and watching 
 what do you mean 
 i mean that both of them ought to be quick to see and swift to overtake the enemy when they see him and strong too if when they have caught him they have to fight with him 
 all these qualities he replied will certainly be required by them 
 well and your guardian must be brave if he is to fight well 
 certainly 
 and is he likely to be brave who has no spirit whether horse or dog or any other animal have you never observed how invincible and unconquerable is spirit and how the presence of it makes the soul of any creature to be absolutely fearless and indomitable 
 i have 
 then now we have a clear notion of the bodily qualities which are required in the guardian 
 true 
 and also of the mental ones his soul is to be full of spirit 
 yes 
 but are not these spirited natures apt to be savage with one another and with everybody else 
 a difficulty by no means easy to overcome he replied 
 whereas i said they ought to be dangerous to their enemies and gentle to their friends if not they will destroy themselves without waiting for their enemies to destroy them 
 true he said 
 what is to be done then i said how shall we find a gentle nature which has also a great spirit for the one is the contradiction of the other 
 true 
 he will not be a good guardian who is wanting in either of these two qualities and yet the combination of them appears to be impossible and hence we must infer that to be a good guardian is impossible 
 i am afraid that what you say is true he replied 
 here feeling perplexed i began to think over what had preceded my friend i said no wonder that we are in a perplexity for we have lost sight of the image which we had before us 
 what do you mean he said 
 i mean to say that there do exist natures gifted with those opposite qualities 
 and where do you find them 
 many animals i replied furnish examples of them our friend the dog is a very good one you know that dogs are perfectly gentle to their familiars and acquaintances and the reverse to strangers 
 yes i know 
 then there is nothing impossible or out of the order of nature in our finding a guardian who has a similar combination of qualities 
 certainly not 
 would not he who is fitted to be a guardian besides the spirited nature need to have the qualities of a philosopher 
 i do not apprehend your meaning 
 the trait of which i am speaking i replied may be also seen in the dog and is remarkable in the animal 
 what trait 
 why a dog whenever he sees a stranger is angry when an acquaintance he welcomes him although the one has never done him any harm nor the other any good did this never strike you as curious 
 the matter never struck me before but i quite recognise the truth of your remark 
 and surely this instinct of the dog is very charming your dog is a true philosopher 
 why 
 why because he distinguishes the face of a friend and of an enemy only by the criterion of knowing and not knowing and must not an animal be a lover of learning who determines what he likes and dislikes by the test of knowledge and ignorance 
 most assuredly 
 and is not the love of learning the love of wisdom which is philosophy 
 they are the same he replied 
 and may we not say confidently of man also that he who is likely to be gentle to his friends and acquaintances must by nature be a lover of wisdom and knowledge 
 that we may safely affirm 
 then he who is to be a really good and noble guardian of the state will require to unite in himself philosophy and spirit and swiftness and strength 
 undoubtedly 
 then we have found the desired natures and now that we have found them how are they to be reared and educated is not this enquiry which may be expected to throw light on the greater enquiry which is our final end how do justice and injustice grow up in states for we do not want either to omit what is to the point or to draw out the argument to an inconvenient length 
 socrates adeimantus 
 adeimantus thought that the enquiry would be of great service to us 
 then i said my dear friend the task must not be given up even if somewhat long 
 certainly not 
 come then and let us pass a leisure hour in and our story shall be the education of our heroes 
 by all means 
 and what shall be their education can we find a better than the traditional sort and this has two divisions gymnastic for the body and music for the soul 
 true 
 shall we begin education with music and go on to gymnastic afterwards 
 by all means 
 and when you speak of music do you include literature or not 
 i do 
 and literature may be either true or false 
 yes 
 and the young should be trained in both kinds and we begin with the false 
 i do not understand your meaning he said 
 you know i said that we begin by telling children stories which though not wholly destitute of truth are in the main fictitious and these stories are told them when they are not of an age to learn gymnastics 
 very true 
 that was my meaning when i said that we must teach music before gymnastics 
 quite right he said 
 you know also that the beginning is the most important part of any work especially in the case of a young and tender thing for that is the time at which the character is being formed and the desired impression is more readily taken 
 quite true 
 and shall we just carelessly allow children to hear any casual tales which may be devised by casual persons and to receive into their minds ideas for the most part the very opposite of those which we should wish them to have when they are grown up 
 we cannot 
 then the first thing will be to establish a censorship of the writers of fiction and let the censors receive any tale of fiction which is good and reject the bad and we will desire mothers and nurses to tell their children the authorised ones only let them fashion the mind with such tales even more fondly than they mould the body with their hands but most of those which are now in use must be discarded 
 of what tales are you speaking he said 
 you may find a model of the lesser in the greater i said for they are necessarily of the same type and there is the same spirit in both of them 
 very likely he replied but i do not as yet know what you would term the greater 
 those i said which are narrated by homer and hesiod and the rest of the poets who have ever been the great of mankind 
 but which stories do you mean he said and what fault do you find with them 
 a fault which is most serious i said the fault of telling a lie and what is more a bad lie 
 but when is this fault committed 
 whenever an erroneous representation is made of the nature of gods and heroes as when a painter paints a portrait not having the shadow of a likeness to the original 
 yes he said that sort of thing is certainly very blamable but what are the stories which you mean 
 first of all i said there was that greatest of all lies in high places which the poet told about uranus and which was a bad lie too i mean what hesiod says that uranus did and how cronus retaliated on him the doings of cronus and the sufferings which in turn his son inflicted upon him even if they were true ought certainly not to be lightly told to young and thoughtless persons if possible they had better be buried in silence but if there is an absolute necessity for their mention a chosen few might hear them in a mystery and they should sacrifice not a common eleusinian pig but some huge and unprocurable victim and then the number of the hearers will be very few indeed 
 why yes said he those stories are extremely objectionable 
 yes adeimantus they are stories not to be repeated in our state the young man should not be told that in committing the worst of crimes he is far from doing anything outrageous and that even if he chastises his father when does wrong in whatever manner he will only be following the example of the first and greatest among the gods 
 i entirely agree with you he said in my opinion those stories are quite unfit to be repeated 
 neither if we mean our future guardians to regard the habit of quarrelling among themselves as of all things the basest should any word be said to them of the wars in heaven and of the plots and fightings of the gods against one another for they are not true no we shall never mention the battles of the giants or let them be embroidered on garments and we shall be silent about the innumerable other quarrels of gods and heroes with their friends and relatives if they would only believe us we would tell them that quarrelling is unholy and that never up to this time has there been any quarrel between citizens this is what old men and old women should begin by telling children and when they grow up the poets also should be told to compose for them in a similar spirit but the narrative of hephaestus binding here his mother or how on another occasion zeus sent him flying for taking her part when she was being beaten and all the battles of the gods in homer these tales must not be admitted into our state whether they are supposed to have an allegorical meaning or not for a young person cannot judge what is allegorical and what is literal anything that he receives into his mind at that age is likely to become indelible and unalterable and therefore it is most important that the tales which the young first hear should be models of virtuous thoughts 
 there you are right he replied but if any one asks where are such models to be found and of what tales are you speaking how shall we answer him 
 i said to him you and i adeimantus at this moment are not poets but founders of a state now the founders of a state ought to know the general forms in which poets should cast their tales and the limits which must be observed by them but to make the tales is not their business 
 very true he said but what are these forms of theology which you mean 
 something of this kind i replied god is always to be represented as he truly is whatever be the sort of poetry epic lyric or tragic in which the representation is given 
 right 
 and is he not truly good and must he not be represented as such 
 certainly 
 and no good thing is hurtful 
 no indeed 
 and that which is not hurtful hurts not 
 certainly not 
 and that which hurts not does no evil 
 no 
 and can that which does no evil be a cause of evil 
 impossible 
 and the good is advantageous 
 yes 
 and therefore the cause of 
 yes 
 it follows therefore that the good is not the cause of all things but of the good only 
 assuredly 
 then god if he be good is not the author of all things as the many assert but he is the cause of a few things only and not of most things that occur to men for few are the goods of human life and many are the evils and the good is to be attributed to god alone of the evils the causes are to be sought elsewhere and not in him 
 that appears to me to be most true he said 
 then we must not listen to homer or to any other poet who is guilty of the folly of saying that two casks lie at the threshold of zeus full of lots one of good the other of evil lots and that he to whom zeus gives a mixture of the two sometimes meets with evil fortune at other times with good but that he to whom is given the cup of unmingled ill 
 him wild hunger drives the beauteous earth and again 
 zeus who is the dispenser of good and evil to us and if any one asserts that the violation of oaths and treaties which was really the work of pandarus was brought about by athene and zeus or that the strife and contention of the gods was instigated by themis and zeus he shall not have our approval neither will we allow our young men to hear the words of aeschylus that god plants guilt among men when he desires utterly to destroy a house and if a poet writes of the sufferings of niobe the subject of the tragedy in which these iambic verses occur or of the house of pelops or of the trojan war or on any similar theme either we must not permit him to say that these are the works of god or if they are of god he must devise some explanation of them such as we are seeking he must say that god did what was just and right and they were the better for being punished but that those who are punished are miserable and that god is the author of their misery the poet is not to be permitted to say though he may say that the wicked are miserable because they require to be punished and are benefited by receiving punishment from god but that god being good is the author of evil to any one is to be strenuously denied and not to be said or sung or heard in verse or prose by any one whether old or young in any commonwealth such a fiction is suicidal ruinous impious 
 i agree with you he replied and am ready to give my assent to the law 
 let this then be one of our rules and principles concerning the gods to which our poets and reciters will be expected to conform that god is not the author of all things but of good only 
 that will do he said 
 and what do you think of a second principle shall i ask you whether god is a magician and of a nature to appear insidiously now in one shape and now in another sometimes himself changing and passing into many forms sometimes deceiving us with the semblance of such transformations or is he one and the same immutably fixed in his own proper image 
 i cannot answer you he said without more thought 
 well i said but if we suppose a change in anything that change must be effected either by the thing itself or by some other thing 
 most certainly 
 and things which are at their best are also least liable to be altered or discomposed for example when healthiest and strongest the human frame is least liable to be affected by meats and drinks and the plant which is in the fullest vigour also suffers least from winds or the heat of the sun or any similar causes 
 of course 
 and will not the bravest and wisest soul be least confused or deranged by any external influence 
 true 
 and the same principle as i should suppose applies to all composite things furniture houses garments when good and well made they are least altered by time and circumstances 
 very true 
 then everything which is good whether made by art or nature or both is least liable to suffer change from without 
 true 
 but surely god and the things of god are in every way perfect 
 of course they are 
 then he can hardly be compelled by external influence to take many shapes 
 he cannot 
 but may he not change and transform himself 
 clearly he said that must be the case if he is changed at all 
 and will he then change himself for the better and fairer or for the worse and more unsightly 
 if he change at all he can only change for the worse for we cannot suppose him to be deficient either in virtue or beauty 
 very true adeimantus but then would any one whether god or man desire to make himself worse 
 impossible 
 then it is impossible that god should ever be willing to change being as is supposed the fairest and best that is conceivable every god remains absolutely and for ever in his own form 
 that necessarily follows he said in my judgment 
 then i said my dear friend let none of the poets tell us that 
 the gods taking the disguise of strangers from other lands walk up and down cities in all sorts of forms and let no one slander proteus and thetis neither let any one either in tragedy or in any other kind of poetry introduce here disguised in the likeness of a priestess asking an alms 
 for the daughters of inachus the river of argos let us have no more lies of that sort neither must we have mothers under the influence of the poets scaring their children with a bad version of these myths telling how certain gods as they say go about by night in the likeness of so many strangers and in divers forms but let them take heed lest they make cowards of their children and at the same time speak blasphemy against the gods 
 heaven forbid he said 
 but although the gods are themselves unchangeable still by witchcraft and deception they may make us think that they appear in various forms 
 perhaps he replied 
 well but can you imagine that god will be willing to lie whether in word or deed or to put forth a phantom of himself 
 i cannot say he replied 
 do you not know i said that the true lie if such an expression may be allowed is hated of gods and men 
 what do you mean he said 
 i mean that no one is willingly deceived in that which is the truest and highest part of himself or about the truest and highest matters there above all he is most afraid of a lie having possession of him 
 still he said i do not comprehend you 
 the reason is i replied that you attribute some profound meaning to my words but i am only saying that deception or being deceived or uninformed about the highest realities in the highest part of themselves which is the soul and in that part of them to have and to hold the lie is what mankind least like that i say is what they utterly detest 
 there is nothing more hateful to them 
 and as i was just now remarking this ignorance in the soul of him who is deceived may be called the true lie for the lie in words is only a kind of imitation and shadowy image of a previous affection of the soul not pure unadulterated falsehood am i not right 
 perfectly right 
 the true lie is hated not only by the gods but also by men 
 yes 
 whereas the lie in words is in certain cases useful and not hateful in dealing with enemies that would be an instance or again when those whom we call our friends in a fit of madness or illusion are going to do some harm then it is useful and is a sort of medicine or preventive also in the tales of mythology of which we were just now speaking because we do not know the truth about ancient times we make falsehood as much like truth as we can and so turn it to account 
 very true he said 
 but can any of these reasons apply to god can we suppose that he is ignorant of antiquity and therefore has recourse to invention 
 that would be ridiculous he said 
 then the lying poet has no place in our idea of god 
 i should say not 
 or perhaps he may tell a lie because he is afraid of enemies 
 that is inconceivable 
 but he may have friends who are senseless or mad 
 but no mad or senseless person can be a friend of god 
 then no motive can be imagined why god should lie 
 none whatever 
 then the superhuman and divine is absolutely incapable of falsehood 
 yes 
 then is god perfectly simple and true both in word and deed he changes not he deceives not either by sign or word by dream or waking vision 
 your thoughts he said are the reflection of my own 
 you agree with me then i said that this is the second type or form in which we should write and speak about divine things the gods are not magicians who transform themselves neither do they deceive mankind in any way 
 i grant that 
 then although we are admirers of homer we do not admire the lying dream which zeus sends to agamemnon neither will we praise the verses of aeschylus in which thetis says that apollo at her nuptials 
 was celebrating in song her fair progeny whose days were to he long and to know no sickness and when he had spoken of my lot as in all things blessed of heaven he raised a note of triumph and cheered my soul and i thought that the word of phoebus being divine and full of prophecy would not fail and now he himself who uttered the strain he who was present at the banquet and who said this he it is who has slain my son 
 these are the kind of sentiments about the gods which will arouse our anger and he who utters them shall be refused a chorus neither shall we allow teachers to make use of them in the instruction of the young meaning as we do that our guardians as far as men can be should be true worshippers of the gods and like them 
 i entirely agree be said in these principles and promise to make them my laws

 book ii 
 
 socrates glaucon 
 with these words i was thinking that i had made an end of the discussion but the end in truth proved to be only a beginning for glaucon who is always the most pugnacious of men was dissatisfied at thrasymachus retirement he wanted to have the battle out so he said to me socrates do you wish really to persuade us or only to seem to have persuaded us that to be just is always better than to be unjust 
 i should wish really to persuade you i replied if i could 
 then you certainly have not succeeded let me ask you now how would you arrange goods are there not some which we welcome for their own sakes and independently of their consequences as for example harmless pleasures and enjoyments which delight us at the time although nothing follows from them 
 i agree in thinking that there is such a class i replied 
 is there not also a second class of goods such as knowledge sight health which are desirable not only in themselves but also for their results 
 certainly i said 
 and would you not recognize a third class such as gymnastic and the care of the sick and the art also the various ways of these do us good but we regard them as disagreeable and no one would choose them for their own sakes but only for the sake of some reward or result which flows from them 
 there is i said this third class also but why do you ask 
 because i want to know in which of the three classes you would place justice 
 in the highest class i replied among those goods which he who would be happy desires both for their own sake and for the sake of their results 
 then the many are of another mind they think that justice is to be reckoned in the troublesome class among goods which are to be pursued for the sake of rewards and of reputation but in themselves are disagreeable and rather to be avoided 
 i know i said that this is their manner of thinking and that this was the thesis which thrasymachus was maintaining just now when he censured justice and praised injustice but i am too stupid to be convinced by him 
 i wish he said that you would hear me as well as him and then i shall see whether you and i agree for thrasymachus seems to me like a snake to have been charmed by your voice sooner than he ought to have been but to my mind the nature of justice and injustice have not yet been made clear setting aside their rewards and results i want to know what they are in themselves and how they inwardly work in the soul if you please then i will revive the argument of thrasymachus and first i will speak of the nature and origin of justice according to the common view of them secondly i will show that all men who practise justice do so against their will of necessity but not as a good and thirdly i will argue that there is reason in this view for the life of the unjust is after all better far than the life of the just if what they say is true socrates since i myself am not of their opinion but still i acknowledge that i am perplexed when i hear the voices of thrasymachus and myriads of others dinning in my ears and on the other hand i have never yet heard the superiority of justice to injustice maintained by any one in a satisfactory way i want to hear justice praised in respect of itself then i shall be satisfied and you are the person from whom i think that i am most likely to hear this and therefore i will praise the unjust life to the utmost of my power and my manner of speaking will indicate the manner in which i desire to hear you too praising justice and censuring injustice will you say whether you approve of my proposal 
 indeed i do nor can i imagine any theme about which a man of sense would oftener wish to converse 
 i am delighted he replied to hear you say so and shall begin by speaking as i proposed of the nature and origin of justice 
 glaucon 
 they say that to do injustice is by nature good to suffer injustice evil but that the evil is greater than the good and so when men have both done and suffered injustice and have had experience of both not being able to avoid the one and obtain the other they think that they had better agree among themselves to have neither hence there arise laws and mutual covenants and that which is ordained by law is termed by them lawful and just this they affirm to be the origin and nature of justice it is a mean or compromise between the best of all which is to do injustice and not be punished and the worst of all which is to suffer injustice without the power of retaliation and justice being at a middle point between the two is tolerated not as a good but as the lesser evil and honoured by reason of the inability of men to do injustice for no man who is worthy to be called a man would ever submit to such an agreement if he were able to resist he would be mad if he did such is the received account socrates of the nature and origin of justice 
 now that those who practise justice do so involuntarily and because they have not the power to be unjust will best appear if we imagine something of this kind having given both to the just and the unjust power to do what they will let us watch and see whither desire will lead them then we shall discover in the very act the just and unjust man to be proceeding along the same road following their interest which all natures deem to be their good and are only diverted into the path of justice by the force of law the liberty which we are supposing may be most completely given to them in the form of such a power as is said to have been possessed by gyges the ancestor of croesus the lydian according to the tradition gyges was a shepherd in the service of the king of lydia there was a great storm and an earthquake made an opening in the earth at the place where he was feeding his flock amazed at the sight he descended into the opening where among other marvels he beheld a hollow brazen horse having doors at which he stooping and looking in saw a dead body of stature as appeared to him more than human and having nothing on but a gold ring this he took from the finger of the dead and reascended now the shepherds met together according to custom that they might send their monthly report about the flocks to the king into their assembly he came having the ring on his finger and as he was sitting among them he chanced to turn the collet of the ring inside his hand when instantly he became invisible to the rest of the company and they began to speak of him as if he were no longer present he was astonished at this and again touching the ring he turned the collet outwards and reappeared he made several trials of the ring and always with the same he turned the collet inwards he became invisible when outwards he reappeared whereupon he contrived to be chosen one of the messengers who were sent to the court where as soon as he arrived he seduced the queen and with her help conspired against the king and slew him and took the kingdom suppose now that there were two such magic rings and the just put on one of them and the unjust the man can be imagined to be of such an iron nature that he would stand fast in justice no man would keep his hands off what was not his own when he could safely take what he liked out of the market or go into houses and lie with any one at his pleasure or kill or release from prison whom he would and in all respects be like a god among men then the actions of the just would be as the actions of the unjust they would both come at last to the same point and this we may truly affirm to be a great proof that a man is just not willingly or because he thinks that justice is any good to him individually but of necessity for wherever any one thinks that he can safely be unjust there he is unjust for all men believe in their hearts that injustice is far more profitable to the individual than justice and he who argues as i have been supposing will say that they are right if you could imagine any one obtaining this power of becoming invisible and never doing any wrong or touching what was he would be thought by the to be a most wretched idiot although they would praise him to one faces and keep up appearances with one another from a fear that they too might suffer injustice enough of this 
 now if we are to form a real judgment of the life of the just and unjust we must isolate them there is no other way and how is the isolation to be effected i answer let the unjust man be entirely unjust and the just man entirely just nothing is to be taken away from either of them and both are to be perfectly furnished for the work of their respective lives first let the unjust be like other distinguished masters of craft like the skilful pilot or physician who knows intuitively his own powers and keeps within their limits and who if he fails at any point is able to recover himself so let the unjust make his unjust attempts in the right way and lie hidden if he means to be great in his injustice he who is found out is nobody for the highest reach of injustice is to be deemed just when you are not therefore i say that in the perfectly unjust man we must assume the most perfect injustice there is to be no deduction but we must allow him while doing the most unjust acts to have acquired the greatest reputation for justice if he have taken a false step he must be able to recover himself he must be one who can speak with effect if any of his deeds come to light and who can force his way where force is required his courage and strength and command of money and friends and at his side let us place the just man in his nobleness and simplicity wishing as aeschylus says to be and not to seem good there must be no seeming for if he seem to be just he will be honoured and rewarded and then we shall not know whether he is just for the sake of justice or for the sake of honours and rewards therefore let him be clothed in justice only and have no other covering and he must be imagined in a state of life the opposite of the former let him be the best of men and let him be thought the worst then he will have been put to the proof and we shall see whether he will be affected by the fear of infamy and its consequences and let him continue thus to the hour of death being just and seeming to be unjust when both have reached the uttermost extreme the one of justice and the other of injustice let judgment be given which of them is the happier of the two 
 socrates glaucon 
 heavens my dear glaucon i said how energetically you polish them up for the decision first one and then the other as if they were two statues 
 i do my best he said and now that we know what they are like there is no difficulty in tracing out the sort of life which awaits either of them this i will proceed to describe but as you may think the description a little too coarse i ask you to suppose socrates that the words which follow are not mine let me put them into the mouths of the eulogists of injustice they will tell you that the just man who is thought unjust will be scourged racked bound will have his eyes burnt out and at last after suffering every kind of evil he will be impaled then he will understand that he ought to seem only and not to be just the words of aeschylus may be more truly spoken of the unjust than of the just for the unjust is pursuing a reality he does not live with a view to appearances he wants to be really unjust and not to seem only 
 his mind has a soil deep and fertile 
 out of which spring his prudent counsels in the first place he is thought just and therefore bears rule in the city he can marry whom he will and give in marriage to whom he will also he can trade and deal where he likes and always to his own advantage because he has no misgivings about injustice and at every contest whether in public or private he gets the better of his antagonists and gains at their expense and is rich and out of his gains he can benefit his friends and harm his enemies moreover he can offer sacrifices and dedicate gifts to the gods abundantly and magnificently and can honour the gods or any man whom he wants to honour in a far better style than the just and therefore he is likely to be dearer than they are to the gods and thus socrates gods and men are said to unite in making the life of the unjust better than the life of the just 
 adeimantus socrates 
 i was going to say something in answer to glaucon when adeimantus his brother interposed socrates he said you do not suppose that there is nothing more to be urged 
 why what else is there i answered 
 the strongest point of all has not been even mentioned he replied 
 well then according to the proverb let brother help brother if he fails in any part do you assist him although i must confess that glaucon has already said quite enough to lay me in the dust and take from me the power of helping justice 
 adeimantus 
 nonsense he replied but let me add something more there is another side to argument about the praise and censure of justice and injustice which is equally required in order to bring out what i believe to be his meaning parents and tutors are always telling their sons and their wards that they are to be just but why not for the sake of justice but for the sake of character and reputation in the hope of obtaining for him who is reputed just some of those offices marriages and the like which glaucon has enumerated among the advantages accruing to the unjust from the reputation of justice more however is made of appearances by this class of persons than by the others for they throw in the good opinion of the gods and will tell you of a shower of benefits which the heavens as they say rain upon the pious and this accords with the testimony of the noble hesiod and homer the first of whom says that the gods make the oaks of the just 
 to hear acorns at their summit and bees i the middle 
 and the sheep the bowed down bowed the with the their fleeces and many other blessings of a like kind are provided for them and homer has a very similar strain for he speaks of one whose fame is 
 as the fame of some blameless king who like a god 
 maintains justice to whom the black earth brings forth 
 wheat and barley whose trees are bowed with fruit 
 and his sheep never fail to bear and the sea gives him fish still grander are the gifts of heaven which musaeus and his son vouchsafe to the just they take them down into the world below where they have the saints lying on couches at a feast everlastingly drunk crowned with garlands their idea seems to be that an immortality of drunkenness is the highest meed of virtue some extend their rewards yet further the posterity as they say of the faithful and just shall survive to the third and fourth generation this is the style in which they praise justice but about the wicked there is another strain they bury them in a slough in hades and make them carry water in a sieve also while they are yet living they bring them to infamy and inflict upon them the punishments which glaucon described as the portion of the just who are reputed to be unjust nothing else does their invention supply such is their manner of praising the one and censuring the other 
 once more socrates i will ask you to consider another way of speaking about justice and injustice which is not confined to the poets but is found in prose writers the universal voice of mankind is always declaring that justice and virtue are honourable but grievous and toilsome and that the pleasures of vice and injustice are easy of attainment and are only censured by law and opinion they say also that honesty is for the most part less profitable than dishonesty and they are quite ready to call wicked men happy and to honour them both in public and private when they are rich or in any other way influential while they despise and overlook those who may be weak and poor even though acknowledging them to be better than the others but most extraordinary of all is their mode of speaking about virtue and the gods they say that the gods apportion calamity and misery to many good men and good and happiness to the wicked and mendicant prophets go to rich doors and persuade them that they have a power committed to them by the gods of making an atonement for a own or his sins by sacrifices or charms with rejoicings and feasts and they promise to harm an enemy whether just or unjust at a small cost with magic arts and incantations binding heaven as they say to execute their will and the poets are the authorities to whom they appeal now smoothing the path of vice with the words of hesiod 
 vice may be had in abundance without trouble the way is smooth and her is near but before virtue the gods have set toil and a tedious and uphill road then citing homer as a witness that the gods may be influenced by men for he also says 
 the gods too may he turned from their purpose and men pray to them and avert their wrath by sacrifices and soothing entreaties and by libations and the odour of fat when they have sinned and transgressed and they produce a host of books written by musaeus and orpheus who were children of the moon and the muses that is what they say according to which they perform their ritual and persuade not only individuals but whole cities that expiations and atonements for sin may be made by sacrifices and amusements which fill a vacant hour and are equally at the service of the living and the dead the latter sort they call mysteries and they redeem us from the pains of hell but if we neglect them no one knows what awaits us 
 he proceeded and now when the young hear all this said about virtue and vice and the way in which gods and men regard them how are their minds likely to be affected my dear socrates those of them i mean who are quickwitted and like bees on the wing light on every flower and from all that they hear are prone to draw conclusions as to what manner of persons they should be and in what way they should walk if they would make the best of life probably the youth will say to himself in the words of pindar 
 can i by justice or by crooked ways of deceit ascend a loftier tower which may he a fortress to me all my days for what men say is that if i am really just and am not also thought just profit there is none but the pain and loss on the other hand are unmistakable but if though unjust i acquire the reputation of justice a heavenly life is promised to me since then as philosophers prove appearance tyrannizes over truth and is lord of happiness to appearance i must devote myself i will describe around me a picture and shadow of virtue to be the vestibule and exterior of my house behind i will trail the subtle and crafty fox as archilochus greatest of sages recommends but i hear some one exclaiming that the concealment of wickedness is often difficult to which i answer nothing great is easy nevertheless the argument indicates this if we would be happy to be the path along which we should proceed with a view to concealment we will establish secret brotherhoods and political clubs and there are professors of rhetoric who teach the art of persuading courts and assemblies and so partly by persuasion and partly by force i shall make unlawful gains and not be punished still i hear a voice saying that the gods cannot be deceived neither can they be compelled but what if there are no gods or suppose them to have no care of human things why in either case should we mind about concealment and even if there are gods and they do care about us yet we know of them only from tradition and the genealogies of the poets and these are the very persons who say that they may be influenced and turned by sacrifices and soothing entreaties and by offerings let us be consistent then and believe both or neither if the poets speak truly why then we had better be unjust and offer of the fruits of injustice for if we are just although we may escape the vengeance of heaven we shall lose the gains of injustice but if we are unjust we shall keep the gains and by our sinning and praying and praying and sinning the gods will be propitiated and we shall not be punished but there is a world below in which either we or our posterity will suffer for our unjust deeds yes my friend will be the reflection but there are mysteries and atoning deities and these have great power that is what mighty cities declare and the children of the gods who were their poets and prophets bear a like testimony 
 on what principle then shall we any longer choose justice rather than the worst injustice when if we only unite the latter with a deceitful regard to appearances we shall fare to our mind both with gods and men in life and after death as the most numerous and the highest authorities tell us knowing all this socrates how can a man who has any superiority of mind or person or rank or wealth be willing to honour justice or indeed to refrain from laughing when he hears justice praised and even if there should be some one who is able to disprove the truth of my words and who is satisfied that justice is best still he is not angry with the unjust but is very ready to forgive them because he also knows that men are not just of their own free will unless peradventure there be some one whom the divinity within him may have inspired with a hatred of injustice or who has attained knowledge of the truth but no other man he only blames injustice who owing to cowardice or age or some weakness has not the power of being unjust and this is proved by the fact that when he obtains the power he immediately becomes unjust as far as he can be 
 the cause of all this socrates was indicated by us at the beginning of the argument when my brother and i told you how astonished we were to find that of all the professing panegyrists of justice beginning with the ancient heroes of whom any memorial has been preserved to us and ending with the men of our own time no one has ever blamed injustice or praised justice except with a view to the glories honours and benefits which flow from them no one has ever adequately described either in verse or prose the true essential nature of either of them abiding in the soul and invisible to any human or divine eye or shown that of all the things of a soul which he has within him justice is the greatest good and injustice the greatest evil had this been the universal strain had you sought to persuade us of this from our youth upwards we should not have been on the watch to keep one another from doing wrong but every one would have been his own watchman because afraid if he did wrong of harbouring in himself the greatest of evils i dare say that thrasymachus and others would seriously hold the language which i have been merely repeating and words even stronger than these about justice and injustice grossly as i conceive perverting their true nature but i speak in this vehement manner as i must frankly confess to you because i want to hear from you the opposite side and i would ask you to show not only the superiority which justice has over injustice but what effect they have on the possessor of them which makes the one to be a good and the other an evil to him and please as glaucon requested of you to exclude reputations for unless you take away from each of them his true reputation and add on the false we shall say that you do not praise justice but the appearance of it we shall think that you are only exhorting us to keep injustice dark and that you really agree with thrasymachus in thinking that justice is good and the interest of the stronger and that injustice is a own profit and interest though injurious to the weaker now as you have admitted that justice is one of that highest class of goods which are desired indeed for their results but in a far greater degree for their own sakes like sight or hearing or knowledge or health or any other real and natural and not merely conventional good i would ask you in your praise of justice to regard one point only i mean the essential good and evil which justice and injustice work in the possessors of them let others praise justice and censure injustice magnifying the rewards and honours of the one and abusing the other that is a manner of arguing which coming from them i am ready to tolerate but from you who have spent your whole life in the consideration of this question unless i hear the contrary from your own lips i expect something better and therefore i say not only prove to us that justice is better than injustice but show what they either of them do to the possessor of them which makes the one to be a good and the other an evil whether seen or unseen by gods and men

 i had always admired the genius of glaucon and adeimantus but on hearing these words i was quite delighted and said sons of an illustrious father that was not a bad beginning of the elegiac verses which the admirer of glaucon made in honour of you after you had distinguished yourselves at the battle of megara 
 sons of ariston he sang divine offspring of an illustrious hero the epithet is very appropriate for there is something truly divine in being able to argue as you have done for the superiority of injustice and remaining unconvinced by your own arguments and i do believe that you are not convinced this i infer from your general character for had i judged only from your speeches i should have mistrusted you but now the greater my confidence in you the greater is my difficulty in knowing what to say for i am in a strait between two on the one hand i feel that i am unequal to the task and my inability is brought home to me by the fact that you were not satisfied with the answer which i made to thrasymachus proving as i thought the superiority which justice has over injustice and yet i cannot refuse to help while breath and speech remain to me i am afraid that there would be an impiety in being present when justice is evil spoken of and not lifting up a hand in her defence and therefore i had best give such help as i can 
 glaucon and the rest entreated me by all means not to let the question drop but to proceed in the investigation they wanted to arrive at the truth first about the nature of justice and injustice and secondly about their relative advantages i told them what i really thought that the enquiry would be of a serious nature and would require very good eyes seeing then i said that we are no great wits i think that we had better adopt a method which i may illustrate thus suppose that a person had been asked by some one to read small letters from a distance and it occurred to some one else that they might be found in another place which was larger and in which the letters were larger if they were the same and he could read the larger letters first and then proceed to the lesser this would have been thought a rare piece of good fortune 
 very true said adeimantus but how does the illustration apply to our enquiry 
 i will tell you i replied justice which is the subject of our enquiry is as you know sometimes spoken of as the virtue of an individual and sometimes as the virtue of a state 
 true he replied 
 and is not a state larger than an individual 
 it is 
 then in the larger the quantity of justice is likely to be larger and more easily discernible i propose therefore that we enquire into the nature of justice and injustice first as they appear in the state and secondly in the individual proceeding from the greater to the lesser and comparing them 
 that he said is an excellent proposal 
 and if we imagine the state in process of creation we shall see the justice and injustice of the state in process of creation also 
 i dare say 
 when the state is completed there may be a hope that the object of our search will be more easily discovered 
 yes far more easily 
 but ought we to attempt to construct one i said for to do so as i am inclined to think will be a very serious task reflect therefore 
 i have reflected said adeimantus and am anxious that you should proceed 
 a state i said arises as i conceive out of the needs of mankind no one is but all of us have many wants can any other origin of a state be imagined 
 there can i be no other 
 then as we have many wants and many persons are needed to supply them one takes a helper for one purpose and another for another and when these partners and helpers are gathered together in one habitation the body of inhabitants is termed a state 
 true he said 
 and they exchange with one another and one gives and another receives under the idea that the exchange will be for their good 
 very true 
 then i said let us begin and create in idea a state and yet the true creator is necessity who is the mother of our invention 
 of course he replied 
 now the first and greatest of necessities is food which is the condition of life and existence 
 certainly 
 the second is a dwelling and the third clothing and the like 
 true 
 and now let us see how our city will be able to supply this great demand we may suppose that one man is a husbandman another a builder some one else a weaver shall we add to them a shoemaker or perhaps some other purveyor to our bodily wants 
 quite right 
 the barest notion of a state must include four or five men 
 clearly 
 and how will they proceed will each bring the result of his labours into a common stock the individual husbandman for example producing for four and labouring four times as long and as much as he need in the provision of food with which he supplies others as well as himself or will he have nothing to do with others and not be at the trouble of producing for them but provide for himself alone a fourth of the food in a fourth of the time and in the remaining of his time be employed in making a house or a coat or a pair of shoes having no partnership with others but supplying himself all his own wants 
 adeimantus thought that he should aim at producing food only and not at producing everything 
 probably i replied that would be the better way and when i hear you say this i am myself reminded that we are not all alike there are diversities of natures among us which are adapted to different occupations 
 very true 
 and will you have a work better done when the workman has many occupations or when he has only one 
 when he has only one 
 further there can be no doubt that a work is spoilt when not done at the right time 
 no doubt 
 for business is not disposed to wait until the doer of the business is at leisure but the doer must follow up what he is doing and make the business his first object 
 he must 
 and if so we must infer that all things are produced more plentifully and easily and of a better quality when one man does one thing which is natural to him and does it at the right time and leaves other things 
 undoubtedly 
 then more than four citizens will be required for the husbandman will not make his own plough or mattock or other implements of agriculture if they are to be good for anything neither will the builder make his tools and he too needs many and in like manner the weaver and shoemaker 
 true 
 then carpenters and smiths and many other artisans will be sharers in our little state which is already beginning to grow 
 true 
 yet even if we add neatherds shepherds and other herdsmen in order that our husbandmen may have oxen to plough with and builders as well as husbandmen may have draught cattle and curriers and weavers fleeces and hides still our state will not be very large 
 that is true yet neither will it be a very small state which contains all these 
 then again there is the situation of the city to find a place where nothing need be imported is impossible 
 impossible 
 then there must be another class of citizens who will bring the required supply from another city 
 there must 
 but if the trader goes having nothing which they require who would supply his need he will come back 
 that is certain 
 and therefore what they produce at home must be not only enough for themselves but such both in quantity and quality as to accommodate those from whom their wants are supplied 
 very true 
 then more husbandmen and more artisans will be required 
 they will 
 not to mention the importers and exporters who are called merchants 
 yes 
 then we shall want merchants 
 we shall 
 and if merchandise is to be carried over the sea skilful sailors will also be needed and in considerable numbers 
 yes in considerable numbers 
 then again within the city how will they exchange their productions to secure such an exchange was as you will remember one of our principal objects when we formed them into a society and constituted a state 
 clearly they will buy and sell 
 then they will need a and a for purposes of exchange 
 certainly 
 suppose now that a husbandman or an artisan brings some production to market and he comes at a time when there is no one to exchange with him is he to leave his calling and sit idle in the 
 not at all he will find people there who seeing the want undertake the office of salesmen in states they are commonly those who are the weakest in bodily strength and therefore of little use for any other purpose their duty is to be in the market and to give money in exchange for goods to those who desire to sell and to take money from those who desire to buy 
 this want then creates a class of in our state is not retailer the term which is applied to those who sit in the engaged in buying and selling while those who wander from one city to another are called merchants 
 yes he said 
 and there is another class of servants who are intellectually hardly on the level of companionship still they have plenty of bodily strength for labour which accordingly they sell and are called if i do not mistake hirelings hire being the name which is given to the price of their labour 
 true 
 then hirelings will help to make up our population 
 yes 
 and now adeimantus is our state matured and perfected 
 i think so 
 where then is justice and where is injustice and in what part of the state did they spring up 
 probably in the dealings of these citizens with one another cannot imagine that they are more likely to be found anywhere else 
 i dare say that you are right in your suggestion i said we had better think the matter out and not shrink from the enquiry 
 let us then consider first of all what will be their way of life now that we have thus established them will they not produce corn and wine and clothes and shoes and build houses for themselves and when they are housed they will work in summer commonly stripped and barefoot but in winter substantially clothed and shod they will feed on and flour of wheat baking and kneading them making noble cakes and loaves these they will serve up on a mat of reeds or on clean leaves themselves reclining the while upon beds strewn with yew or myrtle and they and their children will feast drinking of the wine which they have made wearing garlands on their heads and hymning the praises of the gods in happy converse with one another and they will take care that their families do not exceed their means having an eye to poverty or war 
 socrates glaucon 
 but said glaucon interposing you have not given them a relish to their meal 
 true i replied i had forgotten of course they must have a and olives and cheese and they will boil roots and herbs such as country people prepare for a dessert we shall give them figs and peas and beans and they will roast and acorns at the fire drinking in moderation and with such a diet they may be expected to live in peace and health to a good old age and bequeath a similar life to their children after them 
 yes socrates he said and if you were providing for a city of pigs how else would you feed the beasts 
 but what would you have glaucon i replied 
 why he said you should give them the ordinary conveniences of life people who are to be comfortable are accustomed to lie on sofas and dine off tables and they should have sauces and sweets in the modern style 
 yes i said now i understand the question which you would have me consider is not only how a state but how a luxurious state is created and possibly there is no harm in this for in such a state we shall be more likely to see how justice and injustice originate in my opinion the true and healthy constitution of the state is the one which i have described but if you wish also to see a state at fever heat i have no objection for i suspect that many will not be satisfied with the simpler way of way they will be for adding sofas and tables and other furniture also dainties and perfumes and incense and courtesans and cakes all these not of one sort only but in every variety we must go beyond the necessaries of which i was at first speaking such as houses and clothes and shoes the arts of the painter and the embroiderer will have to be set in motion and gold and ivory and all sorts of materials must be procured 
 true he said 
 then we must enlarge our borders for the original healthy state is no longer sufficient now will the city have to fill and swell with a multitude of callings which are not required by any natural want such as the whole tribe of hunters and actors of whom one large class have to do with forms and colours another will be the votaries of music poets and their attendant train of rhapsodists players dancers contractors also makers of divers kinds of articles including dresses and we shall want more servants will not tutors be also in request and nurses wet and dry tirewomen and barbers as well as confectioners and cooks and swineherds too who were not needed and therefore had no place in the former edition of our state but are needed now they must not be forgotten and there will be animals of many other kinds if people eat them 
 certainly 
 and living in this way we shall have much greater need of physicians than before 
 much greater 
 and the country which was enough to support the original inhabitants will be too small now and not enough 
 quite true 
 then a slice of our neighbours land will be wanted by us for pasture and tillage and they will want a slice of ours if like ourselves they exceed the limit of necessity and give themselves up to the unlimited accumulation of wealth 
 that socrates will be inevitable 
 and so we shall go to war glaucon shall we not 
 most certainly he replied 
 then without determining as yet whether war does good or harm thus much we may affirm that now we have discovered war to be derived from causes which are also the causes of almost all the evils in states private as well as public 
 undoubtedly 
 and our state must once more enlarge and this time the will be nothing short of a whole army which will have to go out and fight with the invaders for all that we have as well as for the things and persons whom we were describing above 
 why he said are they not capable of defending themselves 
 no i said not if we were right in the principle which was acknowledged by all of us when we were framing the state the principle as you will remember was that one man cannot practise many arts with success 
 very true he said 
 but is not war an art 
 certainly 
 and an art requiring as much attention as shoemaking 
 quite true 
 and the shoemaker was not allowed by us to be husbandman or a weaver a builder in order that we might have our shoes well made but to him and to every other worker was assigned one work for which he was by nature fitted and at that he was to continue working all his life long and at no other he was not to let opportunities slip and then he would become a good workman now nothing can be more important than that the work of a soldier should be well done but is war an art so easily acquired that a man may be a warrior who is also a husbandman or shoemaker or other artisan although no one in the world would be a good dice or draught player who merely took up the game as a recreation and had not from his earliest years devoted himself to this and nothing else 
 no tools will make a man a skilled workman or master of defence nor be of any use to him who has not learned how to handle them and has never bestowed any attention upon them how then will he who takes up a shield or other implement of war become a good fighter all in a day whether with or any other kind of troops 
 yes he said the tools which would teach men their own use would be beyond price 
 and the higher the duties of the guardian i said the more time and skill and art and application will be needed by him 
 no doubt he replied 
 will he not also require natural aptitude for his calling 
 certainly 
 then it will be our duty to select if we can natures which are fitted for the task of guarding the city 
 it will 
 and the selection will be no easy matter i said but we must be brave and do our best 
 we must 
 is not the noble youth very like a dog in respect of guarding and watching 
 what do you mean 
 i mean that both of them ought to be quick to see and swift to overtake the enemy when they see him and strong too if when they have caught him they have to fight with him 
 all these qualities he replied will certainly be required by them 
 well and your guardian must be brave if he is to fight well 
 certainly 
 and is he likely to be brave who has no spirit whether horse or dog or any other animal have you never observed how invincible and unconquerable is spirit and how the presence of it makes the soul of any creature to be absolutely fearless and indomitable 
 i have 
 then now we have a clear notion of the bodily qualities which are required in the guardian 
 true 
 and also of the mental ones his soul is to be full of spirit 
 yes 
 but are not these spirited natures apt to be savage with one another and with everybody else 
 a difficulty by no means easy to overcome he replied 
 whereas i said they ought to be dangerous to their enemies and gentle to their friends if not they will destroy themselves without waiting for their enemies to destroy them 
 true he said 
 what is to be done then i said how shall we find a gentle nature which has also a great spirit for the one is the contradiction of the other 
 true 
 he will not be a good guardian who is wanting in either of these two qualities and yet the combination of them appears to be impossible and hence we must infer that to be a good guardian is impossible 
 i am afraid that what you say is true he replied 
 here feeling perplexed i began to think over what had preceded my friend i said no wonder that we are in a perplexity for we have lost sight of the image which we had before us 
 what do you mean he said 
 i mean to say that there do exist natures gifted with those opposite qualities 
 and where do you find them 
 many animals i replied furnish examples of them our friend the dog is a very good one you know that dogs are perfectly gentle to their familiars and acquaintances and the reverse to strangers 
 yes i know 
 then there is nothing impossible or out of the order of nature in our finding a guardian who has a similar combination of qualities 
 certainly not 
 would not he who is fitted to be a guardian besides the spirited nature need to have the qualities of a philosopher 
 i do not apprehend your meaning 
 the trait of which i am speaking i replied may be also seen in the dog and is remarkable in the animal 
 what trait 
 why a dog whenever he sees a stranger is angry when an acquaintance he welcomes him although the one has never done him any harm nor the other any good did this never strike you as curious 
 the matter never struck me before but i quite recognise the truth of your remark 
 and surely this instinct of the dog is very charming your dog is a true philosopher 
 why 
 why because he distinguishes the face of a friend and of an enemy only by the criterion of knowing and not knowing and must not an animal be a lover of learning who determines what he likes and dislikes by the test of knowledge and ignorance 
 most assuredly 
 and is not the love of learning the love of wisdom which is philosophy 
 they are the same he replied 
 and may we not say confidently of man also that he who is likely to be gentle to his friends and acquaintances must by nature be a lover of wisdom and knowledge 
 that we may safely affirm 
 then he who is to be a really good and noble guardian of the state will require to unite in himself philosophy and spirit and swiftness and strength 
 undoubtedly 
 then we have found the desired natures and now that we have found them how are they to be reared and educated is not this enquiry which may be expected to throw light on the greater enquiry which is our final end how do justice and injustice grow up in states for we do not want either to omit what is to the point or to draw out the argument to an inconvenient length 
 socrates adeimantus 
 adeimantus thought that the enquiry would be of great service to us 
 then i said my dear friend the task must not be given up even if somewhat long 
 certainly not 
 come then and let us pass a leisure hour in and our story shall be the education of our heroes 
 by all means 
 and what shall be their education can we find a better than the traditional sort and this has two divisions gymnastic for the body and music for the soul 
 true 
 shall we begin education with music and go on to gymnastic afterwards 
 by all means 
 and when you speak of music do you include literature or not 
 i do 
 and literature may be either true or false 
 yes 
 and the young should be trained in both kinds and we begin with the false 
 i do not understand your meaning he said 
 you know i said that we begin by telling children stories which though not wholly destitute of truth are in the main fictitious and these stories are told them when they are not of an age to learn gymnastics 
 very true 
 that was my meaning when i said that we must teach music before gymnastics 
 quite right he said 
 you know also that the beginning is the most important part of any work especially in the case of a young and tender thing for that is the time at which the character is being formed and the desired impression is more readily taken 
 quite true 
 and shall we just carelessly allow children to hear any casual tales which may be devised by casual persons and to receive into their minds ideas for the most part the very opposite of those which we should wish them to have when they are grown up 
 we cannot 
 then the first thing will be to establish a censorship of the writers of fiction and let the censors receive any tale of fiction which is good and reject the bad and we will desire mothers and nurses to tell their children the authorised ones only let them fashion the mind with such tales even more fondly than they mould the body with their hands but most of those which are now in use must be discarded 
 of what tales are you speaking he said 
 you may find a model of the lesser in the greater i said for they are necessarily of the same type and there is the same spirit in both of them 
 very likely he replied but i do not as yet know what you would term the greater 
 those i said which are narrated by homer and hesiod and the rest of the poets who have ever been the great of mankind 
 but which stories do you mean he said and what fault do you find with them 
 a fault which is most serious i said the fault of telling a lie and what is more a bad lie 
 but when is this fault committed 
 whenever an erroneous representation is made of the nature of gods and heroes as when a painter paints a portrait not having the shadow of a likeness to the original 
 yes he said that sort of thing is certainly very blamable but what are the stories which you mean 
 first of all i said there was that greatest of all lies in high places which the poet told about uranus and which was a bad lie too i mean what hesiod says that uranus did and how cronus retaliated on him the doings of cronus and the sufferings which in turn his son inflicted upon him even if they were true ought certainly not to be lightly told to young and thoughtless persons if possible they had better be buried in silence but if there is an absolute necessity for their mention a chosen few might hear them in a mystery and they should sacrifice not a common eleusinian pig but some huge and unprocurable victim and then the number of the hearers will be very few indeed 
 why yes said he those stories are extremely objectionable 
 yes adeimantus they are stories not to be repeated in our state the young man should not be told that in committing the worst of crimes he is far from doing anything outrageous and that even if he chastises his father when does wrong in whatever manner he will only be following the example of the first and greatest among the gods 
 i entirely agree with you he said in my opinion those stories are quite unfit to be repeated 
 neither if we mean our future guardians to regard the habit of quarrelling among themselves as of all things the basest should any word be said to them of the wars in heaven and of the plots and fightings of the gods against one another for they are not true no we shall never mention the battles of the giants or let them be embroidered on garments and we shall be silent about the innumerable other quarrels of gods and heroes with their friends and relatives if they would only believe us we would tell them that quarrelling is unholy and that never up to this time has there been any quarrel between citizens this is what old men and old women should begin by telling children and when they grow up the poets also should be told to compose for them in a similar spirit but the narrative of hephaestus binding here his mother or how on another occasion zeus sent him flying for taking her part when she was being beaten and all the battles of the gods in homer these tales must not be admitted into our state whether they are supposed to have an allegorical meaning or not for a young person cannot judge what is allegorical and what is literal anything that he receives into his mind at that age is likely to become indelible and unalterable and therefore it is most important that the tales which the young first hear should be models of virtuous thoughts 
 there you are right he replied but if any one asks where are such models to be found and of what tales are you speaking how shall we answer him 
 i said to him you and i adeimantus at this moment are not poets but founders of a state now the founders of a state ought to know the general forms in which poets should cast their tales and the limits which must be observed by them but to make the tales is not their business 
 very true he said but what are these forms of theology which you mean 
 something of this kind i replied god is always to be represented as he truly is whatever be the sort of poetry epic lyric or tragic in which the representation is given 
 right 
 and is he not truly good and must he not be represented as such 
 certainly 
 and no good thing is hurtful 
 no indeed 
 and that which is not hurtful hurts not 
 certainly not 
 and that which hurts not does no evil 
 no 
 and can that which does no evil be a cause of evil 
 impossible 
 and the good is advantageous 
 yes 
 and therefore the cause of 
 yes 
 it follows therefore that the good is not the cause of all things but of the good only 
 assuredly 
 then god if he be good is not the author of all things as the many assert but he is the cause of a few things only and not of most things that occur to men for few are the goods of human life and many are the evils and the good is to be attributed to god alone of the evils the causes are to be sought elsewhere and not in him 
 that appears to me to be most true he said 
 then we must not listen to homer or to any other poet who is guilty of the folly of saying that two casks lie at the threshold of zeus full of lots one of good the other of evil lots and that he to whom zeus gives a mixture of the two sometimes meets with evil fortune at other times with good but that he to whom is given the cup of unmingled ill 
 him wild hunger drives the beauteous earth and again 
 zeus who is the dispenser of good and evil to us and if any one asserts that the violation of oaths and treaties which was really the work of pandarus was brought about by athene and zeus or that the strife and contention of the gods was instigated by themis and zeus he shall not have our approval neither will we allow our young men to hear the words of aeschylus that god plants guilt among men when he desires utterly to destroy a house and if a poet writes of the sufferings of niobe the subject of the tragedy in which these iambic verses occur or of the house of pelops or of the trojan war or on any similar theme either we must not permit him to say that these are the works of god or if they are of god he must devise some explanation of them such as we are seeking he must say that god did what was just and right and they were the better for being punished but that those who are punished are miserable and that god is the author of their misery the poet is not to be permitted to say though he may say that the wicked are miserable because they require to be punished and are benefited by receiving punishment from god but that god being good is the author of evil to any one is to be strenuously denied and not to be said or sung or heard in verse or prose by any one whether old or young in any commonwealth such a fiction is suicidal ruinous impious 
 i agree with you he replied and am ready to give my assent to the law 
 let this then be one of our rules and principles concerning the gods to which our poets and reciters will be expected to conform that god is not the author of all things but of good only 
 that will do he said 
 and what do you think of a second principle shall i ask you whether god is a magician and of a nature to appear insidiously now in one shape and now in another sometimes himself changing and passing into many forms sometimes deceiving us with the semblance of such transformations or is he one and the same immutably fixed in his own proper image 
 i cannot answer you he said without more thought 
 well i said but if we suppose a change in anything that change must be effected either by the thing itself or by some other thing 
 most certainly 
 and things which are at their best are also least liable to be altered or discomposed for example when healthiest and strongest the human frame is least liable to be affected by meats and drinks and the plant which is in the fullest vigour also suffers least from winds or the heat of the sun or any similar causes 
 of course 
 and will not the bravest and wisest soul be least confused or deranged by any external influence 
 true 
 and the same principle as i should suppose applies to all composite things furniture houses garments when good and well made they are least altered by time and circumstances 
 very true 
 then everything which is good whether made by art or nature or both is least liable to suffer change from without 
 true 
 but surely god and the things of god are in every way perfect 
 of course they are 
 then he can hardly be compelled by external influence to take many shapes 
 he cannot 
 but may he not change and transform himself 
 clearly he said that must be the case if he is changed at all 
 and will he then change himself for the better and fairer or for the worse and more unsightly 
 if he change at all he can only change for the worse for we cannot suppose him to be deficient either in virtue or beauty 
 very true adeimantus but then would any one whether god or man desire to make himself worse 
 impossible 
 then it is impossible that god should ever be willing to change being as is supposed the fairest and best that is conceivable every god remains absolutely and for ever in his own form 
 that necessarily follows he said in my judgment 
 then i said my dear friend let none of the poets tell us that 
 the gods taking the disguise of strangers from other lands walk up and down cities in all sorts of forms and let no one slander proteus and thetis neither let any one either in tragedy or in any other kind of poetry introduce here disguised in the likeness of a priestess asking an alms 
 for the daughters of inachus the river of argos let us have no more lies of that sort neither must we have mothers under the influence of the poets scaring their children with a bad version of these myths telling how certain gods as they say go about by night in the likeness of so many strangers and in divers forms but let them take heed lest they make cowards of their children and at the same time speak blasphemy against the gods 
 heaven forbid he said 
 but although the gods are themselves unchangeable still by witchcraft and deception they may make us think that they appear in various forms 
 perhaps he replied 
 well but can you imagine that god will be willing to lie whether in word or deed or to put forth a phantom of himself 
 i cannot say he replied 
 do you not know i said that the true lie if such an expression may be allowed is hated of gods and men 
 what do you mean he said 
 i mean that no one is willingly deceived in that which is the truest and highest part of himself or about the truest and highest matters there above all he is most afraid of a lie having possession of him 
 still he said i do not comprehend you 
 the reason is i replied that you attribute some profound meaning to my words but i am only saying that deception or being deceived or uninformed about the highest realities in the highest part of themselves which is the soul and in that part of them to have and to hold the lie is what mankind least like that i say is what they utterly detest 
 there is nothing more hateful to them 
 and as i was just now remarking this ignorance in the soul of him who is deceived may be called the true lie for the lie in words is only a kind of imitation and shadowy image of a previous affection of the soul not pure unadulterated falsehood am i not right 
 perfectly right 
 the true lie is hated not only by the gods but also by men 
 yes 
 whereas the lie in words is in certain cases useful and not hateful in dealing with enemies that would be an instance or again when those whom we call our friends in a fit of madness or illusion are going to do some harm then it is useful and is a sort of medicine or preventive also in the tales of mythology of which we were just now speaking because we do not know the truth about ancient times we make falsehood as much like truth as we can and so turn it to account 
 very true he said 
 but can any of these reasons apply to god can we suppose that he is ignorant of antiquity and therefore has recourse to invention 
 that would be ridiculous he said 
 then the lying poet has no place in our idea of god 
 i should say not 
 or perhaps he may tell a lie because he is afraid of enemies 
 that is inconceivable 
 but he may have friends who are senseless or mad 
 but no mad or senseless person can be a friend of god 
 then no motive can be imagined why god should lie 
 none whatever 
 then the superhuman and divine is absolutely incapable of falsehood 
 yes 
 then is god perfectly simple and true both in word and deed he changes not he deceives not either by sign or word by dream or waking vision 
 your thoughts he said are the reflection of my own 
 you agree with me then i said that this is the second type or form in which we should write and speak about divine things the gods are not magicians who transform themselves neither do they deceive mankind in any way 
 i grant that 
 then although we are admirers of homer we do not admire the lying dream which zeus sends to agamemnon neither will we praise the verses of aeschylus in which thetis says that apollo at her nuptials 
 was celebrating in song her fair progeny whose days were to he long and to know no sickness and when he had spoken of my lot as in all things blessed of heaven he raised a note of triumph and cheered my soul and i thought that the word of phoebus being divine and full of prophecy would not fail and now he himself who uttered the strain he who was present at the banquet and who said this he it is who has slain my son 
 these are the kind of sentiments about the gods which will arouse our anger and he who utters them shall be refused a chorus neither shall we allow teachers to make use of them in the instruction of the young meaning as we do that our guardians as far as men can be should be true worshippers of the gods and like them 
 i entirely agree be said in these principles and promise to make them my laws

 book iii 
 
 socrates adeimantus 
 such then i said are our principles of theology some tales are to be told and others are not to be told to our disciples from their youth upwards if we mean them to honour the gods and their parents and to value friendship with one another 
 yes and i think that our principles are right he said 
 but if they are to be courageous must they not learn other lessons besides these and lessons of such a kind as will take away the fear of death can any man be courageous who has the fear of death in him 
 certainly not he said 
 and can he be fearless of death or will he choose death in battle rather than defeat and slavery who believes the world below to be real and terrible 
 impossible 
 then we must assume a control over the narrators of this class of tales as well as over the others and beg them not simply to but rather to commend the world below intimating to them that their descriptions are untrue and will do harm to our future warriors 
 that will be our duty he said 
 then i said we shall have to obliterate many obnoxious passages beginning with the verses 
 i would rather he a serf on the land of a poor and portionless man than rule over all the dead who have come to nought we must also expunge the verse which tells us how pluto feared 
 lest the mansions grim and squalid which the gods abhor should he seen both of mortals and immortals and again 
 o heavens verily in the house of hades there is soul and ghostly form but no mind at all again of tiresias 
 to him even after death did persephone grant mind that he alone should be wise but the other souls are flitting shades again 
 the soul flying from the limbs had gone to hades lamentng her fate leaving manhood and youth again 
 and the soul with shrilling cry passed like smoke beneath the earth and 
 as bats in hollow of mystic cavern whenever any of the has dropped out of the string and falls from the rock fly shrilling and cling to one another so did they with shrilling cry hold together as they moved and we must beg homer and the other poets not to be angry if we strike out these and similar passages not because they are unpoetical or unattractive to the popular ear but because the greater the poetical charm of them the less are they meet for the ears of boys and men who are meant to be free and who should fear slavery more than death 
 undoubtedly 
 also we shall have to reject all the terrible and appalling names describe the world below cocytus and styx ghosts under the earth and sapless shades and any similar words of which the very mention causes a shudder to pass through the inmost soul of him who hears them i do not say that these horrible stories may not have a use of some kind but there is a danger that the nerves of our guardians may be rendered too excitable and effeminate by them 
 there is a real danger he said 
 then we must have no more of them 
 true 
 another and a nobler strain must be composed and sung by us 
 clearly 
 and shall we proceed to get rid of the weepings and wailings of famous men 
 they will go with the rest 
 but shall we be right in getting rid of them reflect our principle is that the good man will not consider death terrible to any other good man who is his comrade 
 yes that is our principle 
 and therefore he will not sorrow for his departed friend as though he had suffered anything terrible 
 he will not 
 such an one as we further maintain is sufficient for himself and his own happiness and therefore is least in need of other men 
 true he said 
 and for this reason the loss of a son or brother or the deprivation of fortune is to him of all men least terrible 
 assuredly 
 and therefore he will be least likely to lament and will bear with the greatest equanimity any misfortune of this sort which may befall him 
 yes he will feel such a misfortune far less than another 
 then we shall be right in getting rid of the lamentations of famous men and making them over to women and not even to women who are good for anything or to men of a baser sort that those who are being educated by us to be the defenders of their country may scorn to do the like 
 that will be very right 
 then we will once more entreat homer and the other poets not to depict achilles who is the son of a goddess first lying on his side then on his back and then on his face then starting up and sailing in a frenzy along the shores of the barren sea now taking the sooty ashes in both his hands and pouring them over his head or weeping and wailing in the various modes which homer has delineated nor should he describe priam the kinsman of the gods as praying and beseeching 
 rolling in the dirt calling each man loudly by his name still more earnestly will we beg of him at all events not to introduce the gods lamenting and saying 
 alas my misery alas that i bore the harvest to my sorrow but if he must introduce the gods at any rate let him not dare so completely to misrepresent the greatest of the gods as to make him say 
 o heavens with my eyes verily i behold a dear friend of mine chased round and round the city and my heart is sorrowful or again 
 woe is me that i am fated to have sarpedon dearest of men to me subdued at the hands of patroclus the son of menoetius for if my sweet adeimantus our youth seriously listen to such unworthy representations of the gods instead of laughing at them as they ought hardly will any of them deem that he himself being but a man can be dishonoured by similar actions neither will he rebuke any inclination which may arise in his mind to say and do the like and instead of having any shame or he will be always whining and lamenting on slight occasions 
 yes he said that is most true 
 yes i replied but that surely is what ought not to be as the argument has just proved to us and by that proof we must abide until it is disproved by a better 
 it ought not to be 
 neither ought our guardians to be given to laughter for a fit of laughter which has been indulged to excess almost always produces a violent reaction 
 so i believe 
 then persons of worth even if only mortal men must not be represented as overcome by laughter and still less must such a representation of the gods be allowed 
 still less of the gods as you say he replied 
 then we shall not suffer such an expression to be used about the gods as that of homer when he describes how 
 inextinguishable laughter arose among the blessed gods when they saw hephaestus bustling about the mansion on your views we must not admit them 
 on my views if you like to father them on me that we must not admit them is certain 
 again truth should be highly valued if as we were saying a lie is useless to the gods and useful only as a medicine to men then the use of such medicines should be restricted to physicians private individuals have no business with them 
 clearly not he said 
 then if any one at all is to have the privilege of lying the rulers of the state should be the persons and they in their dealings either with enemies or with their own citizens may be allowed to lie for the public good but nobody else should meddle with anything of the kind and although the rulers have this privilege for a private man to lie to them in return is to be deemed a more heinous fault than for the patient or the pupil of a gymnasium not to speak the truth about his own bodily illnesses to the physician or to the trainer or for a sailor not to tell the captain what is happening about the ship and the rest of the crew and how things are going with himself or his fellow sailors 
 most true he said 
 if then the ruler catches anybody beside himself lying in the state 
 any of the craftsmen whether he priest or physician or carpenter he will punish him for introducing a practice which is equally subversive and destructive of ship or state 
 most certainly he said if our idea of the state is ever carried out 
 in the next place our youth must be temperate 
 certainly 
 are not the chief elements of temperance speaking generally obedience to commanders and in sensual pleasures 
 true 
 then we shall approve such language as that of diomede in homer 
 friend sit still and obey my word and the verses which follow 
 the greeks marched breathing prowess 
 in silent awe of their leaders and other sentiments of the same kind 
 we shall 
 what of this line 
 o heavy with wine who hast the eyes of a dog and the heart of a stag and of the words which follow would you say that these or any similar impertinences which private individuals are supposed to address to their rulers whether in verse or prose are well or ill spoken 
 they are ill spoken 
 they may very possibly afford some amusement but they do not conduce to temperance and therefore they are likely to do harm to our young men you would agree with me there 
 yes 
 and then again to make the wisest of men say that nothing in his opinion is more glorious than 
 when the tables are full of bread and meat and the carries round wine which he draws from the bowl and pours into the cups is it fit or conducive to temperance for a young man to hear such words or the verse 
 the saddest of fates is to die and meet destiny from hunger what would you say again to the tale of zeus who while other gods and men were asleep and he the only person awake lay devising plans but forgot them all in a moment through his lust and was so completely overcome at the sight of here that he would not even go into the hut but wanted to lie with her on the ground declaring that he had never been in such a state of rapture before even when they first met one another 
 without the knowledge of their parents or that other tale of how hephaestus because of similar goings on cast a chain around ares and aphrodite 
 indeed he said i am strongly of opinion that they ought not to hear that sort of thing 
 but any deeds of endurance which are done or told by famous men these they ought to see and hear as for example what is said in the verses 
 he smote his breast and thus reproached his heart 
 endure my heart far worse hast thou endured 
 certainly he said 
 in the next place we must not let them be receivers of gifts or lovers of money 
 certainly not 
 neither must we sing to them of 
 gifts persuading gods and persuading reverend kings neither is phoenix the tutor of achilles to be approved or deemed to have given his pupil good counsel when he told him that he should take the gifts of the greeks and assist them but that without a gift he should not lay aside his anger neither will we believe or acknowledge achilles himself to have been such a lover of money that he took or that when he had received payment he restored the dead body of hector but that without payment he was unwilling to do so 
 undoubtedly he said these are not sentiments which can be approved 
 loving homer as i do i hardly like to say that in attributing these feelings to achilles or in believing that they are truly to him he is guilty of downright impiety as little can i believe the narrative of his insolence to apollo where he says 
 thou hast wronged me o most abominable of deities verily i would he even with thee if i had only the power or his insubordination to the on whose divinity he is ready to lay hands or his offering to the dead patroclus of his own hair which had been previously dedicated to the other spercheius and that he actually performed this vow or that he dragged hector round the tomb of patroclus and slaughtered the captives at the pyre of all this i cannot believe that he was guilty any more than i can allow our citizens to believe that he the wise pupil the son of a goddess and of peleus who was the gentlest of men and third in descent from zeus was so disordered in his wits as to be at one time the slave of two seemingly inconsistent passions meanness not untainted by avarice combined with overweening contempt of gods and men 
 you are quite right he replied 
 and let us equally refuse to believe or allow to be repeated the tale of theseus son of poseidon or of peirithous son of zeus going forth as they did to perpetrate a horrid rape or of any other hero or son of a god daring to do such impious and dreadful things as they falsely ascribe to them in our day and let us further compel the poets to declare either that these acts were not done by them or that they were not the sons of gods both in the same breath they shall not be permitted to affirm we will not have them trying to persuade our youth that the gods are the authors of evil and that heroes are no better than which as we were saying are neither pious nor true for we have already proved that evil cannot come from the gods 
 assuredly not 
 and further they are likely to have a bad effect on those who hear them for everybody will begin to excuse his own vices when he is convinced that similar wickednesses are always being perpetrated by 
 the kindred of the gods the relatives of zeus whose ancestral altar the attar of zeus is aloft in air on the peak of ida and who have 
 the blood of deities yet flowing in their veins and therefore let us put an end to such tales lest they engender laxity of morals among the young 
 by all means he replied 
 but now that we are determining what classes of subjects are or are not to be spoken of let us see whether any have been omitted by us the manner in which gods and demigods and heroes and the world below should be treated has been already laid down 
 very true 
 and what shall we say about men that is clearly the remaining portion of our subject 
 clearly so 
 but we are not in a condition to answer this question at present my friend 
 why not 
 because if i am not mistaken we shall have to say that about men poets and are guilty of making the gravest misstatements when they tell us that wicked men are often happy and the good miserable and that injustice is profitable when undetected but that justice is a own loss and gain these things we shall forbid them to utter and command them to sing and say the opposite 
 to be sure we shall he replied 
 but if you admit that i am right in this then i shall maintain that you have implied the principle for which we have been all along contending 
 i grant the truth of your inference 
 that such things are or are not to be said about men is a question which we cannot determine until we have discovered what justice is and how naturally advantageous to the possessor whether he seems to be just or not 
 most true he said 
 enough of the subjects of poetry let us now speak of the style and when this has been considered both matter and manner will have been completely treated 
 i do not understand what you mean said adeimantus 
 then i must make you understand and perhaps i may be more intelligible if i put the matter in this way you are aware i suppose that all mythology and poetry is a narration of events either past present or to come 
 certainly he replied 
 and narration may be either simple narration or imitation or a union of the two 
 that again he said i do not quite understand 
 i fear that i must be a ridiculous teacher when i have so much difficulty in making myself apprehended like a bad speaker therefore i will not take the whole of the subject but will break a piece off in illustration of my meaning you know the first lines of the iliad in which the poet says that chryses prayed agamemnon to release his daughter and that agamemnon flew into a passion with him whereupon chryses failing of his object invoked the anger of the god against the achaeans now as far as these lines 
 and he prayed all the greeks but especially the two sons of atreus the chiefs of the people the poet is speaking in his own person he never leads us to suppose that he is any one else but in what follows he takes the person of chryses and then he does all that he can to make us believe that the speaker is not homer but the aged priest himself and in this double form he has cast the entire narrative of the events which occurred at troy and in ithaca and throughout the odyssey 
 yes 
 and a narrative it remains both in the speeches which the poet recites from time to time and in the intermediate passages 
 quite true 
 but when the poet speaks in the person of another may we not say that he assimilates his style to that of the person who as he informs you is going to speak 
 certainly 
 and this assimilation of himself to another either by the use of voice or gesture is the imitation of the person whose character he assumes 
 of course 
 then in this case the narrative of the poet may be said to proceed by way of imitation 
 very true 
 or if the poet everywhere appears and never conceals himself then again the imitation is dropped and his poetry becomes simple narration however in order that i may make my meaning quite clear and that you may no more say i understand i will show how the change might be effected if homer had said the priest came having his ransom in his hands supplicating the achaeans and above all the kings and then if instead of speaking in the person of chryses he had continued in his own person the words would have been not imitation but simple narration the passage would have run as follows i am no poet and therefore i drop the metre the priest came and prayed the gods on behalf of the greeks that they might capture troy and return safely home but begged that they would give him back his daughter and take the ransom which he brought and respect the god thus he spoke and the other greeks revered the priest and assented but agamemnon was wroth and bade him depart and not come again lest the staff and chaplets of the god should be of no avail to him the daughter of chryses should not be released he said she should grow old with him in argos and then he told him to go away and not to provoke him if he intended to get home unscathed and the old man went away in fear and silence and when he had left the camp he called upon apollo by his many names reminding him of everything which he had done pleasing to him whether in building his temples or in offering sacrifice and praying that his good deeds might be returned to him and that the achaeans might expiate his tears by the arrows of the god and so on in this way the whole becomes simple narrative 
 i understand he said 
 or you may suppose the opposite case that the intermediate passages are omitted and the dialogue only left 
 that also he said i understand you mean for example as in tragedy 
 you have conceived my meaning perfectly and if i mistake not what you failed to apprehend before is now made clear to you that poetry and mythology are in some cases wholly imitative instances of this are supplied by tragedy and comedy there is likewise the opposite style in which the my poet is the only speaker of this the dithyramb affords the best example and the combination of both is found in epic and in several other styles of poetry do i take you with me 
 yes he said i see now what you meant 
 i will ask you to remember also what i began by saying that we had done with the subject and might proceed to the style 
 yes i remember 
 in saying this i intended to imply that we must come to an understanding about the mimetic art whether the poets in narrating their stories are to be allowed by us to imitate and if so whether in whole or in part and if the latter in what parts or should all imitation be prohibited 
 you mean i suspect to ask whether tragedy and comedy shall be admitted into our state 
 yes i said but there may be more than this in question i really do not know as yet but whither the argument may blow thither we go 
 and go we will he said 
 then adeimantus let me ask you whether our guardians ought to be imitators or rather has not this question been decided by the rule already laid down that one man can only do one thing well and not many and that if he attempt many he will altogether fall of gaining much reputation in any 
 certainly 
 and this is equally true of imitation no one man can imitate many things as well as he would imitate a single one 
 he cannot 
 then the same person will hardly be able to play a serious part in life and at the same time to be an imitator and imitate many other parts as well for even when two species of imitation are nearly allied the same persons cannot succeed in both as for example the writers of tragedy and comedy did you not just now call them imitations 
 yes i did and you are right in thinking that the same persons cannot succeed in both 
 any more than they can be rhapsodists and actors at once 
 true 
 neither are comic and tragic actors the same yet all these things are but imitations 
 they are so 
 and human nature adeimantus appears to have been coined into yet smaller pieces and to be as incapable of imitating many things well as of performing well the actions of which the imitations are copies 
 quite true he replied 
 if then we adhere to our original notion and bear in mind that our guardians setting aside every other business are to dedicate themselves wholly to the maintenance of freedom in the state making this their craft and engaging in no work which does not bear on this end they ought not to practise or imitate anything else if they imitate at all they should imitate from youth upward only those characters which are suitable to their profession the courageous temperate holy free and the like but they should not depict or be skilful at imitating any kind of illiberality or baseness lest from imitation they should come to be what they imitate did you never observe how imitations beginning in early youth and continuing far into life at length grow into habits and become a second nature affecting body voice and mind 
 yes certainly he said 
 then i said we will not allow those for whom we profess a care and of whom we say that they ought to be good men to imitate a woman whether young or old quarrelling with her husband or striving and vaunting against the gods in conceit of her happiness or when she is in affliction or sorrow or weeping and certainly not one who is in sickness love or labour 
 very right he said 
 neither must they represent slaves male or female performing the offices of slaves 
 they must not 
 and surely not bad men whether cowards or any others who do the reverse of what we have just been prescribing who scold or mock or revile one another in drink or out of in drink or or who in any other manner sin against themselves and their neighbours in word or deed as the manner of such is neither should they be trained to imitate the action or speech of men or women who are mad or bad for madness like vice is to be known but not to be practised or imitated 
 very true he replied 
 neither may they imitate smiths or other artificers or oarsmen or boatswains or the like 
 how can they he said when they are not allowed to apply their minds to the callings of any of these 
 nor may they imitate the neighing of horses the bellowing of bulls the murmur of rivers and roll of the ocean thunder and all that sort of thing 
 nay he said if madness be forbidden neither may they copy the behaviour of madmen 
 you mean i said if i understand you aright that there is one sort of narrative style which may be employed by a truly good man when he has anything to say and that another sort will be used by a man of an opposite character and education 
 and which are these two sorts he asked 
 suppose i answered that a just and good man in the course of a narration comes on some saying or action of another good man i should imagine that he will like to personate him and will not be ashamed of this sort of imitation he will be most ready to play the part of the good man when he is acting firmly and wisely in a less degree when he is overtaken by illness or love or drink or has met with any other disaster but when he comes to a character which is unworthy of him he will not make a study of that he will disdain such a person and will assume his likeness if at all for a moment only when he is performing some good action at other times he will be ashamed to play a part which he has never practised nor will he like to fashion and frame himself after the baser models he feels the employment of such an art unless in jest to be beneath him and his mind revolts at it 
 so i should expect he replied 
 then he will adopt a mode of narration such as we have illustrated out of homer that is to say his style will be both imitative and narrative but there will be very little of the former and a great deal of the latter do you agree 
 certainly he said that is the model which such a speaker must necessarily take 
 but there is another sort of character who will narrate anything and the worse lie is the more unscrupulous he will be nothing will be too bad for him and he will be ready to imitate anything not as a joke but in right good earnest and before a large company as i was just now saying he will attempt to represent the roll of thunder the noise of wind and hall or the creaking of wheels and pulleys and the various sounds of flutes pipes trumpets and all sorts of instruments he will bark like a dog bleat like a sheep or crow like a cock his entire art will consist in imitation of voice and gesture and there will be very little narration 
 that he said will be his mode of speaking 
 these then are the two kinds of style 
 yes 
 and you would agree with me in saying that one of them is simple and has but slight changes and if the harmony and rhythm are also chosen for their simplicity the result is that the speaker if hc speaks correctly is always pretty much the same in style and he will keep within the limits of a single harmony for the changes are not great and in like manner he will make use of nearly the same rhythm 
 that is quite true he said 
 whereas the other requires all sorts of harmonies and all sorts of rhythms if the music and the style are to correspond because the style has all sorts of changes 
 that is also perfectly true he replied 
 and do not the two styles or the mixture of the two comprehend all poetry and every form of expression in words no one can say anything except in one or other of them or in both together 
 they include all he said 
 and shall we receive into our state all the three styles or one only of the two unmixed styles or would you include the mixed 
 i should prefer only to admit the pure imitator of virtue 
 yes i said adeimantus but the mixed style is also very charming and indeed the pantomimic which is the opposite of the one chosen by you is the most popular style with children and their attendants and with the world in general 
 i do not deny it 
 but i suppose you would argue that such a style is unsuitable to our state in which human nature is not twofold or manifold for one man plays one part only 
 yes quite unsuitable 
 and this is the reason why in our state and in our state only we shall find a shoemaker to be a shoemaker and not a pilot also and a husbandman to be a husbandman and not a dicast also and a soldier a soldier and not a trader also and the same throughout 
 true he said 
 and therefore when any one of these pantomimic gentlemen who are so clever that they can imitate anything comes to us and makes a proposal to exhibit himself and his poetry we will fall down and worship him as a sweet and holy and wonderful being but we must also inform him that in our state such as he are not permitted to exist the law will not allow them and so when we have anointed him with myrrh and set a garland of wool upon his head we shall send him away to another city for we mean to employ for our souls health the rougher and severer poet or who will imitate the style of the virtuous only and will follow those models which we prescribed at first when we began the education of our soldiers 
 we certainly will he said if we have the power 
 then now my friend i said that part of music or literary education which relates to the story or myth may be considered to be finished for the matter and manner have both been discussed 
 i think so too he said 
 next in order will follow melody and song 
 that is obvious 
 every one can see already what we ought to say about them if we are to be consistent with ourselves 
 socrates glaucon 
 i fear said glaucon laughing that the words every one hardly includes me for i cannot at the moment say what they should be though i may guess 
 at any rate you can tell that a song or ode has three parts the words the melody and the rhythm that degree of knowledge i may presuppose 
 yes he said so much as that you may 
 and as for the words there surely be no difference words between words which are and which are not set to music both will conform to the same laws and these have been already determined by us 
 yes 
 and the melody and rhythm will depend upon the words 
 certainly 
 we were saying when we spoke of the that we had no need of lamentations and strains of sorrow 
 true 
 and which are the harmonies expressive of sorrow you are musical and can tell me 
 the harmonies which you mean are the mixed or tenor lydian and the or bass lydian and such like 
 these then i said must be banished even to women who have a character to maintain they are of no use and much less to men certainly 
 in the next place drunkenness and softness and indolence are utterly unbecoming the character of our guardians 
 utterly unbecoming 
 and which are the soft or drinking harmonies 
 the ionian he replied and the lydian they are termed relaxed 
 well and are these of any military use 
 quite the reverse he replied and if so the dorian and the phrygian are the only ones which you have left 
 i answered of the harmonies i know nothing but i want to have one warlike to sound the note or accent which a brave man utters in the hour of danger and stern resolve or when his cause is failing and he is going to wounds or death or is overtaken by some other evil and at every such crisis meets the blows of fortune with firm step and a determination to endure and another to be used by him in times of peace and freedom of action when there is no pressure of necessity and he is seeking to persuade god by prayer or man by instruction and admonition or on the other hand when he is expressing his willingness to yield to persuasion or entreaty or admonition and which represents him when by prudent conduct he has attained his end not carried away by his success but acting moderately and wisely under the circumstances and acquiescing in the event these two harmonies i ask you to leave the strain of necessity and the strain of freedom the strain of the unfortunate and the strain of the fortunate the strain of courage and the strain of temperance these i say leave 
 and these he replied are the dorian and phrygian harmonies of which i was just now speaking 
 then i said if these and these only are to be used in our songs and melodies we shall not want multiplicity of notes or a panharmonic scale 
 i suppose not 
 then we shall not maintain the artificers of lyres with three corners and complex scales or the makers of any other instruments 
 certainly not 
 but what do you say to and would you admit them into our state when you reflect that in this composite use of harmony the flute is worse than all the stringed instruments put together even the panharmonic music is only an imitation of the flute 
 clearly not 
 there remain then only the lyre and the harp for use in the city and the shepherds may have a pipe in the country 
 that is surely the conclusion to be drawn from the argument 
 the preferring of apollo and his instruments to marsyas and his instruments is not at all strange i said 
 not at all he replied 
 and so by the dog of egypt we have been unconsciously purging the state which not long ago we termed luxurious 
 and we have done wisely he replied 
 then let us now finish the purgation i said next in order to harmonies rhythms will naturally follow and they should be subject to the same rules for we ought not to seek out complex systems of metre or metres of every kind but rather to discover what rhythms are the expressions of a courageous and harmonious life and when we have found them we shall adapt the foot and the melody to words having a like spirit not the words to the foot and melody to say what these rhythms are will be your duty you must teach me them as you have already taught me the harmonies 
 but indeed he replied i cannot tell you i only know that there are some three principles of rhythm out of which metrical systems are framed just as in sounds there are four notes out of which all the harmonies are composed that is an observation which i have made but of what sort of lives they are severally the imitations i am unable to say 
 then i said we must take damon into our counsels and he will tell us what rhythms are expressive of meanness or insolence or fury or other unworthiness and what are to be reserved for the expression of opposite feelings and i think that i have an indistinct recollection of his mentioning a complex cretic rhythm also a dactylic or heroic and he arranged them in some manner which i do not quite understand making the rhythms equal in the rise and fall of the foot long and short alternating and unless i am mistaken he spoke of an iambic as well as of a trochaic rhythm and assigned to them short and long quantities also in some cases he appeared to praise or censure the movement of the foot quite as much as the rhythm or perhaps a combination of the two for i am not certain what he meant these matters however as i was saying had better be referred to damon himself for the analysis of the subject would be difficult you know 
 rather so i should say 
 but there is no difficulty in seeing that grace or the absence of grace is an effect of good or bad rhythm 
 none at all 
 and also that good and bad rhythm naturally assimilate to a good and bad style and that harmony and discord in like manner follow style for our principle is that rhythm and harmony are regulated by the words and not the words by them 
 just so he said they should follow the words 
 and will not the words and the character of the style depend on the temper of the soul 
 yes 
 and everything else on the style 
 yes 
 then beauty of style and harmony and grace and good rhythm depend on simplicity i mean the true simplicity of a rightly and nobly ordered mind and character not that other simplicity which is only an euphemism for folly 
 very true he replied 
 and if our youth are to do their work in life must they not make these graces and harmonies their perpetual aim 
 they must 
 and surely the art of the painter and every other creative and constructive art are full of them weaving embroidery architecture and every kind of manufacture also nature animal and vegetable in all of them there is grace or the absence of grace and ugliness and discord and inharmonious motion are nearly allied to ill words and ill nature as grace and harmony are the twin sisters of goodness and virtue and bear their likeness 
 that is quite true he said 
 but shall our superintendence go no further and are the poets only to be required by us to express the image of the good in their works on pain if they do anything else of expulsion from our state or is the same control to be extended to other artists and are they also to be prohibited from exhibiting the opposite forms of vice and intemperance and meanness and indecency in sculpture and building and the other creative arts and is he who cannot conform to this rule of ours to be prevented from practising his art in our state lest the taste of our citizens be corrupted by him we would not have our guardians grow up amid images of moral deformity as in some noxious pasture and there browse and feed upon many a baneful herb and flower day by day little by little until they silently gather a festering mass of corruption in their own soul let our artists rather be those who are gifted to discern the true nature of the beautiful and graceful then will our youth dwell in a land of health amid fair sights and sounds and receive the good in everything and beauty the effluence of fair works shall flow into the eye and ear like a breeze from a purer region and insensibly draw the soul from earliest years into likeness and sympathy with the beauty of reason 
 there can be no nobler training than that he replied 
 and therefore i said glaucon musical training is a more potent instrument than any other because rhythm and harmony find their way into the inward places of the soul on which they mightily fasten imparting grace and making the soul of him who is rightly educated graceful or of him who is ungraceful and also because he who has received this true education of the inner being will most shrewdly perceive omissions or faults in art and nature and with a true taste while he praises and rejoices over and receives into his soul the good and becomes noble and good he will justly blame and hate the bad now in the days of his youth even before he is able to know the reason why and when reason comes he will recognise and salute the friend with whom his education has made him long familiar 
 yes he said i quite agree with you in thinking that our youth should be trained in music and on the grounds which you mention 
 just as in learning to read i said we were satisfied when we knew the letters of the alphabet which are very few in all their recurring sizes and combinations not slighting them as unimportant whether they occupy a space large or small but everywhere eager to make them out and not thinking ourselves perfect in the art of reading until we recognise them wherever they are found 
 true 
 or as we recognise the reflection of letters in the water or in a mirror only when we know the letters themselves the same art and study giving us the knowledge of both 
 exactly 
 even so as i maintain neither we nor our guardians whom we have to educate can ever become musical until we and they know the essential forms in all their combinations and can recognise them and their images wherever they are found not slighting them either in small things or great but believing them all to be within the sphere of one art and study 
 most assuredly 
 and when a beautiful soul harmonises with a beautiful form and the two are cast in one mould that will be the fairest of sights to him who has an eye to see it 
 the fairest indeed 
 and the fairest is also the loveliest 
 that may be assumed 
 and the man who has the spirit of harmony will be most in love with the loveliest but he will not love him who is of an inharmonious soul 
 that is true he replied if the deficiency be in his soul but if there be any merely bodily defect in another he will be patient of it and will love all the same 
 i perceive i said that you have or have had experiences of this sort and i agree but let me ask you another question has excess of pleasure any affinity to temperance 
 how can that be he replied pleasure deprives a man of the use of his faculties quite as much as pain 
 or any affinity to virtue in general 
 none whatever 
 any affinity to wantonness and intemperance 
 yes the greatest 
 and is there any greater or keener pleasure than that of sensual love 
 no nor a madder 
 whereas true love is a love of beauty and order temperate and harmonious 
 quite true he said 
 then no intemperance or madness should be allowed to approach true love 
 certainly not 
 then mad or intemperate pleasure must never be allowed to come near the lover and his beloved neither of them can have any part in it if their love is of the right sort 
 no indeed socrates it must never come near them 
 then i suppose that in the city which we are founding you would make a law to the effect that a friend should use no other familiarity to his love than a father would use to his son and then only for a noble purpose and he must first have the consent and this rule is to limit him in all his intercourse and he is never to be seen going further or if he exceeds he is to be deemed guilty of coarseness and bad taste 
 i quite agree he said 
 thus much of music which makes a fair ending for what should be the end of music if not the love of beauty 
 i agree he said 
 after music comes gymnastic in which our youth are next to be trained 
 certainly 
 gymnastic as well as music should begin in early years the training in it should be careful and should continue through life now my belief is and this is a matter upon which i should like to have your opinion in confirmation of my own but my own belief is not that the good body by any bodily excellence improves the soul but on the contrary that the good soul by her own excellence improves the body as far as this may be possible what do you say 
 yes i agree 
 then to the mind when adequately trained we shall be right in handing over the more particular care of the body and in order to avoid prolixity we will now only give the general outlines of the subject 
 very good 
 that they must abstain from intoxication has been already remarked by us for of all persons a guardian should be the last to get drunk and not know where in the world he is 
 yes he said that a guardian should require another guardian to take care of him is ridiculous indeed 
 but next what shall we say of their food for the men are in training for the great contest of all are they not 
 yes he said 
 and will the habit of body of our ordinary athletes be suited to them 
 why not 
 i am afraid i said that a habit of body such as they have is but a sleepy sort of thing and rather perilous to health do you not observe that these athletes sleep away their lives and are liable to most dangerous illnesses if they depart in ever so slight a degree from their customary regimen 
 yes i do 
 then i said a finer sort of training will be required for our warrior athletes who are to be like wakeful dogs and to see and hear with the utmost keenness amid the many changes of water and also of food of summer heat and winter cold which they will have to endure when on a campaign they must not be liable to break down in health 
 that is my view 
 the really excellent gymnastic is twin sister of that simple music which we were just now describing 
 how so 
 why i conceive that there is a gymnastic which like our music is simple and good and especially the military gymnastic 
 what do you mean 
 my meaning may be learned from homer he you know feeds his heroes at their feasts when they are campaigning on soldiers fare they have no fish although they are on the shores of the hellespont and they are not allowed boiled meats but only roast which is the food most convenient for soldiers requiring only that they should light a fire and not involving the trouble of carrying about pots and pans 
 true 
 and i can hardly be mistaken in saying that sweet sauces are nowhere mentioned in homer in proscribing them however he is not singular all professional athletes are well aware that a man who is to be in good condition should take nothing of the kind 
 yes he said and knowing this they are quite right in not taking them 
 then you would not approve of syracusan dinners and the refinements of sicilian cookery 
 i think not 
 nor if a man is to be in condition would you allow him to have a corinthian girl as his fair friend 
 certainly not 
 neither would you approve of the delicacies as they are thought of athenian confectionery 
 certainly not 
 all such feeding and living may be rightly compared by us to melody and song composed in the panharmonic style and in all the rhythms exactly 
 there complexity engendered license and here disease whereas simplicity in music was the parent of temperance in the soul and simplicity in gymnastic of health in the body 
 most true he said 
 but when intemperance and disease multiply in a state halls of justice and medicine are always being opened and the arts of the doctor and the lawyer give themselves airs finding how keen is the interest which not only the slaves but the freemen of a city take about them 
 of course 
 and yet what greater proof can there be of a bad and disgraceful state of education than this that not only artisans and the meaner sort of people need the skill of physicians and judges but also those who would profess to have had a liberal education is it not disgraceful and a great sign of want of that a man should have to go abroad for his law and physic because he has none of his own at home and must therefore surrender himself into the hands of other men whom he makes lords and judges over him 
 of all things he said the most disgraceful 
 would you say most i replied when you consider that there is a further stage of the evil in which a man is not only a litigant passing all his days in the courts either as plaintiff or defendant but is actually led by his bad taste to pride himself on his litigiousness he imagines that he is a master in dishonesty able to take every crooked turn and wriggle into and out of every hole bending like a withy and getting out of the way of justice and all for what in order to gain small points not worth mentioning he not knowing that so to order his life as to be able to do without a napping judge is a far higher and nobler sort of thing is not that still more disgraceful 
 yes he said that is still more disgraceful 
 well i said and to require the help of medicine not when a wound has to be cured or on occasion of an epidemic but just because by indolence and a habit of life such as we have been describing men fill themselves with waters and winds as if their bodies were a marsh compelling the ingenious sons of asclepius to find more names for diseases such as flatulence and catarrh is not this too a disgrace 
 yes he said they do certainly give very strange and newfangled names to diseases 
 yes i said and i do not believe that there were any such diseases in the days of asclepius and this i infer from the circumstance that the hero eurypylus after he has been wounded in homer drinks a posset of pramnian wine well besprinkled with and grated cheese which are certainly inflammatory and yet the sons of asclepius who were at the trojan war do not blame the damsel who gives him the drink or rebuke patroclus who is treating his case 
 well he said that was surely an extraordinary drink to be given to a person in his condition 
 not so extraordinary i replied if you bear in mind that in former days as is commonly said before the time of herodicus the guild of asclepius did not practise our present system of medicine which may be said to educate diseases but herodicus being a trainer and himself of a sickly constitution by a combination of training and doctoring found out a way of torturing first and chiefly himself and secondly the rest of the world 
 how was that he said 
 by the invention of lingering death for he had a mortal disease which he perpetually tended and as recovery was out of the question he passed his entire life as a valetudinarian he could do nothing but attend upon himself and he was in constant torment whenever he departed in anything from his usual regimen and so dying hard by the help of science he struggled on to old age 
 a rare reward of his skill 
 yes i said a reward which a man might fairly expect who never understood that if asclepius did not instruct his descendants in valetudinarian arts the omission arose not from ignorance or inexperience of such a branch of medicine but because he knew that in all states every individual has an occupation to which he must attend and has therefore no leisure to spend in continually being ill this we remark in the case of the artisan but ludicrously enough do not apply the same rule to people of the richer sort 
 how do you mean he said 
 i mean this when a carpenter is ill he asks the physician for a rough and ready cure an emetic or a purge or a cautery or the knife these are his remedies and if some one prescribes for him a course of dietetics and tells him that he must swathe and swaddle his head and all that sort of thing he replies at once that he has no time to be ill and that he sees no good in a life which is spent in nursing his disease to the neglect of his customary employment and therefore bidding to this sort of physician he resumes his ordinary habits and either gets well and lives and does his business or if his constitution falls he dies and has no more trouble 
 yes he said and a man in his condition of life ought to use the art of medicine thus far only 
 has he not i said an occupation and what profit would there be in his life if he were deprived of his occupation 
 quite true he said 
 but with the rich man this is otherwise of him we do not say that he has any specially appointed work which he must perform if he would live 
 he is generally supposed to have nothing to do 
 then you never heard of the saying of phocylides that as soon as a man has a livelihood he should practise virtue 
 nay he said i think that he had better begin somewhat sooner 
 let us not have a dispute with him about this i said but rather ask ourselves is the practice of virtue obligatory on the rich man or can he live without it and if obligatory on him then let us raise a further question whether this dieting of disorders which is an impediment to the application of the mind t in carpentering and the mechanical arts does not equally stand in the way of the sentiment of phocylides 
 of that he replied there can be no doubt such excessive care of the body when carried beyond the rules of gymnastic is most inimical to the practice of virtue 
 yes indeed i replied and equally incompatible with the management of a house an army or an office of state and what is most important of all irreconcilable with any kind of study or thought or there is a constant suspicion that headache and giddiness are to be ascribed to philosophy and hence all practising or making trial of virtue in the higher sense is absolutely stopped for a man is always fancying that he is being made ill and is in constant anxiety about the state of his body 
 yes likely enough 
 and therefore our politic asclepius may be supposed to have exhibited the power of his art only to persons who being generally of healthy constitution and habits of life had a definite ailment such as these he cured by purges and operations and bade them live as usual herein consulting the interests of the state but bodies which disease had penetrated through and through he would not have attempted to cure by gradual processes of evacuation and infusion he did not want to lengthen out lives or to have weak fathers begetting weaker sons if a man was not able to live in the ordinary way he had no business to cure him for such a cure would have been of no use either to himself or to the state 
 then he said you regard asclepius as a statesman 
 clearly and his character is further illustrated by his sons note that they were heroes in the days of old and practised the medicines of which i am speaking at the siege of troy you will remember how when pandarus wounded menelaus they 
 sucked the blood out of the wound and sprinkled soothing remedies but they never prescribed what the patient was afterwards to eat or drink in the case of menelaus any more than in the case of eurypylus the remedies as they conceived were enough to heal any man who before he was wounded was healthy and regular in habits and even though he did happen to drink a posset of pramnian wine he might get well all the same but they would have nothing to do with unhealthy and intemperate subjects whose lives were of no use either to themselves or others the art of medicine was not designed for their good and though they were as rich as midas the sons of asclepius would have declined to attend them 
 they were very acute persons those sons of asclepius 
 naturally so i replied nevertheless the tragedians and pindar disobeying our behests although they acknowledge that asclepius was the son of apollo say also that he was bribed into healing a rich man who was at the point of death and for this reason he was struck by lightning but we in accordance with the principle already affirmed by us will not believe them when they tell us both if he was the son of a god we maintain that hd was not avaricious or if he was avaricious he was not the son of a god 
 all that socrates is excellent but i should like to put a question to you ought there not to be good physicians in a state and are not the best those who have treated the greatest number of constitutions good and bad and are not the best judges in like manner those who are acquainted with all sorts of moral natures 
 yes i said i too would have good judges and good physicians but do you know whom i think good 
 will you tell me 
 i will if i can let me however note that in the same question you join two things which are not the same 
 how so he asked 
 why i said you join physicians and judges now the most skilful physicians are those who from their youth upwards have combined with the knowledge of their art the greatest experience of disease they had better not be robust in health and should have had all manner of diseases in their own persons for the body as i conceive is not the instrument with which they cure the body in that case we could not allow them ever to be or to have been sickly but they cure the body with the mind and the mind which has become and is sick can cure nothing 
 that is very true he said 
 but with the judge it is otherwise since he governs mind by mind he ought not therefore to have been trained among vicious minds and to have associated with them from youth upwards and to have gone through the whole calendar of crime only in order that he may quickly infer the crimes of others as he might their bodily diseases from his own the honourable mind which is to form a healthy judgment should have had no experience or contamination of evil habits when young and this is the reason why in youth good men often appear to be simple and are easily practised upon by the dishonest because they have no examples of what evil is in their own souls 
 yes he said they are far too apt to be deceived 
 therefore i said the judge should not be young he should have learned to know evil not from his own soul but from late and long observation of the nature of evil in others knowledge should be his guide not personal experience 
 yes he said that is the ideal of a judge 
 yes i replied and he will be a good man which is my answer to your question for he is good who has a good soul but the cunning and suspicious nature of which we spoke he who has committed many crimes and fancies himself to be a master in wickedness when he is amongst his fellows is wonderful in the precautions which he takes because he judges of them by himself but when he gets into the company of men of virtue who have the experience of age he appears to be a fool again owing to his unseasonable suspicions he cannot recognise an honest man because he has no pattern of honesty in himself at the same time as the bad are more numerous than the good and he meets with them oftener he thinks himself and is by others thought to be rather wise than foolish 
 most true he said 
 then the good and wise judge whom we are seeking is not this man but the other for vice cannot know virtue too but a virtuous nature educated by time will acquire a knowledge both of virtue and vice the virtuous and not the vicious man has wisdom in my opinion 
 and in mine also 
 this is the sort of medicine and this is the sort of law which you sanction in your state they will minister to better natures giving health both of soul and of body but those who are diseased in their bodies they will leave to die and the corrupt and incurable souls they will put an end to themselves 
 that is clearly the best thing both for the patients and for the state 
 and thus our youth having been educated only in that simple music which as we said inspires temperance will be reluctant to go to law 
 clearly 
 and the musician who keeping to the same track is content to practise the simple gymnastic will have nothing to do with medicine unless in some extreme case 
 that i quite believe 
 the very exercises and tolls which he undergoes are intended to stimulate the spirited element of his nature and not to increase his strength he will not like common athletes use exercise and regimen to develop his muscles 
 very right he said 
 neither are the two arts of music and gymnastic really designed as is often supposed the one for the training of the soul the other fir the training of the body 
 what then is the real object of them 
 i believe i said that the teachers of both have in view chiefly the improvement of the soul 
 how can that be he asked 
 did you never observe i said the effect on the mind itself of exclusive devotion to gymnastic or the opposite effect of an exclusive devotion to music 
 in what way shown he said 
 the one producing a temper of hardness and ferocity the other of softness and effeminacy i replied 
 yes he said i am quite aware that the mere athlete becomes too much of a savage and that the mere musician is melted and softened beyond what is good for him 
 yet surely i said this ferocity only comes from spirit which if rightly educated would give courage but if too much intensified is liable to become hard and brutal 
 that i quite think 
 on the other hand the philosopher will have the quality of gentleness and this also when too much indulged will turn to softness but if educated rightly will be gentle and moderate 
 true 
 and in our opinion the guardians ought to have both these qualities 
 assuredly 
 and both should be in harmony 
 beyond question 
 and the harmonious soul is both temperate and courageous 
 yes 
 and the inharmonious is cowardly and boorish 
 very true 
 and when a man allows music to play upon him and to pour into his soul through the funnel of his ears those sweet and soft and melancholy airs of which we were just now speaking and his whole life is passed in warbling and the delights of song in the first stage of the process the passion or spirit which is in him is tempered like iron and made useful instead of brittle and useless but if he carries on the softening and soothing process in the next stage he begins to melt and waste until he has wasted away his spirit and cut out the sinews of his soul and he becomes a feeble warrior 
 very true 
 if the element of spirit is naturally weak in him the change is speedily accomplished but if he have a good deal then the power of music weakening the spirit renders him excitable on the least provocation he flames up at once and is speedily extinguished instead of having spirit he grows irritable and passionate and is quite impracticable 
 exactly 
 and so in gymnastics if a man takes violent exercise and is a great feeder and the reverse of a great student of music and philosophy at first the high condition of his body fills him with pride and spirit and lie becomes twice the man that he was 
 certainly 
 and what happens if he do nothing else and holds no verse with the muses does not even that intelligence which there may be in him having no taste of any sort of learning or enquiry or thought or culture grow feeble and dull and blind his mind never waking up or receiving nourishment and his senses not being purged of their mists 
 true he said 
 and he ends by becoming a hater of philosophy uncivilized never using the weapon of persuasion he is like a wild beast all violence and fierceness and knows no other way of dealing and he lives in all ignorance and evil conditions and has no sense of propriety and grace 
 that is quite true he said 
 and as there are two principles of human nature one the spirited and the other the philosophical some god as i should say has given mankind two arts answering to them and only indirectly to the soul and body in order that these two principles like the strings of an instrument may be relaxed or drawn tighter until they are duly harmonised 
 that appears to be the intention 
 and he who mingles music with gymnastic in the fairest proportions and best attempers them to the soul may be rightly called the true musician and harmonist in a far higher sense than the tuner of the strings 
 you are quite right socrates 
 and such a presiding genius will be always required in our state if the government is to last 
 yes he will be absolutely necessary 
 such then are our principles of nurture and education where would be the use of going into further details about the dances of our citizens or about their hunting and coursing their gymnastic and equestrian contests for these all follow the general principle and having found that we shall have no difficulty in discovering them 
 i dare say that there will be no difficulty 
 very good i said then what is the next question must we not ask who are to be rulers and who subjects 
 certainly 
 there can be no doubt that the elder must rule the younger 
 clearly 
 and that the best of these must rule 
 that is also clear 
 now are not the best husbandmen those who are most devoted to husbandry 
 yes 
 and as we are to have the best of guardians for our city must they not be those who have most the character of guardians 
 yes 
 and to this end they ought to be wise and efficient and to have a special care of the state 
 true 
 and a man will be most likely to care about that which he loves 
 to be sure 
 and he will be most likely to love that which he regards as having the same interests with himself and that of which the good or evil fortune is supposed by him at any time most to affect his own 
 very true he replied 
 then there must be a selection let us note among the guardians those who in their whole life show the greatest eagerness to do what is for the good of their country and the greatest repugnance to do what is against her interests 
 those are the right men 
 and they will have to be watched at every age in order that we may see whether they preserve their resolution and never under the influence either of force or enchantment forget or cast off their sense of duty to the state 
 how cast off he said 
 i will explain to you i replied a resolution may go out of a mind either with his will or against his will with his will when he gets rid of a falsehood and learns better against his will whenever he is deprived of a truth 
 i understand he said the willing loss of a resolution the meaning of the unwilling i have yet to learn 
 why i said do you not see that men are unwillingly deprived of good and willingly of evil is not to have lost the truth an evil and to possess the truth a good and you would agree that to conceive things as they are is to possess the truth 
 yes he replied i agree with you in thinking that mankind are deprived of truth against their will 
 and is not this involuntary deprivation caused either by theft or force or enchantment 
 still he replied i do not understand you 
 i fear that i must have been talking darkly like the tragedians i only mean that some men are changed by persuasion and that others forget argument steals away the hearts of one class and time of the other and this i call theft now you understand me 
 yes 
 those again who are forced are those whom the violence of some pain or grief compels to change their opinion 
 i understand he said and you are quite right 
 and you would also acknowledge that the enchanted are those who change their minds either under the softer influence of pleasure or the sterner influence of fear 
 yes he said everything that deceives may be said to enchant 
 therefore as i was just now saying we must enquire who are the best guardians of their own conviction that what they think the interest of the state is to be the rule of their lives we must watch them from their youth upwards and make them perform actions in which they are most likely to forget or to be deceived and he who remembers and is not deceived is to be selected and he who falls in the trial is to be rejected that will be the way 
 yes 
 and there should also be toils and pains and conflicts prescribed for them in which they will be made to give further proof of the same qualities 
 very right he replied 
 and then i said we must try them with enchantments that is the third sort of test and see what will be their behaviour like those who take colts amid noise and tumult to see if they are of a timid nature so must we take our youth amid terrors of some kind and again pass them into pleasures and prove them more thoroughly than gold is proved in the furnace that we may discover whether they are armed against all enchantments and of a noble bearing always good guardians of themselves and of the music which they have learned and retaining under all circumstances a rhythmical and harmonious nature such as will be most serviceable to the individual and to the state and he who at every age as boy and youth and in mature life has come out of the trial victorious and pure shall be appointed a ruler and guardian of the state he shall be honoured in life and death and shall receive sepulture and other memorials of honour the greatest that we have to give but him who fails we must reject i am inclined to think that this is the sort of way in which our rulers and guardians should be chosen and appointed i speak generally and not with any pretension to exactness 
 and speaking generally i agree with you he said 
 and perhaps the word guardian in the fullest sense ought to be applied to this higher class only who preserve us against foreign enemies and maintain peace among our citizens at home that the one may not have the will or the others the power to harm us the young men whom we before called guardians may be more properly designated auxiliaries and supporters of the principles of the rulers 
 i agree with you he said 
 how then may we devise one of those needful falsehoods of which we lately spoke just one royal lie which may deceive the rulers if that be possible and at any rate the rest of the city 
 what sort of lie he said 
 nothing new i replied only an old phoenician tale of what has often occurred before now in other places as the poets say and have made the world believe though not in our time and i do not know whether such an event could ever happen again or could now even be made probable if it did 
 how your words seem to hesitate on your lips 
 you will not wonder i replied at my hesitation when you have heard 
 speak he said and fear not 
 well then i will speak although i really know not how to look you in the face or in what words to utter the audacious fiction which i propose to communicate gradually first to the rulers then to the soldiers and lastly to the people they are to be told that their youth was a dream and the education and training which they received from us an appearance only in reality during all that time they were being formed and fed in the womb of the earth where they themselves and their arms and appurtenances were manufactured when they were completed the earth their mother sent them up and so their country being their mother and also their nurse they are bound to advise for her good and to defend her against attacks and her citizens they are to regard as children of the earth and their own brothers 
 you had good reason he said to be ashamed of the lie which you were going to tell 
 true i replied but there is more coming i have only told you half citizens we shall say to them in our tale you are brothers yet god has framed you differently some of you have the power of command and in the composition of these he has mingled gold wherefore also they have the greatest honour others he has made of silver to be auxillaries others again who are to be husbandmen and craftsmen he has composed of brass and iron and the species will generally be preserved in the children but as all are of the same original stock a golden parent will sometimes have a silver son or a silver parent a golden son and god proclaims as a first principle to the rulers and above all else that there is nothing which should so anxiously guard or of which they are to be such good guardians as of the purity of the race they should observe what elements mingle in their off spring for if the son of a golden or silver parent has an admixture of brass and iron then nature orders a transposition of ranks and the eye of the ruler must not be pitiful towards the child because he has to descend in the scale and become a husbandman or artisan just as there may be sons of artisans who having an admixture of gold or silver in them are raised to honour and become guardians or auxiliaries for an oracle says that when a man of brass or iron guards the state it will be destroyed such is the tale is there any possibility of making our citizens believe in it 
 not in the present generation he replied there is no way of accomplishing this but their sons may be made to believe in the tale and their sons sons and posterity after them 
 i see the difficulty i replied yet the fostering of such a belief will make them care more for the city and for one another enough however of the fiction which may now fly abroad upon the wings of rumour while we arm our heroes and lead them forth under the command of their rulers let them look round and select a spot whence they can best suppress insurrection if any prove refractory within and also defend themselves against enemies who like wolves may come down on the fold from without there let them encamp and when they have encamped let them sacrifice to the proper gods and prepare their dwellings 
 just so he said 
 and their dwellings must be such as will shield them against the cold of winter and the heat of summer 
 i suppose that you mean houses he replied 
 yes i said but they must be the houses of soldiers and not of 
 what is the difference he said 
 that i will endeavour to explain i replied to keep watchdogs who from want of discipline or hunger or some evil habit or evil habit or other would turn upon the sheep and worry them and behave not like dogs but wolves would be a foul and monstrous thing in a shepherd 
 truly monstrous he said 
 and therefore every care must be taken that our auxiliaries being stronger than our citizens may not grow to be too much for them and become savage tyrants instead of friends and allies 
 yes great care should be taken 
 and would not a really good education furnish the best safeguard 
 but they are already he replied 
 i cannot be so confident my dear glaucon i said i am much certain that they ought to be and that true education whatever that may be will have the greatest tendency to civilize and humanize them in their relations to one another and to those who are under their protection 
 very true he replied 
 and not only their education but their habitations and all that belongs to them should be such as will neither impair their virtue as guardians nor tempt them to prey upon the other citizens any man of sense must acknowledge that 
 he must 
 then let us consider what will be their way of life if they are to realize our idea of them in the first place none of them should have any property of his own beyond what is absolutely necessary neither should they have a private house or store closed against any one who has a mind to enter their provisions should be only such as are required by trained warriors who are men of temperance and courage they should agree to receive from the citizens a fixed rate of pay enough to meet the expenses of the year and no more and they will go and live together like soldiers in a camp gold and silver we will tell them that they have from god the diviner metal is within them and they have therefore no need of the dross which is current among men and ought not to pollute the divine by any such earthly admixture for that commoner metal has been the source of many unholy deeds but their own is undefiled and they alone of all the citizens may not touch or handle silver or gold or be under the same roof with them or wear them or drink from them and this will be their salvation and they will be the saviours of the state but should they ever acquire homes or lands or moneys of their own they will become housekeepers and husbandmen instead of guardians enemies and tyrants instead of allies of the other citizens hating and being hated plotting and being plotted against they will pass their whole life in much greater terror of internal than of external enemies and the hour of ruin both to themselves and to the rest of the state will be at hand for all which reasons may we not say that thus shall our state be ordered and that these shall be the regulations appointed by us for guardians concerning their houses and all other matters other 
 yes said glaucon

 such then i said are our principles of theology some tales are to be told and others are not to be told to our disciples from their youth upwards if we mean them to honour the gods and their parents and to value friendship with one another 
 yes and i think that our principles are right he said 
 but if they are to be courageous must they not learn other lessons besides these and lessons of such a kind as will take away the fear of death can any man be courageous who has the fear of death in him 
 certainly not he said 
 and can he be fearless of death or will he choose death in battle rather than defeat and slavery who believes the world below to be real and terrible 
 impossible 
 then we must assume a control over the narrators of this class of tales as well as over the others and beg them not simply to but rather to commend the world below intimating to them that their descriptions are untrue and will do harm to our future warriors 
 that will be our duty he said 
 then i said we shall have to obliterate many obnoxious passages beginning with the verses 
 i would rather he a serf on the land of a poor and portionless man than rule over all the dead who have come to nought we must also expunge the verse which tells us how pluto feared 
 lest the mansions grim and squalid which the gods abhor should he seen both of mortals and immortals and again 
 o heavens verily in the house of hades there is soul and ghostly form but no mind at all again of tiresias 
 to him even after death did persephone grant mind that he alone should be wise but the other souls are flitting shades again 
 the soul flying from the limbs had gone to hades lamentng her fate leaving manhood and youth again 
 and the soul with shrilling cry passed like smoke beneath the earth and 
 as bats in hollow of mystic cavern whenever any of the has dropped out of the string and falls from the rock fly shrilling and cling to one another so did they with shrilling cry hold together as they moved and we must beg homer and the other poets not to be angry if we strike out these and similar passages not because they are unpoetical or unattractive to the popular ear but because the greater the poetical charm of them the less are they meet for the ears of boys and men who are meant to be free and who should fear slavery more than death 
 undoubtedly 
 also we shall have to reject all the terrible and appalling names describe the world below cocytus and styx ghosts under the earth and sapless shades and any similar words of which the very mention causes a shudder to pass through the inmost soul of him who hears them i do not say that these horrible stories may not have a use of some kind but there is a danger that the nerves of our guardians may be rendered too excitable and effeminate by them 
 there is a real danger he said 
 then we must have no more of them 
 true 
 another and a nobler strain must be composed and sung by us 
 clearly 
 and shall we proceed to get rid of the weepings and wailings of famous men 
 they will go with the rest 
 but shall we be right in getting rid of them reflect our principle is that the good man will not consider death terrible to any other good man who is his comrade 
 yes that is our principle 
 and therefore he will not sorrow for his departed friend as though he had suffered anything terrible 
 he will not 
 such an one as we further maintain is sufficient for himself and his own happiness and therefore is least in need of other men 
 true he said 
 and for this reason the loss of a son or brother or the deprivation of fortune is to him of all men least terrible 
 assuredly 
 and therefore he will be least likely to lament and will bear with the greatest equanimity any misfortune of this sort which may befall him 
 yes he will feel such a misfortune far less than another 
 then we shall be right in getting rid of the lamentations of famous men and making them over to women and not even to women who are good for anything or to men of a baser sort that those who are being educated by us to be the defenders of their country may scorn to do the like 
 that will be very right 
 then we will once more entreat homer and the other poets not to depict achilles who is the son of a goddess first lying on his side then on his back and then on his face then starting up and sailing in a frenzy along the shores of the barren sea now taking the sooty ashes in both his hands and pouring them over his head or weeping and wailing in the various modes which homer has delineated nor should he describe priam the kinsman of the gods as praying and beseeching 
 rolling in the dirt calling each man loudly by his name still more earnestly will we beg of him at all events not to introduce the gods lamenting and saying 
 alas my misery alas that i bore the harvest to my sorrow but if he must introduce the gods at any rate let him not dare so completely to misrepresent the greatest of the gods as to make him say 
 o heavens with my eyes verily i behold a dear friend of mine chased round and round the city and my heart is sorrowful or again 
 woe is me that i am fated to have sarpedon dearest of men to me subdued at the hands of patroclus the son of menoetius for if my sweet adeimantus our youth seriously listen to such unworthy representations of the gods instead of laughing at them as they ought hardly will any of them deem that he himself being but a man can be dishonoured by similar actions neither will he rebuke any inclination which may arise in his mind to say and do the like and instead of having any shame or he will be always whining and lamenting on slight occasions 
 yes he said that is most true 
 yes i replied but that surely is what ought not to be as the argument has just proved to us and by that proof we must abide until it is disproved by a better 
 it ought not to be 
 neither ought our guardians to be given to laughter for a fit of laughter which has been indulged to excess almost always produces a violent reaction 
 so i believe 
 then persons of worth even if only mortal men must not be represented as overcome by laughter and still less must such a representation of the gods be allowed 
 still less of the gods as you say he replied 
 then we shall not suffer such an expression to be used about the gods as that of homer when he describes how 
 inextinguishable laughter arose among the blessed gods when they saw hephaestus bustling about the mansion on your views we must not admit them 
 on my views if you like to father them on me that we must not admit them is certain 
 again truth should be highly valued if as we were saying a lie is useless to the gods and useful only as a medicine to men then the use of such medicines should be restricted to physicians private individuals have no business with them 
 clearly not he said 
 then if any one at all is to have the privilege of lying the rulers of the state should be the persons and they in their dealings either with enemies or with their own citizens may be allowed to lie for the public good but nobody else should meddle with anything of the kind and although the rulers have this privilege for a private man to lie to them in return is to be deemed a more heinous fault than for the patient or the pupil of a gymnasium not to speak the truth about his own bodily illnesses to the physician or to the trainer or for a sailor not to tell the captain what is happening about the ship and the rest of the crew and how things are going with himself or his fellow sailors 
 most true he said 
 if then the ruler catches anybody beside himself lying in the state 
 any of the craftsmen whether he priest or physician or carpenter he will punish him for introducing a practice which is equally subversive and destructive of ship or state 
 most certainly he said if our idea of the state is ever carried out 
 in the next place our youth must be temperate 
 certainly 
 are not the chief elements of temperance speaking generally obedience to commanders and in sensual pleasures 
 true 
 then we shall approve such language as that of diomede in homer 
 friend sit still and obey my word and the verses which follow 
 the greeks marched breathing prowess 
 in silent awe of their leaders and other sentiments of the same kind 
 we shall 
 what of this line 
 o heavy with wine who hast the eyes of a dog and the heart of a stag and of the words which follow would you say that these or any similar impertinences which private individuals are supposed to address to their rulers whether in verse or prose are well or ill spoken 
 they are ill spoken 
 they may very possibly afford some amusement but they do not conduce to temperance and therefore they are likely to do harm to our young men you would agree with me there 
 yes 
 and then again to make the wisest of men say that nothing in his opinion is more glorious than 
 when the tables are full of bread and meat and the carries round wine which he draws from the bowl and pours into the cups is it fit or conducive to temperance for a young man to hear such words or the verse 
 the saddest of fates is to die and meet destiny from hunger what would you say again to the tale of zeus who while other gods and men were asleep and he the only person awake lay devising plans but forgot them all in a moment through his lust and was so completely overcome at the sight of here that he would not even go into the hut but wanted to lie with her on the ground declaring that he had never been in such a state of rapture before even when they first met one another 
 without the knowledge of their parents or that other tale of how hephaestus because of similar goings on cast a chain around ares and aphrodite 
 indeed he said i am strongly of opinion that they ought not to hear that sort of thing 
 but any deeds of endurance which are done or told by famous men these they ought to see and hear as for example what is said in the verses 
 he smote his breast and thus reproached his heart 
 endure my heart far worse hast thou endured 
 certainly he said 
 in the next place we must not let them be receivers of gifts or lovers of money 
 certainly not 
 neither must we sing to them of 
 gifts persuading gods and persuading reverend kings neither is phoenix the tutor of achilles to be approved or deemed to have given his pupil good counsel when he told him that he should take the gifts of the greeks and assist them but that without a gift he should not lay aside his anger neither will we believe or acknowledge achilles himself to have been such a lover of money that he took or that when he had received payment he restored the dead body of hector but that without payment he was unwilling to do so 
 undoubtedly he said these are not sentiments which can be approved 
 loving homer as i do i hardly like to say that in attributing these feelings to achilles or in believing that they are truly to him he is guilty of downright impiety as little can i believe the narrative of his insolence to apollo where he says 
 thou hast wronged me o most abominable of deities verily i would he even with thee if i had only the power or his insubordination to the on whose divinity he is ready to lay hands or his offering to the dead patroclus of his own hair which had been previously dedicated to the other spercheius and that he actually performed this vow or that he dragged hector round the tomb of patroclus and slaughtered the captives at the pyre of all this i cannot believe that he was guilty any more than i can allow our citizens to believe that he the wise pupil the son of a goddess and of peleus who was the gentlest of men and third in descent from zeus was so disordered in his wits as to be at one time the slave of two seemingly inconsistent passions meanness not untainted by avarice combined with overweening contempt of gods and men 
 you are quite right he replied 
 and let us equally refuse to believe or allow to be repeated the tale of theseus son of poseidon or of peirithous son of zeus going forth as they did to perpetrate a horrid rape or of any other hero or son of a god daring to do such impious and dreadful things as they falsely ascribe to them in our day and let us further compel the poets to declare either that these acts were not done by them or that they were not the sons of gods both in the same breath they shall not be permitted to affirm we will not have them trying to persuade our youth that the gods are the authors of evil and that heroes are no better than which as we were saying are neither pious nor true for we have already proved that evil cannot come from the gods 
 assuredly not 
 and further they are likely to have a bad effect on those who hear them for everybody will begin to excuse his own vices when he is convinced that similar wickednesses are always being perpetrated by 
 the kindred of the gods the relatives of zeus whose ancestral altar the attar of zeus is aloft in air on the peak of ida and who have 
 the blood of deities yet flowing in their veins and therefore let us put an end to such tales lest they engender laxity of morals among the young 
 by all means he replied 
 but now that we are determining what classes of subjects are or are not to be spoken of let us see whether any have been omitted by us the manner in which gods and demigods and heroes and the world below should be treated has been already laid down 
 very true 
 and what shall we say about men that is clearly the remaining portion of our subject 
 clearly so 
 but we are not in a condition to answer this question at present my friend 
 why not 
 because if i am not mistaken we shall have to say that about men poets and are guilty of making the gravest misstatements when they tell us that wicked men are often happy and the good miserable and that injustice is profitable when undetected but that justice is a own loss and gain these things we shall forbid them to utter and command them to sing and say the opposite 
 to be sure we shall he replied 
 but if you admit that i am right in this then i shall maintain that you have implied the principle for which we have been all along contending 
 i grant the truth of your inference 
 that such things are or are not to be said about men is a question which we cannot determine until we have discovered what justice is and how naturally advantageous to the possessor whether he seems to be just or not 
 most true he said 
 enough of the subjects of poetry let us now speak of the style and when this has been considered both matter and manner will have been completely treated 
 i do not understand what you mean said adeimantus 
 then i must make you understand and perhaps i may be more intelligible if i put the matter in this way you are aware i suppose that all mythology and poetry is a narration of events either past present or to come 
 certainly he replied 
 and narration may be either simple narration or imitation or a union of the two 
 that again he said i do not quite understand 
 i fear that i must be a ridiculous teacher when i have so much difficulty in making myself apprehended like a bad speaker therefore i will not take the whole of the subject but will break a piece off in illustration of my meaning you know the first lines of the iliad in which the poet says that chryses prayed agamemnon to release his daughter and that agamemnon flew into a passion with him whereupon chryses failing of his object invoked the anger of the god against the achaeans now as far as these lines 
 and he prayed all the greeks but especially the two sons of atreus the chiefs of the people the poet is speaking in his own person he never leads us to suppose that he is any one else but in what follows he takes the person of chryses and then he does all that he can to make us believe that the speaker is not homer but the aged priest himself and in this double form he has cast the entire narrative of the events which occurred at troy and in ithaca and throughout the odyssey 
 yes 
 and a narrative it remains both in the speeches which the poet recites from time to time and in the intermediate passages 
 quite true 
 but when the poet speaks in the person of another may we not say that he assimilates his style to that of the person who as he informs you is going to speak 
 certainly 
 and this assimilation of himself to another either by the use of voice or gesture is the imitation of the person whose character he assumes 
 of course 
 then in this case the narrative of the poet may be said to proceed by way of imitation 
 very true 
 or if the poet everywhere appears and never conceals himself then again the imitation is dropped and his poetry becomes simple narration however in order that i may make my meaning quite clear and that you may no more say i understand i will show how the change might be effected if homer had said the priest came having his ransom in his hands supplicating the achaeans and above all the kings and then if instead of speaking in the person of chryses he had continued in his own person the words would have been not imitation but simple narration the passage would have run as follows i am no poet and therefore i drop the metre the priest came and prayed the gods on behalf of the greeks that they might capture troy and return safely home but begged that they would give him back his daughter and take the ransom which he brought and respect the god thus he spoke and the other greeks revered the priest and assented but agamemnon was wroth and bade him depart and not come again lest the staff and chaplets of the god should be of no avail to him the daughter of chryses should not be released he said she should grow old with him in argos and then he told him to go away and not to provoke him if he intended to get home unscathed and the old man went away in fear and silence and when he had left the camp he called upon apollo by his many names reminding him of everything which he had done pleasing to him whether in building his temples or in offering sacrifice and praying that his good deeds might be returned to him and that the achaeans might expiate his tears by the arrows of the god and so on in this way the whole becomes simple narrative 
 i understand he said 
 or you may suppose the opposite case that the intermediate passages are omitted and the dialogue only left 
 that also he said i understand you mean for example as in tragedy 
 you have conceived my meaning perfectly and if i mistake not what you failed to apprehend before is now made clear to you that poetry and mythology are in some cases wholly imitative instances of this are supplied by tragedy and comedy there is likewise the opposite style in which the my poet is the only speaker of this the dithyramb affords the best example and the combination of both is found in epic and in several other styles of poetry do i take you with me 
 yes he said i see now what you meant 
 i will ask you to remember also what i began by saying that we had done with the subject and might proceed to the style 
 yes i remember 
 in saying this i intended to imply that we must come to an understanding about the mimetic art whether the poets in narrating their stories are to be allowed by us to imitate and if so whether in whole or in part and if the latter in what parts or should all imitation be prohibited 
 you mean i suspect to ask whether tragedy and comedy shall be admitted into our state 
 yes i said but there may be more than this in question i really do not know as yet but whither the argument may blow thither we go 
 and go we will he said 
 then adeimantus let me ask you whether our guardians ought to be imitators or rather has not this question been decided by the rule already laid down that one man can only do one thing well and not many and that if he attempt many he will altogether fall of gaining much reputation in any 
 certainly 
 and this is equally true of imitation no one man can imitate many things as well as he would imitate a single one 
 he cannot 
 then the same person will hardly be able to play a serious part in life and at the same time to be an imitator and imitate many other parts as well for even when two species of imitation are nearly allied the same persons cannot succeed in both as for example the writers of tragedy and comedy did you not just now call them imitations 
 yes i did and you are right in thinking that the same persons cannot succeed in both 
 any more than they can be rhapsodists and actors at once 
 true 
 neither are comic and tragic actors the same yet all these things are but imitations 
 they are so 
 and human nature adeimantus appears to have been coined into yet smaller pieces and to be as incapable of imitating many things well as of performing well the actions of which the imitations are copies 
 quite true he replied 
 if then we adhere to our original notion and bear in mind that our guardians setting aside every other business are to dedicate themselves wholly to the maintenance of freedom in the state making this their craft and engaging in no work which does not bear on this end they ought not to practise or imitate anything else if they imitate at all they should imitate from youth upward only those characters which are suitable to their profession the courageous temperate holy free and the like but they should not depict or be skilful at imitating any kind of illiberality or baseness lest from imitation they should come to be what they imitate did you never observe how imitations beginning in early youth and continuing far into life at length grow into habits and become a second nature affecting body voice and mind 
 yes certainly he said 
 then i said we will not allow those for whom we profess a care and of whom we say that they ought to be good men to imitate a woman whether young or old quarrelling with her husband or striving and vaunting against the gods in conceit of her happiness or when she is in affliction or sorrow or weeping and certainly not one who is in sickness love or labour 
 very right he said 
 neither must they represent slaves male or female performing the offices of slaves 
 they must not 
 and surely not bad men whether cowards or any others who do the reverse of what we have just been prescribing who scold or mock or revile one another in drink or out of in drink or or who in any other manner sin against themselves and their neighbours in word or deed as the manner of such is neither should they be trained to imitate the action or speech of men or women who are mad or bad for madness like vice is to be known but not to be practised or imitated 
 very true he replied 
 neither may they imitate smiths or other artificers or oarsmen or boatswains or the like 
 how can they he said when they are not allowed to apply their minds to the callings of any of these 
 nor may they imitate the neighing of horses the bellowing of bulls the murmur of rivers and roll of the ocean thunder and all that sort of thing 
 nay he said if madness be forbidden neither may they copy the behaviour of madmen 
 you mean i said if i understand you aright that there is one sort of narrative style which may be employed by a truly good man when he has anything to say and that another sort will be used by a man of an opposite character and education 
 and which are these two sorts he asked 
 suppose i answered that a just and good man in the course of a narration comes on some saying or action of another good man i should imagine that he will like to personate him and will not be ashamed of this sort of imitation he will be most ready to play the part of the good man when he is acting firmly and wisely in a less degree when he is overtaken by illness or love or drink or has met with any other disaster but when he comes to a character which is unworthy of him he will not make a study of that he will disdain such a person and will assume his likeness if at all for a moment only when he is performing some good action at other times he will be ashamed to play a part which he has never practised nor will he like to fashion and frame himself after the baser models he feels the employment of such an art unless in jest to be beneath him and his mind revolts at it 
 so i should expect he replied 
 then he will adopt a mode of narration such as we have illustrated out of homer that is to say his style will be both imitative and narrative but there will be very little of the former and a great deal of the latter do you agree 
 certainly he said that is the model which such a speaker must necessarily take 
 but there is another sort of character who will narrate anything and the worse lie is the more unscrupulous he will be nothing will be too bad for him and he will be ready to imitate anything not as a joke but in right good earnest and before a large company as i was just now saying he will attempt to represent the roll of thunder the noise of wind and hall or the creaking of wheels and pulleys and the various sounds of flutes pipes trumpets and all sorts of instruments he will bark like a dog bleat like a sheep or crow like a cock his entire art will consist in imitation of voice and gesture and there will be very little narration 
 that he said will be his mode of speaking 
 these then are the two kinds of style 
 yes 
 and you would agree with me in saying that one of them is simple and has but slight changes and if the harmony and rhythm are also chosen for their simplicity the result is that the speaker if hc speaks correctly is always pretty much the same in style and he will keep within the limits of a single harmony for the changes are not great and in like manner he will make use of nearly the same rhythm 
 that is quite true he said 
 whereas the other requires all sorts of harmonies and all sorts of rhythms if the music and the style are to correspond because the style has all sorts of changes 
 that is also perfectly true he replied 
 and do not the two styles or the mixture of the two comprehend all poetry and every form of expression in words no one can say anything except in one or other of them or in both together 
 they include all he said 
 and shall we receive into our state all the three styles or one only of the two unmixed styles or would you include the mixed 
 i should prefer only to admit the pure imitator of virtue 
 yes i said adeimantus but the mixed style is also very charming and indeed the pantomimic which is the opposite of the one chosen by you is the most popular style with children and their attendants and with the world in general 
 i do not deny it 
 but i suppose you would argue that such a style is unsuitable to our state in which human nature is not twofold or manifold for one man plays one part only 
 yes quite unsuitable 
 and this is the reason why in our state and in our state only we shall find a shoemaker to be a shoemaker and not a pilot also and a husbandman to be a husbandman and not a dicast also and a soldier a soldier and not a trader also and the same throughout 
 true he said 
 and therefore when any one of these pantomimic gentlemen who are so clever that they can imitate anything comes to us and makes a proposal to exhibit himself and his poetry we will fall down and worship him as a sweet and holy and wonderful being but we must also inform him that in our state such as he are not permitted to exist the law will not allow them and so when we have anointed him with myrrh and set a garland of wool upon his head we shall send him away to another city for we mean to employ for our souls health the rougher and severer poet or who will imitate the style of the virtuous only and will follow those models which we prescribed at first when we began the education of our soldiers 
 we certainly will he said if we have the power 
 then now my friend i said that part of music or literary education which relates to the story or myth may be considered to be finished for the matter and manner have both been discussed 
 i think so too he said 
 next in order will follow melody and song 
 that is obvious 
 every one can see already what we ought to say about them if we are to be consistent with ourselves 
 socrates glaucon 
 i fear said glaucon laughing that the words every one hardly includes me for i cannot at the moment say what they should be though i may guess 
 at any rate you can tell that a song or ode has three parts the words the melody and the rhythm that degree of knowledge i may presuppose 
 yes he said so much as that you may 
 and as for the words there surely be no difference words between words which are and which are not set to music both will conform to the same laws and these have been already determined by us 
 yes 
 and the melody and rhythm will depend upon the words 
 certainly 
 we were saying when we spoke of the that we had no need of lamentations and strains of sorrow 
 true 
 and which are the harmonies expressive of sorrow you are musical and can tell me 
 the harmonies which you mean are the mixed or tenor lydian and the or bass lydian and such like 
 these then i said must be banished even to women who have a character to maintain they are of no use and much less to men certainly 
 in the next place drunkenness and softness and indolence are utterly unbecoming the character of our guardians 
 utterly unbecoming 
 and which are the soft or drinking harmonies 
 the ionian he replied and the lydian they are termed relaxed 
 well and are these of any military use 
 quite the reverse he replied and if so the dorian and the phrygian are the only ones which you have left 
 i answered of the harmonies i know nothing but i want to have one warlike to sound the note or accent which a brave man utters in the hour of danger and stern resolve or when his cause is failing and he is going to wounds or death or is overtaken by some other evil and at every such crisis meets the blows of fortune with firm step and a determination to endure and another to be used by him in times of peace and freedom of action when there is no pressure of necessity and he is seeking to persuade god by prayer or man by instruction and admonition or on the other hand when he is expressing his willingness to yield to persuasion or entreaty or admonition and which represents him when by prudent conduct he has attained his end not carried away by his success but acting moderately and wisely under the circumstances and acquiescing in the event these two harmonies i ask you to leave the strain of necessity and the strain of freedom the strain of the unfortunate and the strain of the fortunate the strain of courage and the strain of temperance these i say leave 
 and these he replied are the dorian and phrygian harmonies of which i was just now speaking 
 then i said if these and these only are to be used in our songs and melodies we shall not want multiplicity of notes or a panharmonic scale 
 i suppose not 
 then we shall not maintain the artificers of lyres with three corners and complex scales or the makers of any other instruments 
 certainly not 
 but what do you say to and would you admit them into our state when you reflect that in this composite use of harmony the flute is worse than all the stringed instruments put together even the panharmonic music is only an imitation of the flute 
 clearly not 
 there remain then only the lyre and the harp for use in the city and the shepherds may have a pipe in the country 
 that is surely the conclusion to be drawn from the argument 
 the preferring of apollo and his instruments to marsyas and his instruments is not at all strange i said 
 not at all he replied 
 and so by the dog of egypt we have been unconsciously purging the state which not long ago we termed luxurious 
 and we have done wisely he replied 
 then let us now finish the purgation i said next in order to harmonies rhythms will naturally follow and they should be subject to the same rules for we ought not to seek out complex systems of metre or metres of every kind but rather to discover what rhythms are the expressions of a courageous and harmonious life and when we have found them we shall adapt the foot and the melody to words having a like spirit not the words to the foot and melody to say what these rhythms are will be your duty you must teach me them as you have already taught me the harmonies 
 but indeed he replied i cannot tell you i only know that there are some three principles of rhythm out of which metrical systems are framed just as in sounds there are four notes out of which all the harmonies are composed that is an observation which i have made but of what sort of lives they are severally the imitations i am unable to say 
 then i said we must take damon into our counsels and he will tell us what rhythms are expressive of meanness or insolence or fury or other unworthiness and what are to be reserved for the expression of opposite feelings and i think that i have an indistinct recollection of his mentioning a complex cretic rhythm also a dactylic or heroic and he arranged them in some manner which i do not quite understand making the rhythms equal in the rise and fall of the foot long and short alternating and unless i am mistaken he spoke of an iambic as well as of a trochaic rhythm and assigned to them short and long quantities also in some cases he appeared to praise or censure the movement of the foot quite as much as the rhythm or perhaps a combination of the two for i am not certain what he meant these matters however as i was saying had better be referred to damon himself for the analysis of the subject would be difficult you know 
 rather so i should say 
 but there is no difficulty in seeing that grace or the absence of grace is an effect of good or bad rhythm 
 none at all 
 and also that good and bad rhythm naturally assimilate to a good and bad style and that harmony and discord in like manner follow style for our principle is that rhythm and harmony are regulated by the words and not the words by them 
 just so he said they should follow the words 
 and will not the words and the character of the style depend on the temper of the soul 
 yes 
 and everything else on the style 
 yes 
 then beauty of style and harmony and grace and good rhythm depend on simplicity i mean the true simplicity of a rightly and nobly ordered mind and character not that other simplicity which is only an euphemism for folly 
 very true he replied 
 and if our youth are to do their work in life must they not make these graces and harmonies their perpetual aim 
 they must 
 and surely the art of the painter and every other creative and constructive art are full of them weaving embroidery architecture and every kind of manufacture also nature animal and vegetable in all of them there is grace or the absence of grace and ugliness and discord and inharmonious motion are nearly allied to ill words and ill nature as grace and harmony are the twin sisters of goodness and virtue and bear their likeness 
 that is quite true he said 
 but shall our superintendence go no further and are the poets only to be required by us to express the image of the good in their works on pain if they do anything else of expulsion from our state or is the same control to be extended to other artists and are they also to be prohibited from exhibiting the opposite forms of vice and intemperance and meanness and indecency in sculpture and building and the other creative arts and is he who cannot conform to this rule of ours to be prevented from practising his art in our state lest the taste of our citizens be corrupted by him we would not have our guardians grow up amid images of moral deformity as in some noxious pasture and there browse and feed upon many a baneful herb and flower day by day little by little until they silently gather a festering mass of corruption in their own soul let our artists rather be those who are gifted to discern the true nature of the beautiful and graceful then will our youth dwell in a land of health amid fair sights and sounds and receive the good in everything and beauty the effluence of fair works shall flow into the eye and ear like a breeze from a purer region and insensibly draw the soul from earliest years into likeness and sympathy with the beauty of reason 
 there can be no nobler training than that he replied 
 and therefore i said glaucon musical training is a more potent instrument than any other because rhythm and harmony find their way into the inward places of the soul on which they mightily fasten imparting grace and making the soul of him who is rightly educated graceful or of him who is ungraceful and also because he who has received this true education of the inner being will most shrewdly perceive omissions or faults in art and nature and with a true taste while he praises and rejoices over and receives into his soul the good and becomes noble and good he will justly blame and hate the bad now in the days of his youth even before he is able to know the reason why and when reason comes he will recognise and salute the friend with whom his education has made him long familiar 
 yes he said i quite agree with you in thinking that our youth should be trained in music and on the grounds which you mention 
 just as in learning to read i said we were satisfied when we knew the letters of the alphabet which are very few in all their recurring sizes and combinations not slighting them as unimportant whether they occupy a space large or small but everywhere eager to make them out and not thinking ourselves perfect in the art of reading until we recognise them wherever they are found 
 true 
 or as we recognise the reflection of letters in the water or in a mirror only when we know the letters themselves the same art and study giving us the knowledge of both 
 exactly 
 even so as i maintain neither we nor our guardians whom we have to educate can ever become musical until we and they know the essential forms in all their combinations and can recognise them and their images wherever they are found not slighting them either in small things or great but believing them all to be within the sphere of one art and study 
 most assuredly 
 and when a beautiful soul harmonises with a beautiful form and the two are cast in one mould that will be the fairest of sights to him who has an eye to see it 
 the fairest indeed 
 and the fairest is also the loveliest 
 that may be assumed 
 and the man who has the spirit of harmony will be most in love with the loveliest but he will not love him who is of an inharmonious soul 
 that is true he replied if the deficiency be in his soul but if there be any merely bodily defect in another he will be patient of it and will love all the same 
 i perceive i said that you have or have had experiences of this sort and i agree but let me ask you another question has excess of pleasure any affinity to temperance 
 how can that be he replied pleasure deprives a man of the use of his faculties quite as much as pain 
 or any affinity to virtue in general 
 none whatever 
 any affinity to wantonness and intemperance 
 yes the greatest 
 and is there any greater or keener pleasure than that of sensual love 
 no nor a madder 
 whereas true love is a love of beauty and order temperate and harmonious 
 quite true he said 
 then no intemperance or madness should be allowed to approach true love 
 certainly not 
 then mad or intemperate pleasure must never be allowed to come near the lover and his beloved neither of them can have any part in it if their love is of the right sort 
 no indeed socrates it must never come near them 
 then i suppose that in the city which we are founding you would make a law to the effect that a friend should use no other familiarity to his love than a father would use to his son and then only for a noble purpose and he must first have the consent and this rule is to limit him in all his intercourse and he is never to be seen going further or if he exceeds he is to be deemed guilty of coarseness and bad taste 
 i quite agree he said 
 thus much of music which makes a fair ending for what should be the end of music if not the love of beauty 
 i agree he said 
 after music comes gymnastic in which our youth are next to be trained 
 certainly 
 gymnastic as well as music should begin in early years the training in it should be careful and should continue through life now my belief is and this is a matter upon which i should like to have your opinion in confirmation of my own but my own belief is not that the good body by any bodily excellence improves the soul but on the contrary that the good soul by her own excellence improves the body as far as this may be possible what do you say 
 yes i agree 
 then to the mind when adequately trained we shall be right in handing over the more particular care of the body and in order to avoid prolixity we will now only give the general outlines of the subject 
 very good 
 that they must abstain from intoxication has been already remarked by us for of all persons a guardian should be the last to get drunk and not know where in the world he is 
 yes he said that a guardian should require another guardian to take care of him is ridiculous indeed 
 but next what shall we say of their food for the men are in training for the great contest of all are they not 
 yes he said 
 and will the habit of body of our ordinary athletes be suited to them 
 why not 
 i am afraid i said that a habit of body such as they have is but a sleepy sort of thing and rather perilous to health do you not observe that these athletes sleep away their lives and are liable to most dangerous illnesses if they depart in ever so slight a degree from their customary regimen 
 yes i do 
 then i said a finer sort of training will be required for our warrior athletes who are to be like wakeful dogs and to see and hear with the utmost keenness amid the many changes of water and also of food of summer heat and winter cold which they will have to endure when on a campaign they must not be liable to break down in health 
 that is my view 
 the really excellent gymnastic is twin sister of that simple music which we were just now describing 
 how so 
 why i conceive that there is a gymnastic which like our music is simple and good and especially the military gymnastic 
 what do you mean 
 my meaning may be learned from homer he you know feeds his heroes at their feasts when they are campaigning on soldiers fare they have no fish although they are on the shores of the hellespont and they are not allowed boiled meats but only roast which is the food most convenient for soldiers requiring only that they should light a fire and not involving the trouble of carrying about pots and pans 
 true 
 and i can hardly be mistaken in saying that sweet sauces are nowhere mentioned in homer in proscribing them however he is not singular all professional athletes are well aware that a man who is to be in good condition should take nothing of the kind 
 yes he said and knowing this they are quite right in not taking them 
 then you would not approve of syracusan dinners and the refinements of sicilian cookery 
 i think not 
 nor if a man is to be in condition would you allow him to have a corinthian girl as his fair friend 
 certainly not 
 neither would you approve of the delicacies as they are thought of athenian confectionery 
 certainly not 
 all such feeding and living may be rightly compared by us to melody and song composed in the panharmonic style and in all the rhythms exactly 
 there complexity engendered license and here disease whereas simplicity in music was the parent of temperance in the soul and simplicity in gymnastic of health in the body 
 most true he said 
 but when intemperance and disease multiply in a state halls of justice and medicine are always being opened and the arts of the doctor and the lawyer give themselves airs finding how keen is the interest which not only the slaves but the freemen of a city take about them 
 of course 
 and yet what greater proof can there be of a bad and disgraceful state of education than this that not only artisans and the meaner sort of people need the skill of physicians and judges but also those who would profess to have had a liberal education is it not disgraceful and a great sign of want of that a man should have to go abroad for his law and physic because he has none of his own at home and must therefore surrender himself into the hands of other men whom he makes lords and judges over him 
 of all things he said the most disgraceful 
 would you say most i replied when you consider that there is a further stage of the evil in which a man is not only a litigant passing all his days in the courts either as plaintiff or defendant but is actually led by his bad taste to pride himself on his litigiousness he imagines that he is a master in dishonesty able to take every crooked turn and wriggle into and out of every hole bending like a withy and getting out of the way of justice and all for what in order to gain small points not worth mentioning he not knowing that so to order his life as to be able to do without a napping judge is a far higher and nobler sort of thing is not that still more disgraceful 
 yes he said that is still more disgraceful 
 well i said and to require the help of medicine not when a wound has to be cured or on occasion of an epidemic but just because by indolence and a habit of life such as we have been describing men fill themselves with waters and winds as if their bodies were a marsh compelling the ingenious sons of asclepius to find more names for diseases such as flatulence and catarrh is not this too a disgrace 
 yes he said they do certainly give very strange and newfangled names to diseases 
 yes i said and i do not believe that there were any such diseases in the days of asclepius and this i infer from the circumstance that the hero eurypylus after he has been wounded in homer drinks a posset of pramnian wine well besprinkled with and grated cheese which are certainly inflammatory and yet the sons of asclepius who were at the trojan war do not blame the damsel who gives him the drink or rebuke patroclus who is treating his case 
 well he said that was surely an extraordinary drink to be given to a person in his condition 
 not so extraordinary i replied if you bear in mind that in former days as is commonly said before the time of herodicus the guild of asclepius did not practise our present system of medicine which may be said to educate diseases but herodicus being a trainer and himself of a sickly constitution by a combination of training and doctoring found out a way of torturing first and chiefly himself and secondly the rest of the world 
 how was that he said 
 by the invention of lingering death for he had a mortal disease which he perpetually tended and as recovery was out of the question he passed his entire life as a valetudinarian he could do nothing but attend upon himself and he was in constant torment whenever he departed in anything from his usual regimen and so dying hard by the help of science he struggled on to old age 
 a rare reward of his skill 
 yes i said a reward which a man might fairly expect who never understood that if asclepius did not instruct his descendants in valetudinarian arts the omission arose not from ignorance or inexperience of such a branch of medicine but because he knew that in all states every individual has an occupation to which he must attend and has therefore no leisure to spend in continually being ill this we remark in the case of the artisan but ludicrously enough do not apply the same rule to people of the richer sort 
 how do you mean he said 
 i mean this when a carpenter is ill he asks the physician for a rough and ready cure an emetic or a purge or a cautery or the knife these are his remedies and if some one prescribes for him a course of dietetics and tells him that he must swathe and swaddle his head and all that sort of thing he replies at once that he has no time to be ill and that he sees no good in a life which is spent in nursing his disease to the neglect of his customary employment and therefore bidding to this sort of physician he resumes his ordinary habits and either gets well and lives and does his business or if his constitution falls he dies and has no more trouble 
 yes he said and a man in his condition of life ought to use the art of medicine thus far only 
 has he not i said an occupation and what profit would there be in his life if he were deprived of his occupation 
 quite true he said 
 but with the rich man this is otherwise of him we do not say that he has any specially appointed work which he must perform if he would live 
 he is generally supposed to have nothing to do 
 then you never heard of the saying of phocylides that as soon as a man has a livelihood he should practise virtue 
 nay he said i think that he had better begin somewhat sooner 
 let us not have a dispute with him about this i said but rather ask ourselves is the practice of virtue obligatory on the rich man or can he live without it and if obligatory on him then let us raise a further question whether this dieting of disorders which is an impediment to the application of the mind t in carpentering and the mechanical arts does not equally stand in the way of the sentiment of phocylides 
 of that he replied there can be no doubt such excessive care of the body when carried beyond the rules of gymnastic is most inimical to the practice of virtue 
 yes indeed i replied and equally incompatible with the management of a house an army or an office of state and what is most important of all irreconcilable with any kind of study or thought or there is a constant suspicion that headache and giddiness are to be ascribed to philosophy and hence all practising or making trial of virtue in the higher sense is absolutely stopped for a man is always fancying that he is being made ill and is in constant anxiety about the state of his body 
 yes likely enough 
 and therefore our politic asclepius may be supposed to have exhibited the power of his art only to persons who being generally of healthy constitution and habits of life had a definite ailment such as these he cured by purges and operations and bade them live as usual herein consulting the interests of the state but bodies which disease had penetrated through and through he would not have attempted to cure by gradual processes of evacuation and infusion he did not want to lengthen out lives or to have weak fathers begetting weaker sons if a man was not able to live in the ordinary way he had no business to cure him for such a cure would have been of no use either to himself or to the state 
 then he said you regard asclepius as a statesman 
 clearly and his character is further illustrated by his sons note that they were heroes in the days of old and practised the medicines of which i am speaking at the siege of troy you will remember how when pandarus wounded menelaus they 
 sucked the blood out of the wound and sprinkled soothing remedies but they never prescribed what the patient was afterwards to eat or drink in the case of menelaus any more than in the case of eurypylus the remedies as they conceived were enough to heal any man who before he was wounded was healthy and regular in habits and even though he did happen to drink a posset of pramnian wine he might get well all the same but they would have nothing to do with unhealthy and intemperate subjects whose lives were of no use either to themselves or others the art of medicine was not designed for their good and though they were as rich as midas the sons of asclepius would have declined to attend them 
 they were very acute persons those sons of asclepius 
 naturally so i replied nevertheless the tragedians and pindar disobeying our behests although they acknowledge that asclepius was the son of apollo say also that he was bribed into healing a rich man who was at the point of death and for this reason he was struck by lightning but we in accordance with the principle already affirmed by us will not believe them when they tell us both if he was the son of a god we maintain that hd was not avaricious or if he was avaricious he was not the son of a god 
 all that socrates is excellent but i should like to put a question to you ought there not to be good physicians in a state and are not the best those who have treated the greatest number of constitutions good and bad and are not the best judges in like manner those who are acquainted with all sorts of moral natures 
 yes i said i too would have good judges and good physicians but do you know whom i think good 
 will you tell me 
 i will if i can let me however note that in the same question you join two things which are not the same 
 how so he asked 
 why i said you join physicians and judges now the most skilful physicians are those who from their youth upwards have combined with the knowledge of their art the greatest experience of disease they had better not be robust in health and should have had all manner of diseases in their own persons for the body as i conceive is not the instrument with which they cure the body in that case we could not allow them ever to be or to have been sickly but they cure the body with the mind and the mind which has become and is sick can cure nothing 
 that is very true he said 
 but with the judge it is otherwise since he governs mind by mind he ought not therefore to have been trained among vicious minds and to have associated with them from youth upwards and to have gone through the whole calendar of crime only in order that he may quickly infer the crimes of others as he might their bodily diseases from his own the honourable mind which is to form a healthy judgment should have had no experience or contamination of evil habits when young and this is the reason why in youth good men often appear to be simple and are easily practised upon by the dishonest because they have no examples of what evil is in their own souls 
 yes he said they are far too apt to be deceived 
 therefore i said the judge should not be young he should have learned to know evil not from his own soul but from late and long observation of the nature of evil in others knowledge should be his guide not personal experience 
 yes he said that is the ideal of a judge 
 yes i replied and he will be a good man which is my answer to your question for he is good who has a good soul but the cunning and suspicious nature of which we spoke he who has committed many crimes and fancies himself to be a master in wickedness when he is amongst his fellows is wonderful in the precautions which he takes because he judges of them by himself but when he gets into the company of men of virtue who have the experience of age he appears to be a fool again owing to his unseasonable suspicions he cannot recognise an honest man because he has no pattern of honesty in himself at the same time as the bad are more numerous than the good and he meets with them oftener he thinks himself and is by others thought to be rather wise than foolish 
 most true he said 
 then the good and wise judge whom we are seeking is not this man but the other for vice cannot know virtue too but a virtuous nature educated by time will acquire a knowledge both of virtue and vice the virtuous and not the vicious man has wisdom in my opinion 
 and in mine also 
 this is the sort of medicine and this is the sort of law which you sanction in your state they will minister to better natures giving health both of soul and of body but those who are diseased in their bodies they will leave to die and the corrupt and incurable souls they will put an end to themselves 
 that is clearly the best thing both for the patients and for the state 
 and thus our youth having been educated only in that simple music which as we said inspires temperance will be reluctant to go to law 
 clearly 
 and the musician who keeping to the same track is content to practise the simple gymnastic will have nothing to do with medicine unless in some extreme case 
 that i quite believe 
 the very exercises and tolls which he undergoes are intended to stimulate the spirited element of his nature and not to increase his strength he will not like common athletes use exercise and regimen to develop his muscles 
 very right he said 
 neither are the two arts of music and gymnastic really designed as is often supposed the one for the training of the soul the other fir the training of the body 
 what then is the real object of them 
 i believe i said that the teachers of both have in view chiefly the improvement of the soul 
 how can that be he asked 
 did you never observe i said the effect on the mind itself of exclusive devotion to gymnastic or the opposite effect of an exclusive devotion to music 
 in what way shown he said 
 the one producing a temper of hardness and ferocity the other of softness and effeminacy i replied 
 yes he said i am quite aware that the mere athlete becomes too much of a savage and that the mere musician is melted and softened beyond what is good for him 
 yet surely i said this ferocity only comes from spirit which if rightly educated would give courage but if too much intensified is liable to become hard and brutal 
 that i quite think 
 on the other hand the philosopher will have the quality of gentleness and this also when too much indulged will turn to softness but if educated rightly will be gentle and moderate 
 true 
 and in our opinion the guardians ought to have both these qualities 
 assuredly 
 and both should be in harmony 
 beyond question 
 and the harmonious soul is both temperate and courageous 
 yes 
 and the inharmonious is cowardly and boorish 
 very true 
 and when a man allows music to play upon him and to pour into his soul through the funnel of his ears those sweet and soft and melancholy airs of which we were just now speaking and his whole life is passed in warbling and the delights of song in the first stage of the process the passion or spirit which is in him is tempered like iron and made useful instead of brittle and useless but if he carries on the softening and soothing process in the next stage he begins to melt and waste until he has wasted away his spirit and cut out the sinews of his soul and he becomes a feeble warrior 
 very true 
 if the element of spirit is naturally weak in him the change is speedily accomplished but if he have a good deal then the power of music weakening the spirit renders him excitable on the least provocation he flames up at once and is speedily extinguished instead of having spirit he grows irritable and passionate and is quite impracticable 
 exactly 
 and so in gymnastics if a man takes violent exercise and is a great feeder and the reverse of a great student of music and philosophy at first the high condition of his body fills him with pride and spirit and lie becomes twice the man that he was 
 certainly 
 and what happens if he do nothing else and holds no verse with the muses does not even that intelligence which there may be in him having no taste of any sort of learning or enquiry or thought or culture grow feeble and dull and blind his mind never waking up or receiving nourishment and his senses not being purged of their mists 
 true he said 
 and he ends by becoming a hater of philosophy uncivilized never using the weapon of persuasion he is like a wild beast all violence and fierceness and knows no other way of dealing and he lives in all ignorance and evil conditions and has no sense of propriety and grace 
 that is quite true he said 
 and as there are two principles of human nature one the spirited and the other the philosophical some god as i should say has given mankind two arts answering to them and only indirectly to the soul and body in order that these two principles like the strings of an instrument may be relaxed or drawn tighter until they are duly harmonised 
 that appears to be the intention 
 and he who mingles music with gymnastic in the fairest proportions and best attempers them to the soul may be rightly called the true musician and harmonist in a far higher sense than the tuner of the strings 
 you are quite right socrates 
 and such a presiding genius will be always required in our state if the government is to last 
 yes he will be absolutely necessary 
 such then are our principles of nurture and education where would be the use of going into further details about the dances of our citizens or about their hunting and coursing their gymnastic and equestrian contests for these all follow the general principle and having found that we shall have no difficulty in discovering them 
 i dare say that there will be no difficulty 
 very good i said then what is the next question must we not ask who are to be rulers and who subjects 
 certainly 
 there can be no doubt that the elder must rule the younger 
 clearly 
 and that the best of these must rule 
 that is also clear 
 now are not the best husbandmen those who are most devoted to husbandry 
 yes 
 and as we are to have the best of guardians for our city must they not be those who have most the character of guardians 
 yes 
 and to this end they ought to be wise and efficient and to have a special care of the state 
 true 
 and a man will be most likely to care about that which he loves 
 to be sure 
 and he will be most likely to love that which he regards as having the same interests with himself and that of which the good or evil fortune is supposed by him at any time most to affect his own 
 very true he replied 
 then there must be a selection let us note among the guardians those who in their whole life show the greatest eagerness to do what is for the good of their country and the greatest repugnance to do what is against her interests 
 those are the right men 
 and they will have to be watched at every age in order that we may see whether they preserve their resolution and never under the influence either of force or enchantment forget or cast off their sense of duty to the state 
 how cast off he said 
 i will explain to you i replied a resolution may go out of a mind either with his will or against his will with his will when he gets rid of a falsehood and learns better against his will whenever he is deprived of a truth 
 i understand he said the willing loss of a resolution the meaning of the unwilling i have yet to learn 
 why i said do you not see that men are unwillingly deprived of good and willingly of evil is not to have lost the truth an evil and to possess the truth a good and you would agree that to conceive things as they are is to possess the truth 
 yes he replied i agree with you in thinking that mankind are deprived of truth against their will 
 and is not this involuntary deprivation caused either by theft or force or enchantment 
 still he replied i do not understand you 
 i fear that i must have been talking darkly like the tragedians i only mean that some men are changed by persuasion and that others forget argument steals away the hearts of one class and time of the other and this i call theft now you understand me 
 yes 
 those again who are forced are those whom the violence of some pain or grief compels to change their opinion 
 i understand he said and you are quite right 
 and you would also acknowledge that the enchanted are those who change their minds either under the softer influence of pleasure or the sterner influence of fear 
 yes he said everything that deceives may be said to enchant 
 therefore as i was just now saying we must enquire who are the best guardians of their own conviction that what they think the interest of the state is to be the rule of their lives we must watch them from their youth upwards and make them perform actions in which they are most likely to forget or to be deceived and he who remembers and is not deceived is to be selected and he who falls in the trial is to be rejected that will be the way 
 yes 
 and there should also be toils and pains and conflicts prescribed for them in which they will be made to give further proof of the same qualities 
 very right he replied 
 and then i said we must try them with enchantments that is the third sort of test and see what will be their behaviour like those who take colts amid noise and tumult to see if they are of a timid nature so must we take our youth amid terrors of some kind and again pass them into pleasures and prove them more thoroughly than gold is proved in the furnace that we may discover whether they are armed against all enchantments and of a noble bearing always good guardians of themselves and of the music which they have learned and retaining under all circumstances a rhythmical and harmonious nature such as will be most serviceable to the individual and to the state and he who at every age as boy and youth and in mature life has come out of the trial victorious and pure shall be appointed a ruler and guardian of the state he shall be honoured in life and death and shall receive sepulture and other memorials of honour the greatest that we have to give but him who fails we must reject i am inclined to think that this is the sort of way in which our rulers and guardians should be chosen and appointed i speak generally and not with any pretension to exactness 
 and speaking generally i agree with you he said 
 and perhaps the word guardian in the fullest sense ought to be applied to this higher class only who preserve us against foreign enemies and maintain peace among our citizens at home that the one may not have the will or the others the power to harm us the young men whom we before called guardians may be more properly designated auxiliaries and supporters of the principles of the rulers 
 i agree with you he said 
 how then may we devise one of those needful falsehoods of which we lately spoke just one royal lie which may deceive the rulers if that be possible and at any rate the rest of the city 
 what sort of lie he said 
 nothing new i replied only an old phoenician tale of what has often occurred before now in other places as the poets say and have made the world believe though not in our time and i do not know whether such an event could ever happen again or could now even be made probable if it did 
 how your words seem to hesitate on your lips 
 you will not wonder i replied at my hesitation when you have heard 
 speak he said and fear not 
 well then i will speak although i really know not how to look you in the face or in what words to utter the audacious fiction which i propose to communicate gradually first to the rulers then to the soldiers and lastly to the people they are to be told that their youth was a dream and the education and training which they received from us an appearance only in reality during all that time they were being formed and fed in the womb of the earth where they themselves and their arms and appurtenances were manufactured when they were completed the earth their mother sent them up and so their country being their mother and also their nurse they are bound to advise for her good and to defend her against attacks and her citizens they are to regard as children of the earth and their own brothers 
 you had good reason he said to be ashamed of the lie which you were going to tell 
 true i replied but there is more coming i have only told you half citizens we shall say to them in our tale you are brothers yet god has framed you differently some of you have the power of command and in the composition of these he has mingled gold wherefore also they have the greatest honour others he has made of silver to be auxillaries others again who are to be husbandmen and craftsmen he has composed of brass and iron and the species will generally be preserved in the children but as all are of the same original stock a golden parent will sometimes have a silver son or a silver parent a golden son and god proclaims as a first principle to the rulers and above all else that there is nothing which should so anxiously guard or of which they are to be such good guardians as of the purity of the race they should observe what elements mingle in their off spring for if the son of a golden or silver parent has an admixture of brass and iron then nature orders a transposition of ranks and the eye of the ruler must not be pitiful towards the child because he has to descend in the scale and become a husbandman or artisan just as there may be sons of artisans who having an admixture of gold or silver in them are raised to honour and become guardians or auxiliaries for an oracle says that when a man of brass or iron guards the state it will be destroyed such is the tale is there any possibility of making our citizens believe in it 
 not in the present generation he replied there is no way of accomplishing this but their sons may be made to believe in the tale and their sons sons and posterity after them 
 i see the difficulty i replied yet the fostering of such a belief will make them care more for the city and for one another enough however of the fiction which may now fly abroad upon the wings of rumour while we arm our heroes and lead them forth under the command of their rulers let them look round and select a spot whence they can best suppress insurrection if any prove refractory within and also defend themselves against enemies who like wolves may come down on the fold from without there let them encamp and when they have encamped let them sacrifice to the proper gods and prepare their dwellings 
 just so he said 
 and their dwellings must be such as will shield them against the cold of winter and the heat of summer 
 i suppose that you mean houses he replied 
 yes i said but they must be the houses of soldiers and not of 
 what is the difference he said 
 that i will endeavour to explain i replied to keep watchdogs who from want of discipline or hunger or some evil habit or evil habit or other would turn upon the sheep and worry them and behave not like dogs but wolves would be a foul and monstrous thing in a shepherd 
 truly monstrous he said 
 and therefore every care must be taken that our auxiliaries being stronger than our citizens may not grow to be too much for them and become savage tyrants instead of friends and allies 
 yes great care should be taken 
 and would not a really good education furnish the best safeguard 
 but they are already he replied 
 i cannot be so confident my dear glaucon i said i am much certain that they ought to be and that true education whatever that may be will have the greatest tendency to civilize and humanize them in their relations to one another and to those who are under their protection 
 very true he replied 
 and not only their education but their habitations and all that belongs to them should be such as will neither impair their virtue as guardians nor tempt them to prey upon the other citizens any man of sense must acknowledge that 
 he must 
 then let us consider what will be their way of life if they are to realize our idea of them in the first place none of them should have any property of his own beyond what is absolutely necessary neither should they have a private house or store closed against any one who has a mind to enter their provisions should be only such as are required by trained warriors who are men of temperance and courage they should agree to receive from the citizens a fixed rate of pay enough to meet the expenses of the year and no more and they will go and live together like soldiers in a camp gold and silver we will tell them that they have from god the diviner metal is within them and they have therefore no need of the dross which is current among men and ought not to pollute the divine by any such earthly admixture for that commoner metal has been the source of many unholy deeds but their own is undefiled and they alone of all the citizens may not touch or handle silver or gold or be under the same roof with them or wear them or drink from them and this will be their salvation and they will be the saviours of the state but should they ever acquire homes or lands or moneys of their own they will become housekeepers and husbandmen instead of guardians enemies and tyrants instead of allies of the other citizens hating and being hated plotting and being plotted against they will pass their whole life in much greater terror of internal than of external enemies and the hour of ruin both to themselves and to the rest of the state will be at hand for all which reasons may we not say that thus shall our state be ordered and that these shall be the regulations appointed by us for guardians concerning their houses and all other matters other 
 yes said glaucon
