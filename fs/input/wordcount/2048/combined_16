 though very happy in the social atmosphere about her and very busy with the daily work that earned her bread and made it sweeter for the effort jo still found time for literary labors the purpose which now took possession of her was a natural one to a poor and ambitious girl but the means she took to gain her end were not the best she saw that money conferred power therefore she resolved to have not to be used for herself alone but for those whom she loved more than life 
 the dream of filling home with comforts giving beth everything she wanted from strawberries in winter to an organ in her bedroom going abroad herself and always having more than enough so that she might indulge in the luxury of charity had been for years most cherished castle in the air 
 the experience had seemed to open a way which might after long traveling and much uphill work lead to this delightful chateau en espagne but the novel disaster quenched her courage for a time for public opinion is a giant which has frightened jacks on bigger beanstalks than hers like that immortal hero she reposed awhile after the first attempt which resulted in a tumble and the least lovely of the treasures if i remember rightly but the up again and take another spirit was as strong in jo as in jack so she scrambled up on the shady side this time and got more booty but nearly left behind her what was far more precious than the moneybags 
 she took to writing sensation stories for in those dark ages even america read rubbish she told no one but concocted a thrilling tale and boldly carried it herself to mr dashwood editor of the weekly volcano she had never read sartor resartus but she had a womanly instinct that clothes possess an influence more powerful over many than the worth of character or the magic of manners so she dressed herself in her best and trying to persuade herself that she was neither excited nor nervous bravely climbed two pairs of dark and dirty stairs to find herself in a disorderly room a cloud of cigar smoke and the presence of three gentlemen sitting with their heels rather higher than their hats which articles of dress none of them took the trouble to remove on her appearance somewhat daunted by this reception jo hesitated on the threshold murmuring in much embarrassment 
 excuse me i was looking for the weekly volcano office i wished to see mr dashwood 
 down went the highest pair of heels up rose the smokiest gentleman and carefully cherishing his cigar between his fingers he advanced with a nod and a countenance expressive of nothing but sleep feeling that she must get through the matter somehow jo produced her manuscript and blushing redder and redder with each sentence blundered out fragments of the little speech carefully prepared for the occasion 
 a friend of mine desired me to as an like your glad to write more if this suits 
 while she blushed and blundered mr dashwood had taken the manuscript and was turning over the leaves with a pair of rather dirty fingers and casting critical glances up and down the neat pages 
 not a first attempt i take it observing that the pages were numbered covered only on one side and not tied up with a sign of a novice 
 no sir she has had some experience and got a prize for a tale in the blarneystone banner 
 oh did she and mr dashwood gave jo a quick look which seemed to take note of everything she had on from the bow in her bonnet to the buttons on her boots well you can leave it if you like more of this sort of thing on hand than we know what to do with at present but run my eye over it and give you an answer next week 
 now jo did not like to leave it for mr dashwood suit her at all but under the circumstances there was nothing for her to do but bow and walk away looking particularly tall and dignified as she was apt to do when nettled or abashed just then she was both for it was perfectly evident from the knowing glances exchanged among the gentlemen that her little fiction of my friend was considered a good joke and a laugh produced by some inaudible remark of the editor as he closed the door completed her discomfiture half resolving never to return she went home and worked off her irritation by stitching pinafores vigorously and in an hour or two was cool enough to laugh over the scene and long for next week 
 when she went again mr dashwood was alone whereat she rejoiced mr dashwood was much wider awake than before which was agreeable and mr dashwood was not too deeply absorbed in a cigar to remember his manners so the second interview was much more comfortable than the first 
 take this editors never say i if you object to a few alterations too long but omitting the passages marked will make it just the right said in a businesslike tone 
 jo hardly knew her own ms again so crumpled and underscored were its pages and paragraphs but feeling as a tender patent might on being asked to cut off her legs in order that it might fit into a new cradle she looked at the marked passages and was surprised to find that all the moral she had carefully put in as ballast for much been stricken out 
 but sir i thought every story should have some sort of a moral so i took care to have a few of my sinners repent 
 mr editorial gravity relaxed into a smile for jo had forgotten her friend and spoken as only an author could 
 people want to be amused not preached at you know morals sell nowadays which was not quite a correct statement by the way 
 you think it would do with these alterations then 
 yes a new plot and pretty well worked good and so on was mr affable reply 
 what do is what compensation began jo not exactly knowing how to express herself 
 oh yes well we give from to thirty for things of this sort pay when it comes out returned mr dashwood as if that point had escaped him such trifles do escape the editorial mind it is said 
 very well you can have it said jo handing back the story with a satisfied air for after the work even seemed good pay 
 shall i tell my friend you will take another if she has one better than this asked jo unconscious of her little slip of the tongue and emboldened by her success 
 well look at it promise to take it tell her to make it short and spicy and never mind the moral what name would your friend like to put on it in a careless tone 
 none at all if you please she wish her name to appear and has no nom de plume said jo blushing in spite of herself 
 
 just as she likes of course the tale will be out next week will you call for the money or shall i send it asked mr dashwood who felt a natural desire to know who his new contributor might be 
 call good morning sir 
 as she departed mr dashwood put up his feet with the graceful remark poor and proud as usual but do 
 following mr directions and making mrs northbury her model jo rashly took a plunge into the frothy sea of sensational literature but thanks to the life preserver thrown her by a friend she came up again not much the worse for her ducking 
 like most young scribblers she went abroad for her characters and scenery and banditti counts gypsies nuns and duchesses appeared upon her stage and played their parts with as much accuracy and spirit as could be expected her readers were not particular about such trifles as grammar punctuation and probability and mr dashwood graciously permitted her to fill his columns at the lowest prices not thinking it necessary to tell her that the real cause of his hospitality was the fact that one of his hacks on being offered higher wages had basely left him in the lurch 
 she soon became interested in her work for her emaciated purse grew stout and the little hoard she was making to take beth to the mountains next summer grew slowly but surely as the weeks passed one thing disturbed her satisfaction and that was that she did not tell them at home she had a feeling that father and mother would not approve and preferred to have her own way first and beg pardon afterward it was easy to keep her secret for no name appeared with her stories mr dashwood had of course found it out very soon but promised to be dumb and for a wonder kept his word 
 she thought it would do her no harm for she sincerely meant to write nothing of which she would be ashamed and quieted all pricks of conscience by anticipations of the happy minute when she should show her earnings and laugh over her secret 
 but mr dashwood rejected any but thrilling tales and as thrills could not be produced except by harrowing up the souls of the readers history and romance land and sea science and art police records and lunatic asylums had to be ransacked for the purpose jo soon found that her innocent experience had given her but few glimpses of the tragic world which underlies society so regarding it in a business light she set about supplying her deficiencies with characteristic energy eager to find material for stories and bent on making them original in plot if not masterly in execution she searched newspapers for accidents incidents and crimes she excited the suspicions of public librarians by asking for works on poisons she studied faces in the street and characters good bad and indifferent all about her she delved in the dust of ancient times for facts or fictions so old that they were as good as new and introduced herself to folly sin and misery as well as her limited opportunities allowed she thought she was prospering finely but unconsciously she was beginning to desecrate some of the womanliest attributes of a character she was living in bad society and imaginary though it was its influence affected her for she was feeding heart and fancy on dangerous and unsubstantial food and was fast brushing the innocent bloom from her nature by a premature acquaintance with the darker side of life which comes soon enough to all of us 
 she was beginning to feel rather than see this for much describing of other passions and feelings set her to studying and speculating about her own a morbid amusement in which healthy young minds do not voluntarily indulge wrongdoing always brings its own punishment and when jo most needed hers she got it 
 i know whether the study of shakespeare helped her to read character or the natural instinct of a woman for what was honest brave and strong but while endowing her imaginary heroes with every perfection under the sun jo was discovering a live hero who interested her in spite of many human imperfections 
 mr bhaer in one of their conversations had advised her to study simple true and lovely characters wherever she found them as good training for a writer jo took him at his word for she coolly turned round and studied proceeding which would have much surprised him had he know it for the worthy professor was very humble in his own conceit 
 why everybody liked him was what puzzled jo at first he was neither rich nor great young nor handsome in no respect what is called fascinating imposing or brilliant and yet he was as attractive as a genial fire and people seemed to gather about him as naturally as about a warm hearth he was poor yet always appeared to be giving something away a stranger yet everyone was his friend no longer young but as as a boy plain and peculiar yet his face looked beautiful to many and his oddities were freely forgiven for his sake jo often watched him trying to discover the charm and at last decided that it was benevolence which worked the miracle if he had any sorrow it sat with its head under its wing and he turned only his sunny side to the world there were lines upon his forehead but time seemed to have touched him gently remembering how kind he was to others the pleasant curves about his mouth were the memorials of many friendly words and cheery laughs his eyes were never cold or hard and his big hand had a warm strong grasp that was more expressive than words 
 his very clothes seemed to partake of the hospitable nature of the wearer they looked as if they were at ease and liked to make him comfortable his apacious waistcoat was suggestive of a large heart underneath his rusty coat had a social air and the baggy pockets plainly proved that little hands often went in empty and came out full his very boots were benevolent and his collars never stiff and raspy like other 
 it said jo to herself when she at length discovered that genuine good will toward fellow men could beautify and dignify even a stout german teacher who shoveled in his dinner darned his own socks and was burdened with the name of bhaer 
 jo valued goodness highly but she also possessed a most feminine respect for intellect and a little discovery which she made about the professor added much to her regard for him he never spoke of himself and no one ever knew that in his native city he had been a man much honored and esteemed for learning and integrity till a countryman came to see him he never spoke of himself and in a conversation with miss norton divulged the pleasing fact from her jo learned it and liked it all the better because mr bhaer had never told it she felt proud to know that he was an honored professor in berlin though only a poor in america and his homely life was much beautified by the spice of romance which this discovery gave it another and a better gift than intellect was shown her in a most unexpected manner miss norton had the entree into most society which jo would have had no chance of seeing but for her the solitary woman felt an interest in the ambitious girl and kindly conferred many favors of this sort both on jo and the professor she took them with her one night to a select symposium held in honor of several celebrities 
 jo went prepared to bow down and adore the mighty ones whom she had worshiped with youthful enthusiasm afar off but her reverence for genius received a severe shock that night and it took her some time to recover from the discovery that the great creatures were only men and women after all imagine her dismay on stealing a glance of timid admiration at the poet whose lines suggested an ethereal being fed on spirit fire and dew to behold him devouring his supper with an ardor which flushed his intellectual countenance turning as from a fallen idol she made other discoveries which rapidly dispelled her romantic illusions the great novelist vibrated between two decanters with the regularity of a pendulum the famous divine flirted openly with one of the madame de staels of the age who looked daggers at another corinne who was amiably satirizing her after outmaneuvering her in efforts to absorb the profound philosopher who imbibed tea johnsonianly and appeared to slumber the loquacity of the lady rendering speech impossible the scientific celebrities forgetting their mollusks and glacial periods gossiped about art while devoting themselves to oysters and ices with characteristic energy the young musician who was charming the city like a second orpheus talked horses and the specimen of the british nobility present happened to be the most ordinary man of the party 
 before the evening was half over jo felt so completely disillusioned that she sat down in a corner to recover herself mr bhaer soon joined her looking rather out of his element and presently several of the philosophers each mounted on his hobby came ambling up to hold an intellectual tournament in the recess the conversations were miles beyond comprehension but she enjoyed it though kant and hegel were unknown gods the subjective and objective unintelligible terms and the only thing evolved from her inner consciousness was a bad headache after it was all over it dawned upon her gradually that the world was being picked to pieces and put together on new and according to the talkers on infinitely better principles than before that religion was in a fair way to be reasoned into nothingness and intellect was to be the only god jo knew nothing about philosophy or metaphysics of any sort but a curious excitement half pleasurable half painful came over her as she listened with a sense of being turned adrift into time and space like a young balloon out on a holiday 
 she looked round to see how the professor liked it and found him looking at her with the grimest expression she had ever seen him wear he shook his head and beckoned her to come away but she was fascinated just then by the freedom of speculative philosophy and kept her seat trying to find out what the wise gentlemen intended to rely upon after they had annihilated all the old beliefs 
 now mr bhaer was a diffident man and slow to offer his own opinions not because they were unsettled but too sincere and earnest to be lightly spoken as he glanced from jo to several other young people attracted by the brilliancy of the philosophic pyrotechnics he knit his brows and longed to speak fearing that some inflammable young soul would be led astray by the rockets to find when the display was over that they had only an empty stick or a scorched hand 
 he bore it as long as he could but when he was appealed to for an opinion he blazed up with honest indignation and defended religion with all the eloquence of eloquence which made his broken english musical and his plain face beautiful he had a hard fight for the wise men argued well but he know when he was beaten and stood to his colors like a man somehow as he talked the world got right again to jo the old beliefs that had lasted so long seemed better than the new god was not a blind force and immortality was not a pretty fable but a blessed fact she felt as if she had solid ground under her feet again and when mr bhaer paused outtalked but not one whit convinced jo wanted to clap her hands and thank him 
 she did neither but she remembered the scene and gave the professor her heartiest respect for she knew it cost him an effort to speak out then and there because his conscience would not let him be silent she began to see that character is a better possession than money rank intellect or beauty and to feel that if greatness is what a wise man has defined it to be truth reverence and good will then her friend friedrich bhaer was not only good but great 
 this belief strengthened daily she valued his esteem she coveted his respect she wanted to be worthy of his friendship and just when the wish was sincerest she came near to losing everything it all grew out of a cocked hat for one evening the professor came in to give jo her lesson with a paper soldier cap on his head which tina had put there and he had forgotten to take off 
 evident he look in his glass before coming down thought jo with a smile as he said goot efening and sat soberly down quite unconscious of the ludicrous contrast between his subject and his headgear for he was going to read her the death of wallenstein 
 she said nothing at first for she liked to hear him laugh out his big hearty laugh when anything funny happened so she left him to discover it for himself and presently forgot all about it for to hear a german read schiller is rather an absorbing occupation after the reading came the lesson which was a lively one for jo was in a gay mood that night and the cocked hat kept her eyes dancing with merriment the professor know what to make of her and stopped at last to ask with an air of mild surprise that was irresistible 
 mees marsch for what do you laugh in your face haf you no respect for me that you go on so bad 
 how can i be respectful sir when you forget to take your hat off said jo 
 lifting his hand to his head the professor gravely felt and removed the little cocked hat looked at it a minute and then threw back his head and laughed like a merry bass viol 
 ah i see him now it is that imp tina who makes me a fool with my cap well it is nothing but see you if this lesson goes not well you too shall wear him 
 but the lesson did not go at all for a few minutes because mr bhaer caught sight of a picture on the hat and unfolding it said with great disgust i wish these papers did not come in the house they are not for children to see nor young people to read it is not well and i haf no patience with those who make this harm 
 jo glanced at the sheet and saw a pleasing illustration composed of a lunatic a corpse a villian and a viper she did not like it but the impulse that made her turn it over was not one of displeasure but fear because for a minute she fancied the paper was the volcano it was not however and her panic subsided as she remembered that even if it had been and one of her own tales in it there would have been no name to betray her she had betrayed herself however by a look and a blush for though an absent man the professor saw a good deal more than people fancied he knew that jo wrote and had met her down among the newspaper offices more than once but as she never spoke of it he asked no questions in spite of a strong desire to see her work now it occurred to him that she was doing what she was ashamed to own and it troubled him he did not say to himself it is none of my business no right to say anything as many people would have done he only remembered that she was young and poor a girl far away from love and care and he was moved to help her with an impulse as quick and natural as that which would prompt him to put out his hand to save a baby from a puddle all this flashed through his mind in a minute but not a trace of it appeared in his face and by the time the paper was turned and needle threaded he was ready to say quite naturally but very gravely 
 yes you are right to put it from you i do not think that good young girls should see such things they are made pleasant to some but i would more rather give my boys gunpowder to play with than this bad trash 
 all may not be bad only silly you know and if there is a demand for it i see any harm in supplying it many very respectable people make an honest living out of what are called sensation stories said jo scratching gathers so energetically that a row of little slits followed her pin 
 there is a demand for whisky but i think you and i do not care to sell it if the respectable people knew what harm they did they would not feel that the living was honest they haf no right to put poison in the sugarplum and let the small ones eat it no they should think a little and sweep mud in the street before they do this thing 
 mr bhaer spoke warmly and walked to the fire crumpling the paper in his hands jo sat still looking as if the fire had come to her for her cheeks burned long after the cocked hat had turned to smoke and gone harmlessly up the chimney 
 i should like much to send all the rest after him muttered the professor coming back with a relieved air 
 jo thought what a blaze her pile of papers upstairs would make and her money lay rather heavily on her conscience at that minute then she thought consolingly to herself mine are not like that they are only silly never bad so i be worried and taking up her book she said with a studious face shall we go on sir be very good and proper now 
 i shall hope so was all he said but he meant more than she imagined and the grave kind look he gave her made her feel as if the words weekly volcano were printed in large type on her forehead 
 as soon as she went to her room she got out her papers and carefully reread every one of her stories being a little shortsighted mr bhaer sometimes used eye glasses and jo had tried them once smiling to see how they magnified the fine print of her book now she seemed to have on the mental or moral spectacles also for the faults of these poor stories glared at her dreadfully and filled her with dismay 
 they are trash and will soon be worse trash if i go on for each is more sensational than the last gone blindly on hurting myself and other people for the sake of money i know so for i read this stuff in sober earnest without being horribly ashamed of it and what should i do if they were seen at home or mr bhaer got hold of them 
 jo turned hot at the bare idea and stuffed the whole bundle into her stove nearly setting the chimney afire with the blaze 
 yes the best place for such inflammable nonsense better burn the house down i suppose than let other people blow themselves up with my gunpowder she thought as she watched the demon of the jura whisk away a little black cinder with fiery eyes 
 but when nothing remained of all her three work except a heap of ashes and the money in her lap jo looked sober as she sat on the floor wondering what she ought to do about her wages 
 i think i done much harm yet and may keep this to pay for my time she said after a long meditation adding impatiently i almost wish i any conscience so inconvenient if i care about doing right and feel uncomfortable when doing wrong i should get on capitally i help wishing sometimes that mother and father been so particular about such things 
 ah jo instead of wishing that thank god that father and mother were particular and pity from your heart those who have no such guardians to hedge them round with principles which may seem like prison walls to impatient youth but which will prove sure foundations to build character upon in womanhood 
 jo wrote no more sensational stories deciding that the money did not pay for her share of the sensation but going to the other extreme as is the way with people of her stamp she took a course of mrs sherwood miss edgeworth and hannah more and then produced a tale which might have been more properly called an essay or a sermon so intensely moral was it she had her doubts about it from the beginning for her lively fancy and girlish romance felt as ill at ease in the new style as she would have done masquerading in the stiff and cumbrous costume of the last century she sent this didactic gem to several markets but it found no purchaser and she was inclined to agree with mr dashwood that morals sell 
 then she tried a story which she could easily have disposed of if she had not been mercenary enough to demand filthy lucre for it the only person who offered enough to make it worth her while to try juvenile literature was a worthy gentleman who felt it his mission to convert all the world to his particular belief but much as she liked to write for children jo could not consent to depict all her naughty boys as being eaten by bears or tossed by mad bulls because they did not go to a particular sabbath school nor all the good infants who did go as rewarded by every kind of bliss from gilded gingerbread to escorts of angels when they departed this life with psalms or sermons on their lisping tongues so nothing came of these trials land jo corked up her inkstand and said in a fit of very wholesome humility 
 i know anything wait until i do before i try again and meantime sweep mud in the street if i do better honest at least which decision proved that her second tumble down the beanstalk had done her some good 
 while these internal revolutions were going on her external life had been as busy and uneventful as usual and if she sometimes looked serious or a little sad no one observed it but professor bhaer he did it so quietly that jo never knew he was watching to see if she would accept and profit by his reproof but she stood the test and he was satisfied for though no words passed between them he knew that she had given up writing not only did he guess it by the fact that the second finger of her right hand was no longer inky but she spent her evenings downstairs now was met no more among newspaper offices and studied with a dogged patience which assured him that she was bent on occupying her mind with something useful if not pleasant 
 he helped her in many ways proving himself a true friend and jo was happy for while her pen lay idle she was learning other lessons besides german and laying a foundation for the sensation story of her own life 
 it was a pleasant winter and a long one for she did not leave mrs kirke till june everyone seemed sorry when the time came the children were inconsolable and mr hair stuck straight up all over his head for he always rumpled it wildly when disturbed in mind 
 going home ah you are happy that you haf a home to go in he said when she told him and sat silently pulling his beard in the corner while she held a little levee on that last evening 
 she was going early so she bade them all goodbye overnight and when his turn came she said warmly now sir you forget to come and see us if you ever travel our way will you never forgive you if you do for i want them all to know my friend 
 do you shall i come he asked looking down at her with an eager expression which she did not see 
 yes come next month laurie graduates then and enjoy commencement as something new 
 that is your best friend of whom you speak he said in an altered tone 
 yes my boy teddy very proud of him and should like you to see him 
 jo looked up then quite unconscious of anything but her own pleasure in the prospect of showing them to one another something in mr face suddenly recalled the fact that she might find laurie more than a best friend and simply because she particularly wished not to look as if anything was the matter she involuntarily began to blush and the more she tried not to the redder she grew if it had not been for tina on her knee she know what would have become of her fortunately the child was moved to hug her so she managed to hide her face an instant hoping the professor did not see it but he did and his own changed again from that momentary anxiety to its usual expression as he said cordially 
 i fear i shall not make the time for that but i wish the friend much success and you all happiness gott bless you and with that he shook hands warmly shouldered tina and went away 
 but after the boys were abed he sat long before his fire with the tired look on his face and the heimweh or homesickness lying heavy at his heart once when he remembered jo as she sat with the little child in her lap and that new softness in her face he leaned his head on his hands a minute and then roamed about the room as if in search of something that he could not find 
 it is not for me i must not hope it now he said to himself with a sigh that was almost a groan then as if reproach ing himself for the longing that he could not repress he went and kissed the two tousled heads upon the pillow took down his meerschaum and opened his plato 
 he did his best and did it manfully but i think he found that a pair of rampant boys a pipe or even the divine plato were very satisfactory substitutes for wife and child at home 
 early as it was he was at the station next morning to see jo off and thanks to him she began her solitary journey with the pleasant memory of a familiar face smiling its farewell a bunch of violets to keep her company and best of all the happy thought well the gone and written no books earned no fortune but made a friend worth having and try to keep him all my life

 wormtail approached harry who scrambled to find his feet to support his own weight before the ropes were untied wormtail raised his new silver hand pulled out the wad of material gagging harry and then with one swipe cut through the bonds tying harry to the gravestone 
 
 there was a split second perhaps when harry might have considered running for it but his injured leg shook under him as he stood on the overgrown grave as the death eaters closed ranks forming a tighter circle around him and voldemort so that the gaps where the missing death eaters should have stood were filled wormtail walked out of the circle to the place where body lay and returned with wand which he thrust roughly into hand without looking at him then wormtail resumed his place in the circle of watching death eaters 
 
 you have been taught how to duel harry potter said voldemort softly his red eyes glinting through the darkness 
 
 at these words harry remembered as though from a former life the dueling club at hogwarts he had attended briefly two years he had learned there was the disarming spell what use would it be to deprive voldemort of his wand even if he could when he was surrounded by death eaters outnumbered by at least thirty to one he had never learned anything that could possibly fit him for this he knew he was facing the thing against which moody had always warnedthe unblockable avada kedavra curse and voldemort was right his mother was not here to die for him this was quite unprotected 
 
 we bow to each other harry said voldemort bending a little but keeping his snakelike face upturned to harry come the niceties must be would like you to show to death harry 
 
 the death eaters were laughing again lipless mouth was smiling harry did not bow he was not going to let voldemort play with him before killing himhe was not going to give him that satisfaction 
 
 i said bow voldemort said raising his wand and harry felt his spine curve as though a huge invisible hand were bending him ruthlessly forward and the death eaters laughed harder than ever 
 
 very good said voldemort softly and as he raised his wand the pressure bearing down upon harry lifted too and now you face me like a and proud the way your father died 
 
 and now we duel 
 
 voldemort raised his wand and before harry could do anything to defend himself before he could even move he had been hit again by the cruciatus curse the pain was so intense so that he no longer knew where he knives were piercing every inch of his skin his head was surely going to burst with pain he was screaming more loudly than ever screamed in his life 
 
 and then it stopped harry rolled over and scrambled to his feet he was shaking as uncontrollably as wormtail had done when his hand had been cut off he staggered sideways into the wall of watching death eaters and they pushed him away back toward voldemort 
 
 a little break said voldemort the nostrils dilating with excitement a little pausethat hurt it harry you want me to do that again do you 
 
 harry answer he was going to die like cedric those pitiless red eyes were telling him sohe was going to die and there was nothing he could do about itbut he going to play along he going to obey voldemorthe going to beg 
 
 i asked you whether you want me to do that again said voldemort softly answer me imperio 
 
 and harry felt for the third time in his life the sensation that his mind had been wiped of all it was bliss not to think it was as though he were floating dreamingjust answer nosay nojust answer no 
 
 i will not said a stronger voice in the back of his head i answer 
 
 just answer no 
 
 i do it i say it 
 
 just answer no 
 
 i 
 
 and these words burst from mouth they echoed through the graveyard and the dream state was lifted as suddenly as though cold water had been thrown over him back rushed the aches that the cruciatus curse had left all over his body back rushed the realization of where he was and what he was facing 
 
 you said voldemort quietly and the death eaters were not laughing now you say no harry obedience is a virtue i need to teach you before you another little dose of pain 
 
 voldemort raised his wand but this time harry was ready with the reflexes born of his quidditch training he flung himself sideways onto the ground he rolled behind the marble headstone of father and he heard it crack as the curse missed him 
 
 we are not playing harry said soft cold voice drawing nearer as the death eaters laughed you cannot hide from me does this mean you are tired of our duel does this mean that you would prefer me to finish it now harry come out harrycome out and play thenit will be quickit might even be painlessi would not knowi have never died 
 
 harry crouched behind the headstone and knew the end had come there was no hopeno help to be had and as he heard voldemort draw nearer still he knew one thing only and it was beyond fear or reason he was not going to die crouching here like a child playing he was not going to die kneeling at feethe was going to die upright like his father and he was going to die trying to defend himself even if no defense was possible 
 
 before voldemort could stick his snakelike face around the headstone harry stood uphe gripped his wand tightly in his hand thrust it out in front of him and threw himself around the headstone facing voldemort 
 
 voldemort was ready as harry shouted expelliarmus voldemort cried avada kedavra 
 
 a jet of green light issued from wand just as a jet of red light blasted from they met in midair and suddenly wand was vibrating as though an electric charge were surging through it his hand seized up around it he have released it if wanted to and a narrow beam of light connected the two wands neither red nor green but bright deep gold harry following the beam with his astonished gaze saw that long white fingers too were gripping a wand that was shaking and vibrating 
 
 and then nothing could have prepared harry for this he felt his feet lift from the ground he and voldemort were both being raised into the air their wands still connected by that thread of shimmering golden light they glided away from the tombstone of father and then came to rest on a patch of ground that was clear and free of death eaters were shouting they were asking voldemort for instructions they were closing in reforming the circle around harry and voldemort the snake slithering at their heels some of them drawing their wands 
 
 the golden thread connecting harry and voldemort splintered though the wands remained connected a thousand more beams arced high over harry and voldemort crisscrossing all around them until they were enclosed in a golden web a cage of light beyond which the death eaters circled like jackals their cries strangely muffled now 
 
 do nothing voldemort shrieked to the death eaters and harry saw his red eyes wide with astonishment at what was happening saw him fighting to break the thread of light still connecting his wand with harry held onto his wand more tightly with both hands and the golden thread remained unbroken do nothing unless i command you voldemort shouted to the death eaters 
 
 and then an unearthly and beautiful sound filled the was coming from every thread of the web vibrating around harry and voldemort it was a sound harry recognized though he had heard it only once before in his life phoenix song 
 
 it was the sound of hope to harrythe most beautiful and welcome thing he had ever heard in his felt as though the song were inside him instead of just around was the sound he connected with dumbledore and it was almost as though a friend were speaking in his ear 
 
 break the connection 
 
 i know harry told the music i know i no sooner had he thought it than the thing became much harder to do his wand began to vibrate more powerfully than everand now the beam between him and voldemort changed tooit was as though large beads of light were sliding up and down the thread connecting the wands harry felt his wand give a shudder under his hand as the light beads began to slide slowly and steadily his direction of the beams movement was now toward him from voldemort and he felt his wand shudder angrily 
 
 as the closest bead of light moved nearer to wand tip the wood beneath his fingers grew so hot he feared it would burst into flame the closer that bead moved the harder wand vibrated he was sure his wand would not survive contact with it it felt as though it was about to shatter under his fingers 
 
 he concentrated every last particle of his mind upon forcing the bead back toward voldemort his ears full of phoenix song his eyes furious fixedand slowly very slowly the beads quivered to a halt and then just as slowly they began to move the other wayand it was wand that was vibrating nowvoldemort who looked astonished and almost fearful 
 
 one of the beads of light was quivering inches from the tip of wand harry understand why he was doing it know what it might achievebut he now concentrated as he had never done in his life on forcing that bead of light right back into wandand slowlyvery slowlyit moved along the golden threadit trembled for a momentand then it connected 
 
 at once wand began to emit echoing screams of painthen red eyes widened with shock a dense smoky hand flew out of the tip of it and vanishedthe ghost of the hand he had made wormtailmore shouts of painand then something much larger began to blossom from wand tip a great grayish something that looked as though it were made of the solidest densest was a headnow a chest and armsthe torso of cedric diggory 
 
 if ever harry might have released his wand from shock it would have been then but instinct kept him clutching his wand tightly so that the thread of golden light remained unbroken even though the thick gray ghost of cedric diggory was it a ghost it looked so solid emerged in its entirety from the end of wand as though it were squeezing itself out of a very narrow tunneland this shade of cedric stood up and looked up and down the golden thread of light and spoke 
 
 hold on harry it said 
 
 its voice was distant and echoing harry looked at voldemorthis wide red eyes were still shockedhe had no more expected this than harry hadand very dimly harry heard the frightened yells of the death eaters prowling around the edges of the golden dome 
 
 more screams of pain from the wandand then something else emerged from its tipthe dense shadow of a second head quickly followed by arms and torsoan old man harry had seen only in a dream was now pushing himself out of the end of the wand just as cedric had doneand his ghost or his shadow or whatever it was fell next to and surveyed harry and voldemort and the golden web and the connected wands with mild surprise leaning on his walking stick 
 
 he was a real wizard then the old man said his eyes on voldemort killed me that one fight him boy 
 
 but already yet another head was emergingand this head gray as a smoky statue was a both arms shaking now as he fought to keep his wand still saw her drop to the ground and straighten up like the others staring 
 
 the shadow of bertha jorkins surveyed the battle before her with wide eyes 
 
 let go now she cried and her voice echoed like as though from very far away let him get you harry let go 
 
 she and the other two shadowy figures began to pace around the inner walls of the golden web while the death eaters flitted around the outside of itand dead victims whispered as they circled the duelers whispered words of encouragement to harry and hissed words harry hear to voldemort 
 
 and now another head was emerging from the tip of wandand harry knew when he saw it who it would behe knew as though he had expected it from the moment when cedric had appeared from the wandknew because the man appearing was the one thought of more than any other tonight 
 
 the smoky shadow of a tall man with untidy hair fell to the ground as bertha had done straightened up and looked at himand harry his arms shaking madly now looked back into the ghostly face of his father 
 
 your coming he said quietly she wants to see youit will be all righthold on 
 
 and she camefirst her head then her bodya young woman with long hair the smoky shadowy form of lily potter blossomed from the end of wand fell to the ground and straightened like her husband she walked close to harry looking down at him and she spoke in the same distant echoing voice as the others but quietly so that voldemort his face now livid with fear as his victims prowled around him could not hear 
 
 when the connection is broken we will linger for only momentsbut we will give you timeyou must get to the portkey it will return you to hogwartsdo you understand harry 
 
 yes harry gasped fighting now to keep a hold on his wand which was slipping and sliding beneath his fingers 
 
 harry whispered the figure of cedric take my body back will you take my body back to my parents 
 
 i will said harry his face screwed up with the effort of holding the wand 
 
 do it now whispered his voice be ready to rundo it now 
 
 now harry yelled he think he could have held on for another moment anyway he pulled his wand upward with an almighty wrench and the golden thread broke the cage of light vanished the phoenix song died but the shadowy figures of victims did not disappear they were closing in upon voldemort shielding harry from his gaze 
 
 and harry ran as he had never run in his life knocking two stunned death eaters aside as he passed he zigzagged behind headstones feeling their curses following him hearing them hit the headstones he was dodging curses and graves pelting toward body no longer aware of the pain in his leg his whole being concentrated on what he had to do 
 
 stun him he heard voldemort scream 
 
 ten feet from cedric harry dived behind a marble angel to avoid the jets of red light and saw the tip of its wing shatter as the spells hit it gripping his wand more tightly he dashed out from behind the angel 
 
 impedimenta he bellowed pointing his wand wildly over his shoulder at the death eaters running at him 
 
 from a muffled yell he thought he had stopped at least one of them but there was no time to stop and look he jumped over the cup and dived as he heard more wand blasts behind him more jets of light flew over his head as he fell stretching out his hand to grab arm 
 
 stand aside i will kill him he is mine shrieked voldemort hand had closed on wrist one tombstone stood between him and voldemort but cedric was too heavy to carry and the cup was out of reach 
 
 red eyes flamed in the darkness harry saw his mouth curl into a smile saw him raise his wand 
 
 accio harry yelled pointing his wand at the triwizard cup it flew into the air and soared toward him harry caught it by the handle 
 
 he heard scream of fury at the same moment that he felt the jerk behind his navel that meant the portkey had worked it was speeding him away in a whirl of wind and color and cedric along with were going back

 wormtail approached harry who scrambled to find his feet to support his own weight before the ropes were untied wormtail raised his new silver hand pulled out the wad of material gagging harry and then with one swipe cut through the bonds tying harry to the gravestone 
 
 there was a split second perhaps when harry might have considered running for it but his injured leg shook under him as he stood on the overgrown grave as the death eaters closed ranks forming a tighter circle around him and voldemort so that the gaps where the missing death eaters should have stood were filled wormtail walked out of the circle to the place where body lay and returned with wand which he thrust roughly into hand without looking at him then wormtail resumed his place in the circle of watching death eaters 
 
 you have been taught how to duel harry potter said voldemort softly his red eyes glinting through the darkness 
 
 at these words harry remembered as though from a former life the dueling club at hogwarts he had attended briefly two years he had learned there was the disarming spell what use would it be to deprive voldemort of his wand even if he could when he was surrounded by death eaters outnumbered by at least thirty to one he had never learned anything that could possibly fit him for this he knew he was facing the thing against which moody had always warnedthe unblockable avada kedavra curse and voldemort was right his mother was not here to die for him this was quite unprotected 
 
 we bow to each other harry said voldemort bending a little but keeping his snakelike face upturned to harry come the niceties must be would like you to show to death harry 
 
 the death eaters were laughing again lipless mouth was smiling harry did not bow he was not going to let voldemort play with him before killing himhe was not going to give him that satisfaction 
 
 i said bow voldemort said raising his wand and harry felt his spine curve as though a huge invisible hand were bending him ruthlessly forward and the death eaters laughed harder than ever 
 
 very good said voldemort softly and as he raised his wand the pressure bearing down upon harry lifted too and now you face me like a and proud the way your father died 
 
 and now we duel 
 
 voldemort raised his wand and before harry could do anything to defend himself before he could even move he had been hit again by the cruciatus curse the pain was so intense so that he no longer knew where he knives were piercing every inch of his skin his head was surely going to burst with pain he was screaming more loudly than ever screamed in his life 
 
 and then it stopped harry rolled over and scrambled to his feet he was shaking as uncontrollably as wormtail had done when his hand had been cut off he staggered sideways into the wall of watching death eaters and they pushed him away back toward voldemort 
 
 a little break said voldemort the nostrils dilating with excitement a little pausethat hurt it harry you want me to do that again do you 
 
 harry answer he was going to die like cedric those pitiless red eyes were telling him sohe was going to die and there was nothing he could do about itbut he going to play along he going to obey voldemorthe going to beg 
 
 i asked you whether you want me to do that again said voldemort softly answer me imperio 
 
 and harry felt for the third time in his life the sensation that his mind had been wiped of all it was bliss not to think it was as though he were floating dreamingjust answer nosay nojust answer no 
 
 i will not said a stronger voice in the back of his head i answer 
 
 just answer no 
 
 i do it i say it 
 
 just answer no 
 
 i 
 
 and these words burst from mouth they echoed through the graveyard and the dream state was lifted as suddenly as though cold water had been thrown over him back rushed the aches that the cruciatus curse had left all over his body back rushed the realization of where he was and what he was facing 
 
 you said voldemort quietly and the death eaters were not laughing now you say no harry obedience is a virtue i need to teach you before you another little dose of pain 
 
 voldemort raised his wand but this time harry was ready with the reflexes born of his quidditch training he flung himself sideways onto the ground he rolled behind the marble headstone of father and he heard it crack as the curse missed him 
 
 we are not playing harry said soft cold voice drawing nearer as the death eaters laughed you cannot hide from me does this mean you are tired of our duel does this mean that you would prefer me to finish it now harry come out harrycome out and play thenit will be quickit might even be painlessi would not knowi have never died 
 
 harry crouched behind the headstone and knew the end had come there was no hopeno help to be had and as he heard voldemort draw nearer still he knew one thing only and it was beyond fear or reason he was not going to die crouching here like a child playing he was not going to die kneeling at feethe was going to die upright like his father and he was going to die trying to defend himself even if no defense was possible 
 
 before voldemort could stick his snakelike face around the headstone harry stood uphe gripped his wand tightly in his hand thrust it out in front of him and threw himself around the headstone facing voldemort 
 
 voldemort was ready as harry shouted expelliarmus voldemort cried avada kedavra 
 
 a jet of green light issued from wand just as a jet of red light blasted from they met in midair and suddenly wand was vibrating as though an electric charge were surging through it his hand seized up around it he have released it if wanted to and a narrow beam of light connected the two wands neither red nor green but bright deep gold harry following the beam with his astonished gaze saw that long white fingers too were gripping a wand that was shaking and vibrating 
 
 and then nothing could have prepared harry for this he felt his feet lift from the ground he and voldemort were both being raised into the air their wands still connected by that thread of shimmering golden light they glided away from the tombstone of father and then came to rest on a patch of ground that was clear and free of death eaters were shouting they were asking voldemort for instructions they were closing in reforming the circle around harry and voldemort the snake slithering at their heels some of them drawing their wands 
 
 the golden thread connecting harry and voldemort splintered though the wands remained connected a thousand more beams arced high over harry and voldemort crisscrossing all around them until they were enclosed in a golden web a cage of light beyond which the death eaters circled like jackals their cries strangely muffled now 
 
 do nothing voldemort shrieked to the death eaters and harry saw his red eyes wide with astonishment at what was happening saw him fighting to break the thread of light still connecting his wand with harry held onto his wand more tightly with both hands and the golden thread remained unbroken do nothing unless i command you voldemort shouted to the death eaters 
 
 and then an unearthly and beautiful sound filled the was coming from every thread of the web vibrating around harry and voldemort it was a sound harry recognized though he had heard it only once before in his life phoenix song 
 
 it was the sound of hope to harrythe most beautiful and welcome thing he had ever heard in his felt as though the song were inside him instead of just around was the sound he connected with dumbledore and it was almost as though a friend were speaking in his ear 
 
 break the connection 
 
 i know harry told the music i know i no sooner had he thought it than the thing became much harder to do his wand began to vibrate more powerfully than everand now the beam between him and voldemort changed tooit was as though large beads of light were sliding up and down the thread connecting the wands harry felt his wand give a shudder under his hand as the light beads began to slide slowly and steadily his direction of the beams movement was now toward him from voldemort and he felt his wand shudder angrily

 harry wound his hand tightly into the mane of the nearest thestral placed a foot on a stump nearby and scrambled clumsily on to the silken back it did not object but twisted its head around fangs bared and attempted to continue its eager licking of his robes 
 
 he found there was a way of lodging his knees behind the wing joints that made him feel more secure then looked around at the others neville had heaved himself over the back of the next thestral and was now attempting to swing one short leg over the back luna was already in place sitting and adjusting her robes as though she did this every day ron hermione and ginny however were still standing motionless on the spot and staring 
 
 what he said 
 
 we supposed to get on said ron faintly when we see the things 
 
 oh easy said luna sliding obligingly from her thestral and marching over to him hermione and ginny come here 
 
 she pulled them over to the other thestrals standing around and one by one managed to help them on to the back of their mount all three looked extremely nervous as she wound their hands into their horses mane and told them to grip tightly before she got back on to her own steed 
 
 this is mad ron murmured moving his free hand gingerly up and down his neck mad if i could just see it 
 
 better hope it stays invisible said harry darkly we all ready then 
 
 they all nodded and he saw live pairs of knees tighten beneath their robes 
 
 ok 
 
 he looked down at the back of his glossy black head and swallowed 
 
 ministry of magic visitors entrance london then he said uncertainly er if you know where to go 
 
 for a moment thestral did nothing at all then with a sweeping movement that nearly unseated him the wings on either side extended the horse crouched slowly then rocketed upwards so fast and so steeply that harry had to clench his arms and legs tightly around the horse to avoid sliding backwards over its bony rump he closed his eyes and pressed his face down into the horses silky mane as they burst through the topmost branches of the trees and soared out into a sunset 
 
 harry did not think he had ever moved so fast the thestral streaked over the castle its wide wings hardly beating the cooling air was slapping face eyes screwed up against the rushing wind he looked round and saw his five fellows soaring along behind him each of them bent as low as possible into the neck of their thestral to protect themselves from his slipstream 
 
 they were over the hogwarts grounds they had passed hogsmeade harry could see mountains and gullies below them as the daylight began to fail harry saw small collections of lights as they passed over more villages then a winding road on which a single car was beetling its way home through the hills 
 
 this is bizarre harry barely heard ron yell from somewhere behind him and he imagined how it must feel to be speeding along at this height with no visible means of support 
 
 twilight fell the sky was turning to a light dusky purple littered with tiny silver stars and soon only the lights of muggle towns gave them any clue of how far from the ground they were or how very fast they were travelling arms were wrapped tightly around his neck as he willed it to go even faster how much time had elapsed since he had seen sirius lying on the department of mysteries floor how much longer would sirius be able to resist voldemort all harry knew for sure was that his godfather had neither done as voldemort wanted nor died for he was convinced that either outcome would have caused him to feel jubilation or fury course through his own body making his scar sear as painfully as it had on the night mr weasley was attacked 
 
 on they flew through the gathering darkness face felt stiff and cold his legs numb from gripping the sides so tightly but he did not dare shift his position lest he slip he was deaf from the thundering rush of air in his ears and his mouth was dry and frozen from the cold night wind he had lost all sense of how far they had come all his faith was in the beast beneath him still streaking purposefully through the night barely flapping its wings as it sped ever onwards 
 
 if they were too late 
 
 still alive still fighting i can feel it 
 
 if voldemort decided sirius was not going to crack 
 
 know 
 
 stomach gave a jolt the head was suddenly pointing towards the ground and he actually slid forwards a few inches along its neck they were descending at last he thought he heard a shriek behind him and twisted around dangerously but could see no sign of a falling body presumably they had all received a shock from the change of direction just as he had 
 
 and now bright orange lights were growing larger and rounder on all sides they could see the tops of buildings streams of headlights like luminous insect eyes squares of pale yellow that were windows quite suddenly it seemed they were hurtling towards the pavement harry gripped the thestral with every last ounce of his strength braced for a sudden impact but the horse touched the dark ground as lightly as a shadow and harry slid from its back looking around at the street where the overflowing skip still stood a short way from the vandalised telephone box both drained of colour in the flat orange glare of the streetlights 
 
 ron landed a short way off and toppled immediately from his thestral on to the pavement 
 
 never again he said struggling to his feet he made as though to stride away from his thestral but unable to see it collided with its hindquarters and almost fell over again never ever again that was the worst 
 
 hermione and ginny touched down on either side of him both slid off their mounts a little more gracefully than ron though with similar expressions of relief at being back on firm ground neville jumped down shaking and luna dismounted smoothly 
 
 where do we go from here then she asked harry in a politely interested voice as though this was all a rather interesting 
 
 over here he said he gave his thestral a quick grateful pat then led the way quickly to the battered telephone box and opened the door come on he urged the others as they hesitated 
 
 ron and ginny marched in obediently hermione neville and luna squashed themselves in after them harry took one glance back at the thestrals now foraging for scraps of rotten food inside the skip then forced himself into the box after luna 
 
 nearest the receiver dial six two four four two he said 
 
 ron did it his arm bent bizarrely to reach the dial as it whirred back into place the cool female voice sounded inside the box 
 
 welcome to the ministry of magic please state your name and business 
 
 harry potter ron weasley hermione granger harry said very quickly ginny weasley neville longbottom luna lovegood here to save someone unless your ministry can do it first 
 
 thank you said the cool female voice visitors please take the badges and attach them to the front of your robes 
 
 half a dozen badges slid out of the metal chute where returned coins normally appeared hermione scooped them up and handed them mutely to harry over head he glanced at the topmost one harry mission 
 
 visitors to the ministry you are required to submit to a search and present your wands for registration at the security desk which is located at the far end of the atrium 
 
 fine harry said loudly as his scar gave another throb now can we move 
 
 the floor of the telephone box shuddered and the pavement rose up past its glass windows the scavenging thestrals were sliding out of sight blackness closed over their heads and with a dull grinding noise they sank down into the depths of the ministry of magic 
 
 a chink of soft golden light hit their feet and widening rose up their bodies harry bent his knees and held his wand as ready as he could in such cramped conditions as he peered through the glass to see whether anybody was waiting for them in the atrium but it seemed to be completely empty the light was dimmer than it had been by day there were no fires burning under the mantelpieces set into the walls but as the lift slid smoothly to a halt he saw that golden symbols continued to twist sinuously in the dark blue ceiling 
 
 the ministry of magic wishes you a pleasant evening said the voice 
 
 the door of the telephone box burst open harry toppled out of it closely followed by neville and luna the only sound in the atrium was the steady rush of water from the golden fountain where jets from the wands of the witch and wizard the point of the arrow the tip of the hat and the ears continued to gush into the surrounding pool 
 
 come on said harry quietly and the six of them sprinted off down the hall harry in the lead past the fountain towards the desk where the watchwizard who had weighed wand had sat and which was now deserted 
 
 harry felt sure there ought to be a security person there sure their absence was an ominous sign and his feeling of foreboding increased as they passed through the golden gates to the lifts he pressed the nearest down button and a lift clattered into sight almost immediately the golden grilles slid apart with a great echoing clanking and they dashed inside harry stabbed the number nine button the grilles closed with a bang and the lift began to descend jangling and rattling harry had not realised how noisy the lifts were on the day he had come with mr weasley he was sure the din would raise every security person within the building yet when the lilt halted the cool female voice said department of mysteries and the grilles slid open they stepped out into the corridor where nothing was moving out but the nearest torches flickering in the rush of air from the lift 
 
 harry turned towards the plain black door after months and months of dreaming about it he was here at last 
 
 go he whispered and he led the way down the corridor luna right behind him gazing around with her mouth slightly open 
 
 ok listen said harry stopping again within six feet of the door maybe maybe a couple of people should stay here as aas a lookout and 
 
 and we going to let you know coming asked ginny her eyebrows raised you could be miles away 
 
 coming with you harry said neville 
 
 get on with it said ron firmly 
 
 harry still did not want to take them all with him but it seemed he had no choice he turned to face the door and walked forwards just as it had in his dream it swung open and he marched over the threshold the others at his heels 
 
 they were standing in a large circular room everything in here was black including the floor and ceiling identical unmarked handleless black doors were set at intervals all around the black walls interspersed with branches of candles whose flames burned blue their cool shimmering light reflected in the shining marble floor made it look as though there was dark water underfoot 
 
 someone shut the door harry muttered 
 
 he regretted giving this order the moment neville had obeyed it without the long chink of light from the torchlit corridor behind them the place became so dark that for a moment the only things they could see were the bunches of shivering blue flames on the walls and their ghostly reflections in the floor 
 
 in his dream harry had always walked purposefully across this room to the door immediately opposite the entrance and walked on but there were around a dozen doors here just as he was gazing ahead at the doors opposite him trying to decide which was the right one there was a great rumbling noise and the candles began to move sideways the circular wall was rotating 
 
 hermione grabbed arm as though frightened the floor might move too but it did not for a few seconds the blue flames around them were blurred to resemble neon lines as the wall sped around then quite as suddenly as it had started the rumbling stopped and everything became stationary once again 
 
 eyes had blue streaks burned into them it was all he could see 
 
 what was that about whispered ron fearfully 
 
 i think it was to stop us knowing which door we came in through said ginny in a hushed voice 
 
 harry realised at once she was right he could no sooner identify the exit door than locate an ant on the floor and the door through which they needed to proceed could be any one of the dozen surrounding them 
 
 we going to get back out said neville uncomfortably 
 
 well that matter now said harry forcefully blinking to try to erase the blue lines from his vision and clutching his wand tighter than ever we need to get out till found sirius 
 
 go calling for him though hermione said urgently but harry had never needed her advice less his instinct was to keep as quiet as possible 
 
 where do we go then harry ron asked 
 
 i harry began he swallowed in the dreams i went through the door at the end of the corridor from the lifts into a dark this oneand then i went through another door into a room that kind of glitters we should try a few doors he said hastily know the right way when i see it 
 
 he marched straight at the door now facing him the others following close behind him set his left hand against its cool shining surface raised his wand ready to strike the moment it opened and pushed 
 
 it swung open easily 
 
 after the darkness of the first room the lamps hanging low on golden chains from this ceiling gave the impression that this long rectangular room was much brighter though there were no glittering shimmering lights as harry had seen in his dreams the place was quite empty except for a few desks and in the very middle of the room an enormous glass tank of deep green liquid big enough for all of them to swim in a number of objects were drifting around lazily in it 
 
 those things whispered ron 
 
 dunno said harry 
 
 are they fish breathed ginny 
 
 aquavirius maggots said luna excitedly dad said the ministry were breeding 
 
 no said hermione she sounded odd she moved forward to look through the side of the tank brains 
 
 brains 
 
 yes i wonder what doing with them 
 
 harry joined her at the tank sure enough there could be no mistake now he saw them at close quarters glimmering eerily they drifted in and out of sight in the depths of the green liquid looking something like slimy cauliflowers 
 
 get out of here said harry this right we need to try another door 
 
 there are doors here too said ron pointing around the walls heart sank how big was this place 
 
 in my dream i went through that dark room into the second one he said i think we should go back and try from there 
 
 so they hurried back into the dark circular room the ghostly shapes of the brains were now swimming before eyes instead of the blue candle flames 
 
 wait said hermione sharply as luna made to close the door of the brain room behind them flagrate 
 
 she drew with her wand in midair and a fiery x appeared on the door no sooner had the door clicked shut behind them than there was a great rumbling and once again the wall began to revolve very fast but now there was a great blur in amongst the faint blue and when all became still again the fiery cross still burned showing the door they had already tried 
 
 good thinking said harry ok try this one 
 
 again he strode directly at the door facing him and pushed it open his wand still raised the others at his heels 
 
 this room was larger than the last dimly lit and rectangular and the centre of it was sunken forming a great stone pit some twenty feet deep they were standing on the topmost tier of what seemed to be stone benches running all around the room and descending in steep steps like an amphitheatre or the courtroom in which harry had been tried by the wizengamot instead of a chained chair however there was a raised stone dais in the centre of the pit on which stood a stone archway that looked so ancient cracked and crumbling that harry was amazed the thing was still standing unsupported by any surrounding wall the archway was hung with a tattered black curtain or veil which despite the complete stillness of the cold surrounding air was fluttering very slightly as though it had just been touched 
 
 there said harry jumping down on to the bench below there was no answering voice but the veil continued to flutter and sway 
 
 careful whispered hermione 
 
 harry scrambled down the benches one by one until he reached the stone bottom of the sunken pit his footsteps echoed loudly as he walked slowly towards the dais the pointed archway looked much taller from where he now stood than it had when been looking down on it from above still the veil swayed gently as though somebody had just passed through it 
 
 sirius harry spoke again but more quietly now that he was nearer 
 
 he had the strangest feeling that there was someone standing right behind the veil on the other side of the archway gripping his wand very tightly he edged around the dais but there was nobody there all that could be seen was the other side of the tattered black veil 
 
 go called hermione from halfway up the stone steps this right harry come on go 
 
 she sounded scared much more scared than she had in the room where the brains swam yet harry thought the archway had a kind of beauty about it old though it was the gently rippling veil intrigued him he felt a very strong inclination to climb up on the dais and walk through it 
 
 harry go ok said hermione more forcefully 
 
 ok he said but did not move he had just heard something there were faint whispering murmuring noises coming from the other side of the veil 
 
 what are you saying he said very loudly so that his words echoed all around the stone benches 
 
 talking harry said hermione now moving over to him 
 
 whispering behind there he said moving out of her reach and continuing to frown at the veil is that you ron 
 
 here mate said ron appearing around the side of the archway 
 
 anyone else hear it harry demanded for the whispering and murmuring was becoming louder without really meaning to put it there he found his foot was on the dais 
 
 i can hear them too breathed luna joining them around the side of the archway and gazing at the swaying veil there are people in there 
 
 what do you mean in there demanded hermione jumping down from the bottom step and sounding much angrier than the occasion warranted there any in there just an archway no room for anybody to be there harry stop it come away 
 
 she grabbed his arm and pulled but he resisted 
 
 harry we are supposed to be here for sirius she said in a strained voice 
 
 sirius harry repeated still gazing mesmerised at the continuously swaying veil yeah 
 
 something finally slid back into place in his brain sirius captured bound and tortured and he was staring at this archway 
 
 he took several paces back from the dais and wrenched his eyes from the veil 
 
 go he said 
 
 what been trying towell come on then said hermione and she led the way back around the dais on the other side ginny and neville were staring apparently entranced at the veil too without speaking hermione took hold of arm 
 
 ron grabbed and they marched them firmly back to the lowest stone bench and clambered all the way back up to the door 
 
 what reckon that arch was harry asked hermione as they regained the dark circular room 
 
 i know but whatever it was it was dangerous she said firmly again inscribing a fiery cross on the door 
 
 once more the wall span and became still again harry approached another door at random and pushed it did not move 
 
 wrong said hermione 
 
 locked said harry throwing his weight at the door but it budge 
 
 this is it then it said ron excitedly joining harry in the attempt to force the door open bound to be 
 
 get out of the way said hermione sharply she pointed her wand at the place where a lock would have been on an ordinary door and said alohomora 
 
 nothing happened 
 
 knife said harry he pulled it out from inside his robes and slid it into the crack between the door and the wall the others all watched eagerly as he ran it from top to bottom withdrew it and then flung his shoulder again at the door it remained as firmly shut as ever what was more when harry looked down at the knife he saw the blade had melted 
 
 right leaving that room said hermione decisively 
 
 but what if the one said ron staring at it with a mixture of apprehension and longing 
 
 it be harry could get through all the doors in his dream said hermione marking the door with another fiery cross as harry replaced the handle of knife in his pocket 
 
 you know what could be in there said luna eagerly as the wall started to spin yet again 
 
 something blibbering no doubt said hermione under her breath and neville gave a nervous little laugh 
 
 the wall slid to a halt and harry with a feeling of increasing desperation pushed the next door open 
 
 this is it 
 
 he knew it at once by the beautiful dancing light as eyes became accustomed to the brilliant glare he saw clocks gleaming from every surface large and small grandfather and carriage hanging in spaces between the bookcases or standing on desks ranging the length of the room so that a busy relentless ticking filled the place like thousands of minuscule marching footsteps the source of the dancing light was a towering crystal bell jar that stood at the far end of the room 
 
 this way 
 
 heart was pumping frantically now that he knew they were on the right track he led the way down the narrow space between the lines of desks heading as he had done in his dream for the source of the light the crystal bell jar quite as tall as he was that stood on a desk and appeared to be full of a billowing glittering wind 
 
 oh took said ginny as they drew nearer pointing at the very heart of the bell jar 
 
 drifting along in the sparkling current inside was a tiny egg as it rose in the jar it cracked open and a hummingbird emerged which was carried to the very top of the jar but as it fell on the draught its feathers became bedraggled and damp again and by the time it had been borne back to the bottom of the jar it had been enclosed once more in its egg 
 
 keep going said harry sharply because ginny showed signs of wanting to stop and watch the progress back into a bird 
 
 you dawdled enough by that old arch she said crossly but followed him past the bell jar to the only door behind it 
 
 this is it harry said again and his heart was now pumping so hard and fast he felt it must interfere with his speech through here 
 
 he glanced around at them all they had their wands out and looked suddenly serious and anxious he looked back at the door and pushed it swung open 
 
 they were there they had found the place high as a church and full of nothing but towering shelves covered in small dusty glass orbs they glimmered dully in the light issuing from more set at intervals along the shelves like those in the circular room behind them their flames were burning blue the room was very cold 
 
 harry edged forward and peered down one of the shadowy aisles between two rows of shelves he could not hear anything or see the slightest sign of movement 
 
 you said it was row whispered hermione 
 
 yeah breathed harry looking up at the end of the closest row beneath the branch of candles protruding from it glimmered the silver figure 
 
 we need to go right i think whispered hermione squinting to the next row yes 
 
 keep your wands ready harry said softly 
 
 they crept forward glancing behind them as they went on down the long alleys of shelves the further ends of which were in darkness tiny yellowing labels had been stuck beneath each glass orb on the shelves some of them had a weird liquid glow others were as dull and dark within as blown light bulbs 
 
 they passed row harry was listening hard for the slightest sound of movement but sirius might be gagged now or else unconscious or said an unbidden voice inside his head he might already be dead 
 
 have felt it he told himself his heart now hammering against his apple already know 
 
 whispered hermione 
 
 they stood grouped around the end of the row gazing down the alley beside it there was nobody there 
 
 right down at the end said harry whose mouth had become slightly dry you see properly from here 
 
 and he led them between the towering rows of glass balls some of which glowed softly as they passed 
 
 he should be near here whispered harry convinced that every step was going to bring the ragged form of sirius into view on the darkened floor anywhere here really close 
 
 harry said hermione tentatively but he did not want to respond his mouth was very dry 
 
 somewhere about here he said 
 
 they had reached the end of the row and emerged into more dim candlelight there was nobody there all was echoing dusty silence 
 
 he might be harry whispered hoarsely peering down the next alley or maybe he hurried to look down the one beyond that 
 
 harry said hermione again 
 
 what he snarled 
 
 i i think sirius is here 
 
 nobody spoke harry did not want to look at any of them he felt sick he did not understand why sirius was not here he had to be here this was where he harry had seen him 
 
 he ran up the space at the end of the rows staring down them empty aisle after empty aisle flickered past he ran the other way back past his staring companions there was no sign of sirius anywhere nor any hint of a struggle 
 
 harry ron called 
 
 what 
 
 he did not want to hear what ron had to say did not want to hear ron tell him he had been stupid or suggest that they ought to go back to hogwarts but the heat was rising in his face and he felt as though he would like to skulk down here in the darkness for a long while before facing the brightness of the atrium above and the others accusing stares 
 
 have you seen this said ron 
 
 what said harry but eagerly this timeit had to be a sign that sirius had been there a clue he strode back to where they were all standing a little way down row but found nothing except ron staring at one of the dusty glass spheres on the shelf 
 
 what harry repeated glumly 
 
 got your name on said ron 
 
 harry moved a little closer ron was pointing at one of the small glass spheres that glowed with a dull inner light though it was very dusty and appeared not to have been touched for many years 
 
 my name said harry blankly 
 
 he stepped forwards not as tall as ron he had to crane his neck to read the yellowish label affixed to the shelf right beneath the dusty glass ball in spidery writing was written a date of some sixteen years previously and below that 
 
 to 
 
 dark lord 
 
 and harry potter 
 
 harry stared at it 
 
 what is it ron asked sounding unnerved your name doing down here 
 
 he glanced along at the other labels on that stretch of shelf 
 
 not here he said sounding perplexed none of the rest of us are here 
 
 harry i think you should touch it said hermione sharply as he stretched out his hand 
 
 why not he said something to do with me it 
 
 harry said neville suddenly harry looked at him round face was shining slightly with sweat he looked as though he could not take much more suspense 
 
 got my name on said harry 
 
 and feeling slightly reckless he closed his fingers around the dusty surface he had expected it to feel cold but it did not on the contrary it felt as though it had been lying in the sun for hours as though the glow of light within was warming it expecting even hoping that something dramatic was going to happen something exciting that might make their long and dangerous journey worth while after all harry lifted the glass ball down from its shelf and stared at it 
 
 nothing whatsoever happened the others moved in closer around harry gazing at the orb as he brushed it free of the clogging dust 
 
 and then from right behind them a drawling voice spoke 
 
 very good potter now turn around nice and slowly and give that to me 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the order of the phoenix 
 

lionfish nov chapter the department of mysteriescontents prev chapter next chapter 
 harry wound his hand tightly into the mane of the nearest thestral placed a foot on a stump nearby and scrambled clumsily on to the silken back it did not object but twisted its head around fangs bared and attempted to continue its eager licking of his robes 
 
 he found there was a way of lodging his knees behind the wing joints that made him feel more secure then looked around at the others neville had heaved himself over the back of the next thestral and was now attempting to swing one short leg over the back luna was already in place sitting and adjusting her robes as though she did this every day ron hermione and ginny however were still standing motionless on the spot and staring 
 
 what he said 
 
 we supposed to get on said ron faintly when we see the things 
 
 oh easy said luna sliding obligingly from her thestral and marching over to him hermione and ginny come here 
 
 she pulled them over to the other thestrals standing around and one by one managed to help them on to the back of their mount all three looked extremely nervous as she wound their hands into their horses mane and told them to grip tightly before she got back on to her own steed 
 
 this is mad ron murmured moving his free hand gingerly up and down his neck mad if i could just see it 
 
 better hope it stays invisible said harry darkly we all ready then 
 
 they all nodded and he saw live pairs of knees tighten beneath their robes 
 
 ok 
 
 he looked down at the back of his glossy black head and swallowed 
 
 ministry of magic visitors entrance london then he said uncertainly er if you know where to go 
 
 for a moment thestral did nothing at all then with a sweeping movement that nearly unseated him the wings on either side extended the horse crouched slowly then rocketed upwards so fast and so steeply that harry had to clench his arms and legs tightly around the horse to avoid sliding backwards over its bony rump he closed his eyes and pressed his face down into the horses silky mane as they burst through the topmost branches of the trees and soared out into a sunset 
 
 harry did not think he had ever moved so fast the thestral streaked over the castle its wide wings hardly beating the cooling air was slapping face eyes screwed up against the rushing wind he looked round and saw his five fellows soaring along behind him each of them bent as low as possible into the neck of their thestral to protect themselves from his slipstream 
 
 they were over the hogwarts grounds they had passed hogsmeade harry could see mountains and gullies below them as the daylight began to fail harry saw small collections of lights as they passed over more villages then a winding road on which a single car was beetling its way home through the hills 
 
 this is bizarre harry barely heard ron yell from somewhere behind him and he imagined how it must feel to be speeding along at this height with no visible means of support 
 
 twilight fell the sky was turning to a light dusky purple littered with tiny silver stars and soon only the lights of muggle towns gave them any clue of how far from the ground they were or how very fast they were travelling arms were wrapped tightly around his neck as he willed it to go even faster how much time had elapsed since he had seen sirius lying on the department of mysteries floor how much longer would sirius be able to resist voldemort all harry knew for sure was that his godfather had neither done as voldemort wanted nor died for he was convinced that either outcome would have caused him to feel jubilation or fury course through his own body making his scar sear as painfully as it had on the night mr weasley was attacked 
 
 on they flew through the gathering darkness face felt stiff and cold his legs numb from gripping the sides so tightly but he did not dare shift his position lest he slip he was deaf from the thundering rush of air in his ears and his mouth was dry and frozen from the cold night wind he had lost all sense of how far they had come all his faith was in the beast beneath him still streaking purposefully through the night barely flapping its wings as it sped ever onwards 
 
 if they were too late 
 
 still alive still fighting i can feel it 
 
 if voldemort decided sirius was not going to crack 
 
 know 
 
 stomach gave a jolt the head was suddenly pointing towards the ground and he actually slid forwards a few inches along its neck they were descending at last he thought he heard a shriek behind him and twisted around dangerously but could see no sign of a falling body presumably they had all received a shock from the change of direction just as he had 
 
 and now bright orange lights were growing larger and rounder on all sides they could see the tops of buildings streams of headlights like luminous insect eyes squares of pale yellow that were windows quite suddenly it seemed they were hurtling towards the pavement harry gripped the thestral with every last ounce of his strength braced for a sudden impact but the horse touched the dark ground as lightly as a shadow and harry slid from its back looking around at the street where the overflowing skip still stood a short way from the vandalised telephone box both drained of colour in the flat orange glare of the streetlights 
 
 ron landed a short way off and toppled immediately from his thestral on to the pavement 
 
 never again he said struggling to his feet he made as though to stride away from his thestral but unable to see it collided with its hindquarters and almost fell over again never ever again that was the worst 
 
 hermione and ginny touched down on either side of him both slid off their mounts a little more gracefully than ron though with similar expressions of relief at being back on firm ground neville jumped down shaking and luna dismounted smoothly 
 
 where do we go from here then she asked harry in a politely interested voice as though this was all a rather interesting 
 
 over here he said he gave his thestral a quick grateful pat then led the way quickly to the battered telephone box and opened the door come on he urged the others as they hesitated 
 
 ron and ginny marched in obediently hermione neville and luna squashed themselves in after them harry took one glance back at the thestrals now foraging for scraps of rotten food inside the skip then forced himself into the box after luna 
 
 nearest the receiver dial six two four four two he said 
 
 ron did it his arm bent bizarrely to reach the dial as it whirred back into place the cool female voice sounded inside the box 
 
 welcome to the ministry of magic please state your name and business 
 
 harry potter ron weasley hermione granger harry said very quickly ginny weasley neville longbottom luna lovegood here to save someone unless your ministry can do it first 
 
 thank you said the cool female voice visitors please take the badges and attach them to the front of your robes 
 
 half a dozen badges slid out of the metal chute where returned coins normally appeared hermione scooped them up and handed them mutely to harry over head he glanced at the topmost one harry mission 
 
 visitors to the ministry you are required to submit to a search and present your wands for registration at the security desk which is located at the far end of the atrium 
 
 fine harry said loudly as his scar gave another throb now can we move 
 
 the floor of the telephone box shuddered and the pavement rose up past its glass windows the scavenging thestrals were sliding out of sight blackness closed over their heads and with a dull grinding noise they sank down into the depths of the ministry of magic 
 
 a chink of soft golden light hit their feet and widening rose up their bodies harry bent his knees and held his wand as ready as he could in such cramped conditions as he peered through the glass to see whether anybody was waiting for them in the atrium but it seemed to be completely empty the light was dimmer than it had been by day there were no fires burning under the mantelpieces set into the walls but as the lift slid smoothly to a halt he saw that golden symbols continued to twist sinuously in the dark blue ceiling 
 
 the ministry of magic wishes you a pleasant evening said the voice 
 
 the door of the telephone box burst open harry toppled out of it closely followed by neville and luna the only sound in the atrium was the steady rush of water from the golden fountain where jets from the wands of the witch and wizard the point of the arrow the tip of the hat and the ears continued to gush into the surrounding pool 
 
 come on said harry quietly and the six of them sprinted off down the hall harry in the lead past the fountain towards the desk where the watchwizard who had weighed wand had sat and which was now deserted 
 
 harry felt sure there ought to be a security person there sure their absence was an ominous sign and his feeling of foreboding increased as they passed through the golden gates to the lifts he pressed the nearest down button and a lift clattered into sight almost immediately the golden grilles slid apart with a great echoing clanking and they dashed inside harry stabbed the number nine button the grilles closed with a bang and the lift began to descend jangling and rattling harry had not realised how noisy the lifts were on the day he had come with mr weasley he was sure the din would raise every security person within the building yet when the lilt halted the cool female voice said department of mysteries and the grilles slid open they stepped out into the corridor where nothing was moving out but the nearest torches flickering in the rush of air from the lift 
 
 harry turned towards the plain black door after months and months of dreaming about it he was here at last 
 
 go he whispered and he led the way down the corridor luna right behind him gazing around with her mouth slightly open 
 
 ok listen said harry stopping again within six feet of the door maybe maybe a couple of people should stay here as aas a lookout and 
 
 and we going to let you know coming asked ginny her eyebrows raised you could be miles away 
 
 coming with you harry said neville 
 
 get on with it said ron firmly 
 
 harry still did not want to take them all with him but it seemed he had no choice he turned to face the door and walked forwards just as it had in his dream it swung open and he marched over the threshold the others at his heels 
 
 they were standing in a large circular room everything in here was black including the floor and ceiling identical unmarked handleless black doors were set at intervals all around the black walls interspersed with branches of candles whose flames burned blue their cool shimmering light reflected in the shining marble floor made it look as though there was dark water underfoot 
 
 someone shut the door harry muttered 
 
 he regretted giving this order the moment neville had obeyed it without the long chink of light from the torchlit corridor behind them the place became so dark that for a moment the only things they could see were the bunches of shivering blue flames on the walls and their ghostly reflections in the floor 
 
 in his dream harry had always walked purposefully across this room to the door immediately opposite the entrance and walked on but there were around a dozen doors here just as he was gazing ahead at the doors opposite him trying to decide which was the right one there was a great rumbling noise and the candles began to move sideways the circular wall was rotating 
 
 hermione grabbed arm as though frightened the floor might move too but it did not for a few seconds the blue flames around them were blurred to resemble neon lines as the wall sped around then quite as suddenly as it had started the rumbling stopped and everything became stationary once again 
 
 eyes had blue streaks burned into them it was all he could see 
 
 what was that about whispered ron fearfully 
 
 i think it was to stop us knowing which door we came in through said ginny in a hushed voice 
 
 harry realised at once she was right he could no sooner identify the exit door than locate an ant on the floor and the door through which they needed to proceed could be any one of the dozen surrounding them 
 
 we going to get back out said neville uncomfortably 
 
 well that matter now said harry forcefully blinking to try to erase the blue lines from his vision and clutching his wand tighter than ever we need to get out till found sirius 
 
 go calling for him though hermione said urgently but harry had never needed her advice less his instinct was to keep as quiet as possible 
 
 where do we go then harry ron asked 
 
 i harry began he swallowed in the dreams i went through the door at the end of the corridor from the lifts into a dark this oneand then i went through another door into a room that kind of glitters we should try a few doors he said hastily know the right way when i see it 
 
 he marched straight at the door now facing him the others following close behind him set his left hand against its cool shining surface raised his wand ready to strike the moment it opened and pushed 
 
 it swung open easily 
 
 after the darkness of the first room the lamps hanging low on golden chains from this ceiling gave the impression that this long rectangular room was much brighter though there were no glittering shimmering lights as harry had seen in his dreams the place was quite empty except for a few desks and in the very middle of the room an enormous glass tank of deep green liquid big enough for all of them to swim in a number of objects were drifting around lazily in it 
 
 those things whispered ron 
 
 dunno said harry 
 
 are they fish breathed ginny 
 
 aquavirius maggots said luna excitedly dad said the ministry were breeding 
 
 no said hermione she sounded odd she moved forward to look through the side of the tank brains 
 
 brains 
 
 yes i wonder what doing with them 
 
 harry joined her at the tank sure enough there could be no mistake now he saw them at close quarters glimmering eerily they drifted in and out of sight in the depths of the green liquid looking something like slimy cauliflowers 
 
 get out of here said harry this right we need to try another door 
 
 there are doors here too said ron pointing around the walls heart sank how big was this place 
 
 in my dream i went through that dark room into the second one he said i think we should go back and try from there 
 
 so they hurried back into the dark circular room the ghostly shapes of the brains were now swimming before eyes instead of the blue candle flames 
 
 wait said hermione sharply as luna made to close the door of the brain room behind them flagrate 
 
 she drew with her wand in midair and a fiery x appeared on the door no sooner had the door clicked shut behind them than there was a great rumbling and once again the wall began to revolve very fast but now there was a great blur in amongst the faint blue and when all became still again the fiery cross still burned showing the door they had already tried 
 
 good thinking said harry ok try this one 
 
 again he strode directly at the door facing him and pushed it open his wand still raised the others at his heels 
 
 this room was larger than the last dimly lit and rectangular and the centre of it was sunken forming a great stone pit some twenty feet deep they were standing on the topmost tier of what seemed to be stone benches running all around the room and descending in steep steps like an amphitheatre or the courtroom in which harry had been tried by the wizengamot instead of a chained chair however there was a raised stone dais in the centre of the pit on which stood a stone archway that looked so ancient cracked and crumbling that harry was amazed the thing was still standing unsupported by any surrounding wall the archway was hung with a tattered black curtain or veil which despite the complete stillness of the cold surrounding air was fluttering very slightly as though it had just been touched 
 
 there said harry jumping down on to the bench below there was no answering voice but the veil continued to flutter and sway 
 
 careful whispered hermione 
 
 harry scrambled down the benches one by one until he reached the stone bottom of the sunken pit his footsteps echoed loudly as he walked slowly towards the dais the pointed archway looked much taller from where he now stood than it had when been looking down on it from above still the veil swayed gently as though somebody had just passed through it 
 
 sirius harry spoke again but more quietly now that he was nearer 
 
 he had the strangest feeling that there was someone standing right behind the veil on the other side of the archway gripping his wand very tightly he edged around the dais but there was nobody there all that could be seen was the other side of the tattered black veil 
 
 go called hermione from halfway up the stone steps this right harry come on go 
 
 she sounded scared much more scared than she had in the room where the brains swam yet harry thought the archway had a kind of beauty about it old though it was the gently rippling veil intrigued him he felt a very strong inclination to climb up on the dais and walk through it 
 
 harry go ok said hermione more forcefully 
 
 ok he said but did not move he had just heard something there were faint whispering murmuring noises coming from the other side of the veil 
 
 what are you saying he said very loudly so that his words echoed all around the stone benches 
 
 talking harry said hermione now moving over to him 
 
 whispering behind there he said moving out of her reach and continuing to frown at the veil is that you ron 
 
 here mate said ron appearing around the side of the archway 
 
 anyone else hear it harry demanded for the whispering and murmuring was becoming louder without really meaning to put it there he found his foot was on the dais 
 
 i can hear them too breathed luna joining them around the side of the archway and gazing at the swaying veil there are people in there 
 
 what do you mean in there demanded hermione jumping down from the bottom step and sounding much angrier than the occasion warranted there any in there just an archway no room for anybody to be there harry stop it come away 
 
 she grabbed his arm and pulled but he resisted 
 
 harry we are supposed to be here for sirius she said in a strained voice 
 
 sirius harry repeated still gazing mesmerised at the continuously swaying veil yeah 
 
 something finally slid back into place in his brain sirius captured bound and tortured and he was staring at this archway 
 
 he took several paces back from the dais and wrenched his eyes from the veil 
 
 go he said 
 
 what been trying towell come on then said hermione and she led the way back around the dais on the other side ginny and neville were staring apparently entranced at the veil too without speaking hermione took hold of arm 
 
 ron grabbed and they marched them firmly back to the lowest stone bench and clambered all the way back up to the door 
 
 what reckon that arch was harry asked hermione as they regained the dark circular room 
 
 i know but whatever it was it was dangerous she said firmly again inscribing a fiery cross on the door 
 
 once more the wall span and became still again harry approached another door at random and pushed it did not move 
 
 wrong said hermione 
 
 locked said harry throwing his weight at the door but it budge 
 
 this is it then it said ron excitedly joining harry in the attempt to force the door open bound to be 
 
 get out of the way said hermione sharply she pointed her wand at the place where a lock would have been on an ordinary door and said alohomora 
 
 nothing happened 
 
 knife said harry he pulled it out from inside his robes and slid it into the crack between the door and the wall the others all watched eagerly as he ran it from top to bottom withdrew it and then flung his shoulder again at the door it remained as firmly shut as ever what was more when harry looked down at the knife he saw the blade had melted 
 
 right leaving that room said hermione decisively 
 
 but what if the one said ron staring at it with a mixture of apprehension and longing 
 
 it be harry could get through all the doors in his dream said hermione marking the door with another fiery cross as harry replaced the handle of knife in his pocket 
 
 you know what could be in there said luna eagerly as the wall started to spin yet again 
 
 something blibbering no doubt said hermione under her breath and neville gave a nervous little laugh 
 
 the wall slid to a halt and harry with a feeling of increasing desperation pushed the next door open 
 
 this is it 
 
 he knew it at once by the beautiful dancing light as eyes became accustomed to the brilliant glare he saw clocks gleaming from every surface large and small grandfather and carriage hanging in spaces between the bookcases or standing on desks ranging the length of the room so that a busy relentless ticking filled the place like thousands of minuscule marching footsteps the source of the dancing light was a towering crystal bell jar that stood at the far end of the room 
 
 this way 
 
 heart was pumping frantically now that he knew they were on the right track he led the way down the narrow space between the lines of desks heading as he had done in his dream for the source of the light the crystal bell jar quite as tall as he was that stood on a desk and appeared to be full of a billowing glittering wind 
 
 oh took said ginny as they drew nearer pointing at the very heart of the bell jar 
 
 drifting along in the sparkling current inside was a tiny egg as it rose in the jar it cracked open and a hummingbird emerged which was carried to the very top of the jar but as it fell on the draught its feathers became bedraggled and damp again and by the time it had been borne back to the bottom of the jar it had been enclosed once more in its egg 
 
 keep going said harry sharply because ginny showed signs of wanting to stop and watch the progress back into a bird 
 
 you dawdled enough by that old arch she said crossly but followed him past the bell jar to the only door behind it 
 
 this is it harry said again and his heart was now pumping so hard and fast he felt it must interfere with his speech through here 
 
 he glanced around at them all they had their wands out and looked suddenly serious and anxious he looked back at the door and pushed it swung open 
 
 they were there they had found the place high as a church and full of nothing but towering shelves covered in small dusty glass orbs they glimmered dully in the light issuing from more set at intervals along the shelves like those in the circular room behind them their flames were burning blue the room was very cold 
 
 harry edged forward and peered down one of the shadowy aisles between two rows of shelves he could not hear anything or see the slightest sign of movement 
 
 you said it was row whispered hermione 
 
 yeah breathed harry looking up at the end of the closest row beneath the branch of candles protruding from it glimmered the silver figure 
 
 we need to go right i think whispered hermione squinting to the next row yes 
 
 keep your wands ready harry said softly 
 
 they crept forward glancing behind them as they went on down the long alleys of shelves the further ends of which were in darkness tiny yellowing labels had been stuck beneath each glass orb on the shelves some of them had a weird liquid glow others were as dull and dark within as blown light bulbs 
 
 they passed row harry was listening hard for the slightest sound of movement but sirius might be gagged now or else unconscious or said an unbidden voice inside his head he might already be dead 
 
 have felt it he told himself his heart now hammering against his apple already know 
 
 whispered hermione 
 
 they stood grouped around the end of the row gazing down the alley beside it there was nobody there 
 
 right down at the end said harry whose mouth had become slightly dry you see properly from here 
 
 and he led them between the towering rows of glass balls some of which glowed softly as they passed 
 
 he should be near here whispered harry convinced that every step was going to bring the ragged form of sirius into view on the darkened floor anywhere here really close 
 
 harry said hermione tentatively but he did not want to respond his mouth was very dry 
 
 somewhere about here he said 
 
 they had reached the end of the row and emerged into more dim candlelight there was nobody there all was echoing dusty silence 
 
 he might be harry whispered hoarsely peering down the next alley or maybe he hurried to look down the one beyond that 
 
 harry said hermione again 
 
 what he snarled 
 
 i i think sirius is here 
 
 nobody spoke harry did not want to look at any of them he felt sick he did not understand why sirius was not here he had to be here this was where he harry had seen him 
 
 he ran up the space at the end of the rows staring down them empty aisle after empty aisle flickered past he ran the other way back past his staring companions there was no sign of sirius anywhere nor any hint of a struggle 
 
 harry ron called 
 
 what 
 
 he did not want to hear what ron had to say did not want to hear ron tell him he had been stupid or suggest that they ought to go back to hogwarts but the heat was rising in his face and he felt as though he would like to skulk down here in the darkness for a long while before facing the brightness of the atrium above and the others accusing stares 
 
 have you seen this said ron 
 
 what said harry but eagerly this timeit had to be a sign that sirius had been there a clue he strode back to where they were all standing a little way down row but found nothing except ron staring at one of the dusty glass spheres on the shelf 
 
 what harry repeated glumly 
 
 got your name on said ron 
 
 harry moved a little closer ron was pointing at one of the small glass spheres that glowed with a dull inner light though it was very dusty and appeared not to have been touched for many years 
 
 my name said harry blankly 
 
 he stepped forwards not as tall as ron he had to crane his neck to read the yellowish label affixed to the shelf right beneath the dusty glass ball in spidery writing was written a date of some sixteen years previously and below that 
 
 to 
 
 dark lord 
 
 and harry potter 
 
 harry stared at it 
 
 what is it ron asked sounding unnerved your name doing down here 
 
 he glanced along at the other labels on that stretch of shelf 
 
 not here he said sounding perplexed none of the rest of us are here 
 
 harry i think you should touch it said hermione sharply as he stretched out his hand 
 
 why not he said something to do with me it 
 
 harry said neville suddenly harry looked at him round face was shining slightly with sweat he looked as though he could not take much more suspense 
 
 got my name on said harry 
 
 and feeling slightly reckless he closed his fingers around the dusty surface he had expected it to feel cold but it did not on the contrary it felt as though it had been lying in the sun for hours as though the glow of light within was warming it expecting even hoping that something dramatic was going to happen something exciting that might make their long and dangerous journey worth while after all harry lifted the glass ball down from its shelf and stared at it 
 
 nothing whatsoever happened the others moved in closer around harry gazing at the orb as he brushed it free of the clogging dust 
 
 and then from right behind them a drawling voice spoke 
 
 very good potter now turn around nice and slowly and give that to me 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the order of the phoenix 
 

lionfish nov chapter the forest againcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 
 finally the truth lying with his face pressed into the dusty carpet of the office where he had once thought he was learning the secrets of victory harry understood at last that he was not supposed to survive his job was to walk calmly into deaths welcoming arms along the way he was to dispose of voldemorts remaining links to life so that when at last he flung himself across voldemorts path and did not raise a wand to defend himself the end would be clean and the job that ought to have been done in godrics hollow would be finished neither would live neither could survive 
 
 he felt his heart pounding fiercely in his chest how strange that in his dread of death it pumped all the harder valiantly keeping him alive but it would have to stop and soon its beats were numbered how many would there be time for as he rose and walked through the castle for the last time out into the grounds and into the forest 
 
 terror washed over him as he lay on the floor with that funeral drum pounding inside him would it hurt to die all those times he had thought that it was about to happen and escaped he had never really thought of the thing itself his will to live had always been so much stronger than his fear of death yet it did not occur to him now to try to escape to outrun voldemort it was over he knew it and all that was left was the thing itself dying 
 
 if he could only have died on that summers night when he had left number four privet drive for the last time when the noble phoenix feather wand had saved him if he could only have died like hedwig so quickly he would not have known it had happened or if he could have launched himself in front of a wand to save someone he loved he envied even his parents deaths now this walk to his own destruction would require a different kind of bravery he felt his fingers trembling slightly and made an effort to control them although no one could see him the portraits on the walls were all empty 
 
 slowly very slowly he sat up and as he did so he felt more alive and more aware of his own living body than ever before why had he never appreciated what a miracle he was brain and nerve and bounding heart it would all be gone or at least he would be gone from it his breath came slow and deep and his mouth and throat were completely dry but so were his eyes 
 
 dumbledores betrayal was almost nothing of course there had been a bigger plan harry had simply been too foolish to see it he realized that now he had never questioned his own assumption that dumbledore wanted him alive now he saw that his life span had always been determined by how long it took to eliminate all the horcruxes dumbledore had passed the job of destroying them to him and obediently he had continued to chip away at the bonds tying not only voldemort but himself to life how neat how elegant not to waste any more lives but to give the dangerous task to the boy who had already been marked for slaughter and whose death would not be a calamity but another blow against voldemort 
 
 and dumbledore had known that harry would not duck out that he would keep going to the end even though it was his end because he had taken trouble to get to know him hadnt he dumbledore knew as voldemort knew that harry would not let anyone else die for him now that he had discovered it was in his power to stop it the images of fred lupin and tonks lying dead in the great hall forced their way back into his minds eye and for a moment he could hardly breathe death was impatient 
 
 but dumbledore had overestimated him he had failed the snake survived one horcrux remained to bind voldemort to the earth even after harry had been killed true that would mean an easier job for somebody he wondered who would do it ron and hermione would know what needed to be done of course that would have been why dumbledore wanted him to confide in two others so that if he fulfilled his true destiny a little early they could carry on 
 
 like rain on a cold window these thoughts pattered against the hard surface of the incontrovertible truth which was that he must die i must die it must end 
 
 ron and hermione seemed a long way away in a country he felt as though he had parted from them long ago there would be no and no explanations he was determined of that this was a journey they could not take together and the attempts they would make to stop him would waste valuable time he looked down at the battered gold watch he had received on his seventeenth birthday nearly half of the hour allotted by voldemort for his surrender had elapsed 
 
 he stood up his heart was leaping against his ribs like a frantic bird perhaps it knew it had little time left perhaps it was determined to fulfill a lifetimes beats before the end he did not look back as he closed the office door 
 
 the castle was empty he felt ghostly striding through it alone as if he had already died the portrait people were still missing from their frames the whole place was eerily still as if all its remaining lifeblood were concentrated in the great hall where the dead and the mourners were crammed 
 
 harry pulled the invisibility cloak over himself and descended through the floors at last walking down the marble staircase into the entrance hall perhaps some tiny part of him hoped to be sensed to be seen to be stopped but the cloak was as ever impenetrable perfect and he reached the front doors easily 
 
 then neville nearly walked into him he was one half of a pair that was carrying a body in from the grounds harry glanced down and felt another dull blow to his stomach colon creevey though underage must have sneaked back just as malfoy crabbe and goyle had done he was tiny in death 
 
 you know what i can manage him alone neville said oliver wood and he heaved colin over his shoulder in a firemans lift and carried him into the great hall 
 
 neville leaned against the door frame for a moment and wiped his forehead with the back of his hand he looked like an old man then he set off on the steps again into the darkness to recover more bodies 
 
 harry took one glance back at the entrance of the great hall people were moving around trying to comfort each other drinking kneeling beside the dead but he could not see any of the people he loved no hint of hermione ron ginny or any of the other weasleys no luna he felt he would have given all the time remaining to him for just one last look at them but then would he ever have the strength to stop looking it was better like this 
 
 he moved down the steps and out into the darkness it was nearly four in the morning and the deathly stillness of the grounds felt as though they were holding their breath waiting to see whether he could do what he must 
 
 harry moved toward neville who was bending over another body 
 
 neville 
 
 blimey harry you nearly gave me heart failure 
 
 harry had pulled off the cloak the idea had come to him out of nowhere born out of a desire to make absolutely sure 
 
 where are you going alone neville asked suspiciously 
 
 its all part of the plan said harry theres something ive got to do listen cneville c 
 
 harry neville looked suddenly scared harry youre not thinking of handing yourself over 
 
 no harry lied easily course not this is something else but i might be out of sight for a while you know voldemorts snake neville hes got a huge snake calls it nagini 
 
 ive heard yeah what about it 
 
 its got to be killed ron and hermione know that but just in case they c 
 
 the awfulness of that possibility smothered him for a moment made it impossible to keep talking but he pulled himself together again this was crucial he must be like dumbledore keep a cool head make sure there were backups others to carry on dumbledore had died knowing that three people still knew about the horcruxes now neville would take harrys place there would still be three in the secret 
 
 just in case theyre c busy c and you get the chance c 
 
 kill the snake 
 
 kill the snake harry repeated 
 
 all right harry youre okay are you 
 
 im fine thanks neville 
 
 but neville seized his wrist as harry made to move on 
 
 were all going to keep fighting harry you know that 
 
 yeah i c 
 
 the suffocating feeling extinguished the end of the sentence he could not go on neville did not seem to find it strange he patted harry on the shoulder released him and walked away to look for more bodies 
 
 harry swung the cloak back over himself and walked on someone else was moving not far away stooping over another prone figure on the ground he was feet away from her when he realized it was ginny 
 
 he stopped in his tracks she was crouching over a girl who was whispering for her mother 
 
 its all right ginny was saying its ok were going to get you inside 
 
 but i want to go home whispered the girl i dont want to fight anymore 
 
 i know said ginny and her voice broke its going to be all right 
 
 ripples of cold undulated over harrys skin he wanted to shout out to the night he wanted ginny to know that he was there he wanted her to know where he was going he wanted to be stopped to be dragged back to be sent back home 
 
 but he was home hogwards was the first and best home he had known he and voldemort and snape the abandoned boys had all found home here 
 
 ginny was kneeling beside the injured girl now holding her hand with a huge effort harry forced himself on he thought he saw ginny look around as he passed and wondered whether she had sensed someone walking nearby but he did not speak and he did not look back 
 
 hagrids hut loomed out of the darkness there were no lights no sound of fang scrabbling at the door his bark booming in welcome all those visits to hagrid and the gleam of the copper kettle on the fire and rock cakes and giant grubs and his great bearded face and ron vomiting slugs and hermione helping him save norbert 
 
 he moved on and now he reached the edge of the forest and he stopped 
 
 a swarm of dementors was gliding amongst the trees he could feel their chill and he was not sure he would be able to pass safely through it he had not strength left for a patronus he could no longer control his own trembling it was not after all so easy to die every second he breathed the smell of the grass the cool air on his face was so precious to think that people had years and years time to waste so much time it dragged and he was clinging to each second at the same time he thought that he would not be able to go on and knew that he must the long game was ended the snitch had been caught it was time to leave the air 
 
 the snitch his nerveless fingers fumbled for a moment with the pouch at his neck and he pulled it out 
 
 i open at the close 
 
 breathing fast and hard he stared down at it now that he wanted time to move as slowly as possible he seemed to have sped up and understanding was coming so fast it seemed to have bypassed though this was the close this was the moment 
 
 he pressed the golden metal to his lips and whispered i am about to die 
 
 the metal shell broke open he lowered his shaking hand raised dracos wand beneath the cloak and murmured lumos 
 
 the black stone with is jagged crack running down the center sat in the two halves of the snitch the resurrection stone had cracked down the vertical line representing the elder wand the triangle and circle representing the cloak and the stone were still discernible 
 
 and again harry understood without having to think it did not matter about bringing them back for he was about to join them he was not really fetching them they were fetching him 
 
 he closed his eyes and turned the stone over in his hand three times 
 
 he knew it had happened because he heard slight movements around him that suggested frail bodies shifting their footing on the earthy ground that marked the outer edge of the forest he opened his eyes and looked around 
 
 they were neither ghost nor truly flesh he could see that they resembled most closely the riddle that had escaped from the diary so long ago and he had been memory made nearly solid less substantial than living bodies but much more than ghosts they moved toward him and on each face there was the same loving smile 
 
 james was exactly the same height as harry he was wearing the clothes in which he had died and his hair was untidy and ruffled and his glasses were a little lopsided like mr weasleys 
 
 sirius was tall and handsome and younger by far than harry had seen him in life he loped with an easy grace his hands in his pockets and a grin on his face 
 
 lupin was younger too and much less shabby and his hair was thicker and darker he looked happy to be back in this familiar place scene of so many adolescent wanderings 
 
 lilys smile was widest of all she pushed her long hair back as she drew closer to him and her green eyes so like his searched his face hungrily as though she would never be able to look at him enough 
 
 youve been so brave 
 
 he could not speak his eyes feasted on her and he thought that he would like to stand and look at her forever and that would be enough 
 
 you are nearly there said james very close we are so proud of you 
 
 does it hurt 
 
 the childish question had fallen from harrys lips before he could stop it 
 
 dying not at all said sirius quicker and easier than falling asleep 
 
 and he will want it to be quick he wants it over said lupin 
 
 i didnt want you to die harry said these words came without his volition any of you im sorry c 
 
 he addressed lupin more than any of them beseeching him 
 
 c right after youd had your son remus im sorry c 
 
 i am sorry too said lupin sorry i will never know him but he will know why i died and i hope he will understand i was trying to make a world in which he could live a happier life 
 
 a chilly breeze that seemed to emanate from the heart of the forest lifted the hair at harrys brow he knew that they would not tell him to go that it would have to be his decision 
 
 youll stay with me 
 
 until the very end said james 
 
 they wont be able to see you asked harry 
 
 we are part of you said sirius invisible to anyone else 
 
 harry looked at his mother 
 
 stay close to me he said quietly 
 
 and he set of the dementors chill did not overcome him he passed through it with his companions and they acted like patronuses to him and together they marched through the old trees that grew closely together their branches tangled their roots gnarled and twisted underfoot harry clutched the cloak tightly around him in the darkness traveling deeper and deeper into the forest with no idea where exactly voldemort was but sure that he would find him beside him making scarcely a sound walked james sirius lupin and lily and their presence was his courage and the reason he was able to keep putting one foot in front of the other 
 
 his body and mind felt oddly disconnected now his limbs working without conscious instruction as if he were passenger not driver in the body he was about to leave the dead who walked beside him through the forest were much more real to him now than the living back at the castle ron hermione ginny and all the others were the ones who felt like ghosts as he stumbled and slipped toward the end of his life toward voldemort 
 
 a thud and a whisper some other living creature had stirred close by harry stopped under the cloak peering around listening and his mother and father lupin and sirius stopped too 
 
 someone there came a rough whisper close at hand hes got an invisibility cloak could it be c 
 
 two figures emerged from behind a nearby tree their wands flared and harry saw yaxley and dolohov peering into the darkness directly at the place harry his mother and father and sirius and lupin stood apparently they could not see anything 
 
 definitely heard something said yaxley animal dyou reckon 
 
 that head case hagrid kept a whole bunch of stuff in here said dolohov glancing over his shoulder 
 
 yaxley looked down at his watch 
 
 times nearly up porters had his hour hes not coming 
 
 better go back said yaxley find out what the plan is now 
 
 he and dolohov turned and walked deeper into the forest harry followed them knowing that they would lead him exactly where he wanted to go he glanced sideways and his mother smiled at him and his father nodded encouragement 
 
 they had traveled on mere minutes when harry saw light ahead and yaxley and dolohov stepped out into a clearing that harry knew had been the place where the monstrous aragog had once lived the remnants of his vast web were there still but the swarms of descendants he had spawned had been driven out by the death eaters to fight for their cause 
 
 a fire burned in the middle of the clearing and its flickering light fell over a crowd of completely silent watchful death eaters some of them were still masked and hooded others showed their faces two giants sat on the outskirts of the group casting massive shadows over the scene their faces cruel like rock harry saw fenrir skulking chewing his long nails the great blond rowle was dabbing at his bleeding lip he saw lucius malfoy who looked defeated and terrified and narcissa whose eyes were sunken and full of apprehension 
 
 every eye was fixed upon voldemort who stood with his head bowed and his white hands folded over the elder wand in front of him he might have been praying or else counting silently in his mind and harry standing still on the edge of the scene though absurdly of a child counting in a game of behind his head still swirling and coiling the great snake nagini floated in her glittering charmed cage like a monstrous halo 
 
 when dolohov and yaxley rejoined the circle voldemort looked up 
 
 no sign of him my lord said dolohov 
 
 voldemorts expression did not change the red eyes seemed to burn in the firelight slowly he drew the elder wand between his long fingers 
 
 my lord c 
 
 bellatrix had spoken she sat closest to voldemort disheveled her face a little bloody but otherwise unharmed 
 
 voldemort raised his hand to silence her and she did not speak another word but eyed him in worshipful fascination 
 
 i thought he would come said voldemort in his high clear voice his eyes on the leaping flames i expected him to come 
 
 nobody spoke they seemed as scared as harry whose heart was now throwing itself against his ribs as though determined to escape the body he was about to cast aside his hands were sweating as he pulled off the invisibility cloak and stuffed it beneath his robes with his wand he did not want to be tempted to fight 
 
 i was it seems mistaken said voldemort 
 
 you werent 
 
 harry said it as loudly as he could with all the force he could muster he did not want to sound afraid the resurrection stone slipped from between his numb fingers and out of the corner of his eyes he saw his parents sirius and lupin vanish as he stepped forward into the firelight at that moment he felt that nobody mattered but voldemort it was just the two of them 
 
 the illusion was gone as soon as it had come the giants roared as the death eaters rose together and there were many cries gasps even laughter voldemort had frozen where he stood but his red eyes had found harry and he stared as harry moved toward him with nothing but the fire between them 
 
 then a voice yelled harry no 
 
 he turned hagrid was bound and trussed tied to a tree nearby his massive body shook the branches overhead as he struggled desperate 
 
 no no harry whatre yeh c 
 
 quiet shouted rowle and with a flick of his wand hagrid was silenced 
 
 bellatrix who had leapt to her feet was looking eagerly from voldemort to harry her breast heaving the only things that moved were the flames and the snake coiling and uncoiling in the glittering cage behind voldemorts head 
 
 harry could feel his wand against his chest but he made no attempt to draw it he knew that the snake was too well protected knew that if he managed to point the wand at nagini fifty curses would hit him first and still voldemort and harry looked at each other and now voldemort tilted his head a little to the side considering the boy standing before him and a singularly mirthless smile curled the lipless mouth 
 
 harry potter he said very softly his voice might have been part of the spitting fire the boy who lived 
 
 none of the death eaters moved they were waiting everything was waiting hagrid was struggling and bellatrix was panting and harry thought inexplicably of ginny and her blazing look and the feel of her lips on his c voldemort had raised his wand his head was still tilted to one side like a curious child wondering what would happen if he proceeded harry looked back into the red eyes and wanted it to happen now quickly while he could still stand before he lost control before he betrayed fear c 
 
 he saw the mouth move and a flash of green light and everything was gone 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the deathly hallows

 hagrids hut loomed out of the darkness there were no lights no sound of fang scrabbling at the door his bark booming in welcome all those visits to hagrid and the gleam of the copper kettle on the fire and rock cakes and giant grubs and his great bearded face and ron vomiting slugs and hermione helping him save norbert 
 
 he moved on and now he reached the edge of the forest and he stopped 
 
 a swarm of dementors was gliding amongst the trees he could feel their chill and he was not sure he would be able to pass safely through it he had not strength left for a patronus he could no longer control his own trembling it was not after all so easy to die every second he breathed the smell of the grass the cool air on his face was so precious to think that people had years and years time to waste so much time it dragged and he was clinging to each second at the same time he thought that he would not be able to go on and knew that he must the long game was ended the snitch had been caught it was time to leave the air 
 
 the snitch his nerveless fingers fumbled for a moment with the pouch at his neck and he pulled it out 
 
 i open at the close 
 
 breathing fast and hard he stared down at it now that he wanted time to move as slowly as possible he seemed to have sped up and understanding was coming so fast it seemed to have bypassed though this was the close this was the moment 
 
 he pressed the golden metal to his lips and whispered i am about to die 
 
 the metal shell broke open he lowered his shaking hand raised dracos wand beneath the cloak and murmured lumos 
 
 the black stone with is jagged crack running down the center sat in the two halves of the snitch the resurrection stone had cracked down the vertical line representing the elder wand the triangle and circle representing the cloak and the stone were still discernible 
 
 and again harry understood without having to think it did not matter about bringing them back for he was about to join them he was not really fetching them they were fetching him 
 
 he closed his eyes and turned the stone over in his hand three times 
 
 he knew it had happened because he heard slight movements around him that suggested frail bodies shifting their footing on the earthy ground that marked the outer edge of the forest he opened his eyes and looked around 
 
 they were neither ghost nor truly flesh he could see that they resembled most closely the riddle that had escaped from the diary so long ago and he had been memory made nearly solid less substantial than living bodies but much more than ghosts they moved toward him and on each face there was the same loving smile 
 
 james was exactly the same height as harry he was wearing the clothes in which he had died and his hair was untidy and ruffled and his glasses were a little lopsided like mr weasleys 
 
 sirius was tall and handsome and younger by far than harry had seen him in life he loped with an easy grace his hands in his pockets and a grin on his face 
 
 lupin was younger too and much less shabby and his hair was thicker and darker he looked happy to be back in this familiar place scene of so many adolescent wanderings 
 
 lilys smile was widest of all she pushed her long hair back as she drew closer to him and her green eyes so like his searched his face hungrily as though she would never be able to look at him enough 
 
 youve been so brave 
 
 he could not speak his eyes feasted on her and he thought that he would like to stand and look at her forever and that would be enough 
 
 you are nearly there said james very close we are so proud of you 
 
 does it hurt 
 
 the childish question had fallen from harrys lips before he could stop it 
 
 dying not at all said sirius quicker and easier than falling asleep 
 
 and he will want it to be quick he wants it over said lupin 
 
 i didnt want you to die harry said these words came without his volition any of you im sorry c 
 
 he addressed lupin more than any of them beseeching him 
 
 c right after youd had your son remus im sorry c 
 
 i am sorry too said lupin sorry i will never know him but he will know why i died and i hope he will understand i was trying to make a world in which he could live a happier life 
 
 a chilly breeze that seemed to emanate from the heart of the forest lifted the hair at harrys brow he knew that they would not tell him to go that it would have to be his decision 
 
 youll stay with me 
 
 until the very end said james 
 
 they wont be able to see you asked harry 
 
 we are part of you said sirius invisible to anyone else 
 
 harry looked at his mother 
 
 stay close to me he said quietly 
 
 and he set of the dementors chill did not overcome him he passed through it with his companions and they acted like patronuses to him and together they marched through the old trees that grew closely together their branches tangled their roots gnarled and twisted underfoot harry clutched the cloak tightly around him in the darkness traveling deeper and deeper into the forest with no idea where exactly voldemort was but sure that he would find him beside him making scarcely a sound walked james sirius lupin and lily and their presence was his courage and the reason he was able to keep putting one foot in front of the other 
 
 his body and mind felt oddly disconnected now his limbs working without conscious instruction as if he were passenger not driver in the body he was about to leave the dead who walked beside him through the forest were much more real to him now than the living back at the castle ron hermione ginny and all the others were the ones who felt like ghosts as he stumbled and slipped toward the end of his life toward voldemort 
 
 a thud and a whisper some other living creature had stirred close by harry stopped under the cloak peering around listening and his mother and father lupin and sirius stopped too 
 
 someone there came a rough whisper close at hand hes got an invisibility cloak could it be c 
 
 two figures emerged from behind a nearby tree their wands flared and harry saw yaxley and dolohov peering into the darkness directly at the place harry his mother and father and sirius and lupin stood apparently they could not see anything 
 
 definitely heard something said yaxley animal dyou reckon 
 
 that head case hagrid kept a whole bunch of stuff in here said dolohov glancing over his shoulder 
 
 yaxley looked down at his watch 
 
 times nearly up porters had his hour hes not coming 
 
 better go back said yaxley find out what the plan is now 
 
 he and dolohov turned and walked deeper into the forest harry followed them knowing that they would lead him exactly where he wanted to go he glanced sideways and his mother smiled at him and his father nodded encouragement 
 
 they had traveled on mere minutes when harry saw light ahead and yaxley and dolohov stepped out into a clearing that harry knew had been the place where the monstrous aragog had once lived the remnants of his vast web were there still but the swarms of descendants he had spawned had been driven out by the death eaters to fight for their cause 
 
 a fire burned in the middle of the clearing and its flickering light fell over a crowd of completely silent watchful death eaters some of them were still masked and hooded others showed their faces two giants sat on the outskirts of the group casting massive shadows over the scene their faces cruel like rock harry saw fenrir skulking chewing his long nails the great blond rowle was dabbing at his bleeding lip he saw lucius malfoy who looked defeated and terrified and narcissa whose eyes were sunken and full of apprehension 
 
 every eye was fixed upon voldemort who stood with his head bowed and his white hands folded over the elder wand in front of him he might have been praying or else counting silently in his mind and harry standing still on the edge of the scene though absurdly of a child counting in a game of behind his head still swirling and coiling the great snake nagini floated in her glittering charmed cage like a monstrous halo 
 
 when dolohov and yaxley rejoined the circle voldemort looked up 
 
 no sign of him my lord said dolohov 
 
 voldemorts expression did not change the red eyes seemed to burn in the firelight slowly he drew the elder wand between his long fingers 
 
 my lord c 
 
 bellatrix had spoken she sat closest to voldemort disheveled her face a little bloody but otherwise unharmed 
 
 voldemort raised his hand to silence her and she did not speak another word but eyed him in worshipful fascination 
 
 i thought he would come said voldemort in his high clear voice his eyes on the leaping flames i expected him to come 
 
 nobody spoke they seemed as scared as harry whose heart was now throwing itself against his ribs as though determined to escape the body he was about to cast aside his hands were sweating as he pulled off the invisibility cloak and stuffed it beneath his robes with his wand he did not want to be tempted to fight 
 
 i was it seems mistaken said voldemort 
 
 you werent 
 
 harry said it as loudly as he could with all the force he could muster he did not want to sound afraid the resurrection stone slipped from between his numb fingers and out of the corner of his eyes he saw his parents sirius and lupin vanish as he stepped forward into the firelight at that moment he felt that nobody mattered but voldemort it was just the two of them 
 
 the illusion was gone as soon as it had come the giants roared as the death eaters rose together and there were many cries gasps even laughter voldemort had frozen where he stood but his red eyes had found harry and he stared as harry moved toward him with nothing but the fire between them 
 
 then a voice yelled harry no 
 
 he turned hagrid was bound and trussed tied to a tree nearby his massive body shook the branches overhead as he struggled desperate 
 
 no no harry whatre yeh c 
 
 quiet shouted rowle and with a flick of his wand hagrid was silenced 
 
 bellatrix who had leapt to her feet was looking eagerly from voldemort to harry her breast heaving the only things that moved were the flames and the snake coiling and uncoiling in the glittering cage behind voldemorts head 
 
 harry could feel his wand against his chest but he made no attempt to draw it he knew that the snake was too well protected knew that if he managed to point the wand at nagini fifty curses would hit him first and still voldemort and harry looked at each other and now voldemort tilted his head a little to the side considering the boy standing before him and a singularly mirthless smile curled the lipless mouth 
 
 harry potter he said very softly his voice might have been part of the spitting fire the boy who lived 
 
 none of the death eaters moved they were waiting everything was waiting hagrid was struggling and bellatrix was panting and harry thought inexplicably of ginny and her blazing look and the feel of her lips on his c voldemort had raised his wand his head was still tilted to one side like a curious child wondering what would happen if he proceeded harry looked back into the red eyes and wanted it to happen now quickly while he could still stand before he lost control before he betrayed fear c 
 
 he saw the mouth move and a flash of green light and everything was gone 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the deathly hallows

 by hans christian andersen 
 
 it sounds up from the in the 
 every child in the old town of odense on the island of 
 funen knows the au which washes the gardens round about the town and flows on under the wooden bridges from the dam to the 
 in the au grow the yellow and brown 
 feathery reeds the dark velvety flag grows there high and thick old 
 and decayed willows slanting and tottering hang far out over the 
 stream beside the meadow and by the bleaching ground but 
 opposite there are gardens upon gardens each different from the rest 
 some with pretty flowers and bowers like little dolls pleasure 
 grounds often displaying cabbage and other kitchen plants and here 
 and there the gardens cannot be seen at all for the great elder trees 
 that spread themselves out by the bank and hang far out over the 
 streaming waters which are deeper here and there than an oar can 
 fathom opposite the old nunnery is the deepest place which is called 
 the and there dwells the old water spirit the 
 this spirit sleeps through the day while the sun shines down upon 
 the water but in starry and moonlit nights he shows himself he is 
 very old grandmother says that she has heard her own grandmother tell of him he is said to lead a solitary life and to have nobody with 
 whom he can converse save the great old church bell once the bell 
 hung in the church tower but now there is no trace left of the 
 tower or of the church which was called st 
 
 sounded the bell when the tower still 
 stood there and one evening while the sun was setting and the 
 bell was swinging away bravely it broke loose and came flying down 
 through the air the brilliant metal shining in the ruddy beam 
 
 now retire to rest sang the bell 
 and flew down into the where it is deepest and that is why the place is called the 
 
 but the bell got neither rest nor sleep down in the 
 haunt it sounds and rings so that the tones sometimes pierce upward 
 through the waters and many people maintain that its strains forebode 
 the death of some one but that is not true for the bell is only 
 talking with the who is now no longer alone 
 
 and what is the bell telling it is old very old as we have 
 already observed it was there long before grandmother was born and yet it is but a child in comparison with the who is quite an old quiet personage an oddity with his hose of and his scaly jacket with the yellow lilies for buttons and a wreath of reed in his hair and seaweed in his beard but he looks very pretty for all that 
 
 what the bell tells to repeat it all would require years and 
 days for year by year it is telling the old stories sometimes 
 short ones sometimes long ones according to its whim it tells of 
 old times of the dark hard times thus 
 
 in the church of st alban the monk had mounted up into the 
 tower he was young and handsome but thoughtful exceedingly he 
 looked through the loophole out upon the when the bed of the water was yet broad and the monks meadow was still a lake he looked out over it and over the rampart and over the nuns hill 
 opposite where the convent lay and the light gleamed forth from 
 the cell he had known the nun right well and he thought of 
 her and his heart beat quicker as he thought 
 yes this was the story the bell told 
 
 into the tower came also the dapper of the bishop 
 and when i the bell who am made of metal rang hard and loud and 
 swung to and fro i might have beaten out his brains he sat down 
 close under me and played with two little sticks as if they had 
 been a stringed instrument and he sang to it now i may sing it 
 out aloud though at other times i may not whisper it i may sing of 
 everything that is kept concealed behind lock and bars yonder it is 
 cold and wet the rats are eating her up alive nobody knows of it 
 nobody hears of it not even now for the bell is ringing and 
 singing its loud 
 
 there was a king in those days they called him canute he 
 bowed himself before bishop and monk but when he offended the free peasants with heavy taxes and hard words they seized their weapons and put him to flight like a wild beast he sought shelter in the church and shut gate and door behind him the violent band surrounded the church i heard tell of it the crows ravens and magpies started up in terror at the yelling and shouting that sounded 
 around they flew into the tower and out again they looked down 
 upon the throng below and they also looked into the windows of the 
 church and screamed out aloud what they saw there king canute 
 knelt before the altar in prayer his brothers eric and benedict stood 
 by him as a guard with drawn swords but the servant the 
 treacherous blake betrayed his master the throng in front of the 
 church knew where they could hit the king and one of them flung a 
 stone through a pane of glass and the king lay there dead the 
 cries and screams of the savage horde and of the birds sounded through the air and i joined in it also for i sang the church bell hangs high and looks far around and sees the birds around it and understands their language the wind roars in 
 upon it through windows and loopholes and the wind knows 
 everything for he gets it from the air which encircles all things 
 and the church bell understands his tongue and rings it out into 
 the world 
 
 but it was too much for me to hear and to know i was not able 
 any longer to ring it out i became so tired so heavy that the 
 beam broke and i flew out into the gleaming au where the water is 
 deepest and where the lives solitary and alone and year 
 by year i tell him what i have heard and what i know 
 
 
 thus it sounds complainingly out of the in the 
 that is what grandmother told us 
 
 but the schoolmaster says that there was not any bell that rung 
 down there for that it could not do so and that no dwelt 
 yonder for there was no at all and when all the other church bells are sounding sweetly he says that it is not really the bells 
 that are sounding but that it is the air itself which sends forth the 
 notes and grandmother said to us that the bell itself said it was the 
 air who told it to him consequently they are agreed on that point 
 and this much is sure 
 
 be cautious cautious and take good heed to thyself they 
 both say 
 
 the air knows everything it is around us it is in us it talks 
 of our thoughts and of our deeds and it speaks longer of them than 
 does the bell down in the depths of the where the dwells it rings it out in the vault of heaven far far out

 book and grandfather 
 chapter vi 
 
 the two old men do everything each one after his own fashion to render cosette happy 
 everything was made ready for the wedding 
 the doctor on being consulted declared that it might take place in february it was then december 
 a few ravishing weeks of perfect happiness passed 
 the grandfather was not the least happy of them all 
 he remained for a quarter of an hour at a time gazing at cosette 
 the wonderful beautiful girl he exclaimed 
 and she has so sweet and good an air she is without exception the most charming girl that i have ever seen in my life 
 later on have virtues with an odor of violets 
 how graceful one cannot live otherwise than nobly with such a creature 
 marius my boy you are a baron you are rich go to pettifogging i beg of you 
 cosette and marius had passed abruptly from the sepulchre to paradise the transition had not been softened and they would have been stunned had they not been dazzled by it 
 do you understand anything about it said marius to cosette 
 no replied cosette but it seems to me that the good god is caring for us 
 jean valjean did everything smoothed away every difficulty arranged everything made everything easy 
 he hastened towards happiness with as much ardor and apparently with as much joy as cosette herself 
 as he had been a mayor he understood how to solve that delicate problem with the secret of which he alone was acquainted civil status 
 if he were to announce her origin bluntly it might prevent the marriage who knows 
 he extricated cosette from all difficulties 
 he concocted for her a family of dead people a sure means of not encountering any objections cosette was the only scion of an extinct family cosette was not his own daughter but the daughter of the other fauchelevent two brothers fauchelevent had been gardeners to the convent of the inquiry was made at that convent the very best information and the most respectable references abounded the good nuns not very apt and but little inclined to fathom questions of paternity and not attaching any importance to the matter had never understood exactly of which of the two fauchelevents cosette was the daughter they said what was wanted and they said it with zeal 
 an acte de notoriete was drawn up 
 cosette became in the eyes of the law mademoiselle euphrasie fauchelevent 
 she was declared an orphan both father and mother being dead 
 jean valjean so arranged it that he was appointed under the name of fauchelevent as guardian with m gillenormand as supervising guardian over him 
 as for the five hundred and eighty thousand francs they constituted a legacy bequeathed to cosette by a dead person who desired to remain unknown 
 the original legacy had consisted of five hundred and thousand francs but ten thousand francs had been expended on the education of mademoiselle euphrasie five thousand francs of that amount having been paid to the convent this legacy deposited in the hands of a third party was to be turned over to cosette at her majority or at the date of her marriage this taken as a whole was very acceptable as the reader will perceive especially when the sum due was half a million 
 there were some peculiarities here and there it is true but they were not noticed one of the interested parties had his eyes blindfolded by love the others by the six hundred thousand francs 
 cosette learned that she was not the daughter of that old man whom she had so long called father 
 he was merely a kinsman another fauchelevent was her real father 
 at any other time this would have broken her heart 
 but at the ineffable moment which she was then passing through it cast but a slight shadow a faint cloud and she was so full of joy that the cloud did not last long she had marius 
 the young man arrived the old man was effaced such is life 
 and then cosette had for long years been habituated to seeing enigmas around her every being who has had a mysterious childhood is always prepared for certain renunciations 
 nevertheless she continued to call jean valjean 
 father 
 cosette happy as the angels was enthusiastic over father gillenormand it is true that he overwhelmed her with gallant compliments and presents 
 while jean valjean was building up for cosette a normal situation in society and an unassailable status m gillenormand was superintending the basket of wedding gifts 
 nothing so amused him as being magnificent 
 he had given to cosette a robe of binche guipure which had descended to him from his own grandmother 
 these fashions come up again said he ancient things are the rage and the young women of my old age dress like the old women of my childhood 
 he rifled his respectable chests of drawers in coromandel lacquer with swelling fronts which had not been opened for us hear the confession of these dowagers he said let us see what they have in their paunches 
 he noisily violated the drawers of all his wives of all his mistresses and of all his grandmothers pekins damasks lampas painted moires robes of shot gros de tours india kerchiefs embroidered in gold that could be washed dauphines without a right or wrong side in the piece genoa and alencon point lace parures in antique work ivory boxes ornamented with microscopic battles gewgaws and ribbons he lavished everything on cosette 
 cosette amazed desperately in love with marius and wild with gratitude towards m gillenormand dreamed of a happiness without limit clothed in satin and velvet her wedding basket seemed to her to be upheld by seraphim her soul flew out into the azure depths with wings of mechlin lace 
 the intoxication of the lovers was only equalled as we have already said by the ecstasy of the grandfather 
 a sort of flourish of trumpets went on in the rue des 
 every morning a fresh offering of from the grandfather to cosette 
 all possible knickknacks glittered around her 
 one day marius who was fond of talking gravely in the midst of his bliss said apropos of i know not what incident 
 the men of the revolution are so great that they have the prestige of the ages like cato and like phocion and each one of them seems to me an antique memory 
 moire antique exclaimed the old gentleman 
 thanks marius that is precisely the idea of which i was in search 
 and on the following day a magnificent dress of colored moire antique was added to wedding presents 
 from these fripperies the grandfather extracted a bit of wisdom 
 love is all very well but there must be something else to go with it 
 the useless must be mingled with happiness 
 happiness is only the necessary 
 season that enormously with the superfluous for me 
 a palace and her heart 
 her heart and the louvre her heart and the grand waterworks of versailles 
 give me my shepherdess and try to make her a duchess 
 fetch me phyllis crowned with and add a hundred thousand francs income open for me a bucolic perspective as far as you can see beneath a marble colonnade 
 i consent to the bucolic and also to the fairy spectacle of marble and gold 
 dry happiness resembles dry bread one eats but one does not dine 
 i want the superfluous the useless the extravagant excess that which serves no purpose i remember to have seen in the cathedral of strasburg a clock as tall as a house which marked the hours which had the kindness to indicate the hour but which had not the air of being made for that and which after having struck midday or midnight midday the hour of the sun or midnight the hour of love or any other hour that you like gave you the moon and the stars the earth and the sea birds and fishes phoebus and phoebe and a host of things which emerged from a niche and the twelve apostles and the emperor charles the fifth and eponine and sabinus and a throng of little gilded goodmen who played on the trumpet to boot 
 without reckoning delicious chimes which it sprinkled through the air on every occasion without any knowing why is a petty bald which merely tells the hour equal to that for my part i am of the opinion of the big clock of strasburg and i prefer it to the cuckoo clock from the black forest 
 m gillenormand talked nonsense in connection with the wedding and all the fripperies of the eighteenth century passed through his dithyrambs 
 you are ignorant of the art of festivals 
 you do not know how to organize a day of enjoyment in this age he exclaimed your nineteenth century is weak 
 it lacks excess 
 it ignores the rich it ignores the noble 
 in everything it is your third estate is insipid colorless odorless and shapeless the dreams of your bourgeois who set up as they express it a pretty boudoir freshly decorated violet ebony and calico make way 
 make way the sieur curmudgeon is marrying mademoiselle sumptuousness and splendor 
 a louis has been stuck to a candle 
 the epoch for you 
 my demand is that i may flee from it beyond the sarmatians 
 ah in i predict that all was lost from the day when i beheld the duc de rohan prince de leon duc de chabot duc de montbazon marquis de sonbise vicomte de thouars peer of france go to longchamps in a tapecu that has borne its fruits 
 in this century men attend to business they gamble on change they win money they are stingy 
 people take care of their surfaces and varnish them every one is dressed as though just out of a washed soaped scraped shaved combed waked smoothed rubbed brushed cleaned on the outside irreproachable polished as a pebble discreet neat and at the same time death of my life in the depths of their consciences they have and cesspools that are enough to make a who blows his nose in his fingers recoil 
 i grant to this age the device dirty cleanliness 
 be vexed marius give me permission to speak i say no evil of the people as you see i am always harping on your people but do look favorably on my dealing a bit of a slap to the bourgeoisie

 book and grandfather 
 chapter vi 
 
 the two old men do everything each one after his own fashion to render cosette happy 
 everything was made ready for the wedding 
 the doctor on being consulted declared that it might take place in february it was then december 
 a few ravishing weeks of perfect happiness passed 
 the grandfather was not the least happy of them all 
 he remained for a quarter of an hour at a time gazing at cosette 
 the wonderful beautiful girl he exclaimed 
 and she has so sweet and good an air she is without exception the most charming girl that i have ever seen in my life 
 later on have virtues with an odor of violets 
 how graceful one cannot live otherwise than nobly with such a creature 
 marius my boy you are a baron you are rich go to pettifogging i beg of you 
 cosette and marius had passed abruptly from the sepulchre to paradise the transition had not been softened and they would have been stunned had they not been dazzled by it 
 do you understand anything about it said marius to cosette 
 no replied cosette but it seems to me that the good god is caring for us 
 jean valjean did everything smoothed away every difficulty arranged everything made everything easy 
 he hastened towards happiness with as much ardor and apparently with as much joy as cosette herself 
 as he had been a mayor he understood how to solve that delicate problem with the secret of which he alone was acquainted civil status 
 if he were to announce her origin bluntly it might prevent the marriage who knows 
 he extricated cosette from all difficulties 
 he concocted for her a family of dead people a sure means of not encountering any objections cosette was the only scion of an extinct family cosette was not his own daughter but the daughter of the other fauchelevent two brothers fauchelevent had been gardeners to the convent of the inquiry was made at that convent the very best information and the most respectable references abounded the good nuns not very apt and but little inclined to fathom questions of paternity and not attaching any importance to the matter had never understood exactly of which of the two fauchelevents cosette was the daughter they said what was wanted and they said it with zeal 
 an acte de notoriete was drawn up 
 cosette became in the eyes of the law mademoiselle euphrasie fauchelevent 
 she was declared an orphan both father and mother being dead 
 jean valjean so arranged it that he was appointed under the name of fauchelevent as guardian with m gillenormand as supervising guardian over him 
 as for the five hundred and eighty thousand francs they constituted a legacy bequeathed to cosette by a dead person who desired to remain unknown 
 the original legacy had consisted of five hundred and thousand francs but ten thousand francs had been expended on the education of mademoiselle euphrasie five thousand francs of that amount having been paid to the convent this legacy deposited in the hands of a third party was to be turned over to cosette at her majority or at the date of her marriage this taken as a whole was very acceptable as the reader will perceive especially when the sum due was half a million 
 there were some peculiarities here and there it is true but they were not noticed one of the interested parties had his eyes blindfolded by love the others by the six hundred thousand francs 
 cosette learned that she was not the daughter of that old man whom she had so long called father 
 he was merely a kinsman another fauchelevent was her real father 
 at any other time this would have broken her heart 
 but at the ineffable moment which she was then passing through it cast but a slight shadow a faint cloud and she was so full of joy that the cloud did not last long she had marius 
 the young man arrived the old man was effaced such is life 
 and then cosette had for long years been habituated to seeing enigmas around her every being who has had a mysterious childhood is always prepared for certain renunciations 
 nevertheless she continued to call jean valjean 
 father 
 cosette happy as the angels was enthusiastic over father gillenormand it is true that he overwhelmed her with gallant compliments and presents 
 while jean valjean was building up for cosette a normal situation in society and an unassailable status m gillenormand was superintending the basket of wedding gifts 
 nothing so amused him as being magnificent 
 he had given to cosette a robe of binche guipure which had descended to him from his own grandmother 
 these fashions come up again said he ancient things are the rage and the young women of my old age dress like the old women of my childhood 
 he rifled his respectable chests of drawers in coromandel lacquer with swelling fronts which had not been opened for us hear the confession of these dowagers he said let us see what they have in their paunches 
 he noisily violated the drawers of all his wives of all his mistresses and of all his grandmothers pekins damasks lampas painted moires robes of shot gros de tours india kerchiefs embroidered in gold that could be washed dauphines without a right or wrong side in the piece genoa and alencon point lace parures in antique work ivory boxes ornamented with microscopic battles gewgaws and ribbons he lavished everything on cosette 
 cosette amazed desperately in love with marius and wild with gratitude towards m gillenormand dreamed of a happiness without limit clothed in satin and velvet her wedding basket seemed to her to be upheld by seraphim her soul flew out into the azure depths with wings of mechlin lace 
 the intoxication of the lovers was only equalled as we have already said by the ecstasy of the grandfather 
 a sort of flourish of trumpets went on in the rue des 
 every morning a fresh offering of from the grandfather to cosette 
 all possible knickknacks glittered around her 
 one day marius who was fond of talking gravely in the midst of his bliss said apropos of i know not what incident 
 the men of the revolution are so great that they have the prestige of the ages like cato and like phocion and each one of them seems to me an antique memory 
 moire antique exclaimed the old gentleman 
 thanks marius that is precisely the idea of which i was in search 
 and on the following day a magnificent dress of colored moire antique was added to wedding presents 
 from these fripperies the grandfather extracted a bit of wisdom 
 love is all very well but there must be something else to go with it 
 the useless must be mingled with happiness 
 happiness is only the necessary 
 season that enormously with the superfluous for me 
 a palace and her heart 
 her heart and the louvre her heart and the grand waterworks of versailles 
 give me my shepherdess and try to make her a duchess 
 fetch me phyllis crowned with and add a hundred thousand francs income open for me a bucolic perspective as far as you can see beneath a marble colonnade 
 i consent to the bucolic and also to the fairy spectacle of marble and gold 
 dry happiness resembles dry bread one eats but one does not dine 
 i want the superfluous the useless the extravagant excess that which serves no purpose i remember to have seen in the cathedral of strasburg a clock as tall as a house which marked the hours which had the kindness to indicate the hour but which had not the air of being made for that and which after having struck midday or midnight midday the hour of the sun or midnight the hour of love or any other hour that you like gave you the moon and the stars the earth and the sea birds and fishes phoebus and phoebe and a host of things which emerged from a niche and the twelve apostles and the emperor charles the fifth and eponine and sabinus and a throng of little gilded goodmen who played on the trumpet to boot 
 without reckoning delicious chimes which it sprinkled through the air on every occasion without any knowing why is a petty bald which merely tells the hour equal to that for my part i am of the opinion of the big clock of strasburg and i prefer it to the cuckoo clock from the black forest 
 m gillenormand talked nonsense in connection with the wedding and all the fripperies of the eighteenth century passed through his dithyrambs 
 you are ignorant of the art of festivals 
 you do not know how to organize a day of enjoyment in this age he exclaimed your nineteenth century is weak 
 it lacks excess 
 it ignores the rich it ignores the noble 
 in everything it is your third estate is insipid colorless odorless and shapeless the dreams of your bourgeois who set up as they express it a pretty boudoir freshly decorated violet ebony and calico make way 
 make way the sieur curmudgeon is marrying mademoiselle sumptuousness and splendor 
 a louis has been stuck to a candle 
 the epoch for you 
 my demand is that i may flee from it beyond the sarmatians 
 ah in i predict that all was lost from the day when i beheld the duc de rohan prince de leon duc de chabot duc de montbazon marquis de sonbise vicomte de thouars peer of france go to longchamps in a tapecu that has borne its fruits 
 in this century men attend to business they gamble on change they win money they are stingy 
 people take care of their surfaces and varnish them every one is dressed as though just out of a washed soaped scraped shaved combed waked smoothed rubbed brushed cleaned on the outside irreproachable polished as a pebble discreet neat and at the same time death of my life in the depths of their consciences they have and cesspools that are enough to make a who blows his nose in his fingers recoil 
 i grant to this age the device dirty cleanliness 
 be vexed marius give me permission to speak i say no evil of the people as you see i am always harping on your people but do look favorably on my dealing a bit of a slap to the bourgeoisie 
 i belong to it 
 he who loves well lashes well 
 thereupon i say plainly that people marry but that they no longer know how to marry 
 ah it is true i regret the grace of the ancient manners 
 i regret everything about them their elegance their chivalry those courteous and delicate ways that joyous luxury which every one possessed music forming part of the wedding a symphony above stairs a beating of drums below stairs the dances the joyous faces round the table the gallant compliments the songs the fireworks the frank laughter the own row the huge knots of ribbon 
 i regret the garter 
 the garter is cousin to the girdle of venus on what does the war of troy turn 
 on garter parbleu why did they fight why did diomed the divine break over the head of meriones that great brazen helmet of ten points why did achilles and hector hew each other up with vast blows of their lances because helen allowed paris to take her garter

 chapter xiii 
 
 when pierre and his wife entered the drawing room the countess was in one of her customary states in which she needed the mental exertion of playing patience and so though by force of habit she greeted him with the words she always used when pierre or her son returned after an absence high time my dear high time we were all weary of waiting for you well thank god and received her presents with another customary remark not the gift precious my dear but that you give it to me an old woman yet it was evident that she was not pleased by arrival at that moment when it diverted her attention from the unfinished game 
 she finished her game of patience and only then examined the presents they consisted of a box for cards of splendid workmanship a sevres tea cup with shepherdesses depicted on it and with a lid and a gold snuffbox with the portrait on the lid which pierre had had done by a miniaturist in petersburg the countess had long wished for such a box but as she did not want to cry just then she glanced indifferently at the portrait and gave her attention chiefly to the box for cards 
 thank you my dear you have cheered me up said she as she always did but best of all you have brought yourself back for i never saw anything like it you ought to give your wife a scolding what are 
 we to do with her she is like a mad woman when you are away see anything remember anything she went on repeating her usual phrases look anna timofeevna she added to her companion see what a box for cards my son has brought us 
 belova admired the presents and was delighted with her dress material 
 though pierre natasha nicholas countess mary and denisov had much to talk about that they could not discuss before the old countess not that anything was hidden from her but because she had dropped so far behindhand in many things that had they begun to converse in her presence they would have had to answer inopportune questions and to repeat what they had already told her many times that was dead and was married which she would again be unable to remember yet they sat at tea round the samovar in the drawing room from habit and pierre answered the countess questions as to whether prince vasili had aged and whether countess mary alexeevna had sent greetings and still thought of them and other matters that interested no one and to which she herself was indifferent 
 conversation of this kind interesting to no one yet unavoidable continued all through teatime all the members of the family were assembled near the round tea table at which sonya presided beside the samovar the children with their tutors and governesses had had tea and their voices were audible from the next room at tea all sat in their accustomed places nicholas beside the stove at a small table where his tea was handed to him milka the old gray borzoi bitch daughter of the first milka with a quite gray face and large black eyes that seemed more prominent than ever lay on the armchair beside him denisov whose curly hair mustache and whiskers had turned half gray sat beside countess mary with his tunic unbuttoned pierre sat between his wife and the old countess he spoke of what he knew might interest the old lady and that she could understand he told her of external social events and of the people who had formed the circle of her contemporaries and had once been a real living and distinct group but who were now for the most part scattered about the world and like herself were garnering the last ears of the harvests they had sown in earlier years but to the old countess those contemporaries of hers seemed to be the only serious and real society natasha saw by animation that his visit had been interesting and that he had much to tell them but dare not say it before the old countess denisov not being a member of the family did not understand caution and being as a malcontent much interested in what was occurring in petersburg kept urging pierre to tell them about what had happened in the semenovsk regiment then about arakcheev and then about the bible society once or twice pierre was carried away and began to speak of these things but nicholas and natasha always brought him back to the health of prince ivan and countess mary alexeevna 
 well and all this idiocy gossner and tatawinova denisov asked is that weally still going on 
 going on pierre exclaimed why more than ever the bible society is the whole government now 
 what is that mon cher ami asked the countess who had finished her tea and evidently needed a pretext for being angry after her meal what are you saying about the government i understand 
 well you know maman nicholas interposed knowing how to translate things into his language prince alexander golitsyn has founded a society and in consequence has great influence they say 
 arakcheev and golitsyn incautiously remarked pierre are now the whole government and what a government they see treason everywhere and are afraid of everything 
 well and how is prince alexander to blame he is a most estimable man i used to meet him at mary said the countess in an offended tone and still more offended that they all remained silent she went on nowadays everyone finds fault a gospel society well and what harm is there in that and she rose everybody else got up too and with a severe expression sailed back to her table in the sitting room 
 the melancholy silence that followed was broken by the sounds of the voices and laughter from the next room evidently some jolly excitement was going on there 
 finished finished little gleeful yell rose above them all 
 pierre exchanged glances with countess mary and nicholas natasha he never lost sight of and smiled happily 
 delightful music said he 
 it means that anna makarovna has finished her stocking said countess mary 
 oh go and see said pierre jumping up you know he added stopping at the door why especially fond of that music it is always the first thing that tells me all is well when i was driving here today the nearer i got to the house the more anxious i grew as i entered the anteroom i heard peals of laughter and that meant that all was well 
 i know i know that feeling said nicholas but i go there those stockings are to be a surprise for me 
 pierre went to the children and the shouting and laughter grew still louder 
 come anna makarovna voice was heard saying come here into the middle of the room and at the word of command one two and when i say three you stand here and you in my arms well now one two said pierre and a silence followed three and a rapturously breathless cry of voices filled the room two two they shouted 
 this meant two stockings which by a secret process known only to herself anna makarovna used to knit at the same time on the same needles and which when they were ready she always triumphantly drew one out of the other in the presence

 what is that mon cher ami asked the countess who had finished her tea and evidently needed a pretext for being angry after her meal what are you saying about the government i understand 
 well you know maman nicholas interposed knowing how to translate things into his language prince alexander golitsyn has founded a society and in consequence has great influence they say 
 arakcheev and golitsyn incautiously remarked pierre are now the whole government and what a government they see treason everywhere and are afraid of everything 
 well and how is prince alexander to blame he is a most estimable man i used to meet him at mary said the countess in an offended tone and still more offended that they all remained silent she went on nowadays everyone finds fault a gospel society well and what harm is there in that and she rose everybody else got up too and with a severe expression sailed back to her table in the sitting room 
 the melancholy silence that followed was broken by the sounds of the voices and laughter from the next room evidently some jolly excitement was going on there 
 finished finished little gleeful yell rose above them all 
 pierre exchanged glances with countess mary and nicholas natasha he never lost sight of and smiled happily 
 delightful music said he 
 it means that anna makarovna has finished her stocking said countess mary 
 oh go and see said pierre jumping up you know he added stopping at the door why especially fond of that music it is always the first thing that tells me all is well when i was driving here today the nearer i got to the house the more anxious i grew as i entered the anteroom i heard peals of laughter and that meant that all was well 
 i know i know that feeling said nicholas but i go there those stockings are to be a surprise for me 
 pierre went to the children and the shouting and laughter grew still louder 
 come anna makarovna voice was heard saying come here into the middle of the room and at the word of command one two and when i say three you stand here and you in my arms well now one two said pierre and a silence followed three and a rapturously breathless cry of voices filled the room two two they shouted 
 this meant two stockings which by a secret process known only to herself anna makarovna used to knit at the same time on the same needles and which when they were ready she always triumphantly drew one out of the other in the presence

 first epilogue 
 chapter xiv 
 
 soon after this the children came in to say good night they kissed everyone the tutors and governesses made their bows and they went out only young nicholas and his tutor remained dessalles whispered to the boy to come downstairs 
 no monsieur dessalles i will ask my aunt to let me stay replied nicholas bolkonski also in a whisper 
 ma tante please let me stay said he going up to his aunt 
 his face expressed entreaty agitation and ecstasy countess mary glanced at him and turned to pierre 
 when you are here he tear himself away she said 
 i will bring him to you directly monsieur dessalles good night said pierre giving his hand to the swiss tutor and he turned to young nicholas with a smile you and i seen anything of one another yet how like he is growing mary he added addressing countess mary 
 like my father asked the boy flushing crimson and looking up at pierre with bright ecstatic eyes 
 pierre nodded and went on with what he had been saying when the children had interrupted countess mary sat down doing woolwork natasha did not take her eyes off her husband nicholas and denisov rose asked for their pipes smoked went to fetch more tea from sonya who sat weary but resolute at the samovar and questioned pierre the delicate boy sat with shining eyes unnoticed in a corner starting every now and then and muttering something to himself and evidently experiencing a new and powerful emotion as he turned his curly head with his thin neck exposed by his collar toward the place where pierre sat 
 the conversation turned on the contemporary gossip about those in power in which most people see the chief interest of home politics denisov dissatisfied with the government on account of his own disappointments in the service heard with pleasure of the things done in petersburg which seemed to him stupid and made forcible and sharp comments on what pierre told them 
 one used to have to be a german now one must dance with tatawinova and madame kwudener and wead and the bwethwen oh they should let that fine fellow bonaparte lose knock all this nonsense out of them fancy giving the command of the semenov wegiment to a fellow like that he cried 
 nicholas though free from readiness to find fault with everything also thought that discussion of the government was a very serious and weighty matter and the fact that a had been appointed minister of this and b governor general of that and that the emperor had said and this minister seemed to him very important and so he thought it necessary to take an interest in these things and to question pierre the questions put by these two kept the conversation from changing its ordinary character of gossip about the higher government circles 
 but natasha knowing all her ways and ideas saw that he had long been wishing but had been unable to divert the conversation to another channel and express his own deeply felt idea for the sake of which he had gone to petersburg to consult with his new friend prince theodore and she helped him by asking how his affairs with prince theodore had gone 
 what was it about asked nicholas 
 always the same thing said pierre looking round at his listeners everybody sees that things are going so badly that they cannot be allowed to go on so and that it is the duty of all decent men to counteract it as far as they can 
 what can decent men do nicholas inquired frowning slightly what can be done 
 why this 
 come into my study said nicholas 
 natasha who had long expected to be fetched to nurse her baby now heard the nurse calling her and went to the nursery countess mary followed her the men went into the study and little nicholas bolkonski followed them unnoticed by his uncle and sat down at the writing table in a shady corner by the window 
 well what would you do asked denisov 
 always some fantastic schemes said nicholas 
 why this began pierre not sitting down but pacing the room sometimes stopping short gesticulating and lisping the position in petersburg is this the emperor does not look into anything he has abandoned himself altogether to this mysticism pierre could not tolerate mysticism in anyone now he seeks only for peace and only these people sans foi ni loi can give it him people who recklessly hack at and strangle everything magnitski arakcheev and tutti quanti you will agree that if you did not look after your estates yourself but only wanted a quiet life the harsher your steward was the more readily your object might be attained he said to nicholas 
 without faith or law 
 well what does that lead up to said nicholas 
 well everything is going to ruin robbery in the law courts in the army nothing but flogging drilling and military settlements the people are tortured enlightenment is suppressed all that is young and honest is crushed everyone sees that this cannot go on everything is strained to such a degree that it will certainly break said pierre as those who examine the actions of any government have always said since governments began i told them just one thing in petersburg 
 told whom 
 well you know whom said pierre with a meaning glance from under his brows prince theodore and all those to encourage culture and philanthropy is all very well of course the aim is excellent but in the present circumstances something else is needed 
 at that moment nicholas noticed the presence of his nephew his face darkened and he went up to the boy 
 why are you here 
 why let him be said pierre taking nicholas by the arm and continuing that is not enough i told them something else is needed when you stand expecting the overstrained string to snap at any moment when everyone is expecting the inevitable catastrophe as many as possible must join hands as closely as they can to withstand the general calamity everything that is young and strong is being enticed away and depraved one is lured by women another by honors a third by ambition or money and they go over to that camp no independent men such as you or i are left what i say is widen the scope of our society let the mot be not virtue alone but independence and action as well 
 nicholas who had left his nephew irritably pushed up an armchair sat down in it and listened to pierre coughing discontentedly and frowning more and more 
 but action with what aim he cried and what position will you adopt toward the government 
 why the position of assistants the society need not be secret if the government allows it not merely is it not hostile to government but it is a society of true conservatives a society of gentlemen in the full meaning of that word it is only to prevent some pugachev or other from killing my children and yours and arakcheev from sending me off to some military settlement we join hands only for the public welfare and the general safety 
 yes but a secret society and therefore a hostile and harmful one which can only cause harm 
 why did the tugendbund which saved europe they did not then venture to suggest that russia had saved europe do any harm the tugendbund is an alliance of virtue it is love mutual help it is what christ preached on the cross 
 natasha who had come in during the conversation looked joyfully at her husband it was not what he was saying that pleased her that did not even interest her for it seemed to her that was all extremely simple and that she had known it a long time it seemed so to her because she knew that it sprang from whole soul but it was his animated and enthusiastic appearance that made her glad 
 the boy with the thin neck stretching out from the collar whom everyone had forgotten gazed at pierre with even greater and more rapturous joy every word of burned into his heart and with a nervous movement of his fingers he unconsciously broke the sealing wax and quill pens his hands came upon on his table 
 it is not at all what you suppose but that is what the german tugendbund was and what i am proposing 
 no my fwiend the tugendbund is all vewy well for the sausage eaters but i understand it and even pwonounce it interposed denisov in a loud and resolute voice i agwee that evewything here is wotten and howwible but the tugendbund i understand if not satisfied let us have a bunt of our own all wight je suis homme 
 your man 
 pierre smiled natasha began to laugh but nicholas knitted his brows still more and began proving to pierre that there was no prospect of any great change and that all the danger he spoke of existed only in his imagination pierre maintained the contrary and as his mental faculties were greater and more resourceful nicholas felt himself cornered this made him still angrier for he was fully convinced not by reasoning but by something within him stronger than reason of the justice of his opinion 
 i will tell you this he said rising and trying with nervously twitching fingers to prop up his pipe in a corner but finally abandoning the attempt i prove it to you you say that everything here is rotten and that an overthrow is coming i see it but you also say that our oath of allegiance is a conditional matter and to that i reply you are my best friend as you know but if you formed a secret society and began working against the government be it what it may i know it is my duty to obey the government and if arakcheev ordered me to lead a squadron against you and cut you down i should not hesitate an instant but should do it and you may argue about that as you like 
 an awkward silence followed these words natasha was the first to speak defending her husband and attacking her brother her defense was weak and inapt but she attained her object the conversation was resumed and no longer in the unpleasantly hostile tone of nicholas last remark 
 when they all got up to go in to supper little nicholas bolkonski went up to pierre pale and with shining radiant eyes 
 uncle pierre you no if papa were alive would he agree with you he asked 
 and pierre suddenly realized what a special independent complex and powerful process of thought and feeling must have been going on in this boy during that conversation and remembering all he had said he regretted that the lad should have heard him he had however to give him an answer 
 yes i think so he said reluctantly and left the study 
 the lad looked down and seemed now for the first time to notice what he had done to the things on the table he flushed and went up to nicholas 
 uncle forgive me i did that unintentionally he said pointing to the broken sealing wax and pens 
 nicholas started angrily 
 all right all right he said throwing the bits under the table 
 and evidently suppressing his vexation with difficulty he turned away from the boy 
 you ought not to have been here at all he said

 chapter viii 
 
 two men impossible to find 
 marius enchantment great as it was could not efface from his mind other 
 while the wedding was in preparation and while awaiting the date fixed upon he caused difficult and scrupulous retrospective researches to be made 
 he owed gratitude in various quarters he owed it on his account he owed it on his own 
 there was thenardier there was the unknown man who had brought him marius back to m gillenormand 
 marius endeavored to find these two men not intending to marry to be happy and to forget them and fearing that were these debts of gratitude not discharged they would leave a shadow on his life which promised so brightly for the future 
 it was impossible for him to leave all these arrears of suffering behind him and he wished before entering joyously into the future to obtain a quittance from the past 
 that thenardier was a villain detracted nothing from the fact that he had saved colonel pontmercy 
 thenardier was a ruffian in the eyes of all the world except marius 
 and marius ignorant of the real scene in the battle field of waterloo was not aware of the peculiar detail that his father so far as thenardier was concerned was in the strange position of being indebted to the latter for his life without being indebted to him for any gratitude 
 none of the various agents whom marius employed succeeded in discovering any trace of thenardier 
 obliteration appeared to be complete in that quarter 
 madame thenardier had died in prison pending the trial 
 thenardier and his daughter azelma the only two remaining of that lamentable group had plunged back into the gloom the gulf of the social unknown had silently closed above those beings on the surface there was not visible so much as that quiver that trembling those obscure concentric circles which announce that something has fallen in and that the plummet may be dropped 
 madame thenardier being dead boulatruelle being eliminated from the case claquesous having disappeared the principal persons accused having escaped from prison the trial connected with the ambush in the gorbeau house had come to nothing 
 that affair had remained rather obscure 
 the bench of assizes had been obliged to content themselves with two subordinates 
 panchaud alias printanier alias bigrenaille and alias who had been inconsistently condemned after a hearing of both sides of the case to ten years in the galleys 
 hard labor for life had been the sentence pronounced against the escaped and contumacious accomplices 
 thenardier the head and leader had been through contumacy likewise condemned to death 
 this sentence was the only information remaining about thenardier casting upon that buried name its sinister light like a candle beside a bier 
 moreover by thrusting thenardier back into the very remotest depths through a fear of being this sentence added to the density of the shadows which enveloped this man

 two men impossible to find 
 marius enchantment great as it was could not efface from his mind other 
 while the wedding was in preparation and while awaiting the date fixed upon he caused difficult and scrupulous retrospective researches to be made 
 he owed gratitude in various quarters he owed it on his account he owed it on his own 
 there was thenardier there was the unknown man who had brought him marius back to m gillenormand 
 marius endeavored to find these two men not intending to marry to be happy and to forget them and fearing that were these debts of gratitude not discharged they would leave a shadow on his life which promised so brightly for the future 
 it was impossible for him to leave all these arrears of suffering behind him and he wished before entering joyously into the future to obtain a quittance from the past 
 that thenardier was a villain detracted nothing from the fact that he had saved colonel pontmercy 
 thenardier was a ruffian in the eyes of all the world except marius 
 and marius ignorant of the real scene in the battle field of waterloo was not aware of the peculiar detail that his father so far as thenardier was concerned was in the strange position of being indebted to the latter for his life without being indebted to him for any gratitude 
 none of the various agents whom marius employed succeeded in discovering any trace of thenardier 
 obliteration appeared to be complete in that quarter 
 madame thenardier had died in prison pending the trial 
 thenardier and his daughter azelma the only two remaining of that lamentable group had plunged back into the gloom the gulf of the social unknown had silently closed above those beings on the surface there was not visible so much as that quiver that trembling those obscure concentric circles which announce that something has fallen in and that the plummet may be dropped 
 madame thenardier being dead boulatruelle being eliminated from the case claquesous having disappeared the principal persons accused having escaped from prison the trial connected with the ambush in the gorbeau house had come to nothing 
 that affair had remained rather obscure 
 the bench of assizes had been obliged to content themselves with two subordinates 
 panchaud alias printanier alias bigrenaille and alias who had been inconsistently condemned after a hearing of both sides of the case to ten years in the galleys 
 hard labor for life had been the sentence pronounced against the escaped and contumacious accomplices 
 thenardier the head and leader had been through contumacy likewise condemned to death 
 this sentence was the only information remaining about thenardier casting upon that buried name its sinister light like a candle beside a bier 
 moreover by thrusting thenardier back into the very remotest depths through a fear of being this sentence added to the density of the shadows which enveloped this man 
 as for the other person as for the unknown man who had saved marius the researches were at first to some extent successful then came to an abrupt conclusion 
 they succeeded in finding the carriage which had brought marius to the rue des on the evening of the th of june 
 the coachman declared that on the th of june in obedience to the commands of a he had stood from three in the afternoon until nightfall on the quai des above the outlet of the grand sewer that towards nine in the evening the grating of the sewer which abuts on the bank of the river had opened that a man had emerged therefrom bearing on his shoulders another man who seemed to be dead that the agent who was on the watch at that point had arrested the living man and had seized the dead man that at the order of the he the coachman had taken all those folks into his carriage that they had first driven to the rue des that they had there deposited the dead man that the dead man was monsieur marius and that he the coachman recognized him perfectly although he was alive this time that afterwards they had entered the vehicle again that he had whipped up his horses a few paces from the gate of the archives they had called to him to halt that there in the street they had paid him and left him and that the had led the other man away that he knew nothing more that the night had been very dark

 the conversation at supper was not about politics or societies but turned on the subject nicholas liked best recollections of denisov started these and pierre was particularly agreeable and amusing about them the family separated on the most friendly terms 
 after supper nicholas having undressed in his study and given instructions to the steward who had been waiting for him went to the bedroom in his dressing gown where he found his wife still at her table writing 
 what are you writing mary nicholas asked 
 countess mary blushed she was afraid that what she was writing would not be understood or approved by her husband 
 she had wanted to conceal what she was writing from him but at the same time was glad he had surprised her at it and that she would now have to tell him 
 a diary nicholas she replied handing him a blue exercise book filled with her firm bold writing 
 a diary nicholas repeated with a shade of irony and he took up the book 
 it was in french 
 december today when andrusha her eldest boy woke up he did not wish to dress and mademoiselle louise sent for me he was naughty and obstinate i tried threats but he only grew angrier then i took the matter in hand i left him alone and began with help to get the other children up telling him that i did not love him for a long time he was silent as if astonished then he jumped out of bed ran to me in his shirt and sobbed so that i could not calm him for a long time it was plain that what troubled him most was that he had grieved me afterwards in the evening when i gave him his ticket he again began crying piteously and kissing me one can do anything with him by tenderness 
 what is a ticket nicholas inquired 
 i have begun giving the elder ones marks every evening showing how they have behaved 
 nicholas looked into the radiant eyes that were gazing at him and continued to turn over the pages and read in the diary was set down everything in the lives that seemed noteworthy to their mother as showing their characters or suggesting general reflections on educational methods they were for the most part quite insignificant trifles but did not seem so to the mother or to the father either now that he read this diary about his children for the first time 
 under the date was entered 
 mitya was naughty at table papa said he was to have no pudding he had none but looked so unhappily and greedily at the others while they were eating i think that punishment by depriving children of sweets only develops their greediness must tell nicholas this 
 nicholas put down the book and looked at his wife the radiant eyes gazed at him questioningly would he approve or disapprove of her diary there could be no doubt not only of his approval but also of his admiration for his wife 
 perhaps it need not be done so pedantically thought nicholas or even done at all but this untiring continual spiritual effort of which the sole aim was the moral welfare delighted him had nicholas been able to analyze his feelings he would have found that his steady tender and proud love of his wife rested on his feeling of wonder at her spirituality and at the lofty moral world almost beyond his reach in which she had her being 
 he was proud of her intelligence and goodness recognized his own insignificance beside her in the spiritual world and rejoiced all the more that she with such a soul not only belonged to him but was part of himself 
 i quite quite approve my dearest said he with a significant look and after a short pause he added and i behaved badly today you in the study we began disputing pierre and i and i lost my temper but he is impossible such a child i know what would become of him if natasha keep him in hand have you any idea why he went to petersburg they have formed 
 yes i know said countess mary natasha told me 
 well then you know nicholas went on growing hot at the mere recollection of their discussion he wanted to convince me that it is every honest duty to go against the government and that the oath of allegiance and duty i am sorry you there they all fell on me denisov and natasha natasha is absurd how she rules over him and yet there need only be a discussion and she has no words of her own but only repeats his sayings added nicholas yielding to that irresistible inclination which tempts us to judge those nearest and dearest to us he forgot that what he was saying about natasha could have been applied word for word to himself in relation to his wife 
 yes i have noticed that said countess mary 
 when i told him that duty and the oath were above everything he started proving goodness knows what a pity you were not there what would you have said 
 as i see it you were quite right and i told natasha so pierre says everybody is suffering tortured and being corrupted and that it is our duty to help our neighbor of course he is right there said countess mary but he forgets that we have other duties nearer to us duties indicated to us by god himself and that though we might expose ourselves to risks we must not risk our children 
 yes it just what i said to him put in nicholas who fancied he really had said it but they insisted on their own view love of neighbor and christianity and all this in the presence of young nicholas who had gone into my study and broke all my things 
 ah nicholas do you know i am often troubled about little nicholas said countess mary he is such an exceptional boy i am afraid i neglect him in favor of my own we all have children and relations while he has no one he is constantly alone with his thoughts

 book sleepless night 
 chapter i 
 
 the th of february 
 the night of the th to the th of february was a blessed night above its shadows heaven stood open 
 it was the wedding night of marius and cosette 
 the day had been adorable 
 it had not been the grand festival dreamed by the grandfather a fairy spectacle with a confusion of cherubim and cupids over the heads of the bridal pair a marriage worthy to form the subject of a painting to be placed over a door but it had been sweet and smiling 
 the manner of marriage in was not the same as it is france had not yet borrowed from england that supreme delicacy of carrying off wife of fleeing on coming out of church of hiding oneself with shame from happiness and of combining the ways of a bankrupt with the delights of the song of songs people had not yet grasped to the full the chastity exquisiteness and decency of jolting their paradise in a of breaking up their mystery with of taking for a nuptial bed the bed of an inn and of leaving behind them in a commonplace chamber at so much a night the most sacred of the souvenirs of life mingled with the of the conductor of the diligence and the of the inn 
 in this second half of the nineteenth century in which we are now living the mayor and his scarf the priest and his chasuble the law and god no longer suffice they must be eked out by the postilion de lonjumeau a blue waistcoat turned up with red and with bell buttons a plaque like a vantbrace of green leather oaths to the norman horses with their tails knotted up false galloons varnished hat long powdered locks an enormous whip and tall boots france does not yet carry elegance to the length of doing like the english nobility and raining down on the of the bridal pair a hail storm of slippers trodden down at heel and of shoes in memory of churchill afterwards marlborough or malbrouck who was assailed on his by the wrath of an aunt which brought him good luck 
 old shoes and slippers do not as yet form a part of our nuptial celebrations but patience as good taste continues to spread we shall come to that 
 in a hundred years ago marriage was not conducted at a full trot 
 strange to say at that epoch people still imagined that a wedding was a private and social festival that a patriarchal banquet does not spoil a domestic solemnity that gayety even in excess provided it be honest and decent does happiness no harm and that in short it is a good and a venerable thing that the fusion of these two destinies whence a family is destined to spring should begin at home and that the household should thenceforth have its nuptial chamber as its witness 
 and people were so immodest as to marry in their own homes 
 the marriage took place therefore in accordance with this now superannuated fashion at m house 
 natural and commonplace as this matter of marrying is the banns to publish the papers to be drawn up the mayoralty and the church produce some complication 
 they could not get ready before the th of february 
 now we note this detail for the pure satisfaction of being exact it chanced that the th fell on shrove tuesday 
 hesitations scruples particularly on the part of aunt gillenormand 
 shrove tuesday exclaimed the grandfather so much the better there is a proverb 
 mariage un mardi gras 
 point enfants ingrats 
 a marriage will have no ungrateful children 
 let us proceed 
 here goes for the th 
 do you want to delay marius 
 no certainly not replied the lover 
 let us marry then cried the grandfather 
 accordingly the marriage took place on the th notwithstanding the public merrymaking 
 it rained that day but there is always in the sky a tiny scrap of blue at the service of happiness which lovers see even when the rest of creation is under an umbrella 
 on the preceding evening jean valjean handed to marius in the presence of m gillenormand the five hundred and thousand francs 
 as the marriage was taking place under the regime of community of property the papers had been simple 
 henceforth toussaint was of no use to jean valjean cosette inherited her and promoted her to the rank of maid 
 as for jean valjean a beautiful chamber in the gillenormand house had been furnished expressly for him and cosette had said to him in such an irresistible manner 
 father i entreat you that she had almost persuaded him to promise that he would come and occupy it 
 a few days before that fixed on for the marriage an accident happened to jean valjean he crushed the thumb of his right hand this was not a serious matter and he had not allowed any one to trouble himself about it nor to dress it nor even to see his hurt not even cosette 
 nevertheless this had forced him to swathe his hand in a linen bandage and to carry his arm in a sling and had prevented his signing

 we will confine ourselves to noting an incident which though unnoticed by the wedding party marked the transit from the rue des to the church of

 the nuptial train on emerging from the rue des became entangled in a long procession of vehicles which formed an endless chain from the madeleine to the bastille and from the bastille to the madeleine maskers abounded on the boulevard

 such shrove tuesdays are no longer to be seen everything which exists being a scattered carnival there is no longer any carnival 
 the sidewalks were overflowing with pedestrians and the windows with curious spectators 
 the terraces which crown the peristyles of the theatres were bordered with spectators 
 besides the maskers they stared at that to shrove tuesday as to longchamps of vehicles of every description citadines tapissieres carioles cabriolets marching in order rigorously riveted to each other by the police regulations and locked into rails as it were any one in these vehicles is at once a spectator and a spectacle maintained on the sides of the boulevard these two interminable parallel files moving in contrary directions and saw to it that nothing interfered with that double current those two brooks of carriages flowing the one down stream the other up stream the one towards the chaussee the other towards the faubourg the carriages of the peers of france and of the ambassadors emblazoned with coats of arms held the middle of the way going and coming freely 
 certain joyous and magnificent trains notably that of the boeuf gras had the same privilege 
 in this gayety of paris england cracked her whip lord harassed by a nickname from the populace passed with great noise 
 in the double file along which the municipal guards galloped like honest family coaches loaded down with and grandmothers displayed at their doors fresh groups of children in disguise clowns of seven years of age columbines of six ravishing little creatures who felt that they formed an official part of the public mirth who were imbued with the dignity of their harlequinade and who possessed the gravity of functionaries 
 from time to time a hitch arose somewhere in the procession of vehicles one or other of the two lateral files halted until the knot was disentangled one carriage delayed sufficed to paralyze the whole line 
 then they set out again on the march 
 the wedding carriages were in the file proceeding towards the bastille and skirting the right side of the boulevard 
 at the top of the there was a stoppage 
 nearly at the same moment the other file which was proceeding towards the madeleine halted also 
 at that point of the file there was a of maskers

 something behind that 
 probably the ministry is about to undergo a change 
 a pile of cassandras harlequins and columbines jolted along high above the all possible grotesquenesses from the turk to the savage hercules supporting marquises fishwives who would have made rabelais stop up his ears just as the maenads made aristophanes drop his eyes tow wigs pink tights dandified hats spectacles of a grimacer hats of janot tormented with a butterfly shouts directed at pedestrians fists on hips bold attitudes bare shoulders immodesty unchained a chaos of shamelessness driven by a coachman crowned with flowers this is what that institution was like

 twenty of them ride in a carriage intended for six 
 they cling to the seats to the rumble on the cheeks of the hood on the shafts

 it certainly is sad that turpitude heaped up should give a sum total of gayety that by piling ignominy upon opprobrium the people should be enticed that the system of spying and serving as caryatids to prostitution should amuse the rabble when it confronts them that the crowd loves to behold that monstrous living pile of tinsel rags half dung half light roll by on four wheels howling and laughing that they should clap their hands at this glory composed of all shames that there would be no festival for the populace did not the police promenade in their midst these sorts of hydras of joy but what can be done about it

 a sham wedding retorted another 
 we are the genuine article 
 and being too far off to accost the wedding party and fearing also the rebuke of the police the two maskers turned their eyes elsewhere 
 at the end of another minute the of maskers had their hands full the multitude set to yelling which is the caress to masquerades and the two maskers who had just spoken had to face the throng with their comrades and did not find the entire repertory of projectiles of the fishmarkets too extensive to retort to the enormous verbal attacks of the populace 
 a frightful exchange of metaphors took place between the maskers and the crowd 
 in the meanwhile two other maskers in the same carriage a spaniard with an enormous nose an elderly air and huge black moustache and a gaunt fishwife who was quite a young girl masked with a loup had also noticed the wedding and while their companions and the were exchanging insults they had held a dialogue in a low voice 
 a short mask 
 their aside was covered by the tumult and was lost in it the gusts of rain had drenched the front of the vehicle which was wide open the breezes of february are not warm as the fishwife clad in a gown replied to the spaniard she shivered laughed and coughed 
 here is their dialogue 
 say now 
 what daddy 
 do you see that old cove 
 what old cove 
 yonder in the first on our side 
 the one with his arm hung up in a black cravat 
 yes 
 well

 pantinois 
 paris in pantin 
 can you see the bride if you stoop down

 and the bridegroom 
 no bridegroom in that trap 
 bah 
 unless the old fellow

 and what good does it do to know him 
 no one can tell 
 sometimes it does 
 i care a hang for old fellows that i 
 i know him 
 know him if you want to 
 how the devil does he come to be one of the wedding party 
 we are in it too 
 where does that wedding come from 
 how should i know 
 listen 
 well what 
 one thing you ought to do 
 that 
 get off of our trap and spin that wedding 
 what for 
 to find out where it goes and what it is 
 hurry up and jump down trot my girl your legs are young 
 i quit the vehicle 
 why not 
 hired 
 ah the devil 
 i owe my fishwife day to the prefecture 
 true 
 if i leave the cart the first inspector who gets his eye on me will arrest me 
 you know that well enough 
 yes i do 
 bought by the government for 
 all the same that old fellow bothers me 
 do the old fellows bother you 
 but not a young girl 
 in the first carriage 
 well 
 in the trap 
 what then 
 so he is the father 
 what concern is that of mine 
 i tell you that the father 
 as if he were the only father 
 listen 
 what 
 i go out otherwise than masked 
 here concealed no one knows that here 
 but there will be no more maskers ash wednesday 
 i run the risk of being nabbed 
 i must sneak back into my hole 
 but you are free 
 not particularly 
 more than i am at any rate 
 well what of that 
 you must try to find out where that went to 
 where it went 
 yes 
 i know 
 where is it going then 
 to the 
 in the first place not in that direction 
 well to la rapee 
 or elsewhere 
 free 
 are at liberty 
 not the point at all 
 i tell you that you must try to learn for me what that wedding is who that old cove belongs to and where that wedding pair lives 
 i like that that would be queer 
 so easy to find out a that passed through the street on a shrove tuesday a week afterwards 
 a pin in a it possible 
 that matter 
 you must try 
 you understand me azelma 
 the two files resumed their movement on both sides of the boulevard in opposite directions and the carriage of the maskers lost sight of the trap of the bride

 book sleepless night 
 chapter i 
 
 the th of february 
 the night of the th to the th of february was a blessed night above its shadows heaven stood open 
 it was the wedding night of marius and cosette 
 the day had been adorable 
 it had not been the grand festival dreamed by the grandfather a fairy spectacle with a confusion of cherubim and cupids over the heads of the bridal pair a marriage worthy to form the subject of a painting to be placed over a door but it had been sweet and smiling 
 the manner of marriage in was not the same as it is france had not yet borrowed from england that supreme delicacy of carrying off wife of fleeing on coming out of church of hiding oneself with shame from happiness and of combining the ways of a bankrupt with the delights of the song of songs people had not yet grasped to the full the chastity exquisiteness and decency of jolting their paradise in a of breaking up their mystery with of taking for a nuptial bed the bed of an inn and of leaving behind them in a commonplace chamber at so much a night the most sacred of the souvenirs of life mingled with the of the conductor of the diligence and the of the inn 
 in this second half of the nineteenth century in which we are now living the mayor and his scarf the priest and his chasuble the law and god no longer suffice they must be eked out by the postilion de lonjumeau a blue waistcoat turned up with red and with bell buttons a plaque like a vantbrace of green leather oaths to the norman horses with their tails knotted up false galloons varnished hat long powdered locks an enormous whip and tall boots france does not yet carry elegance to the length of doing like the english nobility and raining down on the of the bridal pair a hail storm of slippers trodden down at heel and of shoes in memory of churchill afterwards marlborough or malbrouck who was assailed on his by the wrath of an aunt which brought him good luck 
 old shoes and slippers do not as yet form a part of our nuptial celebrations but patience as good taste continues to spread we shall come to that 
 in a hundred years ago marriage was not conducted at a full trot 
 strange to say at that epoch people still imagined that a wedding was a private and social festival that a patriarchal banquet does not spoil a domestic solemnity that gayety even in excess provided it be honest and decent does happiness no harm and that in short it is a good and a venerable thing that the fusion of these two destinies whence a family is destined to spring should begin at home and that the household should thenceforth have its nuptial chamber as its witness 
 and people were so immodest as to marry in their own homes 
 the marriage took place therefore in accordance with this now superannuated fashion at m house 
 natural and commonplace as this matter of marrying is the banns to publish the papers to be drawn up the mayoralty and the church produce some complication 
 they could not get ready before the th of february 
 now we note this detail for the pure satisfaction of being exact it chanced that the th fell on shrove tuesday 
 hesitations scruples particularly on the part of aunt gillenormand 
 shrove tuesday exclaimed the grandfather so much the better there is a proverb 
 mariage un mardi gras 
 point enfants ingrats 
 a marriage will have no ungrateful children 
 let us proceed 
 here goes for the th 
 do you want to delay marius 
 no certainly not replied the lover 
 let us marry then cried the grandfather 
 accordingly the marriage took place on the th notwithstanding the public merrymaking 
 it rained that day but there is always in the sky a tiny scrap of blue at the service of happiness which lovers see even when the rest of creation is under an umbrella

 first epilogue 
 chapter xvi 
 
 natasha and pierre left alone also began to talk as only a husband and wife can talk that is with extraordinary clearness and rapidity understanding and expressing each thoughts in ways contrary to all rules of logic without premises deductions or conclusions and in a quite peculiar way natasha was so used to this kind of talk with her husband that for her it was the surest sign of something being wrong between them if pierre followed a line of logical reasoning when he began proving anything or talking argumentatively and calmly and she led on by his example began to do the same she knew that they were on the verge of a quarrel 
 from the moment they were alone and natasha came up to him with happy eyes and quickly seizing his head pressed it to her bosom saying now you are all mine mine you escape from that moment this conversation began contrary to all the laws of logic and contrary to them because quite different subjects were talked about at one and the same time this simultaneous discussion of many topics did not prevent a clear understanding but on the contrary was the surest sign that they fully understood one another 
 just as in a dream when all is uncertain unreasoning and contradictory except the feeling that guides the dream so in this intercourse contrary to all laws of reason the words themselves were not consecutive and clear but only the feeling that prompted them 
 natasha spoke to pierre about her life and doings of how she had suffered and lacked life during his own absence and of how she was fonder than ever of mary and how mary was in every way better than herself in saying this natasha was sincere in acknowledging superiority but at the same time by saying it she made a demand on pierre that he should all the same prefer her to mary and to all other women and that now especially after having seen many women in petersburg he should tell her so afresh 
 pierre answering words told her how intolerable it had been for him to meet ladies at dinners and balls in petersburg 
 i have quite lost the knack of talking to ladies he said it was simply dull besides i was very busy 
 natasha looked intently at him and went on 
 mary is so splendid she said how she understands children it is as if she saw straight into their souls yesterday for instance mitya was naughty 
 how like his father he is pierre interjected 
 natasha knew why he mentioned likeness to nicholas the recollection of his dispute with his was unpleasant and he wanted to know what natasha thought of it 
 nicholas has the weakness of never agreeing with anything not generally accepted but i understand that you value what opens up a fresh line said she repeating words pierre had once uttered 
 no the chief point is that to nicholas ideas and discussions are an amusement almost a pastime said pierre for instance he is collecting a library and has made it a rule not to buy a new book till he has read what he had already bought sismondi and rousseau and montesquieu he added with a smile you know how much i he began to soften down what he had said but natasha interrupted him to show that this was unnecessary 
 so you say ideas are an amusement to him 
 yes and for me nothing else is serious all the time in petersburg i saw everyone as in a dream when i am taken up by a thought all else is mere amusement 
 ah so sorry i there when you met the children said natasha which was most delighted lisa sure 
 yes pierre replied and went on with what was in his mind nicholas says we ought not to think but i help it besides when i was in petersburg i felt i can this to you that the whole affair would go to pieces without me everyone was pulling his own way but i succeeded in uniting them all and then my idea is so clear and simple you see i say that we ought to oppose this and that we may be mistaken what i say is join hands you who love the right and let there be but one banner that of active virtue prince sergey is a fine fellow and clever 
 natasha would have had no doubt as to the greatness of idea but one thing disconcerted her can a man so important and necessary to society be also my husband how did this happen she wished to express this doubt to him now who could decide whether he is really cleverer than all the others she asked herself and passed in review all those whom pierre most respected judging by what he had said there was no one he had respected so highly as platon karataev 
 do you know what i am thinking about she asked about platon karataev would he have approved of you now do you think 
 pierre was not at all surprised at this question he understood his line of thought 
 platon karataev he repeated and pondered evidently sincerely trying to imagine opinion on the subject he would not have understood yet perhaps he would

 first epilogue 
 chapter xvi 
 
 natasha and pierre left alone also began to talk as only a husband and wife can talk that is with extraordinary clearness and rapidity understanding and expressing each thoughts in ways contrary to all rules of logic without premises deductions or conclusions and in a quite peculiar way natasha was so used to this kind of talk with her husband that for her it was the surest sign of something being wrong between them if pierre followed a line of logical reasoning when he began proving anything or talking argumentatively and calmly and she led on by his example began to do the same she knew that they were on the verge of a quarrel 
 from the moment they were alone and natasha came up to him with happy eyes and quickly seizing his head pressed it to her bosom saying now you are all mine mine you escape from that moment this conversation began contrary to all the laws of logic and contrary to them because quite different subjects were talked about at one and the same time this simultaneous discussion of many topics did not prevent a clear understanding but on the contrary was the surest sign that they fully understood one another 
 just as in a dream when all is uncertain unreasoning and contradictory except the feeling that guides the dream so in this intercourse contrary to all laws of reason the words themselves were not consecutive and clear but only the feeling that prompted them 
 natasha spoke to pierre about her life and doings of how she had suffered and lacked life during his own absence and of how she was fonder than ever of mary and how mary was in every way better than herself in saying this natasha was sincere in acknowledging superiority but at the same time by saying it she made a demand on pierre that he should all the same prefer her to mary and to all other women and that now especially after having seen many women in petersburg he should tell her so afresh 
 pierre answering words told her how intolerable it had been for him to meet ladies at dinners and balls in petersburg 
 i have quite lost the knack of talking to ladies he said it was simply dull besides i was very busy 
 natasha looked intently at him and went on 
 mary is so splendid she said how she understands children it is as if she saw straight into their souls yesterday for instance mitya was naughty 
 how like his father he is pierre interjected 
 natasha knew why he mentioned likeness to nicholas the recollection of his dispute with his was unpleasant and he wanted to know what natasha thought of it 
 nicholas has the weakness of never agreeing with anything not generally accepted but i understand that you value what opens up a fresh line said she repeating words pierre had once uttered 
 no the chief point is that to nicholas ideas and discussions are an amusement almost a pastime said pierre for instance he is collecting a library and has made it a rule not to buy a new book till he has read what he had already bought sismondi and rousseau and montesquieu he added with a smile you know how much i he began to soften down what he had said but natasha interrupted him to show that this was unnecessary 
 so you say ideas are an amusement to him 
 yes and for me nothing else is serious all the time in petersburg i saw everyone as in a dream when i am taken up by a thought all else is mere amusement 
 ah so sorry i there when you met the children said natasha which was most delighted lisa sure 
 yes pierre replied and went on with what was in his mind nicholas says we ought not to think but i help it besides when i was in petersburg i felt i can this to you that the whole affair would go to pieces without me everyone was pulling his own way but i succeeded in uniting them all and then my idea is so clear and simple you see i say that we ought to oppose this and that we may be mistaken what i say is join hands you who love the right and let there be but one banner that of active virtue prince sergey is a fine fellow and clever 
 natasha would have had no doubt as to the greatness of idea but one thing disconcerted her can a man so important and necessary to society be also my husband how did this happen she wished to express this doubt to him now who could decide whether he is really cleverer than all the others she asked herself and passed in review all those whom pierre most respected judging by what he had said there was no one he had respected so highly as platon karataev 
 do you know what i am thinking about she asked about platon karataev would he have approved of you now do you think 
 pierre was not at all surprised at this question he understood his line of thought 
 platon karataev he repeated and pondered evidently sincerely trying to imagine opinion on the subject he would not have understood yet perhaps he would 
 i love you awfully natasha suddenly said awfully awfully 
 no he would not have approved said pierre after reflection what he would have approved of is our family life he was always so anxious to find seemliness happiness and peace in everything and i should have been proud to let him see us there now you talk of my absence but you believe what a special feeling i have for you after a separation 
 yes i should think natasha began 
 no not that i never leave off loving you and one love more but this is something special yes of course he did not finish because their eyes meeting said the rest 
 what nonsense it is natasha suddenly exclaimed about honeymoons and that the greatest happiness is at first on the contrary now is the best of all if only you did not go away do you remember how we quarreled and it was always my fault always mine and what we quarreled about i even remember 
 always about the same thing said pierre with a smile jealo 
 say it i bear it natasha cried and her eyes glittered coldly and vindictively did you see her she added after a pause 
 no and if i had i have recognized her 
 they were silent for a while 
 oh do you know while you were talking in the study i was looking at you natasha began evidently anxious to disperse the cloud that had come over them you are as like him as two peas like the boy she meant her little son oh time to go to him the come but sorry to leave you

 book sleepless night 
 chapter ii 
 
 jean valjean still wears his arm in a sling 
 to realize dream 
 to whom is this accorded 
 there must be elections for this in heaven we are all candidates unknown to ourselves the angels vote 
 cosette and marius had been elected 
 cosette both at the office and at church was dazzling and touching 
 toussaint assisted by nicolette had dressed her 
 cosette wore over a petticoat of white taffeta her robe of binche guipure a veil of english point a necklace of fine pearls a wreath of orange flowers all this was white and from the midst of that whiteness she beamed forth 
 it was an exquisite candor expanding and becoming transfigured in the light 
 one would have pronounced her a virgin on the point of turning into a goddess 
 marius handsome hair was lustrous and perfumed here and there beneath the thick curls pale scars of the barricade were visible 
 the grandfather haughty with head held high amalgamating more than ever in his toilet and his manners all the elegances of the epoch of barras escorted cosette 
 he took the place of jean valjean who on account of his arm being still in a sling could not give his hand to the bride 
 jean valjean dressed in black followed them with a smile 
 monsieur fauchelevent said the grandfather to him this is a fine day 
 i vote for the end of afflictions and sorrows henceforth there must be no sadness anywhere 
 pardieu i decree joy evil has no right to exist 
 that there should be any unhappy men is in sooth a disgrace to the azure of the sky 
 evil does not come from man who is good at bottom 
 all human miseries have for their capital and central government hell otherwise known as the tuileries 
 good here i am uttering demagogical words as far as i am concerned i have no longer any political opinions let all me be rich that is to say mirthful and i confine myself to that 
 when at the conclusion of all the ceremonies after having pronounced before the mayor and before the priest all possible yesses after having signed the registers at the municipality and at the sacristy after having exchanged their rings after having knelt side by side under the pall of white moire in the smoke of the censer they arrived hand in hand admired and envied by all marius in black she in white preceded by the suisse with the epaulets of a colonel tapping the pavement with his halberd between two rows of astonished spectators at the portals of the church both leaves of which were thrown wide open ready to enter their carriage again and all being finished cosette still could not believe that it was real 
 she looked at marius she looked at the crowd she looked at the sky 
 it seemed as though she feared that she should wake up from her dream 
 her amazed and uneasy air added something indescribably enchanting to her beauty they entered the same carriage to return home marius beside cosette m gillenormand and jean valjean sat opposite them aunt gillenormand had withdrawn one degree and was in the second vehicle 
 my children said the grandfather here you are monsieur le baron and madame la baronne with an income of thirty thousand livres 
 and cosette nestling close to marius caressed his ear with an angelic whisper 
 so it is true 
 my name is marius 
 i am madame thou 
 these two creatures were resplendent 
 they had reached that irrevocable and irrecoverable moment at the dazzling intersection of all youth and all joy 
 they realized the verses of jean prouvaire they were forty years old taken together 
 it was marriage sublimated these two children were two lilies 
 they did not see each other they did not contemplate each other 
 cosette perceived marius in the midst of a glory marius perceived cosette on an altar and on that altar and in that glory the two apotheoses mingling in the background one knows not how behind a cloud for cosette in a flash for marius there was the ideal thing the real thing the meeting of the kiss and the dream the nuptial pillow all the torments through which they had passed came back to them in intoxication 
 it seemed to them that their sorrows their sleepless nights their tears their anguish their terrors their despair converted into caresses and rays of light rendered still more charming 
 the charming hour which was approaching and that their griefs were but so many handmaidens who were preparing the toilet of joy how good it is to have suffered 
 their unhappiness formed a halo round their happiness 
 the long agony of their love was terminating in an ascension 
 it was the same enchantment in two souls tinged with voluptuousness in marius and with modesty in cosette 
 they said to each other in low tones 
 we will go back to take a look at our little garden in the rue plumet 
 the folds of gown lay across marius 
 such a day is an ineffable mixture of dream and of reality one possesses and one supposes 
 one still has time before one to divine the emotion on that day of being at and of dreaming of midnight is indescribable 
 the delights of these two hearts overflowed upon the crowd and inspired the with cheerfulness 
 people halted in the rue in front of to gaze through the windows of the carriage at the quivering on head 
 then they returned home to the rue des marius triumphant and radiant mounted side by side with cosette the staircase up which he had been borne in a dying condition 
 the poor who had trooped to the door and who shared their purses blessed them there were flowers everywhere 
 the house was no less fragrant than the church after the incense roses 
 they thought they heard voices carolling in the infinite they had god in their hearts destiny appeared to them like a ceiling of stars above their heads they beheld the light of a rising sun 
 all at once the clock struck marius glanced at charming bare arm and at the rosy things which were vaguely visible through the lace of her bodice and cosette intercepting marius glance blushed to her very hair 
 quite a number of old family friends of the gillenormand family had been invited they pressed about cosette 
 each one vied with the rest in saluting her as madame la baronne 
 the officer theodule gillenormand now a captain had come from chartres where he was stationed in garrison to be present at the wedding of his cousin pontmercy 
 cosette did not recognize him 
 he on his side habituated as he was to have women consider him handsome retained no more recollection of cosette than of any other woman 
 how right i was not to believe in that story about the lancer said father gillenormand to himself 
 cosette had never been more tender with jean valjean she was in unison with father gillenormand while he erected joy into aphorisms and maxims she exhaled goodness like a perfume happiness desires that all the world should be happy 
 she regained for the purpose of addressing jean valjean inflections of voice belonging to the time when she was a little girl she caressed him with her smile 
 a banquet had been spread in the 
 illumination as brilliant as the daylight is the necessary seasoning of a great joy 
 mist and obscurity are not accepted by the happy they do not consent to be black 
 the night yes the shadows no if there is no sun one must be made 
 the was full of gay things 
 in the centre above the white and glittering table was a venetian lustre with flat plates with all sorts of colored birds blue violet red and green perched amid the candles around the chandelier girandoles on the walls sconces with triple and quintuple branches mirrors silverware glassware plate porcelain faience pottery gold and work all was sparkling and gay 
 the empty spaces between the candelabra were filled in with bouquets so that where there was not a light there was a flower 
 in the antechamber three violins and a flute softly played quartettes by haydn 
 jean valjean had seated himself on a chair in the behind the door the leaf of which folded back upon him in such a manner as to nearly conceal him 
 a few moments before they sat down to table cosette came as though inspired by a sudden whim and made him a deep courtesy spreading out her bridal toilet with both hands and with a tenderly roguish glance she asked him 
 father are you satisfied 
 yes said jean valjean i am content 
 well then laugh 
 jean valjean began to laugh 
 a few moments later basque announced that dinner was served 
 the guests preceded by m gillenormand with cosette on his arm entered the and arranged themselves in the proper order around the table 
 two large figured on the right and left of the bride the first for m gillenormand the other for jean valjean m gillenormand took his seat 
 the other remained empty 
 they looked about for m fauchelevent 
 he was no longer there 
 m gillenormand questioned basque 
 do you know where m fauchelevent is 
 sir replied basque i do precisely 
 m fauchelevent told me to say to you sir that he was suffering his injured hand was paining him somewhat and that he could not dine with monsieur le baron and madame la baronne 
 that he begged to be excused that he would come he has just taken his departure 
 that empty chilled the effusion of the wedding feast for a moment 
 but if m fauchelevent was absent m gillenormand was present and the grandfather beamed for two he affirmed that m fauchelevent had done well to retire early if he were suffering but that it was only a slight ailment this declaration sufficed 
 moreover what is an obscure corner in such a submersion of joy 
 cosette and marius were passing through one of those egotistical and blessed moments when no other faculty is left to a person than that of receiving happiness and then an idea occurred to m this armchair is empty 
 come hither marius 
 your aunt will permit it although she has a right to you 
 this armchair is for you that is legal and delightful 
 fortunatus beside fortunata applause from the whole table 
 marius took jean place beside cosette and things fell out so that cosette who had at first been saddened by jean absence ended by being satisfied with it 
 from the moment when marius took his place and was the substitute cosette would not have regretted god himself she set her sweet little foot shod in white satin on marius foot 
 the being occupied m fauchelevent was obliterated and nothing was lacking 
 and five minutes afterward the whole table from one end to the other was laughing with all the animation of forgetfulness 
 at dessert m gillenormand rising to his feet with a glass of champagne in his half full so that the palsy of his eighty years might not cause an the health of the married pair 
 you shall not escape two sermons he exclaimed 
 this morning you had one from the cure this evening you shall have one from your grandfather 
 listen to me i will give you a bit of advice adore each other 
 i do not make a pack of gyrations i go straight to the mark be happy 
 in all creation only the are wise philosophers say 
 moderate your joys 
 i say 
 give rein to your joys 
 be as much smitten with each other as fiends be in a rage about it 
 the philosophers talk stuff and nonsense i should like to stuff their philosophy down their gullets again can there be too many perfumes too many open too many nightingales singing too many green leaves too much aurora in life can people love each other too much can people please each other too much 
 take care estelle thou art too pretty have a care nemorin thou art too handsome 
 fine stupidity in sooth can people enchant each other too much cajole each other too much charm each other too much 
 can one be too much alive too happy moderate your joys 
 ah indeed 
 down with the philosophers wisdom consists in jubilation 
 make merry let us make merry are we happy because we are good or are we good because we are happy is the sancy diamond called the sancy because it belonged to harley de sancy or because it weighs six hundred carats i know nothing about it life is full of such problems the important point is to possess the sancy and happiness 
 let us be happy without quibbling and quirking 
 let us obey the sun blindly what is the sun 
 it is love 
 he who says love says woman ah ah behold 
 ask that demagogue of a marius if he is not the slave of that little tyrant of a cosette 
 and of his own free will too the coward 
 woman 
 there is no robespierre who keeps his place but woman reigns 
 i am no longer royalist except towards that royalty 
 what is adam 
 the kingdom of eve no for eve 
 there has been the royal sceptre surmounted by a there has been the imperial sceptre surmounted by a globe there has been the sceptre of charlemagne which was of iron there has been the sceptre of louis the great which was of gold the revolution twisted them between its thumb and forefinger straws it is done with it is broken it lies on the earth there is no longer any sceptre but make me a revolution against that little embroidered handkerchief which smells of patchouli i should like to see you do it 
 try 
 why is it so solid 
 because it is a gewgaw 
 ah you are the nineteenth century 
 well what then and we have been as foolish as you 
 do not imagine that you have effected much change in the universe because your is called the and because your pourree is called the cachuca in fact the women must always be loved 
 i defy you to escape from that these friends are our angels 
 yes love woman the kiss forms a circle from which i defy you to escape and for my own part i should be only too happy to it 
 which of you has seen the planet venus the coquette of the abyss the celimene of the ocean rise in the infinite calming all here below the ocean is a rough alcestis 
 well grumble as he will when venus appears he is forced to smile 
 that brute beast submits 
 we are all made so 
 wrath tempest claps of thunder foam to the very ceiling a woman enters on the scene a planet rises flat on your face marius was fighting six months ago he is married that is well 
 yes marius yes cosette you are in the right exist boldly for each other make us burst with rage that we cannot do the same idealize each other catch in your beaks all the tiny blades of felicity that exist on earth and arrange yourselves a nest for life 
 pardi to love to be loved what a fine miracle when one is young 
 imagine that you have invented that 
 i too have had my dream i too have meditated i too have sighed i too have had a moonlight soul 
 love is a child six thousand years old love has the right to a long white beard 
 methusalem is a street arab beside cupid 
 for sixty centuries men and women have got out of their scrape by loving 
 the devil who is cunning took to hating man man who is still more cunning took to loving woman in this way he does more good than the devil does him harm this craft was discovered in the days of the terrestrial paradise the invention is old my friends but it is perfectly new 
 profit by it be daphnis and chloe while waiting to become philemon and baucis manage so that when you are with each other nothing shall be lacking to you and that cosette may be the sun for marius and that marius may be the universe to cosette 
 cosette let your fine weather be the smile of your husband marius let your rain be your tears 
 and let it never rain in your household you have filched the winning number in the lottery you have gained the great prize guard it well keep it under lock and key do not squander it adore each other and snap your fingers at all the rest 
 believe what i say to you 
 it is good sense and good sense cannot lie 
 be a religion to each other each man has his own fashion of adoring god 
 saperlotte the best way to adore god is to love wife 
 i love thee my catechism 
 he who loves is orthodox 
 the oath of henri iv places sanctity somewhere between feasting and drunkenness i belong to the religion of that oath woman is forgotten in it 
 this astonishes me on the part of henri iv 
 my friends long live women 
 i am old they say astonishing how much i feel in the mood to be young 
 i should like to go and listen to the bagpipes in the woods 
 children who contrive to be beautiful and intoxicates me i would like greatly to get married if any one would have me it is impossible to imagine that god could have made us for anything but this 
 to idolize to coo to preen ourselves to be to be dainty to bill and coo our loves from morn to night to gaze at image in little wife to be proud to be triumphant to plume oneself that is the aim of life 
 there let not that displease you which we used to think in our day when we were young folks ah what charming women there were in those days and what pretty little faces and what lovely lasses 
 i committed my ravages among them 
 then love each other 
 if people did not love each other i really do not see what use there would be in having any springtime and for my own part i should pray the good god to shut up all the beautiful things that he shows us and to take away from us and put back in his box the flowers the birds and the pretty maidens 
 my children receive an old blessing 
 the evening was gay lively and agreeable 
 the sovereign good humor gave the to the whole feast and each person regulated his conduct on that almost centenarian cordiality they danced a little they laughed a great deal it was an amiable wedding 
 goodman days of yore might have been invited to it 
 however he was present in the person of father gillenormand 
 there was a tumult then silence 
 the married pair disappeared 
 a little after midnight the gillenormand house became a temple 
 here we pause 
 on the threshold of wedding nights stands a smiling angel with his finger on his lips 
 the soul enters into contemplation before that sanctuary where the celebration of love takes place 
 there should be flashes of light athwart such houses 
 the joy which they contain ought to make its escape through the stones of the walls in brilliancy and vaguely illuminate the gloom it is impossible that this sacred and fatal festival should not give off a celestial radiance to the infinite 
 love is the sublime crucible wherein the fusion of the man and the woman takes place the being one the being triple the being final the human trinity proceeds from it 
 this birth of two souls into one ought to be an emotion for the gloom 
 the lover is the priest the ravished virgin is terrified 
 something of that joy ascends to god where true marriage is that is to say where there is love the ideal enters in 
 a nuptial bed makes a nook of dawn amid the shadows if it were given to the eye of the flesh to scan the formidable and charming visions of the upper life it is probable that we should behold the forms of night the winged unknowns the blue passers of the invisible bend down a throng of sombre heads around the luminous house satisfied showering benedictions pointing out to each other the virgin wife gently alarmed sweetly terrified and bearing the reflection of human bliss upon their divine countenances 
 if at that supreme hour the wedded pair dazzled with voluptuousness and believing themselves alone were to listen they would hear in their chamber a confused rustling of wings 
 perfect happiness implies a mutual understanding with the angels 
 that dark little chamber has all heaven for its ceiling when two mouths rendered sacred by love approach to create it is impossible that there should not be above that ineffable kiss a quivering throughout the immense mystery of stars 
 these felicities are the true ones 
 there is no joy outside of these joys 
 love is the only ecstasy 
 all the rest weeps 
 to love or to have suffices 
 demand nothing more there is no other pearl to be found in the shadowy folds of life to love is a fulfilment

 i vote for the end of afflictions and sorrows henceforth there must be no sadness anywhere 
 pardieu i decree joy evil has no right to exist 
 that there should be any unhappy men is in sooth a disgrace to the azure of the sky 
 evil does not come from man who is good at bottom 
 all human miseries have for their capital and central government hell otherwise known as the tuileries 
 good here i am uttering demagogical words as far as i am concerned i have no longer any political opinions let all me be rich that is to say mirthful and i confine myself to that 
 when at the conclusion of all the ceremonies after having pronounced before the mayor and before the priest all possible yesses after having signed the registers at the municipality and at the sacristy after having exchanged their rings after having knelt side by side under the pall of white moire in the smoke of the censer they arrived hand in hand admired and envied by all marius in black she in white preceded by the suisse with the epaulets of a colonel tapping the pavement with his halberd between two rows of astonished spectators at the portals of the church both leaves of which were thrown wide open ready to enter their carriage again and all being finished cosette still could not believe that it was real 
 she looked at marius she looked at the crowd she looked at the sky 
 it seemed as though she feared that she should wake up from her dream 
 her amazed and uneasy air added something indescribably enchanting to her beauty they entered the same carriage to return home marius beside cosette m gillenormand and jean valjean sat opposite them aunt gillenormand had withdrawn one degree and was in the second vehicle 
 my children said the grandfather here you are monsieur le baron and madame la baronne with an income of thirty thousand livres 
 and cosette nestling close to marius caressed his ear with an angelic whisper 
 so it is true 
 my name is marius 
 i am madame thou 
 these two creatures were resplendent 
 they had reached that irrevocable and irrecoverable moment at the dazzling intersection of all youth and all joy 
 they realized the verses of jean prouvaire they were forty years old taken together 
 it was marriage sublimated these two children were two lilies 
 they did not see each other they did not contemplate each other 
 cosette perceived marius in the midst of a glory marius perceived cosette on an altar and on that altar and in that glory the two apotheoses mingling in the background one knows not how behind a cloud for cosette in a flash for marius there was the ideal thing the real thing the meeting of the kiss and the dream the nuptial pillow all the torments through which they had passed came back to them in intoxication 
 it seemed to them that their sorrows their sleepless nights their tears their anguish their terrors their despair converted into caresses and rays of light rendered still more charming 
 the charming hour which was approaching and that their griefs were but so many handmaidens who were preparing the toilet of joy how good it is to have suffered 
 their unhappiness formed a halo round their happiness 
 the long agony of their love was terminating in an ascension 
 it was the same enchantment in two souls tinged with voluptuousness in marius and with modesty in cosette 
 they said to each other in low tones 
 we will go back to take a look at our little garden in the rue plumet 
 the folds of gown lay across marius 
 such a day is an ineffable mixture of dream and of reality one possesses and one supposes 
 one still has time before one to divine the emotion on that day of being at and of dreaming of midnight is indescribable 
 the delights of these two hearts overflowed upon the crowd and inspired the with cheerfulness 
 people halted in the rue in front of to gaze through the windows of the carriage at the quivering on head 
 then they returned home to the rue des marius triumphant and radiant mounted side by side with cosette the staircase up which he had been borne in a dying condition 
 the poor who had trooped to the door and who shared their purses blessed them there were flowers everywhere 
 the house was no less fragrant than the church after the incense roses 
 they thought they heard voices carolling in the infinite they had god in their hearts destiny appeared to them like a ceiling of stars above their heads they beheld the light of a rising sun 
 all at once the clock struck marius glanced at charming bare arm and at the rosy things which were vaguely visible through the lace of her bodice and cosette intercepting marius glance blushed to her very hair 
 quite a number of old family friends of the gillenormand family had been invited they pressed about cosette 
 each one vied with the rest in saluting her as madame la baronne 
 the officer theodule gillenormand now a captain had come from chartres where he was stationed in garrison to be present at the wedding of his cousin pontmercy 
 cosette did not recognize him 
 he on his side habituated as he was to have women consider him handsome retained no more recollection of cosette than of any other woman 
 how right i was not to believe in that story about the lancer said father gillenormand to himself 
 cosette had never been more tender with jean valjean she was in unison with father gillenormand while he erected joy into aphorisms and maxims she exhaled goodness like a perfume happiness desires that all the world should be happy 
 she regained for the purpose of addressing jean valjean inflections of voice belonging to the time when she was a little girl she caressed him with her smile 
 a banquet had been spread in the 
 illumination as brilliant as the daylight is the necessary seasoning of a great joy 
 mist and obscurity are not accepted by the happy they do not consent to be black 
 the night yes the shadows no if there is no sun one must be made 
 the was full of gay things 
 in the centre above the white and glittering table was a venetian lustre with flat plates with all sorts of colored birds blue violet red and green perched amid the candles around the chandelier girandoles on the walls sconces with triple and quintuple branches mirrors silverware glassware plate porcelain faience pottery gold and work all was sparkling and gay 
 the empty spaces between the candelabra were filled in with bouquets so that where there was not a light there was a flower 
 in the antechamber three violins and a flute softly played quartettes by haydn 
 jean valjean had seated himself on a chair in the behind the door the leaf of which folded back upon him in such a manner as to nearly conceal him 
 a few moments before they sat down to table cosette came as though inspired by a sudden whim and made him a deep courtesy spreading out her bridal toilet with both hands and with a tenderly roguish glance she asked him 
 father are you satisfied 
 yes said jean valjean i am content 
 well then laugh 
 jean valjean began to laugh 
 a few moments later basque announced that dinner was served 
 the guests preceded by m gillenormand with cosette on his arm entered the and arranged themselves in the proper order around the table 
 two large figured on the right and left of the bride the first for m gillenormand the other for jean valjean m gillenormand took his seat 
 the other remained empty 
 they looked about for m fauchelevent 
 he was no longer there 
 m gillenormand questioned basque 
 do you know where m fauchelevent is 
 sir replied basque i do precisely 
 m fauchelevent told me to say to you sir that he was suffering his injured hand was paining him somewhat and that he could not dine with monsieur le baron and madame la baronne 
 that he begged to be excused that he would come he has just taken his departure 
 that empty chilled the effusion of the wedding feast for a moment 
 but if m fauchelevent was absent m gillenormand was present and the grandfather beamed for two he affirmed that m fauchelevent had done well to retire early if he were suffering but that it was only a slight ailment this declaration sufficed 
 moreover what is an obscure corner in such a submersion of joy 
 cosette and marius were passing through one of those egotistical and blessed moments when no other faculty is left to a person than that of receiving happiness and then an idea occurred to m this armchair is empty 
 come hither marius 
 your aunt will permit it although she has a right to you 
 this armchair is for you that is legal and delightful 
 fortunatus beside fortunata applause from the whole table 
 marius took jean place beside cosette and things fell out so that cosette who had at first been saddened by jean absence ended by being satisfied with it 
 from the moment when marius took his place and was the substitute cosette would not have regretted god himself she set her sweet little foot shod in white satin on marius foot 
 the being occupied m fauchelevent was obliterated and nothing was lacking 
 and five minutes afterward the whole table from one end to the other was laughing with all the animation of forgetfulness 
 at dessert m gillenormand rising to his feet with a glass of champagne in his half full so that the palsy of his eighty years might not cause an the health of the married pair 
 you shall not escape two sermons he exclaimed 
 this morning you had one from the cure this evening you shall have one from your grandfather 
 listen to me i will give you a bit of advice adore each other 
 i do not make a pack of gyrations i go straight to the mark be happy 
 in all creation only the are wise philosophers say 
 moderate your joys 
 i say 
 give rein to your joys 
 be as much smitten with each other as fiends be in a rage about it 
 the philosophers talk stuff and nonsense i should like to stuff their philosophy down their gullets again can there be too many perfumes too many open too many nightingales singing too many green leaves too much aurora in life can people love each other too much can people please each other too much 
 take care estelle thou art too pretty have a care nemorin thou art too handsome 
 fine stupidity in sooth can people enchant each other too much cajole each other too much charm each other too much 
 can one be too much alive too happy moderate your joys 
 ah indeed 
 down with the philosophers wisdom consists in jubilation 
 make merry let us make merry are we happy because we are good or are we good because we are happy is the sancy diamond called the sancy because it belonged to harley de sancy or because it weighs six hundred carats i know nothing about it life is full of such problems the important point is to possess the sancy and happiness 
 let us be happy without quibbling and quirking 
 let us obey the sun blindly what is the sun 
 it is love 
 he who says love says woman ah ah behold 
 ask that demagogue of a marius if he is not the slave of that little tyrant of a cosette 
 and of his own free will too the coward 
 woman 
 there is no robespierre who keeps his place but woman reigns 
 i am no longer royalist except towards that royalty 
 what is adam 
 the kingdom of eve no for eve 
 there has been the royal sceptre surmounted by a there has been the imperial sceptre surmounted by a globe there has been the sceptre of charlemagne which was of iron there has been the sceptre of louis the great which was of gold the revolution twisted them between its thumb and forefinger straws it is done with it is broken it lies on the earth there is no longer any sceptre but make me a revolution against that little embroidered handkerchief which smells of patchouli i should like to see you do it 
 try 
 why is it so solid 
 because it is a gewgaw 
 ah you are the nineteenth century 
 well what then and we have been as foolish as you 
 do not imagine that you have effected much change in the universe because your is called the and because your pourree is called the cachuca in fact the women must always be loved 
 i defy you to escape from that these friends are our angels 
 yes love woman the kiss forms a circle from which i defy you to escape and for my own part i should be only too happy to it 
 which of you has seen the planet venus the coquette of the abyss the celimene of the ocean rise in the infinite calming all here below the ocean is a rough alcestis 
 well grumble as he will when venus appears he is forced to smile 
 that brute beast submits 
 we are all made so 
 wrath tempest claps of thunder foam to the very ceiling a woman enters on the scene a planet rises flat on your face marius was fighting six months ago he is married that is well 
 yes marius yes cosette you are in the right exist boldly for each other make us burst with rage that we cannot do the same idealize each other catch in your beaks all the tiny blades of felicity that exist on earth and arrange yourselves a nest for life 
 pardi to love to be loved what a fine miracle when one is young 
 imagine that you have invented that 
 i too have had my dream i too have meditated i too have sighed i too have had a moonlight soul 
 love is a child six thousand years old love has the right to a long white beard 
 methusalem is a street arab beside cupid 
 for sixty centuries men and women have got out of their scrape by loving 
 the devil who is cunning took to hating man man who is still more cunning took to loving woman in this way he does more good than the devil does him harm this craft was discovered in the days of the terrestrial paradise the invention is old my friends but it is perfectly new 
 profit by it be daphnis and chloe while waiting to become philemon and baucis manage so that when you are with each other nothing shall be lacking to you and that cosette may be the sun for marius and that marius may be the universe to cosette 
 cosette let your fine weather be the smile of your husband marius let your rain be your tears 
 and let it never rain in your household you have filched the winning number in the lottery you have gained the great prize guard it well keep it under lock and key do not squander it adore each other and snap your fingers at all the rest 
 believe what i say to you 
 it is good sense and good sense cannot lie 
 be a religion to each other each man has his own fashion of adoring god 
 saperlotte the best way to adore god is to love wife 
 i love thee my catechism 
 he who loves is orthodox 
 the oath of henri iv places sanctity somewhere between feasting and drunkenness i belong to the religion of that oath woman is forgotten in it 
 this astonishes me on the part of henri iv 
 my friends long live women 
 i am old they say astonishing how much i feel in the mood to be young 
 i should like to go and listen to the bagpipes in the woods 
 children who contrive to be beautiful and intoxicates me i would like greatly to get married if any one would have me it is impossible to imagine that god could have made us for anything but this 
 to idolize to coo to preen ourselves to be to be dainty to bill and coo our loves from morn to night to gaze at image in little wife to be proud to be triumphant to plume oneself that is the aim of life 
 there let not that displease you which we used to think in our day when we were young folks ah what charming women there were in those days and what pretty little faces and what lovely lasses 
 i committed my ravages among them 
 then love each other 
 if people did not love each other i really do not see what use there would be in having any springtime and for my own part i should pray the good god to shut up all the beautiful things that he shows us and to take away from us and put back in his box the flowers the birds and the pretty maidens 
 my children receive an old blessing 
 the evening was gay lively and agreeable 
 the sovereign good humor gave the to the whole feast and each person regulated his conduct on that almost centenarian cordiality they danced a little they laughed a great deal it was an amiable wedding 
 goodman days of yore might have been invited to it 
 however he was present in the person of father gillenormand 
 there was a tumult then silence 
 the married pair disappeared 
 a little after midnight the gillenormand house became a temple 
 here we pause 
 on the threshold of wedding nights stands a smiling angel with his finger on his lips 
 the soul enters into contemplation before that sanctuary where the celebration of love takes place 
 there should be flashes of light athwart such houses 
 the joy which they contain ought to make its escape through the stones of the walls in brilliancy and vaguely illuminate the gloom it is impossible that this sacred and fatal festival should not give off a celestial radiance to the infinite 
 love is the sublime crucible wherein the fusion of the man and the woman takes place the being one the being triple the being final the human trinity proceeds from it 
 this birth of two souls into one ought to be an emotion for the gloom 
 the lover is the priest the ravished virgin is terrified 
 something of that joy ascends to god where true marriage is that is to say where there is love the ideal enters in 
 a nuptial bed makes a nook of dawn amid the shadows if it were given to the eye of the flesh to scan the formidable and charming visions of the upper life it is probable that we should behold the forms of night the winged unknowns the blue passers of the invisible bend down a throng of sombre heads around the luminous house satisfied showering benedictions pointing out to each other the virgin wife gently alarmed sweetly terrified and bearing the reflection of human bliss upon their divine countenances 
 if at that supreme hour the wedded pair dazzled with voluptuousness and believing themselves alone were to listen they would hear in their chamber a confused rustling of wings 
 perfect happiness implies a mutual understanding with the angels 
 that dark little chamber has all heaven for its ceiling when two mouths rendered sacred by love approach to create it is impossible that there should not be above that ineffable kiss a quivering throughout the immense mystery of stars 
 these felicities are the true ones 
 there is no joy outside of these joys 
 love is the only ecstasy 
 all the rest weeps 
 to love or to have suffices 
 demand nothing more there is no other pearl to be found in the shadowy folds of life to love is a fulfilment

 second epilogue 
 chapter i 
 
 history is the life of nations and of humanity to seize and put into words to describe directly the life of humanity or even of a single nation appears impossible 
 the ancient historians all employed one and the same method to describe and seize the apparently elusive the life of a people they described the activity of individuals who ruled the people and regarded the activity of those men as representing the activity of the whole nation 
 the question how did individuals make nations act as they wished and by what was the will of these individuals themselves guided the ancients met by recognizing a divinity which subjected the nations to the will of a chosen man and guided the will of that chosen man so as to accomplish ends that were predestined 
 for the ancients these questions were solved by a belief in the direct participation of the deity in human affairs 
 modern history in theory rejects both these principles 
 it would seem that having rejected the belief of the ancients in subjection to the deity and in a predetermined aim toward which nations are led modern history should study not the manifestations of power but the causes that produce it but modern history has not done this having in theory rejected the view held by the ancients it still follows them in practice 
 instead of men endowed with divine authority and directly guided by the will of god modern history has given us either heroes endowed with extraordinary superhuman capacities or simply men of very various kinds from monarchs to journalists who lead the masses instead of the former divinely appointed aims of the jewish greek or roman nations which ancient historians regarded as representing the progress of humanity modern history has postulated its own aims the welfare of the french german or english people or in its highest abstraction the welfare and civilization of humanity in general by which is usually meant that of the peoples occupying a small northwesterly portion of a large continent 
 modern history has rejected the beliefs of the ancients without replacing them by a new conception and the logic of the situation has obliged the historians after they had apparently rejected the divine authority of the kings and the fate of the ancients to reach the same conclusion by another road that is to recognize nations guided by individual men and the existence of a known aim to which these nations and humanity at large are tending 
 at the basis of the works of all the modern historians from gibbon to buckle despite their seeming disagreements and the apparent novelty of their outlooks lie those two old unavoidable assumptions 
 in the first place the historian describes the activity of individuals who in his opinion have directed humanity one historian considers only monarchs generals and ministers as being such men while another includes also orators learned men reformers philosophers and poets secondly it is assumed that the goal toward which humanity is being led is known to the historians to one of them this goal is the greatness of the roman spanish or french realm to another it is liberty equality and a certain kind of civilization of a small corner of the world called europe 
 in a ferment arises in paris it grows spreads and is expressed by a movement of peoples from west to east several times it moves eastward and collides with a countermovement from the east westward in it reaches its extreme limit moscow and then with remarkable symmetry a countermovement occurs from east to west attracting to it as the first movement had done the nations of middle europe the counter movement reaches the starting point of the first movement in the west paris and subsides 
 during that period an immense number of fields were left untilled houses were burned trade changed its direction millions of men migrated were impoverished or were enriched and millions of christian men professing the law of love of their fellows slew one another 
 what does all this mean why did it happen what made those people burn houses and slay their fellow men what were the causes of these events what force made men act so these are the instinctive plain and most legitimate questions humanity asks itself when it encounters the monuments and tradition of that period 
 for a reply to these questions the common sense of mankind turns to the science of history whose aim is to enable nations and humanity to know themselves 
 if history had retained the conception of the ancients it would have said that god to reward or punish his people gave napoleon power and directed his will to the fulfillment of the divine ends and that reply would have been clear and complete one might believe or disbelieve in the divine significance of napoleon but for anyone believing in it there would have been nothing unintelligible in the history of that period nor would there have been any contradictions 
 but modern history cannot give that reply science does not admit the conception of the ancients as to the direct participation of the deity in human affairs and therefore history ought to give other answers 
 modern history replying to these questions says you want to know what this movement means what caused it and what force produced these events then listen 
 louis xiv was a very proud and man he had such and such mistresses and such and such ministers and he ruled france badly his descendants were weak men and they too ruled france badly and they had such and such favorites and such and such mistresses moreover certain men wrote some books at that time at the end of the eighteenth century there were a couple of dozen men in paris who began to talk about all men being free and equal this caused people all over france to begin to slash at and drown one another they killed the king and many other people at that time there was in france a man of genius napoleon he conquered everybody everywhere that is he killed many people because he was a great genius and for some reason he went to kill africans and killed them so well and was so cunning and wise that when he returned to france he ordered everybody to obey him and they all obeyed him having become an emperor he again went out to kill people in italy austria and prussia and there too he killed a great many in russia there was an emperor alexander who decided to restore order in europe and therefore fought against napoleon in he suddenly made friends with him but in they again quarreled and again began killing many people napoleon led six hundred thousand men into russia and captured moscow then he suddenly ran away from moscow and the emperor alexander helped by the advice of stein and others united europe to arm against the disturber of its peace all allies suddenly became his enemies and their forces advanced against the fresh forces he raised the allies defeated napoleon entered paris forced napoleon to abdicate and sent him to the island of elba not depriving him of the title of emperor and showing him every respect though five years before and one year later they all regarded him as an outlaw and a brigand then louis xviii who till then had been the laughingstock both of the french and the allies began to reign and napoleon shedding tears before his old guards renounced the throne and went into exile then the skillful statesmen and diplomatists especially talleyrand who managed to sit down in a particular chair before anyone else and thereby extended the frontiers of france talked in vienna and by these conversations made the nations happy or unhappy suddenly the diplomatists and monarchs nearly quarreled and were on the point of again ordering their armies to kill one another but just then napoleon arrived in france with a battalion and the french who had been hating him immediately all submitted to him but the allied monarchs were angry at this and went to fight the french once more and they defeated the genius napoleon and suddenly recognizing him as a brigand sent him to the island of st helena and the exile separated from the beloved france so dear to his heart died a lingering death on that rock and bequeathed his great deeds to posterity but in europe a reaction occurred and the sovereigns once again all began to oppress their subjects 
 it would be a mistake to think that this is ironic a caricature of the historical accounts on the contrary it is a very mild expression of the contradictory replies not meeting the questions which all the historians give from the compilers of memoirs and the histories of separate states to the writers of general histories and the new histories of the culture of that period 
 the strangeness and absurdity of these replies arise from the fact that modern history like a deaf man answers questions no one has asked 
 if the purpose of history be to give a description of the movement of humanity and of the peoples the first question in the absence of a reply to which all the rest will be incomprehensible is what is the power that moves peoples to this modern history laboriously replies either that napoleon was a great genius or that louis xiv was very proud or that certain writers wrote certain books 
 all that may be so and mankind is ready to agree with it but it is not what was asked all that would be interesting if we recognized a divine power based on itself and always consistently directing its nations through napoleons and writers but we do not acknowledge such a power and therefore before speaking about napoleons and authors we ought to be shown the connection existing between these men and the movement of the nations 
 if instead of a divine power some other force has appeared it should be explained in what this new force consists for the whole interest of history lies precisely in that force 
 history seems to assume that this force is and known to everyone but in spite of every desire to regard it as known anyone reading many historical works cannot help doubting whether this new force so variously understood by the historians themselves is really quite well known to everybody

 book sleepless night 
 chapter iii 
 
 the inseparable 
 what had become of jean valjean

 this was the very room which eight months before he had entered black with mud with blood and powder bringing back the grandson to the grandfather the old wainscoting was garlanded with foliage and flowers the musicians were seated on the sofa on which they had laid marius down 
 basque in a black coat white stockings and white gloves was arranging roses round all of the dishes that were to be served 
 jean valjean pointed to his arm in its sling charged basque to explain his absence and went away

 he listened the confused sounds of the banquet reached his ear 
 he heard the loud commanding tones of the grandfather the violins the clatter of the plates the bursts of laughter and through all that merry uproar he distinguished sweet and joyous voice 
 he quitted the rue des and returned to the rue de arme 
 in order to return thither he took the rue the rue and the it was a little longer but it was the road through which for the last three months he had become accustomed to pass every day on his way from the rue de arme to the rue des in order to avoid the obstructions and the mud in the rue

 he had disengaged his arm from the sling and he used his right hand as though it did not hurt him 
 he approached his bed and his eyes rested was it by chance was it intentionally on the inseparable of which cosette had been jealous on the little portmanteau which never left him on his arrival in the rue de arme on the th of june he had deposited it on a round table near the head of his bed he went to this table with a sort of vivacity took a key from his pocket and opened the valise 
 from it he slowly drew forth the garments in which ten years before cosette had quitted montfermeil first the little gown then the black fichu then the stout coarse shoes which cosette might almost have worn still so tiny were her feet then the fustian bodice which was very thick then the knitted petticoat next the apron with pockets then the woollen stockings these stockings which still preserved the graceful form of a tiny leg were no longer than jean hand 
 all this was black of hue it was he who had brought those garments to montfermeil for her as he removed them from the valise he laid them on the bed he fell to thinking 
 he called up memories 
 it was in winter in a very cold month of december she was shivering in rags her poor little feet were all red in their wooden shoes he jean valjean had made her abandon those rags to clothe herself in these mourning habiliments 
 the mother must have felt pleased in her grave to see her daughter wearing mourning for her and above all to see that she was properly clothed and that she was warm he thought of that forest of montfermeil they had traversed it together cosette and he he thought of what the weather had been of the leafless trees of the wood destitute of birds of the sunless sky it mattered not it was charming 
 he arranged the tiny garments on the bed the fichu next to the petticoat the stockings beside the shoes and he looked at them one after the other she was no taller than that she had her big doll in her arms she had put her louis in the pocket of that apron she had laughed they walked hand in hand she had no one in the world but him 
 then his venerable white head fell forward on the bed that stoical old heart broke his face was engulfed so to speak in garments and if any one had passed up the stairs at that moment he would have heard frightful sobs

 what force moves the nations 
 biographical historians and historians of separate nations understand this force as a power inherent in heroes and rulers in their narration events occur solely by the will of a napoleon and alexander or in general of the persons they describe the answers given by this kind of historian to the question of what force causes events to happen are satisfactory only as long as there is but one historian to each event as soon as historians of different nationalities and tendencies begin to describe the same event the replies they give immediately lose all meaning for this force is understood by them all not only differently but often in quite contradictory ways one historian says that an event was produced by power another that it was produced by a third that it was due to the power of some other person besides this historians of that kind contradict each other even in their statement as to the force on which the authority of some particular person was based thiers a bonapartist says that power was based on his virtue and genius lanfrey a republican says it was based on his trickery and deception of the people so the historians of this class by mutually destroying one positions destroy the understanding of the force which produces events and furnish no reply to essential question 
 writers of universal history who deal with all the nations seem to recognize how erroneous is the specialist historians view of the force which produces events they do not recognize it as a power inherent in heroes and rulers but as the resultant of a multiplicity of variously directed forces in describing a war or the subjugation of a people a general historian looks for the cause of the event not in the power of one man but in the interaction of many persons connected with the event 
 according to this view the power of historical personages represented as the product of many forces can no longer it would seem be regarded as a force that itself produces events yet in most cases universal historians still employ the conception of power as a force that itself produces events and treat it as their cause in their exposition an historic character is first the product of his time and his power only the resultant of various forces and then his power is itself a force producing events gervinus schlosser and others for instance at one time prove napoleon to be a product of the revolution of the ideas of and so forth and at another plainly say that the campaign of and other things they do not like were simply the product of misdirected will and that the very ideas of were arrested in their development by caprice the ideas of the revolution and the general temper of the age produced power but power suppressed the ideas of the revolution and the general temper of the age 
 this curious contradiction is not accidental not only does it occur at every step but the universal historians accounts are all made up of a chain of such contradictions this contradiction occurs because after entering the field of analysis the universal historians stop halfway 
 to find component forces equal to the composite or resultant force the sum of the components must equal the resultant this condition is never observed by the universal historians and so to explain the resultant forces they are obliged to admit in addition to the insufficient components another unexplained force affecting the resultant action 
 specialist historians describing the campaign of or the restoration of the bourbons plainly assert that these events were produced by the will of alexander but the universal historian gervinus refuting this opinion of the specialist historian tries to prove that the campaign of and the restoration of the bourbons were due to other things beside will such as the activity of stein metternich madame de stael talleyrand fichte chateaubriand and others the historian evidently decomposes power into the components talleyrand chateaubriand and the rest but the sum of the components that is the interactions of chateaubriand talleyrand madame de stael and the others evidently does not equal the resultant namely the phenomenon of millions of frenchmen submitting to the bourbons that chateaubriand madame de stael and others spoke certain words to one another only affected their mutual relations but does not account for the submission of millions and therefore to explain how from these relations of theirs the submission of millions of people resulted that is how component forces equal to one a gave a resultant equal to a thousand times a the historian is again obliged to fall back on power the force he had denied and to recognize it as the resultant of the forces that is he has to admit an unexplained force acting on the resultant and that is just what the universal historians do and consequently they not only contradict the specialist historians but contradict themselves 
 peasants having no clear idea of the cause of rain say according to whether they want rain or fine weather the wind has blown the clouds away or the wind has brought up the clouds and in the same way the universal historians sometimes when it pleases them and fits in with their theory say that power is the result of events and sometimes when they want to prove something else say that power produces events 
 a third class of historians the historians of culture following the path laid down by the universal historians who sometimes accept writers and ladies as forces producing events again take that force to be something quite different they see it in what is called culture in mental activity 
 the historians of culture are quite consistent in regard to their progenitors the writers of universal histories for if historical events may be explained by the fact that certain persons treated one another in such and such ways why not explain them by the fact that such and such people wrote such and such books of the immense number of indications accompanying every vital phenomenon these historians select the indication of intellectual activity and say that this indication is the cause but despite their endeavors to prove that the cause of events lies in intellectual activity only by a great stretch can one admit that there is any connection between intellectual activity and the movement of peoples and in no case can one admit that intellectual activity controls actions for that view is not confirmed by such facts as the very cruel murders of the french revolution resulting from the doctrine of the equality of man or the very cruel wars and executions resulting from the preaching of love 
 but even admitting as correct all the cunningly devised arguments with which these histories are filled admitting that nations are governed by some undefined force called an idea essential question still remains unanswered and to the former power of monarchs and to the influence of advisers and other people introduced by the universal historians another newer force the idea is added the connection of which with the masses needs explanation it is possible to understand that napoleon had power and so events occurred with some effort one may even conceive that napoleon together with other influences was the cause of an event but how a book le contrat social had the effect of making frenchmen begin to drown one another cannot be understood without an explanation of the causal nexus of this new force with the event 
 undoubtedly some relation exists between all who live contemporaneously and so it is possible to find some connection between the intellectual activity of men and their historical movements just as such a connection may be found between the movements of humanity and commerce handicraft gardening or anything else you please but why intellectual activity is considered by the historians of culture to be the cause or expression of the whole historical movement is hard to understand only the following considerations can have led the historians to such a conclusion that history is written by learned men and so it is natural and agreeable for them to think that the activity of their class supplies the basis of the movement of all humanity just as a similar belief is natural and agreeable to traders agriculturists and soldiers if they do not express it that is merely because traders and soldiers do not write history and that spiritual activity enlightenment civilization culture ideas are all indistinct indefinite conceptions under whose banner it is very easy to use words having a still less definite meaning and which can therefore be readily introduced into any theory 
 but not to speak of the intrinsic quality of histories of this kind which may possibly even be of use to someone for something the histories of culture to which all general histories tend more and more to approximate are significant from the fact that after seriously and minutely examining various religious philosophic and political doctrines as causes of events as soon as they have to describe an actual historic event such as the campaign of for instance they involuntarily describe it as resulting from an exercise of power and say plainly that that was the result of will speaking so the historians of culture involuntarily contradict themselves and show that the new force they have devised does not account for what happens in history and that history can only be explained by introducing a power which they apparently do not recognize

 book sleepless night 
 chapter iv 
 
 the immortal liver 
 in allusion to the story of prometheus 
 the old and formidable struggle of which we have already witnessed so many phases began once more 
 jacob struggled with the angel but one night 
 alas how many times have we beheld jean valjean seized bodily by his conscience in the darkness and struggling desperately against it 
 conflict 
 at certain moments the foot slips at other moments the ground crumbles away underfoot 
 how many times had that conscience mad for the good clasped and overthrown him how many times had the truth set her knee inexorably upon his breast how many times hurled to earth by the light had he begged for mercy how many times had that implacable spark lighted within him and upon him by the bishop dazzled him by force when he had wished to be blind 
 how many times had he risen to his feet in the combat held fast to the rock leaning against sophism dragged in the dust now getting the upper hand of his conscience again overthrown by it 
 how many times after an equivoque after the specious and treacherous reasoning of egotism had he heard his irritated conscience cry in his ear 
 a trip you wretch how many times had his refractory thoughts rattled convulsively in his throat under the evidence of duty 
 resistance to god funereal sweats 
 what secret wounds which he alone felt bleed what excoriations in his lamentable existence 
 how many times he had risen bleeding bruised broken enlightened despair in his heart serenity in his soul and vanquished he had felt himself the conqueror 
 and after having dislocated broken and rent his conscience with pincers it had said to him as it stood over him formidable luminous and tranquil 
 now go in peace 
 but on emerging from so melancholy a conflict what a lugubrious peace alas 
 nevertheless that night jean valjean felt that he was passing through his final combat 
 a question presented itself 
 predestinations are not all direct they do not open out in a straight avenue before the predestined man they have blind courts impassable alleys obscure turns disturbing crossroads offering the choice of many ways 
 jean valjean had halted at that moment at the most perilous of these crossroads 
 he had come to the supreme crossing of good and evil 
 he had that gloomy intersection beneath his eyes 
 on this occasion once more as had happened to him already in other sad vicissitudes two roads opened out before him the one tempting the other alarming 
 which was he to take 
 he was counselled to the one which alarmed him by that mysterious index finger which we all perceive whenever we fix our eyes on the darkness 
 once more jean valjean had the choice between the terrible port and the smiling ambush 
 is it then true the soul may recover but not fate 
 frightful thing an incurable destiny 
 this is the problem which presented itself to him 
 in what manner was jean valjean to behave in relation to the happiness of cosette and marius 
 it was he who had willed that happiness it was he who had brought it about he had himself buried it in his entrails and at that moment when he reflected on it he was able to enjoy the sort of satisfaction which an armorer would experience on recognizing his factory mark on a knife on withdrawing it all smoking from his own breast 
 cosette had marius marius possessed cosette 
 they had everything even riches 
 and this was his doing 
 but what was he jean valjean to do with this happiness now that it existed now that it was there 
 should he force himself on this happiness 
 should he treat it as belonging to him no doubt cosette did belong to another but should he jean valjean retain of cosette all that he could retain 
 should he remain the sort of father half seen but respected which he had hitherto been should he without saying a word bring his past to that future should he present himself there as though he had a right and should he seat himself veiled at that luminous fireside should he take those innocent hands into his tragic hands with a smile 
 should he place upon the peaceful fender of the gillenormand those feet of his which dragged behind them the disgraceful shadow of the law 
 should he enter into participation in the fair fortunes of cosette and marius should he render the obscurity on his brow and the cloud upon theirs still more dense 
 should he place his catastrophe as a third associate in their felicity 
 should he continue to hold his peace in a word should he be the sinister mute of destiny beside these two happy beings 
 we must have become habituated to fatality and to encounters with it in order to have the daring to raise our eyes when certain questions appear to us in all their horrible nakedness 
 good or evil stands behind this severe interrogation point 
 what are you going to do demands the sphinx 
 this habit of trial jean valjean possessed 
 he gazed intently at the sphinx 
 he examined the pitiless problem under all its aspects 
 cosette that charming existence was the raft of this shipwreck what was he to do 
 to cling fast to it or to let go his hold 
 if he clung to it he should emerge from disaster he should ascend again into the sunlight he should let the bitter water drip from his garments and his hair he was saved he should live 
 and if he let go his hold 
 then the abyss 
 thus he took sad council with his thoughts 
 or to speak more correctly he fought he kicked furiously internally now against his will now against his conviction 
 happily for jean valjean that he had been able to weep that relieved him possibly 
 but the beginning was savage a tempest more furious than the one which had formerly driven him to arras broke loose within him 
 the past surged up before him facing the present he compared them and sobbed 
 the silence of tears once opened the despairing man writhed 
 he felt that he had been stopped short 
 alas in this fight to the death between our egotism and our duty when we thus retreat step by step before our immutable ideal bewildered furious exasperated at having to yield disputing the ground hoping for a possible flight seeking an escape what an abrupt and sinister resistance does the foot of the wall offer in our rear 
 to feel the sacred shadow which forms an obstacle 
 the invisible inexorable what an obsession 
 then one is never done with conscience 
 make your choice brutus make your choice cato 
 it is fathomless since it is god one flings into that well the labor of whole life one flings in fortune one flings in riches one flings in success one flings in liberty or fatherland one flings in one flings in repose one flings in joy more more more 
 empty the vase tip the urn 
 one must finish by flinging in heart 
 somewhere in the fog of the ancient hells there is a tun like that 
 is not one pardonable if one at last refuses 
 can the inexhaustible have any right 
 are not chains which are endless above human strength who would blame sisyphus and jean valjean for saying 
 it is enough 
 the obedience of matter is limited by friction is there no limit to the obedience of the soul 
 if perpetual motion is impossible can perpetual be exacted 
 the first step is nothing it is the last which is difficult what was the champmathieu affair in comparison with marriage and of that which it entailed 
 what is a into the galleys compared to entrance into the void 
 oh first step that must be descended how sombre art thou oh second step how black art thou 
 how could he refrain from turning aside his head this time 
 martyrdom is sublimation corrosive sublimation 
 it is a torture which consecrates 
 one can consent to it for the first hour one seats oneself on the throne of glowing iron one places on head the crown of hot iron one accepts the globe of red hot iron one takes the sceptre of red hot iron but the mantle of flame still remains to be donned and comes there not a moment when the miserable flesh revolts and when one abdicates from suffering 
 at length jean valjean entered into the peace of exhaustion 
 he weighed he reflected he considered the alternatives the mysterious balance of light and darkness 
 should he impose his galleys on those two dazzling children or should he consummate his irremediable engulfment by himself on one side lay the sacrifice of cosette on the other that of himself 
 at what solution should he arrive 
 what decision did he come to 
 what resolution did he take 
 what was his own inward definitive response to the unbribable interrogatory of fatality 
 what door did he decide to open 
 which side of his life did he resolve upon closing and condemning 
 among all the unfathomable precipices which surrounded him which was his choice 
 what extremity did he accept to which of the gulfs did he nod his head 
 his dizzy revery lasted all night long 
 he remained there until daylight in the same attitude bent double over that bed prostrate beneath the enormity of fate crushed perchance alas with clenched fists with arms outspread at right angles like a man crucified who has been and flung face down on the earth 
 there he remained for twelve hours the twelve long hours of a long night without once raising his head and without uttering a word he was as motionless as a corpse while his thoughts wallowed on the earth and soared now like the hydra now like the eagle any one to behold him thus motionless would have pronounced him dead all at once he shuddered convulsively and his mouth glued to garments kissed them then it could be seen that he was alive 
 who could see 
 since jean valjean was alone and there was no one there 
 the one who is in the shadows

 nevertheless that night jean valjean felt that he was passing through his final combat 
 a question presented itself 
 predestinations are not all direct they do not open out in a straight avenue before the predestined man they have blind courts impassable alleys obscure turns disturbing crossroads offering the choice of many ways 
 jean valjean had halted at that moment at the most perilous of these crossroads 
 he had come to the supreme crossing of good and evil 
 he had that gloomy intersection beneath his eyes 
 on this occasion once more as had happened to him already in other sad vicissitudes two roads opened out before him the one tempting the other alarming 
 which was he to take 
 he was counselled to the one which alarmed him by that mysterious index finger which we all perceive whenever we fix our eyes on the darkness 
 once more jean valjean had the choice between the terrible port and the smiling ambush 
 is it then true the soul may recover but not fate 
 frightful thing an incurable destiny 
 this is the problem which presented itself to him 
 in what manner was jean valjean to behave in relation to the happiness of cosette and marius 
 it was he who had willed that happiness it was he who had brought it about he had himself buried it in his entrails and at that moment when he reflected on it he was able to enjoy the sort of satisfaction which an armorer would experience on recognizing his factory mark on a knife on withdrawing it all smoking from his own breast 
 cosette had marius marius possessed cosette 
 they had everything even riches 
 and this was his doing 
 but what was he jean valjean to do with this happiness now that it existed now that it was there 
 should he force himself on this happiness 
 should he treat it as belonging to him no doubt cosette did belong to another but should he jean valjean retain of cosette all that he could retain 
 should he remain the sort of father half seen but respected which he had hitherto been should he without saying a word bring his past to that future should he present himself there as though he had a right and should he seat himself veiled at that luminous fireside should he take those innocent hands into his tragic hands with a smile 
 should he place upon the peaceful fender of the gillenormand those feet of his which dragged behind them the disgraceful shadow of the law 
 should he enter into participation in the fair fortunes of cosette and marius should he render the obscurity on his brow and the cloud upon theirs still more dense 
 should he place his catastrophe as a third associate in their felicity 
 should he continue to hold his peace in a word should he be the sinister mute of destiny beside these two happy beings 
 we must have become habituated to fatality and to encounters with it in order to have the daring to raise our eyes when certain questions appear to us in all their horrible nakedness 
 good or evil stands behind this severe interrogation point 
 what are you going to do demands the sphinx 
 this habit of trial jean valjean possessed 
 he gazed intently at the sphinx 
 he examined the pitiless problem under all its aspects 
 cosette that charming existence was the raft of this shipwreck what was he to do 
 to cling fast to it or to let go his hold 
 if he clung to it he should emerge from disaster he should ascend again into the sunlight he should let the bitter water drip from his garments and his hair he was saved he should live 
 and if he let go his hold 
 then the abyss 
 thus he took sad council with his thoughts 
 or to speak more correctly he fought he kicked furiously internally now against his will now against his conviction 
 happily for jean valjean that he had been able to weep that relieved him possibly 
 but the beginning was savage a tempest more furious than the one which had formerly driven him to arras broke loose within him 
 the past surged up before him facing the present he compared them and sobbed 
 the silence of tears once opened the despairing man writhed 
 he felt that he had been stopped short 
 alas in this fight to the death between our egotism and our duty when we thus retreat step by step before our immutable ideal bewildered furious exasperated at having to yield disputing the ground hoping for a possible flight seeking an escape what an abrupt and sinister resistance does the foot of the wall offer in our rear 
 to feel the sacred shadow which forms an obstacle 
 the invisible inexorable what an obsession 
 then one is never done with conscience 
 make your choice brutus make your choice cato 
 it is fathomless since it is god one flings into that well the labor of whole life one flings in fortune one flings in riches one flings in success one flings in liberty or fatherland one flings in one flings in repose one flings in joy more more more 
 empty the vase tip the urn 
 one must finish by flinging in heart 
 somewhere in the fog of the ancient hells there is a tun like that 
 is not one pardonable if one at last refuses 
 can the inexhaustible have any right 
 are not chains which are endless above human strength who would blame sisyphus and jean valjean for saying 
 it is enough 
 the obedience of matter is limited by friction is there no limit to the obedience of the soul 
 if perpetual motion is impossible can perpetual be exacted 
 the first step is nothing it is the last which is difficult what was the champmathieu affair in comparison with marriage and of that which it entailed 
 what is a into the galleys compared to entrance into the void 
 oh first step that must be descended how sombre art thou oh second step how black art thou 
 how could he refrain from turning aside his head this time 
 martyrdom is sublimation corrosive sublimation 
 it is a torture which consecrates 
 one can consent to it for the first hour one seats oneself on the throne of glowing iron one places on head the crown of hot iron one accepts the globe of red hot iron one takes the sceptre of red hot iron but the mantle of flame still remains to be donned and comes there not a moment when the miserable flesh revolts and when one abdicates from suffering 
 at length jean valjean entered into the peace of exhaustion 
 he weighed he reflected he considered the alternatives the mysterious balance of light and darkness 
 should he impose his galleys on those two dazzling children or should he consummate his irremediable engulfment by himself on one side lay the sacrifice of cosette on the other that of himself 
 at what solution should he arrive 
 what decision did he come to 
 what resolution did he take 
 what was his own inward definitive response to the unbribable interrogatory of fatality 
 what door did he decide to open 
 which side of his life did he resolve upon closing and condemning 
 among all the unfathomable precipices which surrounded him which was his choice 
 what extremity did he accept to which of the gulfs did he nod his head 
 his dizzy revery lasted all night long 
 he remained there until daylight in the same attitude bent double over that bed prostrate beneath the enormity of fate crushed perchance alas with clenched fists with arms outspread at right angles like a man crucified who has been and flung face down on the earth 
 there he remained for twelve hours the twelve long hours of a long night without once raising his head and without uttering a word he was as motionless as a corpse while his thoughts wallowed on the earth and soared now like the hydra now like the eagle any one to behold him thus motionless would have pronounced him dead all at once he shuddered convulsively and his mouth glued to garments kissed them then it could be seen that he was alive 
 who could see 
 since jean valjean was alone and there was no one there 
 the one who is in the shadows

 a locomotive is moving someone asks what moves it a peasant says the devil moves it another man says the locomotive moves because its wheels go round a third asserts that the cause of its movement lies in the smoke which the wind carries away 
 the peasant is irrefutable he has devised a complete explanation to refute him someone would have to prove to him that there is no devil or another peasant would have to explain to him that it is not the devil but a german who moves the locomotive only then as a result of the contradiction will they see that they are both wrong but the man who says that the movement of the wheels is the cause refutes himself for having once begun to analyze he ought to go on and explain further why the wheels go round and till he has reached the ultimate cause of the movement of the locomotive in the pressure of steam in the boiler he has no right to stop in his search for the cause the man who explains the movement of the locomotive by the smoke that is carried back has noticed that the wheels do not supply an explanation and has taken the first sign that occurs to him and in his turn has offered that as an explanation 
 the only conception that can explain the movement of the locomotive is that of a force commensurate with the movement observed 
 the only conception that can explain the movement of the peoples is that of some force commensurate with the whole movement of the peoples 
 yet to supply this conception various historians take forces of different kinds all of which are incommensurate with the movement observed some see it as a force directly inherent in heroes as the peasant sees the devil in the locomotive others as a force resulting from several other forces like the movement of the wheels others again as an intellectual influence like the smoke that is blown away 
 so long as histories are written of separate individuals whether caesars alexanders luthers or voltaires and not the histories of all absolutely all those who take part in an event it is quite impossible to describe the movement of humanity without the conception of a force compelling men to direct their activity toward a certain end and the only such conception known to historians is that of power 
 this conception is the one handle by means of which the material of history as at present expounded can be dealt with and anyone who breaks that handle off as buckle did without finding some other method of treating historical material merely deprives himself of the one possible way of dealing with it the necessity of the conception of power as an explanation of historical events is best demonstrated by the universal historians and historians of culture themselves for they professedly reject that conception but inevitably have recourse to it at every step 
 in dealing with inquiry the science of history up to now is like money in circulation paper money and coin the biographies and special national histories are like paper money they can be used and can circulate and fulfill their purpose without harm to anyone and even advantageously as long as no one asks what is the security behind them you need only forget to ask how the will of heroes produces events and such histories as thiers will be interesting and instructive and may perhaps even possess a tinge of poetry but just as doubts of the real value of paper money arise either because being easy to make too much of it gets made or because people try to exchange it for gold so also doubts concerning the real value of such histories arise either because too many of them are written or because in his simplicity of heart someone inquires by what force did napoleon do this that is wants to exchange the current paper money for the real gold of actual comprehension 
 the writers of universal histories and of the history of culture are like people who recognizing the defects of paper money decide to substitute for it money made of metal that has not the specific gravity of gold it may indeed make jingling coin but will do no more than that paper money may deceive the ignorant but nobody is deceived by tokens of base metal that have no value but merely jingle as gold is gold only if it is serviceable not merely for exchange but also for use so universal historians will be valuable only when they can reply to essential question what is power the universal historians give contradictory replies to that question while the historians of culture evade it and answer something quite different and as counters of imitation gold can be used only among a group of people who agree to accept them as gold or among those who do not know the nature of gold so universal historians and historians of culture not answering essential question serve as currency for some purposes of their own only in universities and among the mass of readers who have a taste for what they call serious reading

 book last draught from the cup 
 chapter i 
 
 the seventh circle and the eighth heaven 
 the days that follow weddings are solitary 
 people respect the meditations of the happy pair 
 and also their tardy slumbers to some degree 
 the tumult of visits and congratulations only begins later on 
 on the morning of the th of february it was a little past midday when basque with napkin and under his arm busy in setting his antechamber to rights heard a light tap at the door 
 there had been no ring which was discreet on such a day basque opened the door and beheld m fauchelevent 
 he introduced him into the still encumbered and and which bore the air of a field of battle after the joys of the preceding evening 
 dame sir remarked basque we all woke up late 
 is your master up asked jean valjean 
 how is arm replied basque 
 better 
 is your master up 
 which one the old one or the new one 
 monsieur pontmercy 
 monsieur le baron said basque drawing himself up 
 a man is a baron most of all to his servants 
 he counts for something with them they are what a philosopher would call bespattered with the title and that flatters them 
 marius be it said in passing a militant republican as he had proved was now a baron in spite of himself 
 a small revolution had taken place in the family in connection with this title 
 it was now m gillenormand who clung to it and marius who detached himself from it but colonel pontmercy had written 
 my son will bear my title marius obeyed 
 and then cosette in whom the woman was beginning to dawn was delighted to be a baroness 
 monsieur le baron repeated basque 
 i will go and see i will tell him that m fauchelevent is here 
 no do not tell him that it is i tell him that some one wishes to speak to him in private and mention no name 
 ah ejaculated basque 
 i wish to surprise him 
 ah ejaculated basque once more emitting his second ah as an explanation of the first 
 and he left the room 
 jean valjean remained alone 
 the as we have just said was in great disorder it seemed as though by lending an air one might still hear the vague noise of the wedding 
 on the polished floor lay all sorts of flowers which had fallen from garlands and the wax candles burned to stumps added stalactites of wax to the crystal drops of the chandeliers 
 not a single piece of furniture was in its place in the corners three or four drawn close together in a circle had the appearance of continuing a conversation the whole effect was cheerful 
 a certain grace still lingers round a dead feast 
 it has been a happy thing 
 on the chairs in disarray among those fading flowers beneath those extinct lights people have thought of joy 
 the sun had succeeded to the chandelier and made its way gayly into the 
 several minutes elapsed 
 jean valjean stood motionless on the spot where basque had left him 
 he was very pale 
 his eyes were hollow and so sunken in his head by sleeplessness that they nearly disappeared in their orbits 
 his black coat bore the weary folds of a garment that has been up all night 
 the elbows were whitened with the down which the friction of cloth against linen leaves behind it 
 jean valjean stared at the window outlined on the polished floor at his feet by the sun 
 there came a sound at the door and he raised his eyes 
 marius entered his head well up his mouth smiling an indescribable light on his countenance his brow expanded his eyes triumphant he had not slept either 
 it is you father he exclaimed on catching sight of jean valjean that idiot of a basque had such a mysterious air 
 but you have come too early 
 it is only half past twelve 
 cosette is asleep 
 that word 
 father said to m fauchelevent by marius signified supreme felicity 
 there had always existed as the reader knows a lofty wall a coldness and a constraint between them ice which must be broken or melted 
 marius had reached that point of intoxication when the wall was lowered when the ice dissolved and when m fauchelevent was to him as to cosette a father 
 he continued 
 his words poured forth as is the peculiarity of divine paroxysms of joy 
 how glad i am to see you 
 if you only knew how we missed you yesterday good morning father 
 how is your hand 
 better is it not 
 and satisfied with the favorable reply which he had made to himself he pursued 
 we have both been talking about you 
 cosette loves you so dearly you must not forget that you have a chamber here we want nothing more to do with the rue de arme 
 we will have no more of it at all how could you go to live in a street like that which is sickly which is disagreeable which is ugly which has a barrier at one end where one is cold and into which one cannot enter 
 you are to come and install yourself here 
 and this very day 
 or you will have to deal with cosette 
 she means to lead us all by the nose i warn you you have your own chamber here it is close to ours it opens on the garden the trouble with the clock has been attended to the bed is made it is all ready you have only to take possession of it near your bed cosette has placed a huge old covered with utrecht velvet and she has said to it 
 stretch out your arms to him 
 a nightingale comes to the clump of acacias opposite your windows every spring 
 in two months more you will have it you will have its nest on your left and ours on your right 
 by night it will sing and by day cosette will prattle 
 your chamber faces due south 
 cosette will arrange your books for you your voyages of captain cook and the and all your affairs i believe that there is a little valise to which you are attached i have fixed upon a corner of honor for that 
 you have conquered my grandfather you suit him 
 we will live together 
 do you play whist you will overwhelm my grandfather with delight if you play whist 
 it is you who shall take cosette to walk on the days when i am at the courts you shall give her your arm you know as you used to in the luxembourg 
 we are absolutely resolved to be happy 
 and you shall be included in it in our happiness do you hear father 
 come will you breakfast with us 
 sir said jean valjean i have something to say to you i am an 
 the limit of shrill sounds perceptible can be overleaped as well in the case of the mind as in that of the ear 
 these words i am an proceeding from the mouth of m fauchelevent and entering the ear of marius overshot the possible 
 it seemed to him that something had just been said to him but he did not know what he stood with his mouth wide open 
 then he perceived that the man who was addressing him was frightful wholly absorbed in his own dazzled state he had not up to that moment observed the other terrible pallor 
 jean valjean untied the black cravat which supported his right arm unrolled the linen from around his hand bared his thumb and showed it to marius 
 there is nothing the matter with my hand said he 
 marius looked at the thumb 
 there has not been anything the matter with it went on jean valjean 
 there was in fact no trace of any injury 
 jean valjean continued 
 it was fitting that i should be absent from your marriage i absented myself as much as was in my power 
 so i invented this injury in order that i might not commit a forgery that i might not introduce a flaw into the marriage documents in order that i might escape from signing 
 marius stammered 
 what is the meaning of this 
 the meaning of it is replied jean valjean that i have been in the galleys 
 you are driving me mad exclaimed marius in terror 
 monsieur pontmercy said jean valjean i was nineteen years in the galleys 
 for theft 
 then i was condemned for life for theft for a second offence 
 at the present moment i have broken my ban 
 in vain did marius recoil before the reality refuse the fact resist the evidence he was forced to give way 
 he began to understand and as always happens in such cases he understood too much an inward shudder of hideous enlightenment flashed through him an idea which made him quiver traversed his mind 
 he caught a glimpse of a wretched destiny for himself in the future 
 say all say all he cried 
 you are father 
 and he retreated a couple of paces with a movement of indescribable horror 
 jean valjean elevated his head with so much majesty of attitude that he seemed to grow even to the ceiling 
 it is necessary that you should believe me here sir although our oath to others may not be received in law 
 here he paused then with a sort of sovereign and sepulchral authority he added articulating slowly and emphasizing the syllables 
 you will believe me 
 i the father of cosette before god no monsieur le baron pontmercy i am a peasant of faverolles i earned my living by pruning trees 
 my name is not fauchelevent but jean valjean 
 i am not related to cosette 
 reassure yourself 
 marius stammered 
 who will prove that to me 
 i since i tell you so 
 marius looked at the man 
 he was melancholy yet tranquil 
 no lie could proceed from such a calm 
 that which is icy is sincere the truth could be felt in that chill of the tomb 
 i believe you said marius 
 jean valjean bent his head as though taking note of this and continued 
 what am i to cosette 
 a ten years ago i did not know that she was in existence 
 i love her it is true 
 one loves a child whom one has seen when very young being old oneself 
 when one is old one feels oneself a grandfather towards all little children you may it seems to me suppose that i have something which resembles a heart 
 she was an orphan 
 without either father or mother she needed me 
 that is why i began to love her 
 children are so weak that the first comer even a man like me can become their protector 
 i have fulfilled this duty towards cosette i do not think that so slight a thing can be called a good action but if it be a good action well say that i have done it register this attenuating circumstance 
 cosette passes out of my life our two roads part 
 henceforth i can do nothing for her 
 she is madame pontmercy 
 her providence has changed and cosette gains by the change 
 all is well 
 as for the six hundred thousand francs you do not mention them to me but i forestall your thought they are a deposit 
 how did that deposit come into my hands 
 what does that matter 
 i restore the deposit nothing more can be demanded of me 
 i complete the restitution by announcing my true name 
 that concerns me 
 i have a reason for desiring that you should know who i am 
 and jean valjean looked marius full in the face 
 all that marius experienced was tumultuous and incoherent certain gusts of destiny produce these billows in our souls 
 we have all undergone moments of trouble in which everything within us is dispersed we say the first things that occur to us which are not always precisely those which should be said there are sudden revelations which one cannot bear and which intoxicate like baleful wine 
 marius was stupefied by the novel situation which presented itself to him to the point of addressing that man almost like a person who was angry with him for this avowal 
 but why he exclaimed do you tell me all this 
 who forces you to do so 
 you could have kept your secret to yourself you are neither denounced nor tracked nor pursued 
 you have a reason for wantonly making such a revelation 
 conclude 
 there is something more 
 in what connection do you make this confession what is your motive 
 my motive replied jean valjean in a voice so low and dull that one would have said that he was talking to himself rather than to marius from what motive in fact has this convict just said i am a convict well yes the motive is strange 
 it is out of honesty stay the unfortunate point is that i have a thread in my heart which keeps me fast 
 it is when one is old that that sort of thread is particularly solid 
 all life falls in ruin around one one resists 
 had i been able to tear out that thread to break it to undo the knot or to cut it to go far away i should have been safe i had only to go away there are diligences in the rue bouloy you are happy i am going 
 i have tried to break that thread i have jerked at it it would not break i tore my heart with it then i said 
 i cannot live anywhere else than here 
 i must stay well yes you are right i am a fool why not simply remain here you offer me a chamber in this house madame pontmercy is sincerely attached to me she said to the stretch out your arms to him your grandfather demands nothing better than to have me i suit him we shall live together and take our meals in common i shall give cosette my arm madame pontmercy excuse me it is a habit we shall have but one roof one table one fire the same in winter the same promenade in summer that is joy that is happiness that is everything 
 we shall live as one family one family 
 at that word jean valjean became wild 
 he folded his arms glared at the floor beneath his feet as though he would have excavated an abyss therein and his voice suddenly rose in thundering tones 
 as one family 
 no i belong to no family 
 i do not belong to yours i do not belong to any family of men 
 in houses where people are among themselves i am superfluous 
 there are families but there is nothing of the sort for me 
 i am an unlucky wretch i am left outside 
 did i have a father and mother 
 i almost doubt it on the day when i gave that child in marriage all came to an end i have seen her happy and that she is with a man whom she loves and that there exists here a kind old man a household of two angels and all joys in that house and that it was well i said to myself enter thou not 
 i could have lied it is true have deceived you all and remained monsieur fauchelevent 
 so long as it was for her i could lie but now it would be for myself and i must not 
 it was sufficient for me to hold my peace it is true and all would go on you ask me what has forced me to speak a very odd thing my conscience to hold my peace was very easy however 
 i passed the night in trying to persuade myself to it you questioned me and what i have just said to you is so extraordinary that you have the right to do it well yes i have passed the night in alleging reasons to myself and i gave myself very good reasons i have done what i could but there are two things in which i have not succeeded in breaking the thread that holds me fixed riveted and sealed here by the heart or in silencing some one who speaks softly to me when i am alone that is why i have come hither to tell you everything this morning everything or nearly everything 
 it is useless to tell you that which concerns only myself i keep that to myself 
 you know the essential points 
 so i have taken my mystery and have brought it to you 
 and i have disembowelled my secret before your eyes it was not a resolution that was easy to take 
 i struggled all night long 
 ah you think that i did not tell myself that this was no champmathieu affair that by concealing my name i was doing no one any injury that the name of fauchelevent had been given to me by fauchelevent himself out of gratitude for a service rendered to him and that i might assuredly keep it and that i should be happy in that chamber which you offer me that i should not be in any way that i should be in my own little corner and that while you would have cosette i should have the idea that i was in the same house with her 
 each one of us would have had his share of happiness 
 if i continued to be monsieur fauchelevent that would arrange everything 
 yes with the exception of my soul there was joy everywhere upon my surface but the bottom of my soul remained black 
 it is not enough to be happy one must be content thus i should have remained monsieur fauchelevent thus i should have concealed my true visage thus in the presence of your expansion i should have had an enigma thus in the midst of your full noonday i should have had shadows thus without crying ware i should have simply introduced the galleys to your fireside i should have taken my seat at your table with the thought that if you knew who i was you would drive me from it i should have allowed myself to be served by domestics who had they known would have said how horrible 
 i should have touched you with my elbow which you have a right to dislike i should have filched your clasps of the hand 
 there would have existed in your house a division of respect between venerable white locks and tainted white locks at your most intimate hours when all hearts thought themselves open to the very bottom to all the rest when we four were together your grandfather you two and myself a stranger would have been present i should have been side by side with you in your existence having for my only care not to disarrange the cover of my dreadful pit thus i a dead man should have thrust myself upon you who are living beings 
 i should have condemned her to myself forever you and cosette and i would have had all three of our heads in the green cap 
 does it not make you shudder 
 i am only the most crushed of men i should have been the most monstrous of men and i should have committed that crime every day 
 and i should have had that face of night upon my visage every day every day and i should have communicated to you a share in my taint every day every day to you my dearly beloved my children to you my innocent creatures 
 is it nothing to hold peace is it a simple matter to keep silence 
 no it is not simple 
 there is a silence which lies 
 and my lie and my fraud and my indignity and my cowardice and my treason and my crime i should have drained drop by drop i should have spit it out then swallowed it again i should have finished at midnight and have begun again at midday and my good morning would have lied and my good night would have lied and i should have slept on it i should have eaten it with my bread and i should have looked cosette in the face and i should have responded to the smile of the angel by the smile of the damned soul and i should have been an abominable villain why should i do it in order to be happy 
 in order to be happy have i the right to be happy 
 i stand outside of life sir 
 jean valjean paused 
 marius listened 
 such chains of ideas and of anguishes cannot be interrupted 
 jean valjean lowered his voice once more but it was no longer a dull was a sinister voice 
 you ask why i speak 
 i am neither denounced nor pursued nor tracked you say 
 yes 
 i am denounced yes 
 i am tracked 
 by whom by myself 
 it is i who bar the passage to myself and i drag myself and i push myself and i arrest myself and i execute myself and when one holds oneself one is firmly held 
 and seizing a handful of his own coat by the nape of the neck and extending it towards marius 
 do you see that fist he continued 
 you think that 
 it holds that collar in such a wise as not to release it well conscience is another grasp 
 if one desires to be happy sir one must never understand duty for as soon as one has comprehended it it is implacable 
 one would say that it punished you for comprehending it but no it rewards you for it places you in a hell where you feel god beside you 
 one has no sooner lacerated his own entrails than he is at peace with himself

 book last draught from the cup 
 chapter i 
 
 the seventh circle and the eighth heaven 
 the days that follow weddings are solitary 
 people respect the meditations of the happy pair 
 and also their tardy slumbers to some degree 
 the tumult of visits and congratulations only begins later on 
 on the morning of the th of february it was a little past midday when basque with napkin and under his arm busy in setting his antechamber to rights heard a light tap at the door 
 there had been no ring which was discreet on such a day basque opened the door and beheld m fauchelevent 
 he introduced him into the still encumbered and and which bore the air of a field of battle after the joys of the preceding evening 
 dame sir remarked basque we all woke up late 
 is your master up asked jean valjean 
 how is arm replied basque 
 better 
 is your master up 
 which one the old one or the new one 
 monsieur pontmercy 
 monsieur le baron said basque drawing himself up 
 a man is a baron most of all to his servants 
 he counts for something with them they are what a philosopher would call bespattered with the title and that flatters them 
 marius be it said in passing a militant republican as he had proved was now a baron in spite of himself 
 a small revolution had taken place in the family in connection with this title 
 it was now m gillenormand who clung to it and marius who detached himself from it but colonel pontmercy had written 
 my son will bear my title marius obeyed 
 and then cosette in whom the woman was beginning to dawn was delighted to be a baroness 
 monsieur le baron repeated basque 
 i will go and see i will tell him that m fauchelevent is here 
 no do not tell him that it is i tell him that some one wishes to speak to him in private and mention no name 
 ah ejaculated basque 
 i wish to surprise him 
 ah ejaculated basque once more emitting his second ah as an explanation of the first 
 and he left the room 
 jean valjean remained alone 
 the as we have just said was in great disorder it seemed as though by lending an air one might still hear the vague noise of the wedding 
 on the polished floor lay all sorts of flowers which had fallen from garlands and the wax candles burned to stumps added stalactites of wax to the crystal drops of the chandeliers 
 not a single piece of furniture was in its place in the corners three or four drawn close together in a circle had the appearance of continuing a conversation the whole effect was cheerful 
 a certain grace still lingers round a dead feast 
 it has been a happy thing 
 on the chairs in disarray among those fading flowers beneath those extinct lights people have thought of joy 
 the sun had succeeded to the chandelier and made its way gayly into the 
 several minutes elapsed 
 jean valjean stood motionless on the spot where basque had left him 
 he was very pale 
 his eyes were hollow and so sunken in his head by sleeplessness that they nearly disappeared in their orbits 
 his black coat bore the weary folds of a garment that has been up all night 
 the elbows were whitened with the down which the friction of cloth against linen leaves behind it 
 jean valjean stared at the window outlined on the polished floor at his feet by the sun 
 there came a sound at the door and he raised his eyes 
 marius entered his head well up his mouth smiling an indescribable light on his countenance his brow expanded his eyes triumphant he had not slept either 
 it is you father he exclaimed on catching sight of jean valjean that idiot of a basque had such a mysterious air 
 but you have come too early 
 it is only half past twelve 
 cosette is asleep 
 that word 
 father said to m fauchelevent by marius signified supreme felicity 
 there had always existed as the reader knows a lofty wall a coldness and a constraint between them ice which must be broken or melted 
 marius had reached that point of intoxication when the wall was lowered when the ice dissolved and when m fauchelevent was to him as to cosette a father 
 he continued 
 his words poured forth as is the peculiarity of divine paroxysms of joy 
 how glad i am to see you 
 if you only knew how we missed you yesterday good morning father 
 how is your hand 
 better is it not 
 and satisfied with the favorable reply which he had made to himself he pursued 
 we have both been talking about you 
 cosette loves you so dearly you must not forget that you have a chamber here we want nothing more to do with the rue de arme 
 we will have no more of it at all how could you go to live in a street like that which is sickly which is disagreeable which is ugly which has a barrier at one end where one is cold and into which one cannot enter 
 you are to come and install yourself here 
 and this very day 
 or you will have to deal with cosette 
 she means to lead us all by the nose i warn you you have your own chamber here it is close to ours it opens on the garden the trouble with the clock has been attended to the bed is made it is all ready you have only to take possession of it near your bed cosette has placed a huge old covered with utrecht velvet and she has said to it 
 stretch out your arms to him 
 a nightingale comes to the clump of acacias opposite your windows every spring 
 in two months more you will have it you will have its nest on your left and ours on your right 
 by night it will sing and by day cosette will prattle 
 your chamber faces due south 
 cosette will arrange your books for you your voyages of captain cook and the and all your affairs i believe that there is a little valise to which you are attached i have fixed upon a corner of honor for that 
 you have conquered my grandfather you suit him 
 we will live together 
 do you play whist you will overwhelm my grandfather with delight if you play whist 
 it is you who shall take cosette to walk on the days when i am at the courts you shall give her your arm you know as you used to in the luxembourg 
 we are absolutely resolved to be happy 
 and you shall be included in it in our happiness do you hear father 
 come will you breakfast with us 
 sir said jean valjean i have something to say to you i am an 
 the limit of shrill sounds perceptible can be overleaped as well in the case of the mind as in that of the ear 
 these words i am an proceeding from the mouth of m fauchelevent and entering the ear of marius overshot the possible 
 it seemed to him that something had just been said to him but he did not know what he stood with his mouth wide open 
 then he perceived that the man who was addressing him was frightful wholly absorbed in his own dazzled state he had not up to that moment observed the other terrible pallor 
 jean valjean untied the black cravat which supported his right arm unrolled the linen from around his hand bared his thumb and showed it to marius 
 there is nothing the matter with my hand said he 
 marius looked at the thumb 
 there has not been anything the matter with it went on jean valjean 
 there was in fact no trace of any injury 
 jean valjean continued 
 it was fitting that i should be absent from your marriage i absented myself as much as was in my power 
 so i invented this injury in order that i might not commit a forgery that i might not introduce a flaw into the marriage documents in order that i might escape from signing 
 marius stammered 
 what is the meaning of this 
 the meaning of it is replied jean valjean that i have been in the galleys 
 you are driving me mad exclaimed marius in terror 
 monsieur pontmercy said jean valjean i was nineteen years in the galleys 
 for theft 
 then i was condemned for life for theft for a second offence 
 at the present moment i have broken my ban 
 in vain did marius recoil before the reality refuse the fact resist the evidence he was forced to give way 
 he began to understand and as always happens in such cases he understood too much an inward shudder of hideous enlightenment flashed through him an idea which made him quiver traversed his mind 
 he caught a glimpse of a wretched destiny for himself in the future 
 say all say all he cried 
 you are father 
 and he retreated a couple of paces with a movement of indescribable horror 
 jean valjean elevated his head with so much majesty of attitude that he seemed to grow even to the ceiling 
 it is necessary that you should believe me here sir although our oath to others may not be received in law 
 here he paused then with a sort of sovereign and sepulchral authority he added articulating slowly and emphasizing the syllables 
 you will believe me 
 i the father of cosette before god no monsieur le baron pontmercy i am a peasant of faverolles i earned my living by pruning trees 
 my name is not fauchelevent but jean valjean 
 i am not related to cosette 
 reassure yourself 
 marius stammered 
 who will prove that to me 
 i since i tell you so 
 marius looked at the man 
 he was melancholy yet tranquil 
 no lie could proceed from such a calm 
 that which is icy is sincere the truth could be felt in that chill of the tomb 
 i believe you said marius 
 jean valjean bent his head as though taking note of this and continued 
 what am i to cosette 
 a ten years ago i did not know that she was in existence 
 i love her it is true 
 one loves a child whom one has seen when very young being old oneself 
 when one is old one feels oneself a grandfather towards all little children you may it seems to me suppose that i have something which resembles a heart 
 she was an orphan 
 without either father or mother she needed me 
 that is why i began to love her 
 children are so weak that the first comer even a man like me can become their protector 
 i have fulfilled this duty towards cosette i do not think that so slight a thing can be called a good action but if it be a good action well say that i have done it register this attenuating circumstance 
 cosette passes out of my life our two roads part 
 henceforth i can do nothing for her 
 she is madame pontmercy 
 her providence has changed and cosette gains by the change 
 all is well 
 as for the six hundred thousand francs you do not mention them to me but i forestall your thought they are a deposit 
 how did that deposit come into my hands 
 what does that matter 
 i restore the deposit nothing more can be demanded of me 
 i complete the restitution by announcing my true name 
 that concerns me 
 i have a reason for desiring that you should know who i am 
 and jean valjean looked marius full in the face 
 all that marius experienced was tumultuous and incoherent certain gusts of destiny produce these billows in our souls 
 we have all undergone moments of trouble in which everything within us is dispersed we say the first things that occur to us which are not always precisely those which should be said there are sudden revelations which one cannot bear and which intoxicate like baleful wine 
 marius was stupefied by the novel situation which presented itself to him to the point of addressing that man almost like a person who was angry with him for this avowal 
 but why he exclaimed do you tell me all this 
 who forces you to do so 
 you could have kept your secret to yourself you are neither denounced nor tracked nor pursued 
 you have a reason for wantonly making such a revelation 
 conclude 
 there is something more 
 in what connection do you make this confession what is your motive 
 my motive replied jean valjean in a voice so low and dull that one would have said that he was talking to himself rather than to marius from what motive in fact has this convict just said i am a convict well yes the motive is strange 
 it is out of honesty stay the unfortunate point is that i have a thread in my heart which keeps me fast 
 it is when one is old that that sort of thread is particularly solid 
 all life falls in ruin around one one resists 
 had i been able to tear out that thread to break it to undo the knot or to cut it to go far away i should have been safe i had only to go away there are diligences in the rue bouloy you are happy i am going 
 i have tried to break that thread i have jerked at it it would not break i tore my heart with it then i said 
 i cannot live anywhere else than here 
 i must stay well yes you are right i am a fool why not simply remain here you offer me a chamber in this house madame pontmercy is sincerely attached to me she said to the stretch out your arms to him your grandfather demands nothing better than to have me i suit him we shall live together and take our meals in common i shall give cosette my arm madame pontmercy excuse me it is a habit we shall have but one roof one table one fire the same in winter the same promenade in summer that is joy that is happiness that is everything 
 we shall live as one family one family 
 at that word jean valjean became wild 
 he folded his arms glared at the floor beneath his feet as though he would have excavated an abyss therein and his voice suddenly rose in thundering tones 
 as one family 
 no i belong to no family 
 i do not belong to yours i do not belong to any family of men 
 in houses where people are among themselves i am superfluous 
 there are families but there is nothing of the sort for me 
 i am an unlucky wretch i am left outside 
 did i have a father and mother 
 i almost doubt it on the day when i gave that child in marriage all came to an end i have seen her happy and that she is with a man whom she loves and that there exists here a kind old man a household of two angels and all joys in that house and that it was well i said to myself enter thou not 
 i could have lied it is true have deceived you all and remained monsieur fauchelevent 
 so long as it was for her i could lie but now it would be for myself and i must not 
 it was sufficient for me to hold my peace it is true and all would go on you ask me what has forced me to speak a very odd thing my conscience to hold my peace was very easy however 
 i passed the night in trying to persuade myself to it you questioned me and what i have just said to you is so extraordinary that you have the right to do it well yes i have passed the night in alleging reasons to myself and i gave myself very good reasons i have done what i could but there are two things in which i have not succeeded in breaking the thread that holds me fixed riveted and sealed here by the heart or in silencing some one who speaks softly to me when i am alone that is why i have come hither to tell you everything this morning everything or nearly everything 
 it is useless to tell you that which concerns only myself i keep that to myself 
 you know the essential points 
 so i have taken my mystery and have brought it to you 
 and i have disembowelled my secret before your eyes it was not a resolution that was easy to take 
 i struggled all night long 
 ah you think that i did not tell myself that this was no champmathieu affair that by concealing my name i was doing no one any injury that the name of fauchelevent had been given to me by fauchelevent himself out of gratitude for a service rendered to him and that i might assuredly keep it and that i should be happy in that chamber which you offer me that i should not be in any way that i should be in my own little corner and that while you would have cosette i should have the idea that i was in the same house with her 
 each one of us would have had his share of happiness 
 if i continued to be monsieur fauchelevent that would arrange everything 
 yes with the exception of my soul there was joy everywhere upon my surface but the bottom of my soul remained black 
 it is not enough to be happy one must be content thus i should have remained monsieur fauchelevent thus i should have concealed my true visage thus in the presence of your expansion i should have had an enigma thus in the midst of your full noonday i should have had shadows thus without crying ware i should have simply introduced the galleys to your fireside i should have taken my seat at your table with the thought that if you knew who i was you would drive me from it i should have allowed myself to be served by domestics who had they known would have said how horrible 
 i should have touched you with my elbow which you have a right to dislike i should have filched your clasps of the hand 
 there would have existed in your house a division of respect between venerable white locks and tainted white locks at your most intimate hours when all hearts thought themselves open to the very bottom to all the rest when we four were together your grandfather you two and myself a stranger would have been present i should have been side by side with you in your existence having for my only care not to disarrange the cover of my dreadful pit thus i a dead man should have thrust myself upon you who are living beings 
 i should have condemned her to myself forever you and cosette and i would have had all three of our heads in the green cap 
 does it not make you shudder 
 i am only the most crushed of men i should have been the most monstrous of men and i should have committed that crime every day 
 and i should have had that face of night upon my visage every day every day and i should have communicated to you a share in my taint every day every day to you my dearly beloved my children to you my innocent creatures 
 is it nothing to hold peace is it a simple matter to keep silence 
 no it is not simple 
 there is a silence which lies 
 and my lie and my fraud and my indignity and my cowardice and my treason and my crime i should have drained drop by drop i should have spit it out then swallowed it again i should have finished at midnight and have begun again at midday and my good morning would have lied and my good night would have lied and i should have slept on it i should have eaten it with my bread and i should have looked cosette in the face and i should have responded to the smile of the angel by the smile of the damned soul and i should have been an abominable villain why should i do it in order to be happy 
 in order to be happy have i the right to be happy 
 i stand outside of life sir 
 jean valjean paused 
 marius listened 
 such chains of ideas and of anguishes cannot be interrupted 
 jean valjean lowered his voice once more but it was no longer a dull was a sinister voice 
 you ask why i speak 
 i am neither denounced nor pursued nor tracked you say 
 yes 
 i am denounced yes 
 i am tracked 
 by whom by myself 
 it is i who bar the passage to myself and i drag myself and i push myself and i arrest myself and i execute myself and when one holds oneself one is firmly held 
 and seizing a handful of his own coat by the nape of the neck and extending it towards marius 
 do you see that fist he continued 
 you think that 
 it holds that collar in such a wise as not to release it well conscience is another grasp 
 if one desires to be happy sir one must never understand duty for as soon as one has comprehended it it is implacable 
 one would say that it punished you for comprehending it but no it rewards you for it places you in a hell where you feel god beside you 
 one has no sooner lacerated his own entrails than he is at peace with himself

 second epilogue 
 chapter iv 
 
 having abandoned the conception of the ancients as to the divine subjection of the will of a nation to some chosen man and the subjection of that will to the deity history cannot without contradictions take a single step till it has chosen one of two things either a return to the former belief in the direct intervention of the deity in human affairs or a definite explanation of the meaning of the force producing historical events and termed power 
 a return to the first is impossible the belief has been destroyed and so it is essential to explain what is meant by power 
 napoleon ordered an army to be raised and go to war we are so accustomed to that idea and have become so used to it that the question why did six hundred thousand men go to fight when napoleon uttered certain words seems to us senseless he had the power and so what he ordered was done 
 this reply is quite satisfactory if we believe that the power was given him by god but as soon as we do not admit that it becomes essential to determine what is this power of one man over others 
 it cannot be the direct physical power of a strong man over a weak one a domination based on the application or threat of physical force like the power of hercules nor can it be based on the effect of moral force as in their simplicity some historians think who say that the leading figures in history are heroes that is men gifted with a special strength of soul and mind called genius this power cannot be based on the predominance of moral strength for not to mention heroes such as napoleon about whose moral qualities opinions differ widely history shows us that neither a louis xi nor a metternich who ruled over millions of people had any particular moral qualities but on the contrary were generally morally weaker than any of the millions they ruled over 
 if the source of power lies neither in the physical nor in the moral qualities of him who possesses it it must evidently be looked for elsewhere in the relation to the people of the man who wields the power 
 and that is how power is understood by the science of jurisprudence that exchange bank of history which offers to exchange understanding of power for true gold 
 power is the collective will of the people transferred by expressed or tacit consent to their chosen rulers 
 in the domain of jurisprudence which consists of discussions of how a state and power might be arranged were it possible for all that to be arranged it is all very clear but when applied to history that definition of power needs explanation 
 the science of jurisprudence regards the state and power as the ancients regarded fire namely as something existing absolutely but for history the state and power are merely phenomena just as for modern physics fire is not an element but a phenomenon 
 from this fundamental difference between the view held by history and that held by jurisprudence it follows that jurisprudence can tell minutely how in its opinion power should be constituted and what power existing immutably outside time is but to questions about the meaning of the mutations of power in time it can answer nothing 
 if power be the collective will of the people transferred to their ruler was pugachev a representative of the will of the people if not then why was napoleon i why was napoleon iii a criminal when he was taken prisoner at boulogne and why later on were those criminals whom he arrested 
 do palace revolutions in which sometimes only two or three people take part transfer the will of the people to a new ruler in international relations is the will of the people also transferred to their conqueror was the will of the confederation of the rhine transferred to napoleon in was the will of the russian people transferred to napoleon in when our army in alliance with the french went to fight the austrians 
 to these questions three answers are possible 
 either to assume that the will of the people is always unconditionally transferred to the ruler or rulers they have chosen and that therefore every emergence of a new power every struggle against the power once appointed should be absolutely regarded as an infringement of the real power or that the will of the people is transferred to the rulers conditionally under definite and known conditions and to show that all limitations conflicts and even destructions of power result from a nonobservance by the rulers of the conditions under which their power was entrusted to them or that the will of the people is delegated to the rulers conditionally but that the conditions are unknown and indefinite and that the appearance of several authorities their struggles and their falls result solely from the greater or lesser fulfillment by the rulers of these unknown conditions on which the will of the people is transferred from some people to others 
 and these are the three ways in which the historians do explain the relation of the people to their rulers 
 some historians those biographical and specialist historians already referred to in their simplicity failing to understand the question of the meaning of power seem to consider that the collective will of the people is unconditionally transferred to historical persons and therefore when describing some single state they assume that particular power to be the one absolute and real power and that any other force opposing this is not a power but a violation of power mere violence 
 their theory suitable for primitive and peaceful periods of history has the inconvenience in application to complex and stormy periods in the life of nations during which various powers arise simultaneously and struggle with one another that a legitimist historian will prove that the national convention the directory and bonaparte were mere infringers of the true power while a republican and a bonapartist will prove the one that the convention and the other that the empire was the real power and that all the others were violations of power evidently the explanations furnished by these historians being mutually contradictory can only satisfy young children 
 recognizing the falsity of this view of history another set of historians say that power rests on a conditional delegation of the will of the people to their rulers and that historical leaders have power only conditionally on carrying out the program that the will of the people has by tacit agreement prescribed to them but what this program consists in these historians do not say or if they do they continually contradict one another 
 each historian according to his view of what constitutes a progress looks for these conditions in the greatness wealth freedom or enlightenment of citizens of france or some other country but not to mention the historians contradictions as to the nature of this program or even admitting that some one general program of these conditions exists the facts of history almost always contradict that theory if the conditions under which power is entrusted consist in the wealth freedom and enlightenment of the people how is it that louis xiv and ivan the terrible end their reigns tranquilly while louis xvi and charles i are executed by their people to this question historians reply that louis activity contrary to the program reacted on louis xvi but why did it not react on louis xiv or on louis xv why should it react just on louis xvi and what is the time limit for such reactions to these questions there are and can be no answers equally little does this view explain why for several centuries the collective will is not withdrawn from certain rulers and their heirs and then suddenly during a period of fifty years is transferred to the convention to the directory to napoleon to alexander to louis xviii to napoleon again to charles x to louis philippe to a republican government and to napoleon iii when explaining these rapid transfers of the will from from one individual to another especially in view of international relations conquests and alliances the historians are obliged to admit that some of these transfers are not normal delegations of the will but are accidents dependent on cunning on mistakes on craft or on the weakness of a diplomatist a ruler or a party leader so that the greater part of the events of history civil wars revolutions and conquests are presented by these historians not as the results of free transferences of the will but as results of the will of one or more individuals that is once again as usurpations of power and so these historians also see and admit historical events which are exceptions to the theory 
 these historians resemble a botanist who having noticed that some plants grow from seeds producing two cotyledons should insist that all that grows does so by sprouting into two leaves and that the palm the mushroom and even the oak which blossom into full growth and no longer resemble two leaves are deviations from the theory 
 historians of the third class assume that the will of the people is transferred to historic personages conditionally but that the conditions are unknown to us they say that historical personages have power only because they fulfill the will of the people which has been delegated to them 
 but in that case if the force that moves nations lies not in the historic leaders but in the nations themselves what significance have those leaders 
 the leaders these historians tell us express the will of the people the activity of the leaders represents the activity of the people 
 but in that case the question arises whether all the activity of the leaders serves as an expression of the will or only some part of it if the whole activity of the leaders serves as the expression of the will as some historians suppose then all the details of the court scandals contained in the biographies of a napoleon or a catherine serve to express the life of the nation which is evident nonsense but if it is only some particular side of the activity of an historical leader which serves to express the life as other philosophical historians believe then to determine which side of the activity of a leader expresses the life we have first of all to know in what the life consists 
 met by this difficulty historians of that class devise some most obscure impalpable and general abstraction which can cover all conceivable occurrences and declare this abstraction to be the aim of movement the most usual generalizations adopted by almost all the historians are freedom equality enlightenment progress civilization and culture postulating some generalization as the goal of the movement of humanity the historians study the men of whom the greatest number of monuments have remained kings ministers generals authors reformers popes and journalists to the extent to which in their opinion these persons have promoted or hindered that abstraction but as it is in no way proved that the aim of humanity does consist in freedom equality enlightenment or civilization and as the connection of the people with the rulers and enlighteners of humanity is only based on the arbitrary assumption that the collective will of the people is always transferred to the men whom we have noticed it happens that the activity of the millions who migrate burn houses abandon agriculture and destroy one another never is expressed in the account of the activity of some dozen people who did not burn houses practice agriculture or slay their fellow creatures 
 history proves this at every turn is the ferment of the peoples of the west at the end of the eighteenth century and their drive eastward explained by the activity of louis xiv xv and xvi their mistresses and ministers and by the lives of napoleon rousseau diderot beaumarchais and others 
 is the movement of the russian people eastward to kazan and siberia expressed by details of the morbid character of ivan the terrible and by his correspondence with kurbski 
 is the movement of the peoples at the time of the crusades explained by the life and activity of the godfreys and the and their ladies for us that movement of the peoples from west to east without leaders with a crowd of vagrants and with peter the hermit remains incomprehensible and yet more incomprehensible is the cessation of that movement when a rational and sacred aim for the crusade the deliverance of jerusalem had been clearly defined by historic leaders popes kings and knights incited the peoples to free the holy land but the people did not go for the unknown cause which had previously impelled them to go no longer existed the history of the godfreys and the minnesingers can evidently not cover the life of the peoples and the history of the godfreys and the minnesingers has remained the history of godfreys and minnesingers but the history of the life of the peoples and their impulses has remained unknown 
 still less does the history of authors and reformers explain to us the life of the peoples 
 the history of culture explains to us the impulses and conditions of life and thought of a writer or a reformer we learn that luther had a hot temper and said such and such things we learn that rousseau was suspicious and wrote such and such books but we do not learn why after the reformation the peoples massacred one another nor why during the french revolution they guillotined one another 
 if we unite both these kinds of history as is done by the newest historians we shall have the history of monarchs and writers but not the history of the life of the peoples

 and these are the three ways in which the historians do explain the relation of the people to their rulers 
 some historians those biographical and specialist historians already referred to in their simplicity failing to understand the question of the meaning of power seem to consider that the collective will of the people is unconditionally transferred to historical persons and therefore when describing some single state they assume that particular power to be the one absolute and real power and that any other force opposing this is not a power but a violation of power mere violence 
 their theory suitable for primitive and peaceful periods of history has the inconvenience in application to complex and stormy periods in the life of nations during which various powers arise simultaneously and struggle with one another that a legitimist historian will prove that the national convention the directory and bonaparte were mere infringers of the true power while a republican and a bonapartist will prove the one that the convention and the other that the empire was the real power and that all the others were violations of power evidently the explanations furnished by these historians being mutually contradictory can only satisfy young children 
 recognizing the falsity of this view of history another set of historians say that power rests on a conditional delegation of the will of the people to their rulers and that historical leaders have power only conditionally on carrying out the program that the will of the people has by tacit agreement prescribed to them but what this program consists in these historians do not say or if they do they continually contradict one another 
 each historian according to his view of what constitutes a progress looks for these conditions in the greatness wealth freedom or enlightenment of citizens of france or some other country but not to mention the historians contradictions as to the nature of this program or even admitting that some one general program of these conditions exists the facts of history almost always contradict that theory if the conditions under which power is entrusted consist in the wealth freedom and enlightenment of the people how is it that louis xiv and ivan the terrible end their reigns tranquilly while louis xvi and charles i are executed by their people to this question historians reply that louis activity contrary to the program reacted on louis xvi but why did it not react on louis xiv or on louis xv why should it react just on louis xvi and what is the time limit for such reactions to these questions there are and can be no answers equally little does this view explain why for several centuries the collective will is not withdrawn from certain rulers and their heirs and then suddenly during a period of fifty years is transferred to the convention to the directory to napoleon to alexander to louis xviii to napoleon again to charles x to louis philippe to a republican government and to napoleon iii when explaining these rapid transfers of the will from from one individual to another especially in view of international relations conquests and alliances the historians are obliged to admit that some of these transfers are not normal delegations of the will but are accidents dependent on cunning on mistakes on craft or on the weakness of a diplomatist a ruler or a party leader so that the greater part of the events of history civil wars revolutions and conquests are presented by these historians not as the results of free transferences of the will but as results of the will of one or more individuals that is once again as usurpations of power and so these historians also see and admit historical events which are exceptions to the theory 
 these historians resemble a botanist who having noticed that some plants grow from seeds producing two cotyledons should insist that all that grows does so by sprouting into two leaves and that the palm the mushroom and even the oak which blossom into full growth and no longer resemble two leaves are deviations from the theory 
 historians of the third class assume that the will of the people is transferred to historic personages conditionally but that the conditions are unknown to us they say that historical personages have power only because they fulfill the will of the people which has been delegated to them 
 but in that case if the force that moves nations lies not in the historic leaders but in the nations themselves what significance have those leaders 
 the leaders these historians tell us express the will of the people the activity of the leaders represents the activity of the people 
 but in that case the question arises whether all the activity of the leaders serves as an expression of the will or only some part of it if the whole activity of the leaders serves as the expression of the will as some historians suppose then all the details of the court scandals contained in the biographies of a napoleon or a catherine serve to express the life of the nation which is evident nonsense but if it is only some particular side of the activity of an historical leader which serves to express the life as other philosophical historians believe then to determine which side of the activity of a leader expresses the life we have first of all to know in what the life consists 
 met by this difficulty historians of that class devise some most obscure impalpable and general abstraction which can cover all conceivable occurrences and declare this abstraction to be the aim of movement the most usual generalizations adopted by almost all the historians are freedom equality enlightenment progress civilization and culture postulating some generalization as the goal of the movement of humanity the historians study the men of whom the greatest number of monuments have remained kings ministers generals authors reformers popes and journalists to the extent to which in their opinion these persons have promoted or hindered that abstraction but as it is in no way proved that the aim of humanity does consist in freedom equality enlightenment or civilization and as the connection of the people with the rulers and enlighteners of humanity is only based on the arbitrary assumption that the collective will of the people is always transferred to the men whom we have noticed it happens that the activity of the millions who migrate burn houses abandon agriculture and destroy one another never is expressed in the account of the activity of some dozen people who did not burn houses practice agriculture or slay their fellow creatures 
 history proves this at every turn is the ferment of the peoples of the west at the end of the eighteenth century and their drive eastward explained by the activity of louis xiv xv and xvi their mistresses and ministers and by the lives of napoleon rousseau diderot beaumarchais and others 
 is the movement of the russian people eastward to kazan and siberia expressed by details of the morbid character of ivan the terrible and by his correspondence with kurbski 
 is the movement of the peoples at the time of the crusades explained by the life and activity of the godfreys and the and their ladies for us that movement of the peoples from west to east without leaders with a crowd of vagrants and with peter the hermit remains incomprehensible and yet more incomprehensible is the cessation of that movement when a rational and sacred aim for the crusade the deliverance of jerusalem had been clearly defined by historic leaders popes kings and knights incited the peoples to free the holy land but the people did not go for the unknown cause which had previously impelled them to go no longer existed the history of the godfreys and the minnesingers can evidently not cover the life of the peoples and the history of the godfreys and the minnesingers has remained the history of godfreys and minnesingers but the history of the life of the peoples and their impulses has remained unknown 
 still less does the history of authors and reformers explain to us the life of the peoples 
 the history of culture explains to us the impulses and conditions of life and thought of a writer or a reformer we learn that luther had a hot temper and said such and such things we learn that rousseau was suspicious and wrote such and such books but we do not learn why after the reformation the peoples massacred one another nor why during the french revolution they guillotined one another 
 if we unite both these kinds of history as is done by the newest historians we shall have the history of monarchs and writers but not the history of the life of the peoples

 book last draught from the cup 
 chapter i 
 
 and with a poignant accent he added 
 monsieur pontmercy this is not common sense i am an honest man it is by degrading myself in your eyes that i elevate myself in my own this has happened to me once before but it was less painful then it was a mere nothing 
 yes an honest man 
 i should not be so if through my fault you had continued to esteem me now that you despise me i am so 
 i have that fatality hanging over me that not being able to ever have anything but stolen consideration that consideration humiliates me and crushes me inwardly and in order that i may respect myself it is necessary that i should be despised 
 then i straighten up again 
 i am a who obeys his conscience 
 i know well that that is most improbable but what would you have me do about it it is the fact 
 i have entered into engagements with myself i keep them 
 there are encounters which bind us there are chances which involve us in duties you see monsieur pontmercy various things have happened to me in the course of my life 
 again jean valjean paused swallowing his saliva with an effort as though his words had a bitter and then he went on 
 when one has such a horror hanging over one one has not the right to make others share it without their knowledge one has not the right to make them slip over own precipice without their perceiving it one has not the right to let red blouse drag upon them one has no right to slyly encumber with misery the happiness of others 
 it is hideous to approach those who are healthy and to touch them in the dark with ulcer 
 in spite of the fact that fauchelevent lent me his name i have no right to use it he could give it to me but i could not take it 
 a name is an i you see sir that i have thought somewhat i have read a little although i am a peasant and you see that i express myself properly i understand things 
 i have procured myself an education 
 well yes to abstract a name and to place oneself under it is dishonest letters of the alphabet can be filched like a purse or a watch to be a false signature in flesh and blood to be a living false key to enter the house of honest people by picking their lock never more to look straightforward to forever eye askance to be infamous within the i no no no no no 
 it is better to suffer to bleed to weep to tear skin from the flesh with nails to pass nights writhing in anguish to devour oneself body and soul 
 that is why i have just told you all this wantonly as you say 
 he drew a painful breath and hurled this final word 
 in days gone by i stole a loaf of bread in order to live in order to live i will not steal a name 
 to live interrupted marius 
 you do not need that name in order to live 
 ah 
 i understand the matter said jean valjean raising and lowering his head several times in succession 
 a silence ensued 
 both held their peace each plunged in a gulf of thoughts 
 marius was sitting near a table and resting the corner of his mouth on one of his fingers which was folded back jean valjean was pacing to and fro 
 he paused before a mirror and remained motionless 
 then as though replying to some inward course of reasoning he said as he gazed at the mirror which he did not see 
 while at present i am relieved 
 he took up his march again and walked to the other end of the at the moment when he turned round he perceived that marius was watching his walk 
 then he said with an inexpressible intonation 
 i drag my leg a little 
 now you understand why 
 then he turned fully round towards marius 
 and now sir imagine this 
 i have said nothing i have remained monsieur fauchelevent i have taken my place in your house i am one of you i am in my chamber i come to breakfast in the morning in slippers in the evening all three of us go to the play i accompany madame pontmercy to the tuileries and to the place royale we are together you think me your equal one fine day you are there and i am there we are conversing we are laughing all at once you hear a voice shouting this name 
 jean valjean and behold that terrible hand the police darts from the darkness and abruptly tears off my mask 
 again he paused marius had sprung to his feet with a shudder jean valjean resumed 
 what do you say to that 
 marius silence answered for him 
 jean valjean continued 
 you see that i am right in not holding my peace 
 be happy be in heaven be the angel of an angel exist in the sun be content therewith and do not trouble yourself about the means which a poor damned wretch takes to open his breast and force his duty to come forth you have before you sir a wretched man 
 marius slowly crossed the room and when he was quite close to jean valjean he offered the latter his hand 
 but marius was obliged to step up and take that hand which was not offered jean valjean let him have his own way and it seemed to marius that he pressed a hand of marble 
 my grandfather has friends said marius i will procure your pardon 
 it is useless replied jean valjean 
 i am believed to be dead and that suffices 
 the dead are not subjected to surveillance they are supposed to rot in peace 
 death is the same thing as pardon 
 and disengaging the hand which marius held he added with a sort of inexorable dignity 
 moreover the friend to whom i have recourse is the doing of my duty and i need but one pardon that of my conscience 
 at that moment a door at the other end of the opened gently half way and in the opening head appeared they saw only her sweet face her hair was in charming disorder her eyelids were still swollen with sleep 
 she made the movement of a bird which thrusts its head out of its nest glanced first at her husband then at jean valjean and cried to them with a smile so that they seemed to behold a smile at the heart of a rose 
 i will wager that you are talking politics 
 how stupid that is instead of being with me 
 jean valjean shuddered 
 cosette stammered marius 
 and he paused 
 one would have said that they were two criminals 
 cosette who was radiant continued to gaze at both of them there was something in her eyes like gleams of paradise 
 i have caught you in the very act said cosette 
 just now i heard my father fauchelevent through the door saying 
 conscience doing my duty that is politics indeed it is 
 i will not have it 
 people should not talk politics the very next day it is not right 
 you are mistaken 
 cosette said marius we are talking business we are discussing the best investment of your six hundred thousand francs 
 that is not it at all interrupted cosette 
 i am coming does any body want me here 
 and passing resolutely through the door she entered the she was dressed in a voluminous white with a thousand folds and large sleeves which starting from the neck fell to her feet 
 in the golden heavens of some ancient gothic pictures there are these charming sacks fit to clothe the angels 
 she contemplated herself from head to foot in a long mirror then exclaimed in an outburst of ineffable ecstasy 
 there was once a king and a queen 
 oh how happy i am 
 that said she made a curtsey to marius and to jean valjean 
 there said she i am going to install myself near you in an we breakfast in half an hour you shall say anything you like i know well that men must talk and i will be very good 
 marius took her by the arm and said lovingly to her 
 we are talking business 
 by the way said cosette i have opened my window a flock of pierrots has arrived in the not maskers is but not for the birds 
 i tell you that we are talking business go my little cosette leave us alone for a moment 
 we are talking figures 
 that will bore you 
 you have a charming cravat on this morning marius 
 you are very dandified monseigneur 
 no it will not bore me 
 i assure you that it will bore you 
 no since it is you 
 i shall not understand you but i shall listen to you 
 when one hears the voices of those whom one loves one does not need to understand the words that they utter that we should be here is all that i desire i shall remain with you bah 
 you are my beloved cosette 
 impossible 
 impossible 
 yes 
 very good said cosette 
 i was going to tell you some news i could have told you that your grandfather is still asleep that your aunt is at mass that the chimney in my father room smokes that nicolette has sent for the that toussaint and nicolette have already quarrelled that nicolette makes sport of stammer 
 well you shall know nothing ah it is impossible you shall see gentlemen that i in my turn can say 
 it is impossible 
 then who will be caught 
 i beseech you my little marius let me stay here with you two 
 i swear to you that it is indispensable that we should be alone 
 well am i anybody 
 jean valjean had not uttered a single word 
 cosette turned to him 
 in the first place father i want you to come and embrace me what do you mean by not saying anything instead of taking my part who gave me such a father as that 
 you must perceive that my family life is very unhappy 
 my husband beats me 
 come embrace me instantly 
 jean valjean approached 
 cosette turned toward marius 
 as for you i shall make a face at you 
 then she presented her brow to jean valjean 
 jean valjean advanced a step toward her 
 cosette recoiled 
 father you are pale 
 does your arm hurt you 
 it is well said jean valjean 
 did you sleep badly 
 no 
 are you sad 
 no 
 embrace me if you are well if you sleep well if you are content i will not scold you 
 and again she offered him her brow 
 jean valjean dropped a kiss upon that brow whereon rested a celestial gleam 
 smile 
 jean valjean obeyed 
 it was the smile of a spectre 
 now defend me against my husband 
 cosette ejaculated marius 
 get angry father 
 say that i must stay 
 you can certainly talk before me 
 so you think me very silly 
 what you say is astonishing business placing money in a bank a great matter truly men make mysteries out of nothing 
 i am very pretty this morning look at me marius 
 and with an adorable shrug of the shoulders and an indescribably exquisite pout she glanced at marius 
 i love you said marius 
 i adore you said cosette 
 and they fell irresistibly into each arms 
 now said cosette adjusting a fold of her with a triumphant little grimace i shall stay 
 no not that said marius in a supplicating tone 
 we have to finish something 
 still no 
 marius assumed a grave tone 
 i assure you cosette that it is impossible 
 ah you put on your voice sir 
 that is well i go you father have not upheld me 
 monsieur my father monsieur my husband you are tyrants 
 i shall go and tell grandpapa if you think that i am going to return and talk platitudes to you you are mistaken 
 i am proud 
 i shall wait for you now you shall see that it is you who are going to be bored without me i am going it is well 
 and she left the room 
 two seconds later the door opened once more her fresh and rosy head was again thrust between the two leaves and she cried to them 
 i am very angry indeed 
 the door closed again and the shadows descended once more 
 it was as though a ray of sunlight should have suddenly traversed the night without itself being conscious of it 
 marius made sure that the door was securely closed 
 poor cosette he murmured when she finds out 
 at that word jean valjean trembled in every limb 
 he fixed on marius a bewildered eye 
 cosette oh yes it is true you are going to tell cosette about this that is right 
 stay i had not thought of that 
 one has the strength for one thing but not for another 
 sir i conjure you i entreat now sir give me your most sacred word of honor that you will not tell her 
 is it not enough that you should know it i have been able to say it myself without being forced to it i could have told it to the universe to the whole was all one to me 
 but she she does not know what it is it would terrify her 
 what a convict we should be obliged to explain matters to her to say to her 
 he is a man who has been in the galleys she saw the pass by one day 
 oh 
 my god he dropped into an and hid his face in his hands 
 his grief was not audible but from the quivering of his shoulders it was evident that he was weeping 
 silent tears terrible tears 
 there is something of suffocation in the sob 
 he was seized with a sort of convulsion he threw himself against the back of the chair as though to gain breath letting his arms fall and allowing marius to see his face inundated with tears and marius heard him murmur so low that his voice seemed to issue from fathomless depths 
 oh would that i could die 
 be at your ease said marius i will keep your secret for myself alone 
 x and less touched perhaps than he ought to have been but forced for the last hour to familiarize himself with something as unexpected as it was dreadful gradually beholding the convict superposed before his very eyes upon m fauchelevent overcome little by little by that lugubrious reality and led by the natural inclination of the situation to recognize the space which had just been placed between that man and himself marius added 
 it is impossible that i should not speak a word to you with regard to the deposit which you have so faithfully and honestly remitted that is an act of probity 
 it is just that some recompense should be bestowed on you 
 fix the sum yourself it shall be counted out to you do not fear to set it very high 
 i thank you sir replied jean valjean gently 
 he remained in thought for a moment mechanically passing the tip of his across his then he lifted up his voice 
 all is nearly over 
 but one last thing remains for me 
 what is it 
 jean valjean struggled with what seemed a last hesitation and without voice without breath he stammered rather than said 
 now that you know do you think sir you who are the master that i ought not to see cosette any more 
 i think that would be better replied marius coldly 
 i shall never see her more murmured jean valjean 
 and he directed his steps towards the door 
 he laid his hand on the knob the latch yielded the door opened jean valjean pushed it open far enough to pass through stood motionless for a second then closed the door again and turned to marius 
 he was no longer pale he was livid 
 there were no longer any tears in his eyes but only a sort of tragic flame 
 his voice had regained a strange composure 
 stay sir he said 
 if you will allow it i will come to see her i assure you that i desire it greatly 
 if i had not cared to see cosette i should not have made to you the confession that i have made i should have gone away but as i desired to remain in the place where cosette is and to continue to see her i had to tell you about it honestly 
 you follow my reasoning do you not it is a matter easily understood 
 you see i have had her with me for more than nine years 
 we lived first in that hut on the boulevard then in the convent then near the luxembourg that was where you saw her for the first time 
 you remember her blue plush hat 
 then we went to the quartier des invalides where there was a railing on a garden the rue plumet 
 i lived in a little back whence i could hear her piano that was my life 
 we never left each other 
 that lasted for nine years and some months 
 i was like her own father and she was my child 
 i do not know whether you understand monsieur pontmercy but to go away now never to see her again never to speak to her again to no longer have anything would be hard 
 if you do not disapprove of it i will come to see cosette from time to time i will not come often 
 i will not remain long 
 you shall give orders that i am to be received in the little on the ground floor 
 i could enter perfectly well by the back door but that might create surprise perhaps and it would be better i think for me to enter by the usual door 
 truly sir i should like to see a little more of cosette 
 as rarely as you please put yourself in my place i have nothing left but that 
 and then we must be cautious 
 if i no longer come at all it would produce a bad effect it would be considered singular 
 what i can do by the way is to come in the afternoon when night is beginning to fall 
 you shall come every evening said marius and cosette will be waiting for you 
 you are kind sir said jean valjean 
 marius saluted jean valjean happiness escorted despair to the door and these two men parted

 what you say is astonishing business placing money in a bank a great matter truly men make mysteries out of nothing 
 i am very pretty this morning look at me marius 
 and with an adorable shrug of the shoulders and an indescribably exquisite pout she glanced at marius 
 i love you said marius 
 i adore you said cosette 
 and they fell irresistibly into each arms 
 now said cosette adjusting a fold of her with a triumphant little grimace i shall stay 
 no not that said marius in a supplicating tone 
 we have to finish something 
 still no 
 marius assumed a grave tone 
 i assure you cosette that it is impossible 
 ah you put on your voice sir 
 that is well i go you father have not upheld me 
 monsieur my father monsieur my husband you are tyrants 
 i shall go and tell grandpapa if you think that i am going to return and talk platitudes to you you are mistaken 
 i am proud 
 i shall wait for you now you shall see that it is you who are going to be bored without me i am going it is well 
 and she left the room 
 two seconds later the door opened once more her fresh and rosy head was again thrust between the two leaves and she cried to them 
 i am very angry indeed 
 the door closed again and the shadows descended once more 
 it was as though a ray of sunlight should have suddenly traversed the night without itself being conscious of it 
 marius made sure that the door was securely closed 
 poor cosette he murmured when she finds out 
 at that word jean valjean trembled in every limb 
 he fixed on marius a bewildered eye 
 cosette oh yes it is true you are going to tell cosette about this that is right 
 stay i had not thought of that 
 one has the strength for one thing but not for another 
 sir i conjure you i entreat now sir give me your most sacred word of honor that you will not tell her 
 is it not enough that you should know it i have been able to say it myself without being forced to it i could have told it to the universe to the whole was all one to me 
 but she she does not know what it is it would terrify her 
 what a convict we should be obliged to explain matters to her to say to her 
 he is a man who has been in the galleys she saw the pass by one day 
 oh 
 my god he dropped into an and hid his face in his hands 
 his grief was not audible but from the quivering of his shoulders it was evident that he was weeping 
 silent tears terrible tears 
 there is something of suffocation in the sob 
 he was seized with a sort of convulsion he threw himself against the back of the chair as though to gain breath letting his arms fall and allowing marius to see his face inundated with tears and marius heard him murmur so low that his voice seemed to issue from fathomless depths 
 oh would that i could die 
 be at your ease said marius i will keep your secret for myself alone 
 x and less touched perhaps than he ought to have been but forced for the last hour to familiarize himself with something as unexpected as it was dreadful gradually beholding the convict superposed before his very eyes upon m fauchelevent overcome little by little by that lugubrious reality and led by the natural inclination of the situation to recognize the space which had just been placed between that man and himself marius added 
 it is impossible that i should not speak a word to you with regard to the deposit which you have so faithfully and honestly remitted that is an act of probity 
 it is just that some recompense should be bestowed on you 
 fix the sum yourself it shall be counted out to you do not fear to set it very high 
 i thank you sir replied jean valjean gently 
 he remained in thought for a moment mechanically passing the tip of his across his then he lifted up his voice 
 all is nearly over 
 but one last thing remains for me 
 what is it 
 jean valjean struggled with what seemed a last hesitation and without voice without breath he stammered rather than said 
 now that you know do you think sir you who are the master that i ought not to see cosette any more 
 i think that would be better replied marius coldly 
 i shall never see her more murmured jean valjean 
 and he directed his steps towards the door 
 he laid his hand on the knob the latch yielded the door opened jean valjean pushed it open far enough to pass through stood motionless for a second then closed the door again and turned to marius 
 he was no longer pale he was livid 
 there were no longer any tears in his eyes but only a sort of tragic flame 
 his voice had regained a strange composure 
 stay sir he said 
 if you will allow it i will come to see her i assure you that i desire it greatly 
 if i had not cared to see cosette i should not have made to you the confession that i have made i should have gone away but as i desired to remain in the place where cosette is and to continue to see her i had to tell you about it honestly 
 you follow my reasoning do you not it is a matter easily understood 
 you see i have had her with me for more than nine years 
 we lived first in that hut on the boulevard then in the convent then near the luxembourg that was where you saw her for the first time 
 you remember her blue plush hat 
 then we went to the quartier des invalides where there was a railing on a garden the rue plumet 
 i lived in a little back whence i could hear her piano that was my life 
 we never left each other 
 that lasted for nine years and some months 
 i was like her own father and she was my child 
 i do not know whether you understand monsieur pontmercy but to go away now never to see her again never to speak to her again to no longer have anything would be hard 
 if you do not disapprove of it i will come to see cosette from time to time i will not come often 
 i will not remain long 
 you shall give orders that i am to be received in the little on the ground floor 
 i could enter perfectly well by the back door but that might create surprise perhaps and it would be better i think for me to enter by the usual door 
 truly sir i should like to see a little more of cosette 
 as rarely as you please put yourself in my place i have nothing left but that 
 and then we must be cautious 
 if i no longer come at all it would produce a bad effect it would be considered singular 
 what i can do by the way is to come in the afternoon when night is beginning to fall 
 you shall come every evening said marius and cosette will be waiting for you 
 you are kind sir said jean valjean 
 marius saluted jean valjean happiness escorted despair to the door and these two men parted

 the life of the nations is not contained in the lives of a few men for the connection between those men and the nations has not been found the theory that this connection is based on the transference of the collective will of a people to certain historical personages is an hypothesis unconfirmed by the experience of history 
 the theory of the transference of the collective will of the people to historic persons may perhaps explain much in the domain of jurisprudence and be essential for its purposes but in its application to history as soon as revolutions conquests or civil wars occur that is as soon as history begins that theory explains nothing 
 the theory seems irrefutable just because the act of transference of the will cannot be verified for it never occurred 
 whatever happens and whoever may stand at the head of affairs the theory can always say that such and such a person took the lead because the collective will was transferred to him 
 the replies this theory gives to historical questions are like the replies of a man who watching the movements of a herd of cattle and paying no attention to the varying quality of the pasturage in different parts of the field or to the driving of the herdsman should attribute the direction the herd takes to what animal happens to be at its head 
 the herd goes in that direction because the animal in front leads it and the collective will of all the other animals is vested in that leader this is what historians of the first class say those who assume the unconditional transference of the will 
 if the animals leading the herd change this happens because the collective will of all the animals is transferred from one leader to another according to whether the animal is or is not leading them in the direction selected by the whole herd such is the reply historians who assume that the collective will of the people is delegated to rulers under conditions which they regard as known with this method of observation it often happens that the observer influenced by the direction he himself prefers regards those as leaders who owing to the change of direction are no longer in front but on one side or even in the rear 
 if the animals in front are continually changing and the direction of the whole herd is constantly altered this is because in order to follow a given direction the animals transfer their will to the animals that have attracted our attention and to study the movements of the herd we must watch the movements of all the prominent animals moving on all sides of the herd so say the third class of historians who regard all historical persons from monarchs to journalists as the expression of their age 
 the theory of the transference of the will of the people to historic persons is merely a paraphrase a restatement of the question in other words 
 what causes historical events power what is power power is the collective will of the people transferred to one person under what condition is the will of the people delegated to one person on condition that that person expresses the will of the whole people that is power is power in other words power is a word the meaning of which we do not understand 
 if the realm of human knowledge were confined to abstract reasoning then having subjected to criticism the explanation of power that juridical science gives us humanity would conclude that power is merely a word and has no real existence but to understand phenomena man has besides abstract reasoning experience by which he verifies his reflections and experience tells us that power is not merely a word but an actually existing phenomenon 
 not to speak of the fact that no description of the collective activity of men can do without the conception of power the existence of power is proved both by history and by observing contemporary events 
 whenever an event occurs a man appears or men appear by whose will the event seems to have taken place napoleon iii issues a decree and the french go to mexico the king of prussia and bismarck issue decrees and an army enters bohemia napoleon i issues a decree and an army enters russia alexander i gives a command and the french submit to the bourbons experience shows us that whatever event occurs it is always related to the will of one or of several men who have decreed it 
 the historians in accord with the old habit of acknowledging divine intervention in human affairs want to see the cause of events in the expression of the will of someone endowed with power but that supposition is not confirmed either by reason or by experience 
 on the one side reflection shows that the expression of a will his words are only part of the general activity expressed in an event as for instance in a war or a revolution and so without assuming an incomprehensible supernatural force a miracle one cannot admit that words can be the immediate cause of the movements of millions of men on the other hand even if we admitted that words could be the cause of events history shows that the expression of the will of historical personages does not in most cases produce any effect that is to say their commands are often not executed and sometimes the very opposite of what they order occurs 
 without admitting divine intervention in the affairs of humanity we cannot regard power as the cause of events 
 power from the standpoint of experience is merely the relation that exists between the expression of will and the execution of that will by others 
 to explain the conditions of that relationship we must first establish a conception of the expression of will referring it to man and not to the deity 
 if the deity issues a command expresses his will as ancient history tells us the expression of that will is independent of time and is not caused by anything for the divinity is not controlled by an event but speaking of commands that are the expression of the will of men acting in time and in relation to one another to explain the connection of commands with events we must restore the condition of all that takes place the continuity of movement in time both of the events and of the person who commands and the inevitability of the connection between the person commanding and those who execute his command

 book last draught from the cup 
 chapter ii 
 
 the obscurities which a revelation can contain 
 marius was quite upset 
 the sort of estrangement which he had always felt towards the man beside whom he had seen cosette was now explained to him there was something enigmatic about that person of which his instinct had warned him 
 this enigma was the most hideous of disgraces the galleys this m fauchelevent was the convict jean valjean 
 to abruptly find such a secret in the midst of happiness resembles the discovery of a scorpion in a nest of turtledoves 
 was the happiness of marius and cosette thenceforth condemned to such a neighborhood 
 was this an accomplished fact 
 did the acceptance of that man form a part of the marriage now consummated was there nothing to be done 
 had marius wedded the convict as well 
 in vain may one be crowned with light and joy in vain may one taste the grand purple hour of life happy love such shocks would force even the archangel in his ecstasy even the demigod in his glory to shudder 
 as is always the case in changes of view of this nature marius asked himself whether he had nothing with which to reproach himself had he been wanting in divination 
 had he been wanting in prudence had he involuntarily dulled his wits 
 a little perhaps 
 had he entered upon this love affair which had ended in his marriage to cosette without taking sufficient precautions to throw light upon the surroundings 
 he is thus by a series of successive admissions of ourselves in regard to ourselves that life amends us little by admitted the chimerical and visionary side of his nature a sort of internal cloud peculiar to many organizations and which in paroxysms of passion and sorrow dilates as the temperature of the soul changes and invades the entire man to such a degree as to render him nothing more than a conscience bathed in a mist 
 we have more than once indicated this characteristic element of marius individuality 
 he recalled that in the intoxication of his love in the rue plumet during those six or seven ecstatic weeks he had not even spoke to cosette of that drama in the gorbeau hovel where the victim had taken up such a singular line of silence during the struggle and the ensuing flight 
 how had it happened that he had not mentioned this to cosette 
 yet it was so near and so terrible how had it come to pass that he had not even named the thenardiers and particularly on the day when he had encountered eponine he now found it almost difficult to explain his silence of that time nevertheless he could account for it 
 he recalled his benumbed state his intoxication with cosette love absorbing everything that catching away of each other into the ideal and perhaps also like the imperceptible quantity of reason mingled with this violent and charming state of the soul a vague dull instinct impelling him to conceal and abolish in his memory that redoubtable adventure contact with which he dreaded in which he did not wish to play any part his agency in which he had kept secret and in which he could be neither narrator nor witness without being an accuser 
 moreover these few weeks had been a flash of lightning there had been no time for anything except love 
 in short having weighed everything turned everything over in his mind examined everything whatever might have been the consequences if he had told cosette about the gorbeau ambush even if he had discovered that jean valjean was a convict would that have changed him marius would that have changed her cosette 
 would he have drawn back would he have adored her any the less 
 would he have refrained from marrying her 
 no then there was nothing to regret nothing with which he need reproach himself 
 all was well there is a deity for those drunken men who are called lovers marius blind had followed the path which he would have chosen had he been in full possession of his sight 
 love had bandaged his eyes in order to lead him whither 
 to paradise 
 but this paradise was henceforth complicated with an infernal accompaniment 
 marius ancient estrangement towards this man towards this fauchelevent who had turned into jean valjean was at present mingled with horror 
 in this horror let us state there was some pity and even a certain surprise 
 this thief this thief guilty of a second offence had restored that deposit 
 and what a deposit 
 six hundred thousand francs 
 he alone was in the secret of that deposit 
 he might have kept it all he had restored it all 
 moreover he had himself revealed his situation 
 nothing forced him to this 
 if any one learned who he was it was through himself in this avowal there was something more than acceptance of humiliation there was acceptance of peril 
 for a condemned man a mask is not a mask it is a shelter 
 a false name is security and he had rejected that false name 
 he the might have hidden himself forever in an honest family he had withstood this temptation and with what motive 
 through a conscientious scruple he himself explained this with the irresistible accents of truth in short whatever this jean valjean might be he was undoubtedly a conscience which was awakening 
 there existed some mysterious which had begun and to all appearances scruples had for a long time already controlled this man 
 such fits of justice and goodness are not characteristic of vulgar natures an awakening of conscience is grandeur of soul 
 jean valjean was sincere 
 this sincerity visible palpable irrefragable evident from the very grief that it caused him rendered inquiries useless and conferred authority on all that that man had said 
 here for marius there was a strange reversal of situations what breathed from m fauchelevent distrust 
 what did jean valjean inspire confidence 
 in the mysterious balance of this jean valjean which the pensive marius struck he admitted the active principle he admitted the passive principle and he tried to reach a balance 
 but all this went on as in a storm 
 marius while endeavoring to form a clear idea of this man and while pursuing jean valjean so to speak in the depths of his thought lost him and found him again in a fatal mist 
 the deposit honestly restored the probity of the confession these were good 
 this produced a lightening of the cloud then the cloud became black once more 
 troubled as were marius memories a shadow of them returned to him 
 after all what was that adventure in the jondrette attic why had that man taken to flight on the arrival of the police instead of entering a complaint 
 here marius found the answer 
 because that man was a fugitive from justice who had broken his ban 
 another question 
 why had that man come to the barricade 
 for marius now once more distinctly beheld that recollection which had in his emotions like sympathetic ink at the application of heat 
 this man had been in the barricade he had not fought there 
 what had he come there for 
 in the presence of this question a spectre sprang up and replied 
 javert 
 marius recalled perfectly now that funereal sight of jean valjean dragging the pinioned javert out of the barricade and he still heard behind the corner of the little rue mondetour that frightful pistol shot 
 obviously there was hatred between that police spy and the the one was in the way 
 jean valjean had gone to the barricade for the purpose of revenging himself he had arrived late 
 he probably knew that javert was a prisoner there the corsican vendetta has penetrated to certain lower strata and has become the law there it is so simple that it does not astonish souls which are but half turned towards good and those hearts are so constituted that a criminal who is in the path of repentance may be scrupulous in the matter of theft and unscrupulous in the matter of vengeance 
 jean valjean had killed javert 
 at least that seemed to be evident 
 this was the final question to be sure but to this there was no reply 
 this question marius felt like pincers 
 how had it come to pass that jean existence had elbowed that of cosette for so long a period 
 what melancholy sport of providence was that which had placed that child in contact with that man 
 are there then chains for two which are forged on high and does god take pleasure in coupling the angel with the demon 
 so a crime and an innocence can be in the mysterious galleys of wretchedness in that defiling of condemned persons which is called human destiny can two brows pass side by side the one ingenuous the other formidable the one all bathed in the divine whiteness of dawn the other forever blemished by the flash of an eternal lightning who could have arranged that inexplicable pairing off 
 in what manner in consequence of what prodigy had any community of life been established between this celestial little creature and that old criminal 
 who could have bound the lamb to the wolf and what was still more incomprehensible have attached the wolf to the lamb for the wolf loved the lamb for the fierce creature adored the feeble one for during the space of nine years the angel had had the monster as her point of support 
 childhood and girlhood her advent in the daylight her virginal growth towards life and light had been sheltered by that hideous devotion here questions exfoliated so to speak into innumerable enigmas abysses yawned at the bottoms of abysses and marius could no longer bend over jean valjean without becoming dizzy 
 what was this 
 the old symbols of genesis are eternal in human society such as it now exists and until a broader day shall effect a change in it there will always be two men the one superior the other subterranean the one which is according to good is abel the other which is according to evil is cain 
 what was this tender cain 
 what was this ruffian religiously absorbed in the adoration of a virgin watching over her rearing her guarding her dignifying her and enveloping her impure as he was himself with purity 
 what was that which had venerated that innocence to such a point as not to leave upon it a single spot 
 what was this jean valjean educating cosette 
 what was this figure of the shadows which had for its only object the preservation of the rising of a star from every shadow and from every cloud 
 that was jean secret that was also secret 
 in the presence of this double secret marius recoiled 
 the one in some sort reassured him as to the other 
 god was as visible in this affair as was jean valjean 
 god has his instruments he makes use of the tool which he wills 
 he is not responsible to men 
 do we know how god sets about the work 
 jean valjean had labored over cosette 
 he had to some extent made that soul that was incontestable 
 well what then 
 the workman was horrible but the work was admirable 
 god produces his miracles as seems good to him 
 he had constructed that charming cosette and he had employed jean valjean 
 it had pleased him to choose this strange collaborator for himself 
 what account have we to demand of him is this the first time that the has aided the spring to create the rose 
 marius made himself these replies and declared to himself that they were good 
 he had not dared to press jean valjean on all the points which we have just indicated but he did not confess to himself that he did not dare to do it 
 he adored cosette he possessed cosette cosette was splendidly pure 
 that was sufficient for him what enlightenment did he need 
 cosette was a light 
 does light require enlightenment 
 he had everything what more could he desire 
 all is not that enough 
 jean personal affairs did not concern him 
 and bending over the fatal shadow of that man he clung fast convulsively to the solemn declaration of that unhappy wretch i am nothing to cosette 
 ten years ago i did not know that she was in existence 
 jean valjean was a he had said so himself well he had passed 
 whatever he was his part was finished 
 henceforth there remained marius to fulfil the part of providence to cosette 
 cosette had sought the azure in a person like herself in her lover her husband her celestial male 
 cosette as she took her flight winged and transfigured left behind her on the earth her hideous and empty chrysalis jean valjean 
 in whatever circle of ideas marius revolved he always returned to a certain horror for jean valjean 
 a sacred horror perhaps for as we have just pointed out he felt a quid divinum in that man but do what he would and seek what extenuation he would he was certainly forced to fall back upon this 
 the man was a convict that is to say a being who has not even a place in the social ladder since he is lower than the very lowest rung 
 after the very last of men comes the convict 
 the convict is no longer so to speak in the semblance of the living 
 the law has deprived him of the entire quantity of humanity of which it can deprive a man 
 marius on penal questions still held to the inexorable system though he was a democrat and he entertained all the ideas of the law on the subject of those whom the law strikes 
 he had not yet accomplished all progress we admit 
 he had not yet come to distinguish between that which is written by man and that which is written by god between law and right 
 he had not examined and weighed the right which man takes to dispose of the irrevocable and the irreparable he was not shocked by the word vindicte 
 he found it quite simple that certain breaches of the written law should be followed by eternal suffering and he accepted as the process of civilization social damnation 
 he still stood at this point though safe to advance infallibly later on since his nature was good and at bottom wholly formed of latent progress 
 in this stage of his ideas jean valjean appeared to him hideous and repulsive 
 he was a man reproved he was the convict that word was for him like the sound of the trump on the day of judgment and after having reflected upon jean valjean for a long time his final gesture had been to turn away his head vade retro 
 marius if we must recognize and even insist upon the fact while interrogating jean valjean to such a point that jean valjean had said 
 you are confessing me had not nevertheless put to him two or three decisive questions 
 it was not that they had not presented themselves to his mind but that he had been afraid of them 
 the jondrette attic the barricade 
 javert 
 who knows where these revelations would have stopped 
 jean valjean did not seem like a man who would draw back and who knows whether marius after having urged him on would not have himself desired to hold him back 
 has it not happened to all of us in certain supreme conjunctures to stop our ears in order that we may not hear the reply after we have asked a question 
 it is especially when one loves that one gives way to these exhibitions of cowardice 
 it is not wise to question sinister situations to the last point particularly when the indissoluble side of our life is fatally intermingled with them 
 what a terrible light might have proceeded from the despairing explanations of jean valjean and who knows whether that hideous glare would not have darted forth as far as cosette 
 who knows whether a sort of infernal glow would not have lingered behind it on the brow of that angel the spattering of a is of the thunder also fatality has points of juncture where innocence itself is stamped with crime by the gloomy law of the reflections which give color the purest figures may forever preserve the reflection of a horrible association 
 rightly or wrongly marius had been afraid he already knew too much 
 he sought to dull his senses rather than to gain further light 
 in dismay he bore off cosette in his arms and shut his eyes to jean valjean 
 that man was the night the living and horrible night how should he dare to seek the bottom of it 
 it is a terrible thing to interrogate the shadow 
 who knows what its reply will be the dawn may be blackened forever by it 
 in this state of mind the thought that that man would henceforth come into any contact whatever with cosette was a heartrending perplexity to marius 
 he now almost reproached himself for not having put those formidable questions before which he had recoiled and from which an implacable and definitive decision might have sprung he felt that he was too good too gentle too weak if we must say the word 
 this weakness had led him to an imprudent concession he had allowed himself to be touched 
 he had been in the wrong he ought to have simply and purely rejected jean valjean 
 jean valjean played the part of fire and that is what he should have done and have freed his house from that man 
 he was vexed with himself he was angry with that whirlwind of emotions which had deafened blinded and carried him away he was displeased with himself 
 what was he to do now 
 jean visits were profoundly repugnant to him 
 what was the use in having that man in his house 
 what did the man want 
 here he became dismayed he did not wish to dig down he did not wish to penetrate deeply he did not wish to sound himself he had promised he had allowed himself to be drawn into a promise jean valjean held his promise one must keep word even to a convict above all to a convict 
 still his first duty was to cosette in short he was carried away by the repugnance which dominated him 
 marius turned over all this confusion of ideas in his mind passing from one to the other and moved by all of them hence arose a profound trouble 
 it was not easy for him to hide this trouble from cosette but love is a talent and marius succeeded in doing it 
 however without any apparent object he questioned cosette who was as candid as a dove is white and who suspected nothing he talked of her childhood and her youth and he became more and more convinced that that convict had been everything good paternal and respectable that a man can be towards cosette all that marius had caught a glimpse of and had surmised was real that sinister nettle had loved and protected that lily

 was the happiness of marius and cosette thenceforth condemned to such a neighborhood 
 was this an accomplished fact 
 did the acceptance of that man form a part of the marriage now consummated was there nothing to be done 
 had marius wedded the convict as well 
 in vain may one be crowned with light and joy in vain may one taste the grand purple hour of life happy love such shocks would force even the archangel in his ecstasy even the demigod in his glory to shudder 
 as is always the case in changes of view of this nature marius asked himself whether he had nothing with which to reproach himself had he been wanting in divination 
 had he been wanting in prudence had he involuntarily dulled his wits 
 a little perhaps 
 had he entered upon this love affair which had ended in his marriage to cosette without taking sufficient precautions to throw light upon the surroundings 
 he is thus by a series of successive admissions of ourselves in regard to ourselves that life amends us little by admitted the chimerical and visionary side of his nature a sort of internal cloud peculiar to many organizations and which in paroxysms of passion and sorrow dilates as the temperature of the soul changes and invades the entire man to such a degree as to render him nothing more than a conscience bathed in a mist 
 we have more than once indicated this characteristic element of marius individuality 
 he recalled that in the intoxication of his love in the rue plumet during those six or seven ecstatic weeks he had not even spoke to cosette of that drama in the gorbeau hovel where the victim had taken up such a singular line of silence during the struggle and the ensuing flight 
 how had it happened that he had not mentioned this to cosette 
 yet it was so near and so terrible how had it come to pass that he had not even named the thenardiers and particularly on the day when he had encountered eponine he now found it almost difficult to explain his silence of that time nevertheless he could account for it 
 he recalled his benumbed state his intoxication with cosette love absorbing everything that catching away of each other into the ideal and perhaps also like the imperceptible quantity of reason mingled with this violent and charming state of the soul a vague dull instinct impelling him to conceal and abolish in his memory that redoubtable adventure contact with which he dreaded in which he did not wish to play any part his agency in which he had kept secret and in which he could be neither narrator nor witness without being an accuser 
 moreover these few weeks had been a flash of lightning there had been no time for anything except love 
 in short having weighed everything turned everything over in his mind examined everything whatever might have been the consequences if he had told cosette about the gorbeau ambush even if he had discovered that jean valjean was a convict would that have changed him marius would that have changed her cosette 
 would he have drawn back would he have adored her any the less 
 would he have refrained from marrying her 
 no then there was nothing to regret nothing with which he need reproach himself 
 all was well there is a deity for those drunken men who are called lovers marius blind had followed the path which he would have chosen had he been in full possession of his sight 
 love had bandaged his eyes in order to lead him whither 
 to paradise 
 but this paradise was henceforth complicated with an infernal accompaniment 
 marius ancient estrangement towards this man towards this fauchelevent who had turned into jean valjean was at present mingled with horror 
 in this horror let us state there was some pity and even a certain surprise 
 this thief this thief guilty of a second offence had restored that deposit 
 and what a deposit 
 six hundred thousand francs 
 he alone was in the secret of that deposit 
 he might have kept it all he had restored it all 
 moreover he had himself revealed his situation 
 nothing forced him to this 
 if any one learned who he was it was through himself in this avowal there was something more than acceptance of humiliation there was acceptance of peril 
 for a condemned man a mask is not a mask it is a shelter 
 a false name is security and he had rejected that false name 
 he the might have hidden himself forever in an honest family he had withstood this temptation and with what motive 
 through a conscientious scruple he himself explained this with the irresistible accents of truth in short whatever this jean valjean might be he was undoubtedly a conscience which was awakening 
 there existed some mysterious which had begun and to all appearances scruples had for a long time already controlled this man 
 such fits of justice and goodness are not characteristic of vulgar natures an awakening of conscience is grandeur of soul 
 jean valjean was sincere 
 this sincerity visible palpable irrefragable evident from the very grief that it caused him rendered inquiries useless and conferred authority on all that that man had said 
 here for marius there was a strange reversal of situations what breathed from m fauchelevent distrust 
 what did jean valjean inspire confidence 
 in the mysterious balance of this jean valjean which the pensive marius struck he admitted the active principle he admitted the passive principle and he tried to reach a balance 
 but all this went on as in a storm 
 marius while endeavoring to form a clear idea of this man and while pursuing jean valjean so to speak in the depths of his thought lost him and found him again in a fatal mist 
 the deposit honestly restored the probity of the confession these were good 
 this produced a lightening of the cloud then the cloud became black once more 
 troubled as were marius memories a shadow of them returned to him 
 after all what was that adventure in the jondrette attic why had that man taken to flight on the arrival of the police instead of entering a complaint 
 here marius found the answer 
 because that man was a fugitive from justice who had broken his ban 
 another question 
 why had that man come to the barricade 
 for marius now once more distinctly beheld that recollection which had in his emotions like sympathetic ink at the application of heat 
 this man had been in the barricade he had not fought there 
 what had he come there for 
 in the presence of this question a spectre sprang up and replied 
 javert 
 marius recalled perfectly now that funereal sight of jean valjean dragging the pinioned javert out of the barricade and he still heard behind the corner of the little rue mondetour that frightful pistol shot 
 obviously there was hatred between that police spy and the the one was in the way 
 jean valjean had gone to the barricade for the purpose of revenging himself he had arrived late 
 he probably knew that javert was a prisoner there the corsican vendetta has penetrated to certain lower strata and has become the law there it is so simple that it does not astonish souls which are but half turned towards good and those hearts are so constituted that a criminal who is in the path of repentance may be scrupulous in the matter of theft and unscrupulous in the matter of vengeance 
 jean valjean had killed javert 
 at least that seemed to be evident 
 this was the final question to be sure but to this there was no reply 
 this question marius felt like pincers 
 how had it come to pass that jean existence had elbowed that of cosette for so long a period 
 what melancholy sport of providence was that which had placed that child in contact with that man 
 are there then chains for two which are forged on high and does god take pleasure in coupling the angel with the demon 
 so a crime and an innocence can be in the mysterious galleys of wretchedness in that defiling of condemned persons which is called human destiny can two brows pass side by side the one ingenuous the other formidable the one all bathed in the divine whiteness of dawn the other forever blemished by the flash of an eternal lightning who could have arranged that inexplicable pairing off 
 in what manner in consequence of what prodigy had any community of life been established between this celestial little creature and that old criminal 
 who could have bound the lamb to the wolf and what was still more incomprehensible have attached the wolf to the lamb for the wolf loved the lamb for the fierce creature adored the feeble one for during the space of nine years the angel had had the monster as her point of support 
 childhood and girlhood her advent in the daylight her virginal growth towards life and light had been sheltered by that hideous devotion here questions exfoliated so to speak into innumerable enigmas abysses yawned at the bottoms of abysses and marius could no longer bend over jean valjean without becoming dizzy 
 what was this 
 the old symbols of genesis are eternal in human society such as it now exists and until a broader day shall effect a change in it there will always be two men the one superior the other subterranean the one which is according to good is abel the other which is according to evil is cain 
 what was this tender cain 
 what was this ruffian religiously absorbed in the adoration of a virgin watching over her rearing her guarding her dignifying her and enveloping her impure as he was himself with purity 
 what was that which had venerated that innocence to such a point as not to leave upon it a single spot 
 what was this jean valjean educating cosette 
 what was this figure of the shadows which had for its only object the preservation of the rising of a star from every shadow and from every cloud 
 that was jean secret that was also secret 
 in the presence of this double secret marius recoiled 
 the one in some sort reassured him as to the other 
 god was as visible in this affair as was jean valjean 
 god has his instruments he makes use of the tool which he wills 
 he is not responsible to men 
 do we know how god sets about the work 
 jean valjean had labored over cosette 
 he had to some extent made that soul that was incontestable 
 well what then 
 the workman was horrible but the work was admirable 
 god produces his miracles as seems good to him 
 he had constructed that charming cosette and he had employed jean valjean 
 it had pleased him to choose this strange collaborator for himself 
 what account have we to demand of him is this the first time that the has aided the spring to create the rose 
 marius made himself these replies and declared to himself that they were good 
 he had not dared to press jean valjean on all the points which we have just indicated but he did not confess to himself that he did not dare to do it 
 he adored cosette he possessed cosette cosette was splendidly pure 
 that was sufficient for him what enlightenment did he need 
 cosette was a light 
 does light require enlightenment 
 he had everything what more could he desire 
 all is not that enough 
 jean personal affairs did not concern him 
 and bending over the fatal shadow of that man he clung fast convulsively to the solemn declaration of that unhappy wretch i am nothing to cosette 
 ten years ago i did not know that she was in existence 
 jean valjean was a he had said so himself well he had passed 
 whatever he was his part was finished 
 henceforth there remained marius to fulfil the part of providence to cosette 
 cosette had sought the azure in a person like herself in her lover her husband her celestial male 
 cosette as she took her flight winged and transfigured left behind her on the earth her hideous and empty chrysalis jean valjean 
 in whatever circle of ideas marius revolved he always returned to a certain horror for jean valjean 
 a sacred horror perhaps for as we have just pointed out he felt a quid divinum in that man but do what he would and seek what extenuation he would he was certainly forced to fall back upon this 
 the man was a convict that is to say a being who has not even a place in the social ladder since he is lower than the very lowest rung 
 after the very last of men comes the convict 
 the convict is no longer so to speak in the semblance of the living 
 the law has deprived him of the entire quantity of humanity of which it can deprive a man 
 marius on penal questions still held to the inexorable system though he was a democrat and he entertained all the ideas of the law on the subject of those whom the law strikes 
 he had not yet accomplished all progress we admit 
 he had not yet come to distinguish between that which is written by man and that which is written by god between law and right 
 he had not examined and weighed the right which man takes to dispose of the irrevocable and the irreparable he was not shocked by the word vindicte 
 he found it quite simple that certain breaches of the written law should be followed by eternal suffering and he accepted as the process of civilization social damnation 
 he still stood at this point though safe to advance infallibly later on since his nature was good and at bottom wholly formed of latent progress 
 in this stage of his ideas jean valjean appeared to him hideous and repulsive 
 he was a man reproved he was the convict that word was for him like the sound of the trump on the day of judgment and after having reflected upon jean valjean for a long time his final gesture had been to turn away his head vade retro 
 marius if we must recognize and even insist upon the fact while interrogating jean valjean to such a point that jean valjean had said 
 you are confessing me had not nevertheless put to him two or three decisive questions 
 it was not that they had not presented themselves to his mind but that he had been afraid of them 
 the jondrette attic the barricade 
 javert 
 who knows where these revelations would have stopped 
 jean valjean did not seem like a man who would draw back and who knows whether marius after having urged him on would not have himself desired to hold him back 
 has it not happened to all of us in certain supreme conjunctures to stop our ears in order that we may not hear the reply after we have asked a question 
 it is especially when one loves that one gives way to these exhibitions of cowardice 
 it is not wise to question sinister situations to the last point particularly when the indissoluble side of our life is fatally intermingled with them 
 what a terrible light might have proceeded from the despairing explanations of jean valjean and who knows whether that hideous glare would not have darted forth as far as cosette 
 who knows whether a sort of infernal glow would not have lingered behind it on the brow of that angel the spattering of a is of the thunder also fatality has points of juncture where innocence itself is stamped with crime by the gloomy law of the reflections which give color the purest figures may forever preserve the reflection of a horrible association 
 rightly or wrongly marius had been afraid he already knew too much 
 he sought to dull his senses rather than to gain further light 
 in dismay he bore off cosette in his arms and shut his eyes to jean valjean 
 that man was the night the living and horrible night how should he dare to seek the bottom of it 
 it is a terrible thing to interrogate the shadow 
 who knows what its reply will be the dawn may be blackened forever by it 
 in this state of mind the thought that that man would henceforth come into any contact whatever with cosette was a heartrending perplexity to marius 
 he now almost reproached himself for not having put those formidable questions before which he had recoiled and from which an implacable and definitive decision might have sprung he felt that he was too good too gentle too weak if we must say the word 
 this weakness had led him to an imprudent concession he had allowed himself to be touched 
 he had been in the wrong he ought to have simply and purely rejected jean valjean 
 jean valjean played the part of fire and that is what he should have done and have freed his house from that man 
 he was vexed with himself he was angry with that whirlwind of emotions which had deafened blinded and carried him away he was displeased with himself 
 what was he to do now 
 jean visits were profoundly repugnant to him 
 what was the use in having that man in his house 
 what did the man want 
 here he became dismayed he did not wish to dig down he did not wish to penetrate deeply he did not wish to sound himself he had promised he had allowed himself to be drawn into a promise jean valjean held his promise one must keep word even to a convict above all to a convict 
 still his first duty was to cosette in short he was carried away by the repugnance which dominated him 
 marius turned over all this confusion of ideas in his mind passing from one to the other and moved by all of them hence arose a profound trouble 
 it was not easy for him to hide this trouble from cosette but love is a talent and marius succeeded in doing it 
 however without any apparent object he questioned cosette who was as candid as a dove is white and who suspected nothing he talked of her childhood and her youth and he became more and more convinced that that convict had been everything good paternal and respectable that a man can be towards cosette all that marius had caught a glimpse of and had surmised was real that sinister nettle had loved and protected that lily

 only the expression of the will of the deity not dependent on time can relate to a whole series of events occurring over a period of years or centuries and only the deity independent of everything can by his sole will determine the direction of movement but man acts in time and himself takes part in what occurs 
 reinstating the first condition omitted that of time we see that no command can be executed without some preceding order having been given rendering the execution of the last command possible 
 no command ever appears spontaneously or itself covers a whole series of occurrences but each command follows from another and never refers to a whole series of events but always to one moment only of an event 
 when for instance we say that napoleon ordered armies to go to war we combine in one simultaneous expression a whole series of consecutive commands dependent one on another napoleon could not have commanded an invasion of russia and never did so today he ordered such and such papers to be written to vienna to berlin and to petersburg tomorrow such and such decrees and orders to the army the fleet the commissariat and so on and so on millions of commands which formed a whole series corresponding to a series of events which brought the french armies into russia 
 if throughout his reign napoleon gave commands concerning an invasion of england and expended on no other undertaking so much time and effort and yet during his whole reign never once attempted to execute that design but undertook an expedition into russia with which country he considered it desirable to be in alliance a conviction he repeatedly expressed this came about because his commands did not correspond to the course of events in the first case but did so correspond in the latter 
 for an order to be certainly executed it is necessary that a man should order what can be executed but to know what can and what cannot be executed is impossible not only in the case of invasion of russia in which millions participated but even in the simplest event for in either case millions of obstacles may arise to prevent its execution every order executed is always one of an immense number unexecuted all the impossible orders inconsistent with the course of events remain unexecuted only the possible ones get linked up with a consecutive series of commands corresponding to a series of events and are executed 
 our false conception that an event is caused by a command which precedes it is due to the fact that when the event has taken place and out of thousands of others those few commands which were consistent with that event have been executed we forget about the others that were not executed because they could not be apart from that the chief source of our error in this matter is due to the fact that in the historical accounts a whole series of innumerable diverse and petty events such for instance as all those which led the french armies to russia is generalized into one event in accord with the result produced by that series of events and corresponding with this generalization the whole series of commands is also generalized into a single expression of will 
 we say that napoleon wished to invade russia and invaded it in reality in all activity we never find anything resembling an expression of that wish but find a series of orders or expressions of his will very variously and indefinitely directed amid a long series of unexecuted orders of one series for the campaign of was carried out not because those orders differed in any way from the other unexecuted orders but because they coincided with the course of events that led the french army into russia just as in stencil work this or that figure comes out not because the color was laid on from this side or in that way but because it was laid on from all sides over the figure cut in the stencil 
 so that examining the relation in time of the commands to the events we find that a command can never be the cause of the event but that a certain definite dependence exists between the two 
 to understand in what this dependence consists it is necessary to reinstate another omitted condition of every command proceeding not from the deity but from a man which is that the man who gives the command himself takes part in 
 this relation of the commander to those he commands is just what is called power this relation consists in the following 
 for common action people always unite in certain combinations in which regardless of the difference of the aims set for the common action the relation between those taking part in it is always the same 
 men uniting in these combinations always assume such relations toward one another that the larger number take a more direct share and the smaller number a less direct share in the collective action for which they have combined 
 of all the combinations in which men unite for collective action one of the most striking and definite examples is an army 
 every army is composed of lower grades of the service the rank and file of whom there are always the greatest number of the next higher military rank corporals and noncommissioned officers of whom there are fewer and of officers of whom there are still fewer and so on to the highest military command which is concentrated in one person 
 a military organization may be quite correctly compared to a cone of which the base with the largest diameter consists of the rank and file the next higher and smaller section of the cone consists of the next higher grades of the army and so on to the apex the point of which will represent the commander in chief 
 the soldiers of whom there are the most form the lower section of the cone and its base the soldier himself does the stabbing hacking burning and pillaging and always receives orders for these actions from men above him he himself never gives an order the noncommissioned officers of whom there are fewer perform the action itself less frequently than the soldiers but they already give commands an officer still less often acts directly himself but commands still more frequently a general does nothing but command the troops indicates the objective and hardly ever uses a weapon himself the commander in chief never takes direct part in the action itself but only gives general orders concerning the movement of the mass of the troops a similar relation of people to one another is seen in every combination of men for common activity in agriculture trade and every administration 
 and so without particularly analyzing all the contiguous sections of a cone and of the ranks of an army or the ranks and positions in any administrative or public business whatever from the lowest to the highest we see a law by which men to take associated action combine in such relations that the more directly they participate in performing the action the less they can command and the more numerous they are while the less their direct participation in the action itself the more they command and the fewer of them there are rising in this way from the lowest ranks to the man at the top who takes the least direct share in the action and directs his activity chiefly to commanding 
 this relation of the men who command to those they command is what constitutes the essence of the conception called power 
 having restored the condition of time under which all events occur find that a command is executed only when it is related to a corresponding series of events restoring the essential condition of relation between those who command and those who execute we find that by the very nature of the case those who command take the smallest part in the action itself and that their activity is exclusively directed to commanding

 of prophecies 
 i mean not to speak of divine prophecies nor of heathen oracles nor of natural 
 predictions but only of prophecies that have been of certain memory and from hidden causes saith the pythonissa to saul tomorrow thou and thy son shall be with me homer hath these verses at domus aeneae cunctis dominabitur oris et nati natorum et qui nascentur ab illis a prophecy as it seems of the roman empire seneca the tragedian hath these verses venient annis secula seris quibus oceanus vincula rerum laxet et ingens pateat tellus tiphysque novos detegat orbes nec sit terris ultima thule a prophecy of the discovery of america the daughter of polycrates dreamed that jupiter bathed her father and apollo anointed him and it came to pass that he was crucified in an open place where the sun made his body run with sweat and the rain washed it philip of macedon dreamed he sealed up his belly whereby he did expound it that his wife should be barren but aristander the soothsayer told him his wife was with child because men do not use to seal vessels that are empty 
 a phantasm that appeared to m brutus in his tent said to him philippis iterum me 
 videbis tiberius said to galba tu quoque galba degustabis imperium in 
 time there went a prophecy in the east that those that should come forth of judea should reign over the world which though it may be was meant of our saviour yet tacitus expounds it of vespasian domidan dreamed the night before he was slain that a golden head was growing out of the nape of his neck and indeed the succession that followed him for many years made golden times henry the sixth of england said of henry the seventh when he was a lad and gave him water 
 this is the lad that shall enjoy the crown for which we strive when i was in france i heard from one dr pena that the queen mother who was given to curious arts caused the king her nativity to be calculated under a false name and the astrologer gave a judgement that he should be killed in a duel at which the queen laughed thinking her husband to be above challenges and duels but he was slain upon a course at tilt the splinters of the staff of mongomery going in at his beaver the trivial prophecy which i heard when i was a child and queen elizabeth was in the flower of her years was when hempe is spun done whereby it was generally conceived that after the princes had reigned which had the principal letters of that word hempe which were henry edward mary philip and elizabeth england should come to utter confusion which thanks be to god is verified only in the change of the name for that the style is now no more of england but of britain there was also another prophecy before the year of which i do not well understand 
 
 there shall be seen upon a day between the baugh and the may the black fleet of norway when that that is come and gone england build houses of lime and stone for after wars shall you have none 
 
 it was generally conceived to be meant of the spanish fleet that came in for 
 that the king of surname as they say is norway the prediction of 
 regiomontanus octogesimus octavus marabilis annus was thought likewise accomplished in the sending of that great fleet being the greatest in strength though not in number of all that ever swam upon the sea 
 as for dream i think it was a jest it was that he was devoured of a long dragon and it was expounded of a maker of sausages that troubled him exceedingly there are numbers of the like kind especially if you include dreams and predictions of astrology but i have set down these few only of certain credit for example my judgement is that they ought all to be despised and ought to serve but for winter talk by the fireside though when i say despised i mean it as for belief for otherwise the spreading or publishing of them is in no sort to be despised for they have done much mischief and i see many severe laws made to suppress them 
 that that hath given them grace and some credit consisteth in three things first that men mark when they hit and never mark when they miss as they do generally also of dreams the second is that probable conjectures or obscure traditions many times turn themselves into prophecies while the nature of man which coveteth divination thinks it no peril to foretell that which indeed they do but collect as that of verse for so much was then subject to demonstration that the globe of the earth had great parts beyond the atlantic which mought be probably conceived not to be all sea and adding thereto the tradition in timaeus and his atlanticus it mought encourage one to turn it to a prediction the third and last which is the great one is that almost all of them being infinite in number have been impostures and by idle and crafty brains merely contrived and feigned after the event past

 videbis tiberius said to galba tu quoque galba degustabis imperium in 
 time there went a prophecy in the east that those that should come forth of judea should reign over the world which though it may be was meant of our saviour yet tacitus expounds it of vespasian domidan dreamed the night before he was slain that a golden head was growing out of the nape of his neck and indeed the succession that followed him for many years made golden times henry the sixth of england said of henry the seventh when he was a lad and gave him water 
 this is the lad that shall enjoy the crown for which we strive when i was in france i heard from one dr pena that the queen mother who was given to curious arts caused the king her nativity to be calculated under a false name and the astrologer gave a judgement that he should be killed in a duel at which the queen laughed thinking her husband to be above challenges and duels but he was slain upon a course at tilt the splinters of the staff of mongomery going in at his beaver the trivial prophecy which i heard when i was a child and queen elizabeth was in the flower of her years was when hempe is spun done whereby it was generally conceived that after the princes had reigned which had the principal letters of that word hempe which were henry edward mary philip and elizabeth england should come to utter confusion which thanks be to god is verified only in the change of the name for that the style is now no more of england but of britain there was also another prophecy before the year of which i do not well understand 
 
 there shall be seen upon a day between the baugh and the may the black fleet of norway when that that is come and gone england build houses of lime and stone for after wars shall you have none 
 
 it was generally conceived to be meant of the spanish fleet that came in for 
 that the king of surname as they say is norway the prediction of 
 regiomontanus octogesimus octavus marabilis annus was thought likewise accomplished in the sending of that great fleet being the greatest in strength though not in number of all that ever swam upon the sea 
 as for dream i think it was a jest it was that he was devoured of a long dragon and it was expounded of a maker of sausages that troubled him exceedingly there are numbers of the like kind especially if you include dreams and predictions of astrology but i have set down these few only of certain credit for example my judgement is that they ought all to be despised and ought to serve but for winter talk by the fireside though when i say despised i mean it as for belief for otherwise the spreading or publishing of them is in no sort to be despised for they have done much mischief and i see many severe laws made to suppress them 
 that that hath given them grace and some credit consisteth in three things first that men mark when they hit and never mark when they miss as they do generally also of dreams the second is that probable conjectures or obscure traditions many times turn themselves into prophecies while the nature of man which coveteth divination thinks it no peril to foretell that which indeed they do but collect as that of verse for so much was then subject to demonstration that the globe of the earth had great parts beyond the atlantic which mought be probably conceived not to be all sea and adding thereto the tradition in timaeus and his atlanticus it mought encourage one to turn it to a prediction the third and last which is the great one is that almost all of them being infinite in number have been impostures and by idle and crafty brains merely contrived and feigned after the event past

 return of the jedi 
 vi 
 
 the starry sky seemed very near the treetops to luke as he and his friends werecarried into the ewok village he even aware it was a village at orange sparks of light in the distance he thought initially to be stars this wasparticularly true on his back strapped to the pole as he bright points flickered directly above him between the trees 
 but then he found himself being hoisted up intricate stairways and hidden rampsaround the immense trunks and gradually the higher they went the bigger andcracklier the lights became when the group was hundreds of feet up in the finally realized the lights were the treetops 
 they were finally taken out onto a rickety wooden walkway far too far off theground to be able to see anything below them but the abysmal drop for one bleakmoment luke was afraid they were simply going to be pitched over the brink to testtheir knowledge of forest lore but the ewoks had something else in mind 
 the narrow platform ended midway between two trees the first creature inline grabbed hold of a long vine and swung across to the far luke couldsee by twisting his head around had a large cavelike opening carved into its titanicsurface vines were quickly tossed back and forth across the chasm until soon akind of lattice was luke found himself being pulled across it on hisback still tied to the wooden poles he looked down once into nothingness itwas an unwelcome sensation 
 on the other side they rested on a shaky narrow platform until everyone wasacross then the diminutive dismantled the webbing of vines andproceeded into the tree with their captives it was totally black inside but luke hadthe impression it was more of a tunnel through the wood than an actual cavern theimpression of dense solid walls was everywhere like a burrow in a they emerged fifty yards beyond they were in the village square 
 it was a series of wooden platforms planks and walkways connecting anextensive cluster of enormous trees supported by this scaffolding was a village ofhuts constructed of an odd combination of stiffened leather daub and wattle thatchedroofs mud floors small campfires burned before many of the sparkswere caught by an elaborate system of hanging vines which funneled them to asmothering point and everywhere were hundreds of ewoks 
 cooks tanners guards grandfathers mother ewoks gathered up squealingbabies at the sight of the prisoners and scurried into their huts or pointed or smoke filled the air children played games minstrels played strange resonantmusic on hollow logs windy reeds 
 there was vast blackness below vaster still above but here in this tiny villagesuspended between the two luke felt warmth and light and special peace 
 the entourage of captors and captives stopped before the largest hut and artoo were leaned on their poles against a nearby tree han was tiedto a spit and balanced above a pile of kindling that looked suspiciously like abarbecue pit dozens of ewoks gathered around chattering curiously in animatedsqueals 
 teebo emerged from the large structure he was slightly bigger than most ofthe others and undeniably fiercer his fur was a pattern of light and dark graystripes instead of the usual leathery hood he wore a horned animal atophis head which further adorned with feathers he carried a stone hatchet andeven for someone as small as an ewok he walked with a definite swagger 
 he examined the group cursorily then seemed to make some kind ofpronouncement at that a member of the hunting party stepped mantled ewok who seemed to have taken a more protective view toward theprisoners 
 teebo conferred with paploo for a short time the discussion soon turned intoa heated disagreement however with paploo apparently taking the rebels side andteebo seemingly dismissing whatever considerations arose the rest of the tribestood around watching the debate with great interest occasionally shouting commentsor squeaking excitedly 
 threepio whose had been set down in a place of honor near thestake to which solo was tied followed the ongoing argument with rapt began to translate once or twice for luke and the stopped after only afew words since the debaters were talking so fast he want to lose the gist ofwhat was being said consequently he transmit any more information thanthe names of the ewoks involved 
 han looked over at luke with a dubious frown i like the looks of this 
 chewie growled his wholehearted agreement 
 suddenly logray exited from the large hut silencing everyone with his than teebo he was nonetheless clearly the object of greater general too wore a on his kind of great bird skull a single feathertied to its crest his fur was striped tan though and his face wise he carried noweapon only a pouch at his side and a staff topped by the spine of a 
 one by one he carefully appraised the captives smelling han testing the fabricof clothing between his fingers teebo and paploo babbled their opposingpoints of view at him but he seemed supremely uninterested so they soon stopped 
 when logray came to chewbacca he became fascinated and poked at thewookiee with his staff of growled dangerously at the tiny logray neededno further coaching and did a quick the same time reaching into hispouch and sprinkling some herbs in direction 
 careful chewie han cautioned from across the square he must be thehead honcho 
 no threepio corrected actually i believe their medicine man 
 luke was about to intervene then decided to wait it would be better if thisserious little community came to its own conclusions about them in its own ewoks seemed curiously grounded for a people so airborne 
 logray wandered over to examine a most wondrous creature hesniffed tapped and stroke the metal shell then scrunched up his face in a lookof consternation after a few moments of thought he ordered the small robot cutdown 
 the crowd murmured excitedly and backed off a few feet vine binderswere slashed by two guards causing the droid to slide down his poleand crash unceremoniously to the ground 
 the guards set him upright artoo was instantly furious he zeroed in onteebo as the source of his ignominy and beeping a blue streak began to chase theterrified ewok in circles the crowd cheering on teebo somesqueaking encouragement to the deranged droid 
 finally artoo got close enough to teebo to zing him with an electric shocked ewok jumped into the air squealed raucously and ran away as fast ashis stubby little legs could carry him wicket slipped surreptitiously into the big the onlookers screeched their indignation or delight 
 threepio was incensed artoo stop that only going to make mattersworse 
 artoo scooted over directly in front of the golden droid and began beeping avehement tirade wreee op doo rhee vrrr gk gdk dk whoo dop dhop vree doodweet 
 this outburst miffed threepio substantially with a haughty tilt he sat upstraight in his throne no way to speak to someone in my position 
 luke was afraid the situation was well on its way to getting out of control hecalled with the barest hint of impatience to his faithful droid threepio i think you spoke on our behalf 
 ungraciously to the assemblage of fuzzycreatures and made a short speech pointing from time to time to his friends tied to thestakes 
 logray became visibly upset by this he waved his staff stamped his at the golden droid for a full minute at the conclusion of his statement henodded to several attentive fellows who nodded back and began filling the pit underhan with firewood 
 well what did he say han shouted with some concern 
 threepio wilted with chagrin rather embarrassed captain solo but itappears you are to be the main course at a banquet in my honor he is quiteoffended that i should suggest otherwise 
 before another word could be said began beating in ominoussyncopation as one all the furry heads turned toward the mouth of the large of it came wicket and behind him chief chirpa 
 chirpa was gray of fur strong of will on his head he bore a garland woven ofleaves teeth and the horns of great animals bested in the hunt in his righthand he carried a staff fashioned from the longbone of a flying reptile in his left heheld an iguana who was his pet and advisor 
 he surveyed the scene in the square at a glance then turned to wait for the guestwho was only now emerging from the large hut behind him 
 the guest was the beautiful young princess of alderaan 
 leia luke and han shouted together 
 rahrhah 
 boo deedwee 
 your highness 
 with a gasp she rushed toward her friends but a phalanx of ewoks blocked herway with spears she turned to chief chirpa then to her robot interpreter 
 threepio tell them these are my friends they must be set free 
 threepio looked at chirpa and logray eep sqee rheeow he said with muchcivility sqeeow roah meep meeb eerah 
 chirpa and logray shook their heads with a motion that was unequivocablynegative logray chattered an order at his helpers who resumed vigorously pilingwood under solo 
 han exchanged helpless looks with leia somehow i have a feeling do us much good 
 luke what can we do leia urged she expected this at all a guide back to her ship or at worst a short supper and lodging for the definitely understand these creatures luke she questioned 
 han was about to offer a suggestion when he paused briefly taken aback sudden intense faith in luke it was something he really noted merely noted it now 
 before he could speak up with his plan though luke chimed in them if they do as you wish become angry and use your magic 
 but master luke what magic the droid protested i 
 tell them luke ordered uncharacteristically raising his voice there weretimes when threepio could test even the patience of a jedi 
 the turned to the large audience and spoke with great screesh oahr aish sh sheestee meep eep eep 
 the ewoks seemed greatly disturbed by this proclamation they all backed upseveral steps except for logray who took two steps forward he shouted somethingat that sounded very in the nature of challenge 
 luke closed his eyes with absolute concentration threepio began rattling on ina terribly unsettled manner as if been caught falsifying his own believe me master luke just as i told you 
 luke listening to the droid though he was visualizing him seeing himsitting shiny and golden on his throne of twigs nodding this way and that prattling onabout the most inconsequential of matters sitting there in the black void of slowly beginning to rise 
 slowly threepio began to rise 
 at first he notice at first nobody did threepio just went right ontalking as his entire litter steadily elevated off the ground told you i told you itold you they i know why a here 
 threepio and the ewoks all realized what was happening at just about the samemoment the ewoks silently fell back in terror from the floating throne threepionow began to spin as if he were on a revolving stool graceful majestic spinning 
 help he whispered artoo help me 
 chief chirpa shouted orders to his cowering minions quickly they ran forwardand released the bound prisoners leia han and luke enfolded each other in a embrace it seemed to all of them a strange setting in which to gain thefirst victory of this campaign against the empire 
 luke was aware of a plaintive beeping behind him and turned to see artoostaring up at a threepio luke lowered the golden droid slowly to theground 
 thanks threepio the young jedi patted him gratefully on the shoulder 
 threepio still a bit shaken stood with a wobbly amazed know i had it in me 
 the hut of chief chirpa was large by ewok nearly scraped the ceiling with his head the wookiee hunchedalong one side of the dwelling with his rebel comrades while the chief and tenelders sat on the other side facing them in the center between the two groups asmall fire warmed the night air casting ephemeral shadows on the earthen walls 
 outside the entire village awaited the decisions this council would arrive at itwas a pensive clear night charged with high moment though it was quite late notan ewok slept 
 inside threepio was speaking positive and negative feedback loops hadalready substantially increased his fluency in this squeaky language he was now inthe midst of an animated history of the galactic civil with explosive sound effects and editorial commentary he even mimicked animperial walker at one point 
 the ewok elders listened carefully occasionally murmuring comments to eachother it was a fascinating story and they were thoroughly at times outraged logray conferred with chief chirpa once or twice andseveral times asked threepio questions to which the golden droid responded artoo even whistled probably for emphasis 
 in the end though after a rather brief discussion among the elders the chiefshook his head negatively with an expression of rueful dissatisfaction he spokefinally to threepio and threepio interpreted for his friends 
 chief chirpa says a very moving story the droid explained but it reallyhas nothing to do with ewoks 
 a deep and pressing silence filled the small chamber only the fire softlycrackled its bright but darkling soliloquy 
 it was finally all opened his mouth to speak for the the alliance 
 tell them this goldenrod he smiled at the droid with conscious affectionfor the first time tell them hard to translate a rebellion so maybe a tell the story so tell em 
 they help us cause asking em to they even helpus cause in their own interest though it is you for oneexample the tappin a lot of energy out of this moon to generate its deflectorshield and a lot of energy you guys are gonna be without come winter and imean gonna be never mind that tell em threepio 
 threepio told them han went on 
 but not why they should help us why i used to do stuff becauseit was in my interest but not anymore well not so much anyway mostly i dothings for my friends what else is so important money had that and you know what happened to him okay okay the point areyour friends you know 
 this was one of the most inarticulate pleas leia had ever heard but it made hereyes fill with tears the ewoks on the other hand remained silent and the stoic little fellow named paploo traded a few muttered words the restwere motionless their expressions unreadable 
 after another protracted pause luke cleared his throat i realize this conceptmay be be difficult to draw these connections he started slowly terribly important for the entire galaxy for our rebel force to destroy the imperialpresence here on endor look up there through the smoke hole in the roof justthrough that tiny hole you can count a hundred stars in the whole sky there aremillions and billions more you even see and they all have planets andmoons and happy people just like you and the empire is destroying all that youcanyou could get dizzy just lying on your back and staring up at all the could almostexplode so beautiful sometimes and part of thebeauty all part of the same force and the empire is trying to turn out thelights 
 it took a while for threepio to finish translating wanted to get all thewords just right when he did eventually stop talking there was an extensivesqueaking among the elders rising and falling in volume ceasing and then resumingagain 
 leia knew what luke was trying to say but she feared greatly that the see the connection it was connected intimately though if she could onlybridge the gap for them she thought of her experience in the forest of oneness with the trees whose outstretched limbs seemed to touch the verystars the stars whose light filtered down like cascading magic she felt the powerof the magic within her and it resonated around the hut from being to being flowingthrough her again making her stronger still until she felt one with these as if she understood them knew them conspired with them in theprimary sense of the word they breathed together 
 the debate wound down leaving finally another quiet moment in the respirations quieted too in resonance and with an air of confident made her appeal to the council 
 do it because of the trees she said 
 all she said everyone expected more but there was no more only thisshort oblique outburst 
 wicket had been observing these proceedings with increasing concern from thesidelines on several occasions it was apparent he was restraining himself with greatdifficulty from entering the now he jumped to his feet pacedthe width of the hut several times finally faced the elders and began his ownimpassioned speech 
 eep eep meep eek squee 
 threepio translated for his friends honorable elders we have this nightreceived a perilous wondrous gift the gift of freedom this threepio paused in his translation just long enough to savor themoment then went golden god whose return to us has been prophesiedsince the first tree tells us now he will not be our master tells us we are free tochoose as we we must choose as all living things must choose their owndestiny he has come honorable elders and he will go no longer may we be slavesto his diving guidance we are free 
 yet how must we comport ourselves is an love of the wood any lessbecause he can leave it love is more because he can leave it yet he is it with the voice of the golden one we can close our eyes yet we listen 
 his friends tell us of a force a great living spirit of which we are all part evenas the leaves are things separate yet part of the tree we know this spirit honorableelders though we call it not the force the friends of the golden one tell us thisforce is in great jeopardy here and everywhere when the fire reaches the is safe not even the great tree of which all things are part nor its leaves norits roots not its birds all are in peril forever and ever 
 it is a brave thing to confront such a fire honorable elders many will the forest lives on 
 but the ewoks are brave 
 the little fixed his gaze on the others in the hut not a word wasspoken nonetheless the communication was intense after a minute like this heconcluded his statement 
 honorable elders we must aid this noble party not less for the trees but morefor the sake of the leaves on the trees these rebels are like the ewoks who are likethe leaves battered by the wind eaten without thought by the tumult of locusts thatinhabit the do we throw ourselves on smoldering fires that another mayknow the warmth of light yet do we make a soft bed of ourselves that another mayknow rest yet do we swirl in the wind that assails us to send the fear of chaos into thehearts of our enemies yet do we change color even as the season calls upon us tochange so must we help our leafbrothers these so has come a seasonof change upon us 
 he stood still before them the small fire dancing in his eye for a timelessmoment all the world seemed still 
 the elders were moved without saying another word they nodded inagreement perhaps they were telepathic 
 in any case chief chirpa stood and without preface made a briefpronouncement 
 all at once drums began to beat throughout the entire village the eldersjumped longer at all so ran across the tent to hug the even began to hug artoo but thought better of it as the little droid backed offwith a low warning whistle teebo scurried over to hop playfully on the instead 
 han smiled uncertainly going on 
 not sure leia answered out the side of her mouth but it look toobad 
 luke like the others was sharing the joyous it pleasant smile and diffuse good will when suddenly a dark cloud filled her there nestled a clammy chill into the corners of his soul he wiped itstraces from his visage made his face a mask nobody noticed 
 threepio finally nodded his understanding to wicket who was explaining thesituation to him he turned with an expansive gesture to the rebels we are nowpart of the tribe 
 just what always wanted said solo 
 threepio continued talking to the others trying to ignore the sarcastic starcaptain the chief has vowed to help us in any way to rid their land of the evilones 
 well short help is better than no help i always say solo chuckled 
 threepio was once again rapidly overheating his circuits toward the corellianingrate teebo says his chief scouts wicket and paploo will show us the fastestway to the shield generator 
 tell him thanks goldenrod he just loved irking threepio he himself 
 chewie let out a righteous bark happy to be on the move again one of theewoks thought he was asking for food though and brought the wookiee a large slabof meat chewbacca refuse he downed the meat in a single gulp as severalewoks gathered watching in amazement they were so incredulous at this feat infact they began giggling furiously and the laughter was so infectious it started thewookiee chortling his gruff guffaws were really hilarious to the chuckling was their jumped on him in a frenzy of tickling which hereturned threefold until they all lay in a puddle quite exhausted chewie wiped hiseyes and grabbed another piece of meat which he gnawed at a more leisurely pace 
 solo meanwhile began organizing the expedition how far is it needsome fresh supplies not much time you know give me some of 
 chewie snarled 
 luke drifted to the back of the hut and then slipped outside during thecommotion out in the square a great party was going luke avoided this too he wandered away from the bonfires awayfrom the gaiety to a secluded walkway on the dark side of a colossal tree 
 leia followed him 
 the sounds of the forest filled the soft night air here crickets skitteringrodents desolate breezes anguished owls the perfumes were a mixture jasmine and pine the harmonies were strictly ethereal the sky wascrystal black 
 luke stared at the brightest star in the heavens it looked to be fired from deepwithin its core by raging elemental vapors it was the death star 
 he take his eyes from it leia found him like that 
 wrong she whispered 
 he smiled wearily everything afraid or nothing maybe maybethings are finally going to be as they were meant to be 
 he felt the presence of darth vader very near 
 leia took his hand she felt so close to luke yetshe say how heseemed so lost now so alone so distant she almost felt his hand in is it luke 
 he looked down at their intertwined fingers leiado you remember yourmother your real mother 
 the question took her totally by surprise always felt so close to heradopted parents it was as if they were her real parents she almost never thought ofher real was like a dream 
 yet now question made her start flashes from her infancy visions of runninga beautiful womanhiding in a trunk thefragments suddenly threatened to flood her with emotion 
 yes she said pausing to regain her composure just a little bit she diedwhen i was very young 
 what do you remember he pressed tell me 
 just feelings reallyimages she wanted to let it slide it was so out of theblue so far from her immediate concernsbut somehow so loud inside all of asudden 
 tell me luke repeated 
 she felt surprised by his insistence but decided to follow him with it at least forthe time being she trusted him even when he frightened her she was verybeautiful leia remembered aloud gentle and sad she lookeddeeply into his eyes seeking his intentions why are you asking me this 
 he turned away peering back up at the death star as if been on the vergeof opening up then something scared him and he pulled it all in once more i haveno memory of my mother he claimed i never knew her 
 luke tell me troubling you she wanted to help she knew she couldhelp 
 he stared at her a long moment estimating her abilities gauging her need toknow her desire to know she was strong he felt it unwaveringly he coulddepend on her they all could vader is herenow on this moon 
 she felt a chill like a physical sensation as if her blood had actually do you know 
 i can feel his presence come for me 
 but how could he know we were here was it the code did we leave out somepassword she knew it was none of these things 
 no me he can feel it when near he held her by the wanted to tell her everything but now as he tried his will was starting to must leave you leia as long as here i endanger the whole group and ourmission here his hands trembled i have to face vader 
 leia was fast becoming distraught confused intimations were rushing at herlike wild owls out of the night their wings brushing her cheek their talons catchingher hail their harsh whispers thrilling her ear who who who 
 she shook her head hard i understand luke what do you mean youhave to face vader 
 he pulled her to him his manner suddenly gentle abidingly calm to say to say it in some basic way released him my father leia 
 your father she believe it yet of course it was true 
 he held her steady to be a rock for her leia found something else not going to be easy for you to hear it but you have to you have to knownbefore i leave here because i might not be back and if i make it theonly hope for the alliance 
 she looked away she shook her head she look at him it was terriblydisturbing what luke was saying though she imagine why it wasnonsense of course that was why to call her the only hope for the alliance if heshould it was absurd absurd to think of luke dying and to think of herbeing the only hope both thoughts were out of the question she moved away from him to deny hiswords at least to give them distance to let her breathe flashes of her mother cameagain in this breathing space parting embraces flesh torn from flesh 
 talk that way luke you have to survive i do what i of no importance without youi can do nothing you seen it you have a power i understandand could never have 
 wrong leia he held her at length you have that power force is strong in you in time learn to use it as i have 
 she shook her head she hear this he was lying she had nopower the power was elsewhere she could only help and succor and support whatwas he saying was it possible 
 he brought her closer still held her face in his hands 
 he looked so tender now so giving was he giving her the power could shetruly hold it what was he saying luke come over you 
 leia the force is strong in my family my father has it i have it and mysister has it 
 leia stared full into his eyes again darkness whirled there and she saw frightened herbut now this time she draw away she stoodclose to him she started to understand 
 yes he whispered seeing her comprehension yes you leia heheld her in his arms 
 leia closed her eyes tightly against his words against her tears to no all washed over her now and through her i know she nodded openly shewept 
 then you know i must go to him 
 she stood back her face hot her mind swimming in a storm no luke away far away if he can feel your presence go away from this place sheheld his hands put her cheek on his chest i wish i could go with you 
 he stroked the back of her head no you never han and i and the others have doubted always been strong turned away from your responsibility i say the same he thought ofhis premature flight from dagobah racing to risk everything before his training hadbeen complete almost destroying everything because of it he looked down at theblack mechanical hand he had to show for it how much more would be lost to hisweakness well he choked now both going to fulfill our destinies 
 luke why why must you confront him 
 he thought of all the win to lose to join to struggle to kill to walk away to accuse to ask why to forgive to not forgive to knew inthe end there was only one reason now and always only one reason that couldever matter good in him felt it he give me over to theemperor i can save him i can turn him back to the good side his eyes becamewild for just a moment turn by doubts and passions i have to try leia ourfather 
 they held each other close tears streamed silently down her face 
 goodbye dear and found goodbye sweet sweet leia 
 she cried openly both luke held her away and movedslowly back along the planking he disappeared into the darkness of the led out of the village 
 leia watched him go quietly weeping she gave free vent to her feelings didnot try to stop the instead to feel them to feel the source they came path they took the murky corners they cleansed 
 memories poured through her now clues suspicions mutteringswhen thought she was asleep luke her brother and vader her was too much to assimilate all at once it was information overload 
 she was crying and trembling and whimpering all at once when suddenly hanstepped up and embraced her from behind gone looking for her and heard hervoice and came around just in time to see luke only now when leiajumped at his touch and he turned her around did he realize she was sobbing 
 his quizzical smile turned to concern tempered by the of the hey going on here 
 she stifled her sobs wiped her eyes nothing han i just want to bealone for a while 
 she was hiding something that much was plain and that much was not nothing he said angrily i want to know going on now you tellme what it is he shook her never felt like this before he wanted toknow but he want to know what he thought he knew it made him sick atheart to think of leiawith lukehe even bring himself to imagine what itwas he want to imagine 
 never been out of control like this he like it he stop it herealized he was still shaking her and stopped 
 i han her lip began to tremble again 
 you you tell me i thought we were closer than that but i guessi was wrong maybe rather tell luke sometimes i 
 oh han she cried and burst into tears once more she buried herself in hisembrace 
 his anger turned slowly to confusion and dismay as he found himself wrappinghis arms around her caressing her shoulders comforting her sorry hewhispered into her hair sorry he understand not an her or himself or his feelings or women or the he knew was that just been furious and now he was affectionate made no sense 
 pleasejust hold me she whispered she want to talk she justwanted to be held 
 he just held her 
 morning mist rose off dewy vegetation as the sun broke the horizon over lush foliage of the edge had a moist green odor in that dawning momentthe world was silent as if holding its breath 
 in violent contrast the imperial landing platform squatted over the metallic octagonal it seemed to cut like an insult into the verdant beauty ofthe place the bushes at its perimeter were singed black from repeated shuttlelandings the flora beyond that was from refuse disposal tramplingfeet chemical exhaust fumes like a blight was this outpost 
 uniformed troops walked continuously on the platform and in the surveilling guarding imperial walkers were parked off to armored war machines big enough for a squad of soldiersto stand inside firing laser cannon in all directions an imperial shuttle took off forthe death star with a roar that made the trees cringe another walker emerged fromthe timber on the far side of the platform returning from a patrol mission step bylumbering step it approached the loading dock 
 darth vader stood at the rail of the lower deck staring mutely into the depths ofthe lovely forest soon it was coming soon he could feel it like a drum gettinglouder his destiny approached dread was all around but fear like this excited he let it bubble quietly within dread was a tonic it heightened his senses honeda raw edge to his passions closer it came 
 victory too he sensed mastery but laced with something elsewhat was see it quite always in motion the future difficult to see itsapparitions tantalized him swirling specters always changing smoky was hisfuture thunderous with conquest and destruction 
 very close now almost here 
 he purred in the pit of his throat like a wild cat smelling game on the air 
 almost here 
 the imperial walker docked at the opposite end of the deck and opened its phalanx of stormtroopers marched out in tight circular formation toward vader 
 he turned around to face the oncoming troopers his breathing even his blackrobes hanging still in the windless morning the stormtroopers stopped when theyreached him and at a word from their captain parted to reveal a bound prisoner intheir midst it was luke skywalker 
 the young jedi gazed at vader with complete calm with many layers of vision 
 the stormtrooper captain spoke to lord vader this is the rebel thatsurrendered to us although he denies it i believe there may be more of them and irequest permission to conduct a wider search of the area he extended his hand tothe dark lord in it he held lightsaber he was armed only with this 
 vader looked at the lightsaber a moment then slowly took it from the leave us conduct your search and bring his companions to me 
 the officer and his troops withdrew back to the walker 
 luke and vader were left standing along facing each other in the emeraldtranquillity of the ageless forest the mist was beginning to burn off long dayahead

 return of the jedi 
 vi 
 
 the starry sky seemed very near the treetops to luke as he and his friends werecarried into the ewok village he even aware it was a village at orange sparks of light in the distance he thought initially to be stars this wasparticularly true on his back strapped to the pole as he bright points flickered directly above him between the trees 
 but then he found himself being hoisted up intricate stairways and hidden rampsaround the immense trunks and gradually the higher they went the bigger andcracklier the lights became when the group was hundreds of feet up in the finally realized the lights were the treetops 
 they were finally taken out onto a rickety wooden walkway far too far off theground to be able to see anything below them but the abysmal drop for one bleakmoment luke was afraid they were simply going to be pitched over the brink to testtheir knowledge of forest lore but the ewoks had something else in mind 
 the narrow platform ended midway between two trees the first creature inline grabbed hold of a long vine and swung across to the far luke couldsee by twisting his head around had a large cavelike opening carved into its titanicsurface vines were quickly tossed back and forth across the chasm until soon akind of lattice was luke found himself being pulled across it on hisback still tied to the wooden poles he looked down once into nothingness itwas an unwelcome sensation 
 on the other side they rested on a shaky narrow platform until everyone wasacross then the diminutive dismantled the webbing of vines andproceeded into the tree with their captives it was totally black inside but luke hadthe impression it was more of a tunnel through the wood than an actual cavern theimpression of dense solid walls was everywhere like a burrow in a they emerged fifty yards beyond they were in the village square 
 it was a series of wooden platforms planks and walkways connecting anextensive cluster of enormous trees supported by this scaffolding was a village ofhuts constructed of an odd combination of stiffened leather daub and wattle thatchedroofs mud floors small campfires burned before many of the sparkswere caught by an elaborate system of hanging vines which funneled them to asmothering point and everywhere were hundreds of ewoks 
 cooks tanners guards grandfathers mother ewoks gathered up squealingbabies at the sight of the prisoners and scurried into their huts or pointed or smoke filled the air children played games minstrels played strange resonantmusic on hollow logs windy reeds 
 there was vast blackness below vaster still above but here in this tiny villagesuspended between the two luke felt warmth and light and special peace 
 the entourage of captors and captives stopped before the largest hut and artoo were leaned on their poles against a nearby tree han was tiedto a spit and balanced above a pile of kindling that looked suspiciously like abarbecue pit dozens of ewoks gathered around chattering curiously in animatedsqueals 
 teebo emerged from the large structure he was slightly bigger than most ofthe others and undeniably fiercer his fur was a pattern of light and dark graystripes instead of the usual leathery hood he wore a horned animal atophis head which further adorned with feathers he carried a stone hatchet andeven for someone as small as an ewok he walked with a definite swagger 
 he examined the group cursorily then seemed to make some kind ofpronouncement at that a member of the hunting party stepped mantled ewok who seemed to have taken a more protective view toward theprisoners 
 teebo conferred with paploo for a short time the discussion soon turned intoa heated disagreement however with paploo apparently taking the rebels side andteebo seemingly dismissing whatever considerations arose the rest of the tribestood around watching the debate with great interest occasionally shouting commentsor squeaking excitedly 
 threepio whose had been set down in a place of honor near thestake to which solo was tied followed the ongoing argument with rapt began to translate once or twice for luke and the stopped after only afew words since the debaters were talking so fast he want to lose the gist ofwhat was being said consequently he transmit any more information thanthe names of the ewoks involved 
 han looked over at luke with a dubious frown i like the looks of this 
 chewie growled his wholehearted agreement 
 suddenly logray exited from the large hut silencing everyone with his than teebo he was nonetheless clearly the object of greater general too wore a on his kind of great bird skull a single feathertied to its crest his fur was striped tan though and his face wise he carried noweapon only a pouch at his side and a staff topped by the spine of a 
 one by one he carefully appraised the captives smelling han testing the fabricof clothing between his fingers teebo and paploo babbled their opposingpoints of view at him but he seemed supremely uninterested so they soon stopped 
 when logray came to chewbacca he became fascinated and poked at thewookiee with his staff of growled dangerously at the tiny logray neededno further coaching and did a quick the same time reaching into hispouch and sprinkling some herbs in direction 
 careful chewie han cautioned from across the square he must be thehead honcho 
 no threepio corrected actually i believe their medicine man 
 luke was about to intervene then decided to wait it would be better if thisserious little community came to its own conclusions about them in its own ewoks seemed curiously grounded for a people so airborne 
 logray wandered over to examine a most wondrous creature hesniffed tapped and stroke the metal shell then scrunched up his face in a lookof consternation after a few moments of thought he ordered the small robot cutdown 
 the crowd murmured excitedly and backed off a few feet vine binderswere slashed by two guards causing the droid to slide down his poleand crash unceremoniously to the ground 
 the guards set him upright artoo was instantly furious he zeroed in onteebo as the source of his ignominy and beeping a blue streak began to chase theterrified ewok in circles the crowd cheering on teebo somesqueaking encouragement to the deranged droid 
 finally artoo got close enough to teebo to zing him with an electric shocked ewok jumped into the air squealed raucously and ran away as fast ashis stubby little legs could carry him wicket slipped surreptitiously into the big the onlookers screeched their indignation or delight 
 threepio was incensed artoo stop that only going to make mattersworse 
 artoo scooted over directly in front of the golden droid and began beeping avehement tirade wreee op doo rhee vrrr gk gdk dk whoo dop dhop vree doodweet 
 this outburst miffed threepio substantially with a haughty tilt he sat upstraight in his throne no way to speak to someone in my position 
 luke was afraid the situation was well on its way to getting out of control hecalled with the barest hint of impatience to his faithful droid threepio i think you spoke on our behalf 
 ungraciously to the assemblage of fuzzycreatures and made a short speech pointing from time to time to his friends tied to thestakes 
 logray became visibly upset by this he waved his staff stamped his at the golden droid for a full minute at the conclusion of his statement henodded to several attentive fellows who nodded back and began filling the pit underhan with firewood 
 well what did he say han shouted with some concern 
 threepio wilted with chagrin rather embarrassed captain solo but itappears you are to be the main course at a banquet in my honor he is quiteoffended that i should suggest otherwise 
 before another word could be said began beating in ominoussyncopation as one all the furry heads turned toward the mouth of the large of it came wicket and behind him chief chirpa 
 chirpa was gray of fur strong of will on his head he bore a garland woven ofleaves teeth and the horns of great animals bested in the hunt in his righthand he carried a staff fashioned from the longbone of a flying reptile in his left heheld an iguana who was his pet and advisor 
 he surveyed the scene in the square at a glance then turned to wait for the guestwho was only now emerging from the large hut behind him 
 the guest was the beautiful young princess of alderaan 
 leia luke and han shouted together 
 rahrhah 
 boo deedwee 
 your highness 
 with a gasp she rushed toward her friends but a phalanx of ewoks blocked herway with spears she turned to chief chirpa then to her robot interpreter 
 threepio tell them these are my friends they must be set free 
 threepio looked at chirpa and logray eep sqee rheeow he said with muchcivility sqeeow roah meep meeb eerah 
 chirpa and logray shook their heads with a motion that was unequivocablynegative logray chattered an order at his helpers who resumed vigorously pilingwood under solo 
 han exchanged helpless looks with leia somehow i have a feeling do us much good 
 luke what can we do leia urged she expected this at all a guide back to her ship or at worst a short supper and lodging for the definitely understand these creatures luke she questioned 
 han was about to offer a suggestion when he paused briefly taken aback sudden intense faith in luke it was something he really noted merely noted it now 
 before he could speak up with his plan though luke chimed in them if they do as you wish become angry and use your magic 
 but master luke what magic the droid protested i 
 tell them luke ordered uncharacteristically raising his voice there weretimes when threepio could test even the patience of a jedi 
 the turned to the large audience and spoke with great screesh oahr aish sh sheestee meep eep eep 
 the ewoks seemed greatly disturbed by this proclamation they all backed upseveral steps except for logray who took two steps forward he shouted somethingat that sounded very in the nature of challenge 
 luke closed his eyes with absolute concentration threepio began rattling on ina terribly unsettled manner as if been caught falsifying his own believe me master luke just as i told you 
 luke listening to the droid though he was visualizing him seeing himsitting shiny and golden on his throne of twigs nodding this way and that prattling onabout the most inconsequential of matters sitting there in the black void of slowly beginning to rise 
 slowly threepio began to rise 
 at first he notice at first nobody did threepio just went right ontalking as his entire litter steadily elevated off the ground told you i told you itold you they i know why a here 
 threepio and the ewoks all realized what was happening at just about the samemoment the ewoks silently fell back in terror from the floating throne threepionow began to spin as if he were on a revolving stool graceful majestic spinning 
 help he whispered artoo help me 
 chief chirpa shouted orders to his cowering minions quickly they ran forwardand released the bound prisoners leia han and luke enfolded each other in a embrace it seemed to all of them a strange setting in which to gain thefirst victory of this campaign against the empire 
 luke was aware of a plaintive beeping behind him and turned to see artoostaring up at a threepio luke lowered the golden droid slowly to theground 
 thanks threepio the young jedi patted him gratefully on the shoulder 
 threepio still a bit shaken stood with a wobbly amazed know i had it in me 
 the hut of chief chirpa was large by ewok nearly scraped the ceiling with his head the wookiee hunchedalong one side of the dwelling with his rebel comrades while the chief and tenelders sat on the other side facing them in the center between the two groups asmall fire warmed the night air casting ephemeral shadows on the earthen walls 
 outside the entire village awaited the decisions this council would arrive at itwas a pensive clear night charged with high moment though it was quite late notan ewok slept 
 inside threepio was speaking positive and negative feedback loops hadalready substantially increased his fluency in this squeaky language he was now inthe midst of an animated history of the galactic civil with explosive sound effects and editorial commentary he even mimicked animperial walker at one point 
 the ewok elders listened carefully occasionally murmuring comments to eachother it was a fascinating story and they were thoroughly at times outraged logray conferred with chief chirpa once or twice andseveral times asked threepio questions to which the golden droid responded artoo even whistled probably for emphasis 
 in the end though after a rather brief discussion among the elders the chiefshook his head negatively with an expression of rueful dissatisfaction he spokefinally to threepio and threepio interpreted for his friends 
 chief chirpa says a very moving story the droid explained but it reallyhas nothing to do with ewoks 
 a deep and pressing silence filled the small chamber only the fire softlycrackled its bright but darkling soliloquy 
 it was finally all opened his mouth to speak for the the alliance 
 tell them this goldenrod he smiled at the droid with conscious affectionfor the first time tell them hard to translate a rebellion so maybe a tell the story so tell em 
 they help us cause asking em to they even helpus cause in their own interest though it is you for oneexample the tappin a lot of energy out of this moon to generate its deflectorshield and a lot of energy you guys are gonna be without come winter and imean gonna be never mind that tell em threepio 
 threepio told them han went on 
 but not why they should help us why i used to do stuff becauseit was in my interest but not anymore well not so much anyway mostly i dothings for my friends what else is so important money had that and you know what happened to him okay okay the point areyour friends you know 
 this was one of the most inarticulate pleas leia had ever heard but it made hereyes fill with tears the ewoks on the other hand remained silent and the stoic little fellow named paploo traded a few muttered words the restwere motionless their expressions unreadable 
 after another protracted pause luke cleared his throat i realize this conceptmay be be difficult to draw these connections he started slowly terribly important for the entire galaxy for our rebel force to destroy the imperialpresence here on endor look up there through the smoke hole in the roof justthrough that tiny hole you can count a hundred stars in the whole sky there aremillions and billions more you even see and they all have planets andmoons and happy people just like you and the empire is destroying all that youcanyou could get dizzy just lying on your back and staring up at all the could almostexplode so beautiful sometimes and part of thebeauty all part of the same force and the empire is trying to turn out thelights 
 it took a while for threepio to finish translating wanted to get all thewords just right when he did eventually stop talking there was an extensivesqueaking among the elders rising and falling in volume ceasing and then resumingagain 
 leia knew what luke was trying to say but she feared greatly that the see the connection it was connected intimately though if she could onlybridge the gap for them she thought of her experience in the forest of oneness with the trees whose outstretched limbs seemed to touch the verystars the stars whose light filtered down like cascading magic she felt the powerof the magic within her and it resonated around the hut from being to being flowingthrough her again making her stronger still until she felt one with these as if she understood them knew them conspired with them in theprimary sense of the word they breathed together 
 the debate wound down leaving finally another quiet moment in the respirations quieted too in resonance and with an air of confident made her appeal to the council 
 do it because of the trees she said 
 all she said everyone expected more but there was no more only thisshort oblique outburst 
 wicket had been observing these proceedings with increasing concern from thesidelines on several occasions it was apparent he was restraining himself with greatdifficulty from entering the now he jumped to his feet pacedthe width of the hut several times finally faced the elders and began his ownimpassioned speech 
 eep eep meep eek squee 
 threepio translated for his friends honorable elders we have this nightreceived a perilous wondrous gift the gift of freedom this threepio paused in his translation just long enough to savor themoment then went golden god whose return to us has been prophesiedsince the first tree tells us now he will not be our master tells us we are free tochoose as we we must choose as all living things must choose their owndestiny he has come honorable elders and he will go no longer may we be slavesto his diving guidance we are free 
 yet how must we comport ourselves is an love of the wood any lessbecause he can leave it love is more because he can leave it yet he is it with the voice of the golden one we can close our eyes yet we listen 
 his friends tell us of a force a great living spirit of which we are all part evenas the leaves are things separate yet part of the tree we know this spirit honorableelders though we call it not the force the friends of the golden one tell us thisforce is in great jeopardy here and everywhere when the fire reaches the is safe not even the great tree of which all things are part nor its leaves norits roots not its birds all are in peril forever and ever 
 it is a brave thing to confront such a fire honorable elders many will the forest lives on 
 but the ewoks are brave 
 the little fixed his gaze on the others in the hut not a word wasspoken nonetheless the communication was intense after a minute like this heconcluded his statement 
 honorable elders we must aid this noble party not less for the trees but morefor the sake of the leaves on the trees these rebels are like the ewoks who are likethe leaves battered by the wind eaten without thought by the tumult of locusts thatinhabit the do we throw ourselves on smoldering fires that another mayknow the warmth of light yet do we make a soft bed of ourselves that another mayknow rest yet do we swirl in the wind that assails us to send the fear of chaos into thehearts of our enemies yet do we change color even as the season calls upon us tochange so must we help our leafbrothers these so has come a seasonof change upon us 
 he stood still before them the small fire dancing in his eye for a timelessmoment all the world seemed still 
 the elders were moved without saying another word they nodded inagreement perhaps they were telepathic 
 in any case chief chirpa stood and without preface made a briefpronouncement 
 all at once drums began to beat throughout the entire village the eldersjumped longer at all so ran across the tent to hug the even began to hug artoo but thought better of it as the little droid backed offwith a low warning whistle teebo scurried over to hop playfully on the instead 
 han smiled uncertainly going on 
 not sure leia answered out the side of her mouth but it look toobad 
 luke like the others was sharing the joyous it pleasant smile and diffuse good will when suddenly a dark cloud filled her there nestled a clammy chill into the corners of his soul he wiped itstraces from his visage made his face a mask nobody noticed 
 threepio finally nodded his understanding to wicket who was explaining thesituation to him he turned with an expansive gesture to the rebels we are nowpart of the tribe 
 just what always wanted said solo 
 threepio continued talking to the others trying to ignore the sarcastic starcaptain the chief has vowed to help us in any way to rid their land of the evilones 
 well short help is better than no help i always say solo chuckled 
 threepio was once again rapidly overheating his circuits toward the corellianingrate teebo says his chief scouts wicket and paploo will show us the fastestway to the shield generator 
 tell him thanks goldenrod he just loved irking threepio he himself 
 chewie let out a righteous bark happy to be on the move again one of theewoks thought he was asking for food though and brought the wookiee a large slabof meat chewbacca refuse he downed the meat in a single gulp as severalewoks gathered watching in amazement they were so incredulous at this feat infact they began giggling furiously and the laughter was so infectious it started thewookiee chortling his gruff guffaws were really hilarious to the chuckling was their jumped on him in a frenzy of tickling which hereturned threefold until they all lay in a puddle quite exhausted chewie wiped hiseyes and grabbed another piece of meat which he gnawed at a more leisurely pace 
 solo meanwhile began organizing the expedition how far is it needsome fresh supplies not much time you know give me some of 
 chewie snarled 
 luke drifted to the back of the hut and then slipped outside during thecommotion out in the square a great party was going luke avoided this too he wandered away from the bonfires awayfrom the gaiety to a secluded walkway on the dark side of a colossal tree 
 leia followed him 
 the sounds of the forest filled the soft night air here crickets skitteringrodents desolate breezes anguished owls the perfumes were a mixture jasmine and pine the harmonies were strictly ethereal the sky wascrystal black 
 luke stared at the brightest star in the heavens it looked to be fired from deepwithin its core by raging elemental vapors it was the death star 
 he take his eyes from it leia found him like that 
 wrong she whispered 
 he smiled wearily everything afraid or nothing maybe maybethings are finally going to be as they were meant to be 
 he felt the presence of darth vader very near 
 leia took his hand she felt so close to luke yetshe say how heseemed so lost now so alone so distant she almost felt his hand in is it luke 
 he looked down at their intertwined fingers leiado you remember yourmother your real mother 
 the question took her totally by surprise always felt so close to heradopted parents it was as if they were her real parents she almost never thought ofher real was like a dream 
 yet now question made her start flashes from her infancy visions of runninga beautiful womanhiding in a trunk thefragments suddenly threatened to flood her with emotion 
 yes she said pausing to regain her composure just a little bit she diedwhen i was very young 
 what do you remember he pressed tell me 
 just feelings reallyimages she wanted to let it slide it was so out of theblue so far from her immediate concernsbut somehow so loud inside all of asudden 
 tell me luke repeated 
 she felt surprised by his insistence but decided to follow him with it at least forthe time being she trusted him even when he frightened her she was verybeautiful leia remembered aloud gentle and sad she lookeddeeply into his eyes seeking his intentions why are you asking me this 
 he turned away peering back up at the death star as if been on the vergeof opening up then something scared him and he pulled it all in once more i haveno memory of my mother he claimed i never knew her 
 luke tell me troubling you she wanted to help she knew she couldhelp 
 he stared at her a long moment estimating her abilities gauging her need toknow her desire to know she was strong he felt it unwaveringly he coulddepend on her they all could vader is herenow on this moon 
 she felt a chill like a physical sensation as if her blood had actually do you know 
 i can feel his presence come for me 
 but how could he know we were here was it the code did we leave out somepassword she knew it was none of these things 
 no me he can feel it when near he held her by the wanted to tell her everything but now as he tried his will was starting to must leave you leia as long as here i endanger the whole group and ourmission here his hands trembled i have to face vader 
 leia was fast becoming distraught confused intimations were rushing at herlike wild owls out of the night their wings brushing her cheek their talons catchingher hail their harsh whispers thrilling her ear who who who 
 she shook her head hard i understand luke what do you mean youhave to face vader 
 he pulled her to him his manner suddenly gentle abidingly calm to say to say it in some basic way released him my father leia 
 your father she believe it yet of course it was true 
 he held her steady to be a rock for her leia found something else not going to be easy for you to hear it but you have to you have to knownbefore i leave here because i might not be back and if i make it theonly hope for the alliance 
 she looked away she shook her head she look at him it was terriblydisturbing what luke was saying though she imagine why it wasnonsense of course that was why to call her the only hope for the alliance if heshould it was absurd absurd to think of luke dying and to think of herbeing the only hope both thoughts were out of the question she moved away from him to deny hiswords at least to give them distance to let her breathe flashes of her mother cameagain in this breathing space parting embraces flesh torn from flesh 
 talk that way luke you have to survive i do what i of no importance without youi can do nothing you seen it you have a power i understandand could never have 
 wrong leia he held her at length you have that power force is strong in you in time learn to use it as i have 
 she shook her head she hear this he was lying she had nopower the power was elsewhere she could only help and succor and support whatwas he saying was it possible 
 he brought her closer still held her face in his hands 
 he looked so tender now so giving was he giving her the power could shetruly hold it what was he saying luke come over you 
 leia the force is strong in my family my father has it i have it and mysister has it 
 leia stared full into his eyes again darkness whirled there and she saw frightened herbut now this time she draw away she stoodclose to him she started to understand 
 yes he whispered seeing her comprehension yes you leia heheld her in his arms 
 leia closed her eyes tightly against his words against her tears to no all washed over her now and through her i know she nodded openly shewept 
 then you know i must go to him 
 she stood back her face hot her mind swimming in a storm no luke away far away if he can feel your presence go away from this place sheheld his hands put her cheek on his chest i wish i could go with you 
 he stroked the back of her head no you never han and i and the others have doubted always been strong turned away from your responsibility i say the same he thought ofhis premature flight from dagobah racing to risk everything before his training hadbeen complete almost destroying everything because of it he looked down at theblack mechanical hand he had to show for it how much more would be lost to hisweakness well he choked now both going to fulfill our destinies 
 luke why why must you confront him 
 he thought of all the win to lose to join to struggle to kill to walk away to accuse to ask why to forgive to not forgive to knew inthe end there was only one reason now and always only one reason that couldever matter good in him felt it he give me over to theemperor i can save him i can turn him back to the good side his eyes becamewild for just a moment turn by doubts and passions i have to try leia ourfather 
 they held each other close tears streamed silently down her face 
 goodbye dear and found goodbye sweet sweet leia 
 she cried openly both luke held her away and movedslowly back along the planking he disappeared into the darkness of the led out of the village 
 leia watched him go quietly weeping she gave free vent to her feelings didnot try to stop the instead to feel them to feel the source they came path they took the murky corners they cleansed 
 memories poured through her now clues suspicions mutteringswhen thought she was asleep luke her brother and vader her was too much to assimilate all at once it was information overload 
 she was crying and trembling and whimpering all at once when suddenly hanstepped up and embraced her from behind gone looking for her and heard hervoice and came around just in time to see luke only now when leiajumped at his touch and he turned her around did he realize she was sobbing 
 his quizzical smile turned to concern tempered by the of the hey going on here 
 she stifled her sobs wiped her eyes nothing han i just want to bealone for a while 
 she was hiding something that much was plain and that much was not nothing he said angrily i want to know going on now you tellme what it is he shook her never felt like this before he wanted toknow but he want to know what he thought he knew it made him sick atheart to think of leiawith lukehe even bring himself to imagine what itwas he want to imagine 
 never been out of control like this he like it he stop it herealized he was still shaking her and stopped 
 i han her lip began to tremble again 
 you you tell me i thought we were closer than that but i guessi was wrong maybe rather tell luke sometimes i 
 oh han she cried and burst into tears once more she buried herself in hisembrace 
 his anger turned slowly to confusion and dismay as he found himself wrappinghis arms around her caressing her shoulders comforting her sorry hewhispered into her hair sorry he understand not an her or himself or his feelings or women or the he knew was that just been furious and now he was affectionate made no sense 
 pleasejust hold me she whispered she want to talk she justwanted to be held 
 he just held her 
 morning mist rose off dewy vegetation as the sun broke the horizon over lush foliage of the edge had a moist green odor in that dawning momentthe world was silent as if holding its breath 
 in violent contrast the imperial landing platform squatted over the metallic octagonal it seemed to cut like an insult into the verdant beauty ofthe place the bushes at its perimeter were singed black from repeated shuttlelandings the flora beyond that was from refuse disposal tramplingfeet chemical exhaust fumes like a blight was this outpost 
 uniformed troops walked continuously on the platform and in the surveilling guarding imperial walkers were parked off to armored war machines big enough for a squad of soldiersto stand inside firing laser cannon in all directions an imperial shuttle took off forthe death star with a roar that made the trees cringe another walker emerged fromthe timber on the far side of the platform returning from a patrol mission step bylumbering step it approached the loading dock 
 darth vader stood at the rail of the lower deck staring mutely into the depths ofthe lovely forest soon it was coming soon he could feel it like a drum gettinglouder his destiny approached dread was all around but fear like this excited he let it bubble quietly within dread was a tonic it heightened his senses honeda raw edge to his passions closer it came 
 victory too he sensed mastery but laced with something elsewhat was see it quite always in motion the future difficult to see itsapparitions tantalized him swirling specters always changing smoky was hisfuture thunderous with conquest and destruction 
 very close now almost here 
 he purred in the pit of his throat like a wild cat smelling game on the air 
 almost here 
 the imperial walker docked at the opposite end of the deck and opened its phalanx of stormtroopers marched out in tight circular formation toward vader 
 he turned around to face the oncoming troopers his breathing even his blackrobes hanging still in the windless morning the stormtroopers stopped when theyreached him and at a word from their captain parted to reveal a bound prisoner intheir midst it was luke skywalker 
 the young jedi gazed at vader with complete calm with many layers of vision 
 the stormtrooper captain spoke to lord vader this is the rebel thatsurrendered to us although he denies it i believe there may be more of them and irequest permission to conduct a wider search of the area he extended his hand tothe dark lord in it he held lightsaber he was armed only with this 
 vader looked at the lightsaber a moment then slowly took it from the leave us conduct your search and bring his companions to me 
 the officer and his troops withdrew back to the walker 
 luke and vader were left standing along facing each other in the emeraldtranquillity of the ageless forest the mist was beginning to burn off long dayahead

 chapter vii 
 
 two of the shots had already flown across the bridge where there was a crush halfway across stood prince nesvitski who had alighted from his horse and whose big body was body was jammed against the railings he looked back laughing to the cossack who stood a few steps behind him holding two horses by their bridles each time prince nesvitski tried to move on soldiers and carts pushed him back again and pressed him against the railings and all he could do was to smile 
 what a fine fellow you are friend said the cossack to a convoy soldier with a wagon who was pressing onto the infantrymen who were crowded together close to his wheels and his horses what a fellow you wait a moment you see the general wants to pass 
 but the convoyman took no notice of the word general and shouted at the soldiers who were blocking his way hi there boys keep to the left wait a bit but the soldiers crowded together shoulder to shoulder their bayonets interlocking moved over the bridge in a dense mass looking down over the rails prince nesvitski saw the rapid noisy little waves of the enns which rippling and eddying round the piles of the bridge chased each other along looking on the bridge he saw equally uniform living waves of soldiers shoulder straps covered shakos knapsacks bayonets long muskets and under the shakos faces with broad cheekbones sunken cheeks and listless tired expressions and feet that moved through the sticky mud that covered the planks of the bridge sometimes through the monotonous waves of men like a fleck of white foam on the waves of the enns an officer in a cloak and with a type of face different from that of the men squeezed his way along sometimes like a chip of wood whirling in the river an hussar on foot an orderly or a townsman was carried through the waves of infantry and sometimes like a log floating down the river an officers or baggage wagon piled high leather covered and hemmed in on all sides moved across the bridge 
 as if a dam had burst said the cossack hopelessly are there many more of you to come 
 a million all but one replied a waggish soldier in a torn coat with a wink and passed on followed by another an old man 
 if he he meant the enemy begins popping at the bridge now said the old soldier dismally to a comrade forget to scratch yourself 
 that soldier passed on and after him came another sitting on a cart 
 where the devil have the leg bands been shoved to said an orderly running behind the cart and fumbling in the back of it 
 and he also passed on with the wagon then came some merry soldiers who had evidently been drinking 
 and then old fellow he gives him one in the teeth with the butt end of his gun a soldier whose greatcoat was well tucked up said gaily with a wide swing of his arm 
 yes the ham was just delicious answered another with a loud laugh and they too passed on so that nesvitski did not learn who had been struck on the teeth or what the ham had to do with it 
 bah how they scurry he just sends a ball and they think all be killed a sergeant was saying angrily and reproachfully 
 as it flies past me daddy the ball i mean said a young soldier with an enormous mouth hardly refraining from laughing i felt like dying of fright i did pon my word i got that frightened said he as if bragging of having been frightened 
 that one also passed then followed a cart unlike any that had gone before it was a german cart with a pair of horses led by a german and seemed loaded with a whole houseful of effects a fine brindled cow with a large udder was attached to the cart behind a woman with an unweaned baby an old woman and a healthy german girl with bright red cheeks were sitting on some feather beds evidently these fugitives were allowed to pass by special permission the eyes of all the soldiers turned toward the women and while the vehicle was passing at foot pace all the soldiers remarks related to the two young ones every face bore almost the same smile expressing unseemly thoughts about the women 
 just see the german sausage is making tracks too 
 sell me the missis said another soldier addressing the german who angry and frightened strode energetically along with downcast eyes 
 see how smart made herself oh the devils 
 there fedotov you should be quartered on them 
 i have seen as much before now mate 
 where are you going asked an infantry officer who was eating an apple also half smiling as he looked at the handsome girl 
 the german closed his eyes signifying that he did not understand 
 take it if you like said the officer giving the girl an apple 
 the girl smiled and took it nesvitski like the rest of the men on the bridge did not take his eyes off the women till they had passed when they had gone by the same stream of soldiers followed with the same kind of talk and at last all stopped as often happens the horses of a convoy wagon became restive at the end of the bridge and the whole crowd had to wait 
 and why are they stopping no proper order said the soldiers where are you shoving to devil take you you wait be worse if he fires the bridge see an officer jammed in too different voices were saying in the crowd as the men looked at one another and all pressed toward the exit from the bridge 
 looking down at the waters of the enns under the bridge nesvitski suddenly heard a sound new to him of something swiftly approaching something big that splashed into the water 
 just see where it carries to a soldier near by said sternly looking round at the sound 
 encouraging us to get along quicker said another uneasily 
 the crowd moved on again nesvitski realized that it was a cannon ball 
 hey cossack my horse he said now then you there get out of the way make way 
 with great difficulty he managed to get to his horse and shouting continually he moved on the soldiers squeezed themselves to make way for him but again pressed on him so that they jammed his leg and those nearest him were not to blame for they were themselves pressed still harder from behind 
 nesvitski nesvitski you numskull came a hoarse voice from behind him 
 nesvitski looked round and saw some fifteen paces away but separated by the living mass of moving infantry vaska denisov red and shaggy with his cap on the back of his black head and a cloak hanging jauntily over his shoulder 
 tell these devils these fiends to let me pass shouted denisov evidently in a fit of rage his eyes with their bloodshot whites glittering and rolling as he waved his sheathed saber in a small bare hand as red as his face 
 ah vaska joyfully replied nesvitski up with you 
 the squadwon pass shouted vaska denisov showing his white teeth fiercely and spurring his black thoroughbred arab which twitched its ears as the bayonets touched it and snorted spurting white foam from his bit tramping the planks of the bridge with his hoofs and apparently ready to jump over the railings had his rider let him what is this like sheep just like sheep out of the way let us pass stop there you devil with the cart hack you with my saber he shouted actually drawing his saber from its scabbard and flourishing it 
 the soldiers crowded against one another with terrified faces and denisov joined nesvitski 
 it not drunk today said nesvitski when the other had ridden up to him 
 they even give one time to dwink answered vaska denisov they keep dwagging the wegiment to and fwo all day if they mean to fight fight but the devil knows what this is 
 what a dandy you are today said nesvitski looking at new cloak and saddlecloth 
 denisov smiled took out of his sabretache a handkerchief that diffused a smell of perfume and put it to nose 
 of course going into action shaved bwushed my teeth and scented myself 
 the imposing figure of nesvitski followed by his cossack and the determination of denisov who flourished his sword and shouted frantically had such an effect that they managed to squeeze through to the farther side of the bridge and stopped the infantry beside the bridge nesvitski found the colonel to whom he had to deliver the order and having done this he rode back 
 having cleared the way denisov stopped at the end of the bridge carelessly holding in his stallion that was neighing and pawing the ground eager to rejoin its fellows he watched his squadron draw nearer then the clang of hoofs as of several horses galloping resounded on the planks of the bridge and the squadron officers in front and men four abreast spread across the bridge and began to emerge on his side of it 
 the infantry who had been stopped crowded near the bridge in the trampled mud and gazed with that particular feeling of estrangement and ridicule with which troops of different arms usually encounter one another at the clean smart hussars who moved past them in regular order 
 smart lads only fit for a fair said one 
 what good are they led about just for show remarked another 
 kick up the dust you infantry jested an hussar whose prancing horse had splashed mud over some foot soldiers 
 like to put you on a two days march with a knapsack your fine cords would soon get a bit rubbed said an infantryman wiping the mud off his face with his sleeve perched up there more like a bird than a man 
 there now zikin they ought to put you on a horse look fine said a corporal chaffing a thin little soldier who bent under the weight of his knapsack 
 take a stick between your legs suit you for a horse the hussar shouted back

 the infantry who had been stopped crowded near the bridge in the trampled mud and gazed with that particular feeling of estrangement and ridicule with which troops of different arms usually encounter one another at the clean smart hussars who moved past them in regular order 
 smart lads only fit for a fair said one 
 what good are they led about just for show remarked another 
 kick up the dust you infantry jested an hussar whose prancing horse had splashed mud over some foot soldiers 
 like to put you on a two days march with a knapsack your fine cords would soon get a bit rubbed said an infantryman wiping the mud off his face with his sleeve perched up there more like a bird than a man 
 there now zikin they ought to put you on a horse look fine said a corporal chaffing a thin little soldier who bent under the weight of his knapsack 
 take a stick between your legs suit you for a horse the hussar shouted back

 chapter 
 
 whatever his motive might have been laurie studied to some purpose that year for he graduated with honor and gave the latin oration with the grace of a phillips and the eloquence of a demosthenes so his friends said they were all there his so and mrs march john and meg jo and beth and all exulted over him with the sincere admiration which boys make light of at the time but fail to win from the world by any 
 got to stay for this confounded supper but i shall be home early tomorrow come and meet me as usual girls laurie said as he put the sisters into the carriage after the joys of the day were over he said girls but he meant jo for she was the only one who kept up the old custom she had not the heart to refuse her splendid successful boy anything and answered warmly 
 come teddy rain or shine and march before you playing hail the conquering hero comes on a 
 laurie thanked her with a look that made her think in a sudden panic oh deary me i know say something and then what shall i do evening meditation and morning work somewhat allayed her fears and having decided that she be vain enough to think people were going to propose when she had given them every reason to know what her answer would be she set forth at the appointed time hoping teddy do anything to make her hurt his poor feelings a call at and a refreshing sniff and sip at the daisy and demijohn still further fortified her for the but when she saw a stalwart figure looming in the distance she had a strong desire to turn about and run away 
 the jo cried laurie as soon as he was within speaking distance 
 
 i forgot it and jo took heart again for that salutation could not be called loverlike 
 she always used to take his arm on these occasions now she did not and he made no complaint which was a bad sign but talked on rapidly about all sorts of faraway subjects till they turned from the road into the little path that led homeward through the grove then he walked more slowly suddenly lost his fine flow of language and now and then a dreadful pause occurred to rescue the conversation from one of the wells of silence into which it kept falling jo said hastily now you must have a good long holiday 
 i intend to 
 something in his resolute tone made jo look up quickly to find him looking down at her with an expression that assured her the dreaded moment had come and made her put out her hand with an imploring no teddy please 
 i will and you must hear me no use jo got to have it out and the sooner the better for both of us he answered getting flushed and excited all at once 
 say what you like then listen said jo with a desperate sort of patience 
 laurie was a young lover but he was in earnest and meant to have it out if he died in the attempt so he plunged into the subject with characteristic impetuousity saying in a voice that would get choky now and then in spite of manful efforts to keep it steady 
 loved you ever since known you jo help it been so good to me tried to show it but you let me now going to make you hear and give me an answer for i go on so any longer 
 i wanted to save you this i thought understand began jo finding it a great deal harder than she expected 
 i know you did but the girls are so queer you never know what they mean they say no when they mean yes and drive a man out of his wits just for the fun of it returned laurie entrenching himself behind an undeniable fact 
 i i never wanted to make you care for me so and i went away to keep you from it if i could 
 i thought so it was like you but it was no use i only loved you all the more and i worked hard to please you and i gave up billiards and everything you like and waited and never complained for i hoped love me though not half good enough here there was a choke that be controlled so he decapitated buttercups while he cleared his confounded throat 
 you you are a great deal too good for me and so grateful to you and so proud and fond of you i know why i love you as you want me to tried but i change the feeling and it would be a lie to say i do when i 
 really truly jo he stopped short and caught both her hands as he put his question with a look that she did not soon forget 
 really truly dear 
 they were in the grove now close by the stile and when the last words fell reluctantly from lips laurie dropped her hands and turned as if to go on but for once in his life the fence was too much for him so he just laid his head down on the mossy post and stood so still that jo was frightened 
 oh teddy sorry so desperately sorry i could kill myself if it would do any good i wish you take it so hard i help it you know impossible for people to make themselves love other people if they cried jo inelegantly but remorsefully as she softly patted his shoulder remembering the time when he had comforted her so long ago 
 they do sometimes said a muffled voice from the post i believe the right sort of love and rather not try it was the decided answer 
 there was a long pause while a blackbird sung blithely on the willow by the river and the tall grass rustled in the wind presently jo said very soberly as she sat down on the step of the stile laurie i want to tell you something 
 he started as if he had been shot threw up his head and cried out in a fierce tone tell me that jo i bear it now 
 tell what she asked wondering at his violence 
 that you love that old man 
 what old man demanded jo thinking he must mean his grandfather 
 that devilish professor you were always writing about if you say you love him i know i shall do something desperate and he looked as if he would keep his word as he clenched his hands with a wrathful spark in his eyes 
 jo wanted to laugh but restrained herself and said warmly for she too was getting excited with all this swear teddy he old nor anything bad but good and kind and the best friend got next to you pray fly into a passion i want to be kind but i know i shall get angry if you abuse my professor i the least idea of loving him or anybody else 
 but you will after a while and then what will become of me 
 love someone else too like a sensible boy and forget all this trouble 
 i love anyone else and never forget you jo never never with a stamp to emphasize his passionate words 
 what shall i do with him sighed jo finding that emotions were more unmanagable than she expected you heard what i wanted to tell you sit down and listen for indeed i want to do right and make you happy she said hoping to soothe him with a little reason which proved that she knew nothing about love 
 seeing a ray of hope in that last speech laurie threw himself down on the grass at her feet leaned his arm on the lower step of the stile and looked up at her with an expectant face now that arrangement was not conducive to calm speech or clear thought on part for how could she say hard things to her boy while he watched her with eyes full of love and longing and lashes still wet with the bitter drop or two her hardness of heart had wrung from him she gently turned his head away saying as she stroked the wavy hair which had been allowed to grow for her touching that was to be sure i agree with mother that you and i are not suited to each other because our quick tempers and strong wills would probably make us very miserable if we were so foolish as to jo paused a little over the last word but laurie uttered it with a rapturous expression 
 we if you loved me jo i should be a perfect saint for you could make me anything you like 
 no i tried and failed and i risk our happiness by such a serious experiment we agree and we never shall so be good friends all our lives but we go and do anything rash 
 yes we will if we get the chance muttered laurie rebelliously 
 now do be reasonable and take a sensible view of the case implored jo almost at her end 
 i be reasonable i want to take what you call a sensible view it help me and it only makes it harder i believe got any heart 
 
 i wish i 
 there was a little quiver in voice and thinking it a good omen laurie turned round bringing all his persuasive powers to bear as he said in the wheedlesome tone that had never been so dangerously wheedlesome before disappoint us dear everyone expects it grandpa has set his heart upon it your people like it and i get on without you say you will and be happy do do 
 not until months afterward did jo understand how she had the strength of mind to hold fast to the resolution she had made when she decided that she did not love her boy and never could it was very hard to do but she did it knowing that delay was both useless and cruel 
 i say yes truly so i say it at all see that right and thank me for it she began solemnly 
 be hanged if i do and laurie bounced up off the grass burning with indignation at the very idea 
 yes you will persisted jo get over this after a while and find some lovely accomplished girl who will adore you and make a fine mistress for your fine house i homely and awkward and odd and old and be ashamed of me and we should help it even now you i like elegant society and you would and hate my scribbling and i get on without it and we should be unhappy and wish we done it and everything would be horrid 
 anything more asked asked laurie finding it hard to listen patiently to this prophetic burst 
 nothing more except that i believe i shall ever marry happy as i am and love my liberty too well to be in a hurry to give it up for any mortal man 
 i know better broke in laurie you think so now but come a time when you will care for somebody and love him tremendously and live and die for him i know you will your way and i shall have to stand by and see it and the despairing lover cast his hat upon the ground with a gesture that would have seemed comical if his face had not been so tragic 
 yes i will live and die for him if her ever comes and makes me love him in spite of myself and you must do the best you can cried jo losing patience with poor teddy done my best but you be reasonable and selfish of you to keep teasing for what i give i shall always be fond of you very fond indeed as a friend but never marry you and the sooner you believe it the better for both of now 
 that speech was like gunpowder laurie looked at her a minute as if he did not quite know what to do with himself then turned sharply away saying in a desperate sort of tone be sorry some day jo 
 oh where are you going she cried for his face frightened her 
 to the devil was the consoling answer 
 for a minute heart stood still as he swung himself down the bank toward the river but it takes much folly sin or misery to send a young man to a violent death and laurie was not one of the weak sort who are conquered by a single failure he had no thought of a melodramatic plunge but some blind instinct led him to fling hat and coat into his boat and row away with all his might making better time up the river than he had done in any race jo drew a long breath and unclasped her hands as she watched the poor fellow trying to outstrip the trouble which he carried in his heart 
 that will do him good and come home in such a tender penitent state of mind that i dare to see him she said adding as she went slowly home feeling as if she had murdered some innocent thing and buried it under the leaves now i must go and prepare mr laurence to be very kind to my poor boy i wish love beth perhaps he may in time but i begin to think i was mistaken about her oh dear how can girls like to have lovers and refuse them i think dreadful 
 being sure that no one could do it so well as herself she went straight to mr laurence told the hard story bravely through and then broke down crying so dismally over her own insensibility that the kind old gentleman though sorely disappointed did not utter a reproach he found it difficult to understand how any girl could help loving laurie and hoped she would change her mind but he knew even better than jo that love cannot be forced so he shook his head sadly and resolved to carry his boy out of way for young parting words to jo disturbed him more than he would confess 
 when laurie came home dead tired but quite composed his grandfather met him as if he knew nothing and kept up the delusion very successfully for an hour or two but when they sat together in the twilight the time they used to enjoy so much it was hard work for the old man to ramble on as usual and harder still for the young one to listen to praises of the last success which to him now seemed like labor lost he bore it as long as he could then went to his piano and began to play the were open and jo walking in the garden with beth for once understood music better than her sister for he played the sonata pathetique and played it as he never did before 
 very fine i dare say but sad enough to make one cry give us something gayer lad said mr laurence whose kind old heart was full of sympathy which he longed to show but knew not how 
 laurie dashed into a livelier strain played stormily for several minutes and would have got through bravely if in a momentary lull mrs voice had not been heard calling jo dear come in i want you 
 just what laurie longed to say with a different meaning as he listened he lost his place the music ended with a broken chord and the musician sat silent in the dark 
 i stand this muttered the old gentleman up he got groped his way to the piano laid a kind hand on either of the broad shoulders and said as gently as a woman i know my boy i know 
 no answer for an instant then laurie asked sharply who told you 
 jo herself 
 then an end of it and he shook off his hands with an impatient motion for though grateful for the sympathy his pride could not bear a pity 
 not quite i want to say one thing and then there shall be an end of it returned mr laurence with unusual mildness you care to stay at home now perhaps 
 i intend to run away from a girl jo prevent my seeing her and i shall stay and do it as long as i like interrupted laurie in a defiant tone 
 not if you are the gentleman i think you disappointed but the girl help it and the only thing left for you to do is to go away for a time where will you go 
 anywhere i care what becomes of me and laurie got up with a reckless laugh that grated on his ear 
 take it like a man and do anything rash for sake why not go abroad as you planned and forget it 
 i 
 but been wild to go and i promised you should when you got through college 
 ah but i mean to go alone and laurie walked fast through the room with an expression which it was well his grandfather did not see 
 i ask you to go alone someone ready and glad to go with you anywhere in the world 
 who sir stopping to listen 
 myself 
 laurie came back as quickly as he went and put out his hand saying huskily a selfish brute 
 lord help me yes i do know for been through it all before once in my own young days and then with your father now my dear boy just sit quietly down and hear my plan all settled and can be carried out at once said mr laurence keeping hold of the young man as if fearful that he would break away as his father had done before him 
 well sir what is it and laurie sat down without a sign of interest in face or voice 
 there is business in london that needs looking after i meant you should attend to it but i can do it better myself and things here will get on very well with brooke to manage them my partners do almost everything merely holding on until you take my place and can be off at any time 
 but you hate traveling sir i ask it of you at your age began laurie who was grateful for the sacrifice but much preferred to go alone if he went at all the old gentleman knew that perfectly well and particularly desired to prevent it for the mood in which he found his grandson assured him that it would not be wise to leave him to his own devices so stifling a natural regret at the thought of the home comforts he would leave behind him he said stoutly bless your soul not superannuated yet i quite enjoy the idea it will do me good and my old bones suffer for traveling nowadays is almost as easy as sitting in a chair 
 a restless movement from laurie suggested that his chair was not easy or that he did not like the plan and made the old man add hastily i mean to be a marplot or a burden i go because i think feel happier than if i was left behind i intend to gad about with you but leave you free to go where you like while i amuse myself in my own way friends in london and paris and should like to visit them meantime you can go to italy germany switzerland where you will and enjoy pictures music scenery and adventures to your content 
 now laurie felt just then that his heart was entirely broken and the world a howling wilderness but at the sound of certain words which the old gentleman artfully introduced into his closing sentence the broken heart gave an unexpected leap and a green oasis or two suddenly appeared in the howling wilderness he sighed and then said in a spiritless tone just as you like sir it matter where i go or what i do 
 it does to me remember that my lad i give you entire liberty but i trust you to make an honest use of it promise me that laurie 
 anything you like sir 
 good thought the old gentleman you care now but come a time when that promise will keep you out of mischief or much mistaken 
 being an energetic individual mr laurence struck while the iron was hot and before the blighted being recovered spirit enough to rebel they were off during the time necessary for preparation laurie bore himself as young gentleman usually do in such cases he was moody irritable and pensive by turns lost his appetite neglected his dress and devoted much time to playing tempestuously on his piano avoided jo but consoled himself by staring at her from his window with a tragic face that haunted her dreams by night and oppressed her with a heavy sense of guilt by day unlike some sufferers he never spoke of his unrequited passion and would allow no one not even mrs march to attempt consolation or offer sympathy on some accounts this was a relief to his friends but the weeks before his departure were very uncomfortable and everyone rejoiced that the poor dear fellow was going away to forget his trouble and come home happy of course he smiled darkly at their delusion but passed it by with the sad superiority of one who knew that his fidelity like his love was unalterable 
 when the parting came he affected high spirits to conceal certain inconvenient emotions which seemed inclined to assert themselves this gaiety did not impose upon anybody but they tried to look as if it did for his sake and he got on very well till mrs march kissed him whit a whisper full of motherly solicitude then feeling that he was going very fast he hastily embraced them all round not forgetting the afflicted hannah and ran downstairs as if for his life jo followed a minute after to wave her hand to him if he looked round he did look round came back put his arms about her as she stood on the step above him and looked up at her with a face that made his short appeal eloquent and pathetic 
 oh jo you 
 teddy dear i wish i could 
 that was all except a little pause then laurie straightened himself up said all right never mind and went away without another word ah but it all right and jo did mind for while the curly head lay on her arm a minute after her hard answer she felt as if she had stabbed her dearest friend and when he left her without a look behind him she knew that the boy laurie never would come again

 but you hate traveling sir i ask it of you at your age began laurie who was grateful for the sacrifice but much preferred to go alone if he went at all the old gentleman knew that perfectly well and particularly desired to prevent it for the mood in which he found his grandson assured him that it would not be wise to leave him to his own devices so stifling a natural regret at the thought of the home comforts he would leave behind him he said stoutly bless your soul not superannuated yet i quite enjoy the idea it will do me good and my old bones suffer for traveling nowadays is almost as easy as sitting in a chair 
 a restless movement from laurie suggested that his chair was not easy or that he did not like the plan and made the old man add hastily i mean to be a marplot or a burden i go because i think feel happier than if i was left behind i intend to gad about with you but leave you free to go where you like while i amuse myself in my own way friends in london and paris and should like to visit them meantime you can go to italy germany switzerland where you will and enjoy pictures music scenery and adventures to your content 
 now laurie felt just then that his heart was entirely broken and the world a howling wilderness but at the sound of certain words which the old gentleman artfully introduced into his closing sentence the broken heart gave an unexpected leap and a green oasis or two suddenly appeared in the howling wilderness he sighed and then said in a spiritless tone just as you like sir it matter where i go or what i do 
 it does to me remember that my lad i give you entire liberty but i trust you to make an honest use of it promise me that laurie 
 anything you like sir 
 good thought the old gentleman you care now but come a time when that promise will keep you out of mischief or much mistaken 
 being an energetic individual mr laurence struck while the iron was hot and before the blighted being recovered spirit enough to rebel they were off during the time necessary for preparation laurie bore himself as young gentleman usually do in such cases he was moody irritable and pensive by turns lost his appetite neglected his dress and devoted much time to playing tempestuously on his piano avoided jo but consoled himself by staring at her from his window with a tragic face that haunted her dreams by night and oppressed her with a heavy sense of guilt by day unlike some sufferers he never spoke of his unrequited passion and would allow no one not even mrs march to attempt consolation or offer sympathy on some accounts this was a relief to his friends but the weeks before his departure were very uncomfortable and everyone rejoiced that the poor dear fellow was going away to forget his trouble and come home happy of course he smiled darkly at their delusion but passed it by with the sad superiority of one who knew that his fidelity like his love was unalterable 
 when the parting came he affected high spirits to conceal certain inconvenient emotions which seemed inclined to assert themselves this gaiety did not impose upon anybody but they tried to look as if it did for his sake and he got on very well till mrs march kissed him whit a whisper full of motherly solicitude then feeling that he was going very fast he hastily embraced them all round not forgetting the afflicted hannah and ran downstairs as if for his life jo followed a minute after to wave her hand to him if he looked round he did look round came back put his arms about her as she stood on the step above him and looked up at her with a face that made his short appeal eloquent and pathetic 
 oh jo you 
 teddy dear i wish i could 
 that was all except a little pause then laurie straightened himself up said all right never mind and went away without another word ah but it all right and jo did mind for while the curly head lay on her arm a minute after her hard answer she felt as if she had stabbed her dearest friend and when he left her without a look behind him she knew that the boy laurie never would come again

 harry felt himself slam flat into the ground his face was pressed into grass the smell of it filled his nostrils he had closed his eyes while the portkey transported him and he kept them closed now he did not move all the breath seemed to have been knocked out of him his head was swimming so badly he felt as though the ground beneath him were swaying like the deck of a ship to hold himself steady he tightened his hold on the two things he was still clutching the smooth cold handle of the triwizard cup and body he felt as though he would slide away into the blackness gathering at the edges of his brain if he let go of either of them shock and exhaustion kept him on the ground breathing in the smell of the grass waitingwaiting for someone to do somethingsomething to happenand all the while his scar burned dully on his forehead 
 
 a torrent of sound deafened and confused him there were voices everywhere footsteps remained where he was his face screwed up against the noise as though it were a nightmare that would pass 
 
 then a pair of hands seized him roughly and turned him over 
 
 harry harry 
 
 he opened his eyes 
 
 he was looking up at the starry sky and albus dumbledore was crouched over him the dark shadows of a crowd of people pressed in around them pushing nearer harry felt the ground beneath his head reverberating with their footsteps 
 
 he had come back to the edge of the maze he could see the stands rising above him the shapes of people moving in them the stars above 
 
 harry let go of the cup but he clutched cedric to him even more tightly he raised his free hand and seized wrist while face swam in and out of focus 
 
 back harry whispered back voldemort 
 
 going on happened 
 
 the face of cornelius fudge appeared upside down over harry it looked white appalled 
 
 my god diggory it whispered dumbledore dead 
 
 the words were repeated the shadowy figures pressing in on them gasped it to those around themand then others shouted it screeched it into the night dead dead cedric diggory dead 
 
 harry let go of him he heard voice say and he felt fingers trying to pry him from limp body but harry let him go then face which was still blurred and misted came closer 
 
 harry you help him now over let go 
 
 he wanted me to bring him back harry muttered it seemed important to explain this he wanted me to bring him back to his parents 
 
 right harryjust let go now 
 
 dumbledore bent down and with extraordinary strength for a man so old and thin raised harry from the ground and set him on his feet harry swayed his head was pounding his injured leg would no longer support his weight the crowd around them jostled fighting to get closer pressing darkly in on him happened wrong with him dead 
 
 need to go to the hospital wing fudge was saying loudly ill injured dumbledore parents here in the stands 
 
 take harry dumbledore take him 
 
 no i would prefer 
 
 dumbledore amos coming you think you should tell him before he sees 
 
 harry stay here 
 
 girls were screaming sobbing scene flickered oddly before eyes 
 
 its all right son got youcome onhospital wing 
 
 dumbledore said stay said harry thickly the pounding in his scar making him feel as though he was about to throw up his vision was blurring worse than ever 
 
 you need to lie on now 
 
 someone larger and stronger than he was was half pulling half carrying him through the frightened crowd harry heard people gasping screaming and shouting as the man supporting him pushed a path through them taking him back to the castle across the lawn past the lake and the durmstrang ship harry heard nothing but the heavy breathing of the man helping him walk 
 
 what happened harry the man asked at last as he lifted harry up the stone steps clunk clunk clunk it was moody 
 
 cup was a portkey said harry as they crossed the entrance hall took me and cedric to a graveyardand voldemort was therelord voldemort 
 
 clunk clunk clunk up the marble stairs 
 
 the dark lord was there what happened then

 and then 
 
 clunk clunk clunk along the corridor 
 
 made a potiongot his body back 
 
 the dark lord got his body back returned 
 
 and the death eaters cameand then we dueled 
 
 you dueled with the dark lord 
 
 got awaymy wanddid something saw my mum and dadthey came out of his wand 
 
 in here harryin here and sit be all right nowdrink this 
 
 harry heard a key scrape in a lock and felt a cup being pushed into his hands 
 
 drink feel bettercome on now harry i need to know exactly what happened 
 
 moody helped tip the stuff down throat he coughed a peppery taste burning his throat office came into sharper focus and so did moody looked as white as fudge had looked and both eyes were fixed unblinkingly upon face 
 
 back harry sure back how did he do it 
 
 he took stuff from his grave and from wormtail and me said harry his head felt clearer his scar hurting so badly he could now see face distinctly even though the office was dark he could still hear screaming and shouting from the distant quidditch field 
 
 what did the dark lord take from you said moody 
 
 blood said harry raising his arm his sleeve was ripped where dagger had torn it 
 
 moody let out his breath in a long low hiss 
 
 and the death eaters they returned 
 
 yes said harry loads of them 
 
 how did he treat them moody asked quietly did he forgive them 
 
 but harry had suddenly remembered he should have told dumbledore he should have said it straightaway 
 
 a death eater at hogwarts a death eater here they put my name in the goblet of fire they made sure i got through to the end 
 
 harry tried to get up but moody pushed him back down 
 
 i know who the death eater is he said quietly 
 
 karkaroff said harry wildly where is he have you got him is he locked up 
 
 karkaroff said moody with an odd laugh karkaroff fled tonight when he felt the dark mark burn upon his arm he betrayed too many faithful supporters of the dark lord to wish to meet thembut i doubt he will get far the dark lord has ways of tracking his enemies 
 
 gone he ran away but then he put my name in the goblet 
 
 no said moody slowly no he it was i who did that 
 
 harry heard but believe 
 
 no you he said you do thatyou have done 
 
 i assure you i did said moody and his magical eye swung around and fixed upon the door and harry knew he was making sure that there was no one outside it at the same time moody drew out his wand and pointed it at harry 
 
 he forgave them then he said the death eaters who went free the ones who escaped azkaban 
 
 what said harry 
 
 he was looking at the wand moody was pointing at him this was a bad joke it had to be 
 
 i asked you said moody quietly whether he forgave the scum who never even went to look for him those treacherous cowards who even brave azkaban for him the faithless worthless bits of filth who were brave enough to cavort in masks at the quidditch world cup but fled at the sight of the dark mark when i fired it into the sky 
 
 you firedwhat are you talking about 
 
 i told you harryi told you if one thing i hate more than any other a death eater who walked free they turned their backs on my master when he needed them most i expected him to punish them i expected him to torture them tell me he hurt them harry face was suddenly lit with an insane smile tell me he told them that i i alone remained faithfulprepared to risk everything to deliver to him the one thing he wanted above allyou 
 
 you it be you 
 
 who put your name in the goblet of fire under the name of a different school i did who frightened off every person i thought might try to hurt you or prevent you from winning the tournament i did who nudged hagrid into showing you the dragons i did who helped you see the only way you could beat the dragon i did 
 
 magical eye had now left the door it was fixed upon harry his lopsided mouth leered more widely than ever 
 
 it been easy harry guiding you through these tasks without arousing suspicion i have had to use every ounce of cunning i possess so that my hand would not be detectable in your success dumbledore would have been very suspicious if you had managed everything too easily as long as you got into that maze preferably with a decent head start then i knew i would have a chance of getting rid of the other champions and leaving your way clear but i also had to contend with your stupidity the second taskthat was when i was most afraid we would fail i was keeping watch on you potter i knew you worked out the clue so i had to give you another hint 
 
 you harry said hoarsely cedric gave me the clue 
 
 who told cedric to open it underwater i did i trusted that he would pass the information on to you decent people are so easy to manipulate potter i was sure cedric would want to repay you for telling him about the dragons and so he did but even then potter even then you seemed likely to fail i was watching all the timeall those hours in the library you realize that the book you needed was in your dormitory all along i planted it there early on i gave it to the longbottom boy you remember magical water plants of the mediterranean it would have told you all you needed to know about gillyweed i expected you to ask everyone and anyone you could for help longbottom would have told you in an instant but you did notyou did have a streak of pride and independence that might have ruined all 
 
 so what could i do feed you information from another innocent source you told me at the yule ball a called dobby had given you a christmas present i called the elf to the staffroom to collect some robes for cleaning i staged a loud conversation with professor mcgonagall about the hostages who had been taken and whether potter would think to use gillyweed and your little elf friend ran straight to office and then hurried to find you 
 
 wand was still pointing directly at heart over his shoulder foggy shapes were moving in the on the wall 
 
 you were so long in that lake potter i thought you had drowned but luckily dumbledore took your idiocy for nobility and marked you high for it i breathed again 
 
 you had an easier time of it than you should have in that maze tonight of course said moody i was patrolling around it able to see through the outer hedges able to curse many obstacles out of your way i stunned fleur delacour as she passed i put the imperius curse on krum so that he would finish diggory and leave your path to the cup clear 
 
 harry stared at moody he just see how this could friend the famous aurorthe one who had caught so many death eatersit made no senseno sense at all 
 
 the foggy shapes in the were sharpening had become more distinct harry could see the outlines of three people over shoulder moving closer and closer but moody watching them his magical eye was upon harry 
 
 the dark lord manage to kill you potter and he so wanted to whispered moody imagine how he will reward me when he finds i have done it for him i gave you to him the thing he needed above all to regenerate and then i killed you for him i will be honored beyond all other death eaters i will be his dearest his closest supportercloser than a son 
 
 normal eye was bulging the magical eye fixed upon harry the door was barred and harry knew he would never reach his own wand in time 
 
 the dark lord and i said moody and he looked completely insane now towering over harry leering down at him have much in common both of us for instance had very disappointing fathersvery disappointing indeed both of us suffered the indignity harry of being named after those fathers and both of us had the pleasurethe very great pleasureof killing our fathers to ensure the continued rise of the dark order 
 
 mad harry said he stop himself mad 
 
 mad am i said moody his voice rising uncontrollably see see mad now that the dark lord has returned with me at his side he is back harry potter you did not conquer him and now i conquer you 
 
 moody raised his wand he opened his mouth harry plunged his own hand into his robes 
 
 stupefy there was a blinding flash of red light and with a great splintering and crashing the door of office was blasted apart 
 
 moody was thrown backward onto the office floor harry still staring at the place where face had been saw albus dumbledore professor snape and professor mcgonagall looking back at him out of the he looked around and saw the three of them standing in the doorway dumbledore in front his wand outstretched 
 
 at that moment harry fully understood for the first time why people said dumbledore was the only wizard voldemort had ever feared the look upon face as he stared down at the unconscious form of moody was more terrible than harry could have ever imagined there was no benign smile upon face no twinkle in the eyes behind the spectacles there was cold fury in every line of the ancient face a sense of power radiated from dumbledore as though he were giving off burning heat 
 
 he stepped into the office placed a foot underneath unconscious body and kicked him over onto his back so that his face was visible snape followed him looking into the where his own face was still visible glaring into the room professor mcgonagall went straight to harry 
 
 come along potter she whispered the thin line of her mouth was twitching as though she was about to cry come alonghospital wing 
 
 no said dumbledore sharply 
 
 dumbledore he ought to look at him been through enough tonight 
 
 he will stay minerva because he needs to understand said dumbledore curtly understanding is the first step to acceptance and only with acceptance can there be recovery he needs to know who has put him through the ordeal he has suffered tonight and why 
 
 moody harry said he was still in a state of complete disbelief how can it have been moody 
 
 this is not alastor moody said dumbledore quietly you have never known alastor moody the real moody would not have removed you from my sight after what happened tonight the moment he took you i knew and i followed 
 
 dumbledore bent down over limp form and put a hand inside his robes he pulled out hip flask and a set of keys on a ring then he turned to professors mcgonagall and snape 
 
 severus please fetch me the strongest truth potion you possess and then go down to the kitchens and bring up the called winky minerva kindly go down to house where you will find a large black dog sitting in the pumpkin patch take the dog up to my office tell him i will be with him shortly then come back here 
 
 if either snape or mcgonagall found these instructions peculiar they hid their confusion both turned at once and left the office dumbledore walked over to the trunk with seven locks fitted the first key in the lock and opened it it contained a mass of dumbledore closed the trunk placed a second key in the second lock and opened the trunk again the spellbooks had vanished this time it contained an assortment of broken some parchment and quills and what looked like a silvery invisibility cloak harry watched astounded as dumbledore placed the third fourth fifth and sixth keys in their respective locks reopening the trunk each time and revealing different contents each time then he placed the seventh key in the lock threw open the lid and harry let out a cry of amazement 
 
 he was looking down into a kind of pit an underground room and lying on the floor some ten feet below apparently fast asleep thin and starved in appearance was the real moody his wooden leg was gone the socket that should have held the magical eye looked empty beneath its lid and chunks of his grizzled hair were missing harry stared thunderstruck between the sleeping moody in the trunk and the unconscious moody lying on the floor of the office 
 
 dumbledore climbed into the trunk lowered himself and fell lightly onto the floor beside the sleeping moody he bent over him 
 
 stunned controlled by the imperius curse very weak he said of course they would have needed to keep him alive harry throw down the cloak freezing madam pomfrey will need to see him but he seems in no immediate danger 
 
 harry did as he was told dumbledore covered moody in the cloak tucked it around him and clambered out of the trunk again then he picked up the hip flask that stood upon the desk unscrewed it and turned it over a thick glutinous liquid splattered onto the office floor 
 
 polyjuice potion harry said dumbledore you see the simplicity of it and the brilliance for moody never does drink except from his hip flask well known for it the imposter needed of course to keep the real moody close by so that he could continue making the potion you see his hair dumbledore looked down on the moody in the trunk the imposter has been cutting it off all year see where it is uneven but i think in the excitement of tonight our fake moody might have forgotten to take it as frequently as he should have doneon the hourevery shall see 
 
 dumbledore pulled out the chair at the desk and sat down upon it his eyes fixed upon the unconscious moody on the floor harry stared at him too minutes passed in silence 
 
 then before very eyes the face of the man on the floor began to change the scars were disappearing the skin was becoming smooth the mangled nose became whole and started to shrink the long mane of grizzled gray hair was withdrawing into the scalp and turning the color of straw suddenly with a loud clunk the wooden leg fell away as a normal leg regrew in its place next moment the magical eyeball had popped out of the face as a real eye replaced it it rolled away across the floor and continued to swivel in every direction 
 
 harry saw a man lying before him slightly freckled with a mop of fair hair he knew who he was he had seen him in pensieve had watched him being led away from court by the dementors trying to convince mr crouch that he was innocentbut he was lined around the eyes now and looked much older 
 
 there were hurried footsteps outside in the corridor snape had returned with winky at his heels professor mcgonagall was right behind them 
 
 crouch snape said stopping dead in the doorway barty crouch 
 
 good heavens said professor mcgonagall stopping dead and staring down at the man on the floor 
 
 filthy disheveled winky peered around legs her mouth opened wide and she let out a piercing shriek 
 
 master barty master barty what is you doing here 
 
 she flung herself forward onto the young chest 
 
 you is killed him you is killed him you is killed son 
 
 he is simply stunned winky said dumbledore step aside please severus you have the potion 
 
 snape handed dumbledore a small glass bottle of completely clear liquid the veritaserum with which he had threatened harry in class dumbledore got up bent over the man on the floor and pulled him into a sitting position against the wall beneath the in which the reflections of dumbledore snape and mcgonagall were still glaring down upon them all winky remained on her knees trembling her hands over her face dumbledore forced the mans mouth open and poured three drops inside it then he pointed his wand at the mans chest and said ennervate 
 
 son opened his eyes his face was slack his gaze unfocused dumbledore knelt before him so that their faces were level 
 
 can you hear me dumbledore asked quietly 
 
 the eyelids flickered 
 
 yes he muttered 
 
 i would like you to tell us said dumbledore softly how you came to be here how did you escape from azkaban 
 
 crouch took a deep shuddering breath then began to speak in a flat expressionless voice 
 
 my mother saved me she knew she was dying she persuaded my father to rescue me as a last favor to her he loved her as he had never loved me he agreed they came to visit me they gave me a draft of polyjuice potion containing one of my hairs she took a draft of polyjuice potion containing one of my hairs we took on each appearance 
 
 winky was shaking her head trembling 
 
 say no more master barty say no more you is getting your father into trouble 
 
 but crouch took another deep breath and continued in the same flat voice 
 
 the dementors are blind they sensed one healthy one dying person entering azkaban they sensed one healthy one dying person leaving it my father smuggled me out disguised as my mother in case any prisoners were watching through their doors 
 
 my mother died a short while afterward in azkaban she was careful to drink polyjuice potion until the end she was buried under my name and bearing my appearance everyone believed her to be me 
 
 the eyelids flickered 
 
 and what did your father do with you when he had got you home said dumbledore quietly 
 
 staged my death a quiet private funeral that grave is empty the nursed me back to health then i had to be concealed i had to be controlled my father had to use a number of spells to subdue me when i had recovered my strength i thought only of finding my masterof returning to his service 
 
 how did your father subdue you said dumbledore 
 
 the imperius curse moody said i was under my fathers control i was forced to wear an invisibility cloak day and night i was always with the she was my keeper and caretaker she pitied me she persuaded my father to give me occasional treats rewards for my good behavior 
 
 master barty master barty sobbed winky through her hands you ought to tell them we is getting in trouble 
 
 did anybody ever discover that you were still alive said dumbledore softly did anyone know except your father and the 
 
 yes said crouch his eyelids flickering again a witch in my office bertha jorkins she came to the house with papers for my signature he was not at home winky showed her inside and returned to the kitchen to me but bertha jorkins heard winky talking to me she came to investigate she heard enough to guess who was hiding under the invisibility cloak my father arrived home she confronted him he put a very powerful memory charm on her to make her forget what found out too powerful he said it damaged her memory permanently 
 
 why is she coming to nose into my masters private business sobbed winky why she leaving us be 
 
 tell me about the quidditch world cup said dumbledore 
 
 winky talked my father into it said crouch still in the same monotonous voice she spent months persuading him i had not left the house for years i had loved quidditch let him go she said he will be in his invisibility cloak he can watch let him smell fresh air for once she said my mother would have wanted it she told my father that my mother had died to give me freedom she had not saved me for a life of imprisonment he agreed in the end 
 
 it was carefully planned my father led me and winky up to the top box early in the day winky was to say that she was saving a seat for my father i was to sit there invisible when everyone had left the box we would emerge winky would appear to be alone nobody would ever know 
 
 but winky know that i was growing stronger i was starting to fight my imperius curse there were times when i was almost myself again there were brief periods when i seemed outside his control it happened there in the top box it was like waking from a deep sleep i found myself out in public in the middle of the match and i saw in front of me a wand sticking out of a boys pocket i had not been allowed a wand since before azkaban i stole it winky know winky is frightened of heights she had her face hidden 
 
 master barty you bad boy whispered winky tears trickling between her fingers 
 
 so you took the wand said dumbledore and what did you do with it 
 
 we went back to the tent said crouch then we heard them we heard the death eaters the ones who had never been to azkaban the ones who had never suffered for my master they had turned their backs on him they were not enslaved as i was they were free to seek him but they did not they were merely making sport of muggles the sound of their voices awoke me my mind was clearer than it had been in years i was angry i had the wand 
 
 i wanted to attack them for their disloyalty to my master my father had left the tent he had gone to free the muggles winky was afraid to see me so angry she used her own brand of magic to bind me to her she pulled me from the tent pulled me into the forest away from the death eaters i tried to hold her back i wanted to return to the campsite i wanted to show those death eaters what loyalty to the dark lord meant and to punish them for their lack of it i used the stolen wand to cast the dark mark into the sky 
 
 ministry wizards arrived they shot stunning spells everywhere one of the spells came through the trees where winky and i stood the bond connecting us was broken we were both stunned 
 
 when winky was discovered my father knew i must be nearby he searched the bushes where she had been found and felt me lying there he waited until the other ministry members had left the forest he put me back under the imperius curse and took me home he dismissed winky she had failed him she had let me acquire a wand she had almost let me escape 
 
 winky let out a wail of despair 
 
 now it was just father and i alone in the house and thenand then head rolled on his neck and an insane grin spread across his face my master came for me 
 
 he arrived at our house late one night in the arms of his servant wormtail my master had found out that i was still alive he had captured bertha jorkins in albania he had tortured her she told him a great deal she told him about the triwizard tournament she told him the old auror moody was going to teach at hogwarts he tortured her until he broke through the memory charm my father had placed upon her she told him i had escaped from azkaban she told him my father kept me imprisoned to prevent me from seeking my master and so my master knew that i was still his faithful servant perhaps the most faithful of all my master conceived a plan based upon the information bertha had given him he needed me he arrived at our house near midnight my father answered the door 
 
 the smile spread wider over face as though recalling the sweetest memory of his life petrified brown eyes were visible through her fingers she seemed too appalled to speak 
 
 it was very quick my father was placed under the imperius curse by my master now my father was the one imprisoned controlled my master forced him to go about his business as usual to act as though nothing was wrong and i was released i awoke i was myself again alive as i been in years 
 
 and what did lord voldemort ask you to do said dumbledore 
 
 he asked me whether i was ready to risk everything for him i was ready it was my dream my greatest ambition to serve him to prove myself to him he told me he needed to place a faithful servant at hogwarts a servant who would guide harry potter through the triwizard tournament without appearing to do so a servant who would watch over harry potter ensure he reached the triwizard cup turn the cup into a portkey which would take the first person to touch it to my master but first 
 
 you needed alastor moody said dumbledore his blue eyes were blazing though his voice remained calm 
 
 wormtail and i did it we had prepared the polyjuice potion beforehand we journeyed to his house moody put up a struggle there was a commotion we managed to subdue him just in time forced him into a compartment of his own magical trunk took some of his hair and added it to the potion i drank it i became double i took his leg and his eye i was ready to face arthur weasley when he arrived to sort out the muggles who had heard a disturbance i made the dustbins move around the yard i told arthur weasley i had heard intruders in my yard who had set off the dustbins then i packed up clothes and dark detectors put them in the trunk with moody and set off for hogwarts i kept him alive under the imperius curse i wanted to be able to question him to find out about his past learn his habits so that i could fool even dumbledore i also needed his hair to make the polyjuice potion the other ingredients were easy i stole skin from the dungeons when the potions master found me in his office i said i was under orders to search it 
 
 and what became of wormtail after you attacked moody said dumbledore 
 
 wormtail returned to care for my master in my house and to keep watch over my father 
 
 but your father escaped said dumbledore 
 
 yes after a while he began to fight the imperius curse just as i had done there were periods when he knew what was happening my master decided it was no longer safe for my father to leave the house he forced him to send letters to the ministry instead he made him write and say he was ill but wormtail neglected his duty he was not watchful enough my father escaped my master guessed that he was heading for hogwarts my father was going to tell dumbledore everything to confess he was going to admit that he had smuggled me from azkaban 
 
 my master sent me word of my escape he told me to stop him at all costs so i waited and watched i used the map i had taken from harry potter the map that had almost ruined everything 
 
 map said dumbledore quickly what map is this 
 
 map of hogwarts potter saw me on it potter saw me stealing more ingredients for the polyjuice potion from office one night he thought i was my father we have the same first name i took the map from potter that night i told him my father hated dark wizards potter believed my father was after snape 
 
 for a week i waited for my father to arrive at hogwarts at last one evening the map showed my father entering the grounds i pulled on my invisibility cloak and went down to meet him he was walking around the edge of the forest then potter came and krum i waited i could not hurt potter my master needed him potter ran to get dumbledore i stunned krum i killed my father 
 
 noooo wailed winky master barty master barty what is you saying 
 
 you killed your father dumbledore said in the same soft voice what did you do with the body 
 
 carried it into the forest covered it with the invisibility cloak i had the map with me i watched potter run into the castle he met snape dumbledore joined them i watched potter bringing dumbledore out of the castle i walked back out of the forest doubled around behind them went to meet them i told dumbledore snape had told me where to come 
 
 dumbledore told me to go and look for my father i went back to my body watched the map when everyone was gone i transfigured my body he became a bonei buried it while wearing the invisibility cloak in the freshly dug earth in front of cabin 
 
 there was complete silence now except for continued sobs then dumbledore said and tonight 
 
 i offered to carry the triwizard cup into the maze before dinner whispered barty crouch turned it into a portkey my plan worked he is returned to power and i will be honored by him beyond the dreams of wizards 
 
 the insane smile lit his features once more and his head drooped onto his shoulder as winky wailed and sobbed at his side 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the goblet of fire

 harry felt himself slam flat into the ground his face was pressed into grass the smell of it filled his nostrils he had closed his eyes while the portkey transported him and he kept them closed now he did not move all the breath seemed to have been knocked out of him his head was swimming so badly he felt as though the ground beneath him were swaying like the deck of a ship to hold himself steady he tightened his hold on the two things he was still clutching the smooth cold handle of the triwizard cup and body he felt as though he would slide away into the blackness gathering at the edges of his brain if he let go of either of them shock and exhaustion kept him on the ground breathing in the smell of the grass waitingwaiting for someone to do somethingsomething to happenand all the while his scar burned dully on his forehead 
 
 a torrent of sound deafened and confused him there were voices everywhere footsteps remained where he was his face screwed up against the noise as though it were a nightmare that would pass 
 
 then a pair of hands seized him roughly and turned him over 
 
 harry harry 
 
 he opened his eyes 
 
 he was looking up at the starry sky and albus dumbledore was crouched over him the dark shadows of a crowd of people pressed in around them pushing nearer harry felt the ground beneath his head reverberating with their footsteps 
 
 he had come back to the edge of the maze he could see the stands rising above him the shapes of people moving in them the stars above 
 
 harry let go of the cup but he clutched cedric to him even more tightly he raised his free hand and seized wrist while face swam in and out of focus 
 
 back harry whispered back voldemort 
 
 going on happened 
 
 the face of cornelius fudge appeared upside down over harry it looked white appalled 
 
 my god diggory it whispered dumbledore dead 
 
 the words were repeated the shadowy figures pressing in on them gasped it to those around themand then others shouted it screeched it into the night dead dead cedric diggory dead 
 
 harry let go of him he heard voice say and he felt fingers trying to pry him from limp body but harry let him go then face which was still blurred and misted came closer 
 
 harry you help him now over let go 
 
 he wanted me to bring him back harry muttered it seemed important to explain this he wanted me to bring him back to his parents 
 
 right harryjust let go now 
 
 dumbledore bent down and with extraordinary strength for a man so old and thin raised harry from the ground and set him on his feet harry swayed his head was pounding his injured leg would no longer support his weight the crowd around them jostled fighting to get closer pressing darkly in on him happened wrong with him dead 
 
 need to go to the hospital wing fudge was saying loudly ill injured dumbledore parents here in the stands

 no i would prefer 
 
 dumbledore amos coming you think you should tell him before he sees 
 
 harry stay here 
 
 girls were screaming sobbing scene flickered oddly before eyes 
 
 its all right son got youcome onhospital wing 
 
 dumbledore said stay said harry thickly the pounding in his scar making him feel as though he was about to throw up his vision was blurring worse than ever 
 
 you need to lie on now 
 
 someone larger and stronger than he was was half pulling half carrying him through the frightened crowd harry heard people gasping screaming and shouting as the man supporting him pushed a path through them taking him back to the castle across the lawn past the lake and the durmstrang ship harry heard nothing but the heavy breathing of the man helping him walk 
 
 what happened harry the man asked at last as he lifted harry up the stone steps clunk clunk clunk it was moody 
 
 cup was a portkey said harry as they crossed the entrance hall took me and cedric to a graveyardand voldemort was therelord voldemort 
 
 clunk clunk clunk up the marble stairs 
 
 the dark lord was there what happened then

 and then 
 
 clunk clunk clunk along the corridor

 the dark lord got his body back returned 
 
 and the death eaters cameand then we dueled 
 
 you dueled with the dark lord 
 
 got awaymy wanddid something saw my mum and dadthey came out of his wand 
 
 in here harryin here and sit be all right nowdrink this 
 
 harry heard a key scrape in a lock and felt a cup being pushed into his hands 
 
 drink feel bettercome on now harry i need to know exactly what happened 
 
 moody helped tip the stuff down throat he coughed a peppery taste burning his throat office came into sharper focus and so did moody looked as white as fudge had looked and both eyes were fixed unblinkingly upon face 
 
 back harry sure back how did he do it 
 
 he took stuff from his grave and from wormtail and me said harry his head felt clearer his scar hurting so badly he could now see face distinctly even though the office was dark he could still hear screaming and shouting from the distant quidditch field 
 
 what did the dark lord take from you said moody 
 
 blood said harry raising his arm his sleeve was ripped where dagger had torn it 
 
 moody let out his breath in a long low hiss 
 
 and the death eaters they returned 
 
 yes said harry loads of them 
 
 how did he treat them moody asked quietly did he forgive them 
 
 but harry had suddenly remembered he should have told dumbledore he should have said it straightaway 
 
 a death eater at hogwarts a death eater here they put my name in the goblet of fire they made sure i got through to the end 
 
 harry tried to get up but moody pushed him back down 
 
 i know who the death eater is he said quietly 
 
 karkaroff said harry wildly where is he have you got him is he locked up 
 
 karkaroff said moody with an odd laugh karkaroff fled tonight when he felt the dark mark burn upon his arm he betrayed too many faithful supporters of the dark lord to wish to meet thembut i doubt he will get far the dark lord has ways of tracking his enemies 
 
 gone he ran away but then he put my name in the goblet 
 
 no said moody slowly no he it was i who did that 
 
 harry heard but believe 
 
 no you he said you do thatyou have done 
 
 i assure you i did said moody and his magical eye swung around and fixed upon the door and harry knew he was making sure that there was no one outside it at the same time moody drew out his wand and pointed it at harry 
 
 he forgave them then he said the death eaters who went free the ones who escaped azkaban 
 
 what said harry 
 
 he was looking at the wand moody was pointing at him this was a bad joke it had to be 
 
 i asked you said moody quietly whether he forgave the scum who never even went to look for him those treacherous cowards who even brave azkaban for him the faithless worthless bits of filth who were brave enough to cavort in masks at the quidditch world cup but fled at the sight of the dark mark when i fired it into the sky 
 
 you firedwhat are you talking about 
 
 i told you harryi told you if one thing i hate more than any other a death eater who walked free they turned their backs on my master when he needed them most i expected him to punish them i expected him to torture them tell me he hurt them harry face was suddenly lit with an insane smile tell me he told them that i i alone remained faithfulprepared to risk everything to deliver to him the one thing he wanted above allyou 
 
 you it be you 
 
 who put your name in the goblet of fire under the name of a different school i did who frightened off every person i thought might try to hurt you or prevent you from winning the tournament i did who nudged hagrid into showing you the dragons i did who helped you see the only way you could beat the dragon i did 
 
 magical eye had now left the door it was fixed upon harry his lopsided mouth leered more widely than ever 
 
 it been easy harry guiding you through these tasks without arousing suspicion i have had to use every ounce of cunning i possess so that my hand would not be detectable in your success dumbledore would have been very suspicious if you had managed everything too easily as long as you got into that maze preferably with a decent head start then i knew i would have a chance of getting rid of the other champions and leaving your way clear but i also had to contend with your stupidity the second taskthat was when i was most afraid we would fail i was keeping watch on you potter i knew you worked out the clue so i had to give you another hint 
 
 you harry said hoarsely cedric gave me the clue 
 
 who told cedric to open it underwater i did i trusted that he would pass the information on to you decent people are so easy to manipulate potter i was sure cedric would want to repay you for telling him about the dragons and so he did but even then potter even then you seemed likely to fail i was watching all the timeall those hours in the library you realize that the book you needed was in your dormitory all along i planted it there early on i gave it to the longbottom boy you remember magical water plants of the mediterranean it would have told you all you needed to know about gillyweed i expected you to ask everyone and anyone you could for help longbottom would have told you in an instant but you did notyou did have a streak of pride and independence that might have ruined all 
 
 so what could i do feed you information from another innocent source you told me at the yule ball a called dobby had given you a christmas present i called the elf to the staffroom to collect some robes for cleaning i staged a loud conversation with professor mcgonagall about the hostages who had been taken and whether potter would think to use gillyweed and your little elf friend ran straight to office and then hurried to find you 
 
 wand was still pointing directly at heart over his shoulder foggy shapes were moving in the on the wall 
 
 you were so long in that lake potter i thought you had drowned but luckily dumbledore took your idiocy for nobility and marked you high for it i breathed again 
 
 you had an easier time of it than you should have in that maze tonight of course said moody i was patrolling around it able to see through the outer hedges able to curse many obstacles out of your way i stunned fleur delacour as she passed i put the imperius curse on krum so that he would finish diggory and leave your path to the cup clear 
 
 harry stared at moody he just see how this could friend the famous aurorthe one who had caught so many death eatersit made no senseno sense at all 
 
 the foggy shapes in the were sharpening had become more distinct harry could see the outlines of three people over shoulder moving closer and closer but moody watching them his magical eye was upon harry 
 
 the dark lord manage to kill you potter and he so wanted to whispered moody imagine how he will reward me when he finds i have done it for him i gave you to him the thing he needed above all to regenerate and then i killed you for him i will be honored beyond all other death eaters i will be his dearest his closest supportercloser than a son 
 
 normal eye was bulging the magical eye fixed upon harry the door was barred and harry knew he would never reach his own wand in time 
 
 the dark lord and i said moody and he looked completely insane now towering over harry leering down at him have much in common both of us for instance had very disappointing fathersvery disappointing indeed both of us suffered the indignity harry of being named after those fathers and both of us had the pleasurethe very great pleasureof killing our fathers to ensure the continued rise of the dark order 
 
 mad harry said he stop himself mad 
 
 mad am i said moody his voice rising uncontrollably see see mad now that the dark lord has returned with me at his side he is back harry potter you did not conquer him and now i conquer you 
 
 moody raised his wand he opened his mouth harry plunged his own hand into his robes 
 
 stupefy there was a blinding flash of red light and with a great splintering and crashing the door of office was blasted apart 
 
 moody was thrown backward onto the office floor harry still staring at the place where face had been saw albus dumbledore professor snape and professor mcgonagall looking back at him out of the he looked around and saw the three of them standing in the doorway dumbledore in front his wand outstretched 
 
 at that moment harry fully understood for the first time why people said dumbledore was the only wizard voldemort had ever feared the look upon face as he stared down at the unconscious form of moody was more terrible than harry could have ever imagined there was no benign smile upon face no twinkle in the eyes behind the spectacles there was cold fury in every line of the ancient face a sense of power radiated from dumbledore as though he were giving off burning heat 
 
 he stepped into the office placed a foot underneath unconscious body and kicked him over onto his back so that his face was visible snape followed him looking into the where his own face was still visible glaring into the room professor mcgonagall went straight to harry 
 
 come along potter she whispered the thin line of her mouth was twitching as though she was about to cry come alonghospital wing 
 
 no said dumbledore sharply 
 
 dumbledore he ought to look at him been through enough tonight 
 
 he will stay minerva because he needs to understand said dumbledore curtly understanding is the first step to acceptance and only with acceptance can there be recovery he needs to know who has put him through the ordeal he has suffered tonight and why 
 
 moody harry said he was still in a state of complete disbelief how can it have been moody 
 
 this is not alastor moody said dumbledore quietly you have never known alastor moody the real moody would not have removed you from my sight after what happened tonight the moment he took you i knew and i followed 
 
 dumbledore bent down over limp form and put a hand inside his robes he pulled out hip flask and a set of keys on a ring then he turned to professors mcgonagall and snape 
 
 severus please fetch me the strongest truth potion you possess and then go down to the kitchens and bring up the called winky minerva kindly go down to house where you will find a large black dog sitting in the pumpkin patch take the dog up to my office tell him i will be with him shortly then come back here 
 
 if either snape or mcgonagall found these instructions peculiar they hid their confusion both turned at once and left the office dumbledore walked over to the trunk with seven locks fitted the first key in the lock and opened it it contained a mass of dumbledore closed the trunk placed a second key in the second lock and opened the trunk again the spellbooks had vanished this time it contained an assortment of broken some parchment and quills and what looked like a silvery invisibility cloak harry watched astounded as dumbledore placed the third fourth fifth and sixth keys in their respective locks reopening the trunk each time and revealing different contents each time then he placed the seventh key in the lock threw open the lid and harry let out a cry of amazement 
 
 he was looking down into a kind of pit an underground room and lying on the floor some ten feet below apparently fast asleep thin and starved in appearance was the real moody his wooden leg was gone the socket that should have held the magical eye looked empty beneath its lid and chunks of his grizzled hair were missing harry stared thunderstruck between the sleeping moody in the trunk and the unconscious moody lying on the floor of the office 
 
 dumbledore climbed into the trunk lowered himself and fell lightly onto the floor beside the sleeping moody he bent over him 
 
 stunned controlled by the imperius curse very weak he said of course they would have needed to keep him alive harry throw down the cloak freezing madam pomfrey will need to see him but he seems in no immediate danger 
 
 harry did as he was told dumbledore covered moody in the cloak tucked it around him and clambered out of the trunk again then he picked up the hip flask that stood upon the desk unscrewed it and turned it over a thick glutinous liquid splattered onto the office floor 
 
 polyjuice potion harry said dumbledore you see the simplicity of it and the brilliance for moody never does drink except from his hip flask well known for it the imposter needed of course to keep the real moody close by so that he could continue making the potion you see his hair dumbledore looked down on the moody in the trunk the imposter has been cutting it off all year see where it is uneven but i think in the excitement of tonight our fake moody might have forgotten to take it as frequently as he should have doneon the hourevery shall see 
 
 dumbledore pulled out the chair at the desk and sat down upon it his eyes fixed upon the unconscious moody on the floor harry stared at him too minutes passed in silence 
 
 then before very eyes the face of the man on the floor began to change the scars were disappearing the skin was becoming smooth the mangled nose became whole and started to shrink the long mane of grizzled gray hair was withdrawing into the scalp and turning the color of straw suddenly with a loud clunk the wooden leg fell away as a normal leg regrew in its place next moment the magical eyeball had popped out of the face as a real eye replaced it it rolled away across the floor and continued to swivel in every direction 
 
 harry saw a man lying before him slightly freckled with a mop of fair hair he knew who he was he had seen him in pensieve had watched him being led away from court by the dementors trying to convince mr crouch that he was innocentbut he was lined around the eyes now and looked much older 
 
 there were hurried footsteps outside in the corridor snape had returned with winky at his heels professor mcgonagall was right behind them 
 
 crouch snape said stopping dead in the doorway barty crouch 
 
 good heavens said professor mcgonagall stopping dead and staring down at the man on the floor 
 
 filthy disheveled winky peered around legs her mouth opened wide and she let out a piercing shriek 
 
 master barty master barty what is you doing here 
 
 she flung herself forward onto the young chest 
 
 you is killed him you is killed him you is killed son 
 
 he is simply stunned winky said dumbledore step aside please severus you have the potion 
 
 snape handed dumbledore a small glass bottle of completely clear liquid the veritaserum with which he had threatened harry in class dumbledore got up bent over the man on the floor and pulled him into a sitting position against the wall beneath the in which the reflections of dumbledore snape and mcgonagall were still glaring down upon them all winky remained on her knees trembling her hands over her face dumbledore forced the mans mouth open and poured three drops inside it then he pointed his wand at the mans chest and said ennervate 
 
 son opened his eyes his face was slack his gaze unfocused dumbledore knelt before him so that their faces were level 
 
 can you hear me dumbledore asked quietly 
 
 the eyelids flickered 
 
 yes he muttered 
 
 i would like you to tell us said dumbledore softly how you came to be here how did you escape from azkaban 
 
 crouch took a deep shuddering breath then began to speak in a flat expressionless voice 
 
 my mother saved me she knew she was dying she persuaded my father to rescue me as a last favor to her he loved her as he had never loved me he agreed they came to visit me they gave me a draft of polyjuice potion containing one of my hairs she took a draft of polyjuice potion containing one of my hairs we took on each appearance 
 
 winky was shaking her head trembling 
 
 say no more master barty say no more you is getting your father into trouble 
 
 but crouch took another deep breath and continued in the same flat voice 
 
 the dementors are blind they sensed one healthy one dying person entering azkaban they sensed one healthy one dying person leaving it my father smuggled me out disguised as my mother in case any prisoners were watching through their doors 
 
 my mother died a short while afterward in azkaban she was careful to drink polyjuice potion until the end she was buried under my name and bearing my appearance everyone believed her to be me 
 
 the eyelids flickered 
 
 and what did your father do with you when he had got you home said dumbledore quietly 
 
 staged my death a quiet private funeral that grave is empty the nursed me back to health then i had to be concealed i had to be controlled my father had to use a number of spells to subdue me when i had recovered my strength i thought only of finding my masterof returning to his service 
 
 how did your father subdue you said dumbledore 
 
 the imperius curse moody said i was under my fathers control i was forced to wear an invisibility cloak day and night i was always with the she was my keeper and caretaker she pitied me she persuaded my father to give me occasional treats rewards for my good behavior 
 
 master barty master barty sobbed winky through her hands you ought to tell them we is getting in trouble 
 
 did anybody ever discover that you were still alive said dumbledore softly did anyone know except your father and the 
 
 yes said crouch his eyelids flickering again a witch in my office bertha jorkins she came to the house with papers for my signature he was not at home winky showed her inside and returned to the kitchen to me but bertha jorkins heard winky talking to me she came to investigate she heard enough to guess who was hiding under the invisibility cloak my father arrived home she confronted him he put a very powerful memory charm on her to make her forget what found out too powerful he said it damaged her memory permanently 
 
 why is she coming to nose into my masters private business sobbed winky why she leaving us be 
 
 tell me about the quidditch world cup said dumbledore 
 
 winky talked my father into it said crouch still in the same monotonous voice she spent months persuading him i had not left the house for years i had loved quidditch let him go she said he will be in his invisibility cloak he can watch let him smell fresh air for once she said my mother would have wanted it she told my father that my mother had died to give me freedom she had not saved me for a life of imprisonment he agreed in the end 
 
 it was carefully planned my father led me and winky up to the top box early in the day winky was to say that she was saving a seat for my father i was to sit there invisible when everyone had left the box we would emerge winky would appear to be alone nobody would ever know 
 
 but winky know that i was growing stronger i was starting to fight my imperius curse there were times when i was almost myself again there were brief periods when i seemed outside his control it happened there in the top box it was like waking from a deep sleep i found myself out in public in the middle of the match and i saw in front of me a wand sticking out of a boys pocket i had not been allowed a wand since before azkaban i stole it winky know winky is frightened of heights she had her face hidden 
 
 master barty you bad boy whispered winky tears trickling between her fingers 
 
 so you took the wand said dumbledore and what did you do with it 
 
 we went back to the tent said crouch then we heard them we heard the death eaters the ones who had never been to azkaban the ones who had never suffered for my master they had turned their backs on him they were not enslaved as i was they were free to seek him but they did not they were merely making sport of muggles the sound of their voices awoke me my mind was clearer than it had been in years i was angry i had the wand 
 
 i wanted to attack them for their disloyalty to my master my father had left the tent he had gone to free the muggles winky was afraid to see me so angry she used her own brand of magic to bind me to her she pulled me from the tent pulled me into the forest away from the death eaters i tried to hold her back i wanted to return to the campsite i wanted to show those death eaters what loyalty to the dark lord meant and to punish them for their lack of it i used the stolen wand to cast the dark mark into the sky 
 
 ministry wizards arrived they shot stunning spells everywhere one of the spells came through the trees where winky and i stood the bond connecting us was broken we were both stunned 
 
 when winky was discovered my father knew i must be nearby he searched the bushes where she had been found and felt me lying there he waited until the other ministry members had left the forest he put me back under the imperius curse and took me home he dismissed winky she had failed him she had let me acquire a wand she had almost let me escape 
 
 winky let out a wail of despair 
 
 now it was just father and i alone in the house and thenand then head rolled on his neck and an insane grin spread across his face my master came for me 
 
 he arrived at our house late one night in the arms of his servant wormtail my master had found out that i was still alive he had captured bertha jorkins in albania he had tortured her she told him a great deal she told him about the triwizard tournament she told him the old auror moody was going to teach at hogwarts he tortured her until he broke through the memory charm my father had placed upon her she told him i had escaped from azkaban she told him my father kept me imprisoned to prevent me from seeking my master and so my master knew that i was still his faithful servant perhaps the most faithful of all my master conceived a plan based upon the information bertha had given him he needed me he arrived at our house near midnight my father answered the door 
 
 the smile spread wider over face as though recalling the sweetest memory of his life petrified brown eyes were visible through her fingers she seemed too appalled to speak 
 
 it was very quick my father was placed under the imperius curse by my master now my father was the one imprisoned controlled my master forced him to go about his business as usual to act as though nothing was wrong and i was released i awoke i was myself again alive as i been in years 
 
 and what did lord voldemort ask you to do said dumbledore 
 
 he asked me whether i was ready to risk everything for him i was ready it was my dream my greatest ambition to serve him to prove myself to him he told me he needed to place a faithful servant at hogwarts a servant who would guide harry potter through the triwizard tournament without appearing to do so a servant who would watch over harry potter ensure he reached the triwizard cup turn the cup into a portkey which would take the first person to touch it to my master but first 
 
 you needed alastor moody said dumbledore his blue eyes were blazing though his voice remained calm 
 
 wormtail and i did it we had prepared the polyjuice potion beforehand we journeyed to his house moody put up a struggle there was a commotion we managed to subdue him just in time forced him into a compartment of his own magical trunk took some of his hair and added it to the potion i drank it i became double i took his leg and his eye i was ready to face arthur weasley when he arrived to sort out the muggles who had heard a disturbance i made the dustbins move around the yard i told arthur weasley i had heard intruders in my yard who had set off the dustbins then i packed up clothes and dark detectors put them in the trunk with moody and set off for hogwarts i kept him alive under the imperius curse i wanted to be able to question him to find out about his past learn his habits so that i could fool even dumbledore i also needed his hair to make the polyjuice potion the other ingredients were easy i stole skin from the dungeons when the potions master found me in his office i said i was under orders to search it 
 
 and what became of wormtail after you attacked moody said dumbledore 
 
 wormtail returned to care for my master in my house and to keep watch over my father 
 
 but your father escaped said dumbledore 
 
 yes after a while he began to fight the imperius curse just as i had done there were periods when he knew what was happening my master decided it was no longer safe for my father to leave the house he forced him to send letters to the ministry instead he made him write and say he was ill but wormtail neglected his duty he was not watchful enough my father escaped my master guessed that he was heading for hogwarts my father was going to tell dumbledore everything to confess he was going to admit that he had smuggled me from azkaban 
 
 my master sent me word of my escape he told me to stop him at all costs so i waited and watched i used the map i had taken from harry potter the map that had almost ruined everything 
 
 map said dumbledore quickly what map is this 
 
 map of hogwarts potter saw me on it potter saw me stealing more ingredients for the polyjuice potion from office one night he thought i was my father we have the same first name i took the map from potter that night i told him my father hated dark wizards potter believed my father was after snape 
 
 for a week i waited for my father to arrive at hogwarts at last one evening the map showed my father entering the grounds i pulled on my invisibility cloak and went down to meet him he was walking around the edge of the forest then potter came and krum i waited i could not hurt potter my master needed him potter ran to get dumbledore i stunned krum i killed my father 
 
 noooo wailed winky master barty master barty what is you saying 
 
 you killed your father dumbledore said in the same soft voice what did you do with the body 
 
 carried it into the forest covered it with the invisibility cloak i had the map with me i watched potter run into the castle he met snape dumbledore joined them i watched potter bringing dumbledore out of the castle i walked back out of the forest doubled around behind them went to meet them i told dumbledore snape had told me where to come 
 
 dumbledore told me to go and look for my father i went back to my body watched the map when everyone was gone i transfigured my body he became a bonei buried it while wearing the invisibility cloak in the freshly dug earth in front of cabin 
 
 there was complete silence now except for continued sobs then dumbledore said and tonight 
 
 i offered to carry the triwizard cup into the maze before dinner whispered barty crouch turned it into a portkey my plan worked he is returned to power and i will be honored by him beyond the dreams of wizards 
 
 the insane smile lit his features once more and his head drooped onto his shoulder as winky wailed and sobbed at his side 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the goblet of fire 
 

lionfish nov chapter beyond the veilcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 black shapes were emerging out of thin air all around them blocking their way left and right eyes glinted through slits in hoods a dozen lit wand tips were pointing directly at their hearts ginny gave a gasp of horror 
 
 to me potter repeated the drawling voice of lucius malfoy as he held out his hand palm up 
 
 insides plummeted sickeningly they were trapped and outnumbered two to one 
 
 to me said malfoy yet again 
 
 sirius harry said 
 
 several of the death eaters laughed a harsh female voice from the midst of the shadowy figures to left said triumphantly the dark lord always knows 
 
 always echoed malfoy softly now give me the prophecy potter 
 
 i want to know where sirius is 
 
 i want to know where sirius is mimicked the woman to his left 
 
 she and her fellow death eaters had closed in so that they were mere feet away from harry and the others the light from their wands dazzling eyes 
 
 got him said harry ignoring the rising panic in his chest the dread he had been fighting since they had first entered the row here i know he is 
 
 the little baby woke up fwightened and fort what it dweamed was twoo said the woman in a horrible mock baby voice harry felt ron stir beside him 
 
 do anything harry muttered not yet 
 
 the woman who had mimicked him let out a raucous scream of laughter 
 
 you hear him you hear instructions to the other children as though he thinks of fighting us 
 
 oh you know potter as i do bellatrix said malfoy softly he has a great weakness for heroics the dark lord understands this about him now give me the prophecy potter 
 
 i know sirius is here said harry though panic was causing his chest to constrict and he felt as though he could not breathe properly i know got him 
 
 more of the death eaters laughed though the woman laughed loudest of all 
 
 time you learned the difference between life and dreams potter said malfoy now give me the prophecy or we start using wands 
 
 go on then said harry raising his own wand to chest height as he did so the five wands of ron hermione neville ginny and luna rose on either side of him the knot in stomach tightened if sirius really was not here he had led his friends to their deaths for no reason at all 
 
 but the death eaters did not strike 
 
 hand over the prophecy and no one need get hurt said malfoy coolly 
 
 it was turn to laugh 
 
 yeah right he said i give you thisprophecy is it and just let us skip off home will you 
 
 the words were hardly out of his mouth when the female death eater shrieked accio proph 
 
 harry was just ready for her he shouted protego before she had finished her spell and though the glass sphere slipped to the tips of his fingers he managed to cling on to it 
 
 oh he knows how to play little bitty baby potter she said her mad eyes staring through the slits in her hood very well then 
 
 i told you no lucius malfoy roared at the woman if you smash it 
 
 mind was racing the death eaters wanted this dusty sphere he had no interest in it he just wanted to get them all out of this alive to make sure none of his friends paid a terrible price for his stupidity 
 
 the woman stepped forward away from her fellows and pulled off her hood azkaban had hollowed bellatrix face making it gaunt and but it was alive with a feverish fanatical glow 
 
 you need more persuasion she said her chest rising and falling rapidly very welltake the smallest one she ordered the death eaters beside her let him watch while we torture the little girl do it 
 
 harry felt the others close in around ginny he stepped sideways so that he was right in front of her the prophecy held up to his chest 
 
 have to smash this if you want to attack any of us he told bellatrix i think your boss will be too pleased if you come back without it will he 
 
 she did not move she merely stared at him the tip of her tongue moistening her thin mouth 
 
 so said harry what kind of prophecy are we talking about anyway 
 
 he could not think what to do but to keep talking arm was pressed against his and he could feel him shaking he could feel one of the others quickened breath on the back of his head he was hoping they were all thinking hard about ways to get out of this because his mind was blank 
 
 what kind of prophecy repeated bellatrix the grin fading from her face you jest harry potter 
 
 nope not jesting said harry his eyes flicking from death eater to death eater looking for a weak link a space through which they could escape how come voldemort wants it 
 
 several of the death eaters let out low hisses 
 
 you dare speak his name whispered bellatrix 
 
 yeah said harry maintaining his tight grip on the glass ball expecting another attempt to bewitch it from him yeah got no problem with saying vol 
 
 shut your mouth bellatrix shrieked you dare speak his name with your unworthy lips you dare besmirch it with your tongue you dare 
 
 did you know a too said harry recklessly hermione gave a little moan in his ear voldemort yeah his mother was a witch but his dad was a muggleor has he been telling you lot 
 
 stupef 
 
 no 
 
 a jet of red light had shot from the end of bellatrix wand but malfoy had deflected it his spell caused hers to hit the shelf a foot to the left of harry and several of the glass orbs there shattered 
 
 two figures as ghosts fluid as smoke unfurled themselves from the fragments of broken glass upon the floor and each began to speak their voices vied with each other so that only fragments of what they were saying could be heard over malfoy and shouts 
 
 at the solstice will come a new said the figure of an old bearded man 
 
 do not attack we need the prophecy 
 
 he daredhe dares shrieked bellatrix incoherently he stands therefilthy 
 
 wait got the prophecy bawled malfoy 
 
 and none will come after said the figure of a young woman 
 
 the two figures that had burst from the shattered spheres had melted into thin air nothing remained of them or their erstwhile homes but fragments of glass upon the floor they had however given harry an idea the problem was going to be conveying it to the others 
 
 you told me so special about this prophecy supposed to be handing over he said playing for time he moved his foot slowly sideways feeling around for someone 
 
 do not play games with us potter said malfoy 
 
 not playing games said harry half his mind on the conversation half on his wandering foot and then he found toes and pressed down upon them a sharp intake of breath behind him told him they were 
 
 what she whispered 
 
 dumbledore never told you the reason you bear that scar was hidden in the bowels of the department of mysteries malfoy sneered 
 
 iwhat said harry and for a moment he quite forgot his plan what about my scar 
 
 what whispered hermione more urgently behind him 
 
 can this be said malfoy sounding maliciously delighted some of the death eaters were laughing again and under cover of their laughter harry hissed to hermione moving his lips as little as possible smash shelves 
 
 dumbledore never told you malfoy repeated well this explains why you come earlier potter the dark lord wondered why 
 
 when i say now 
 
 you come running when he showed you the place where it was hidden in your dreams he thought natural curiosity would make you want to hear the exact wording 
 
 did he said harry behind him he felt rather than heard hermione passing his message to the others and he sought to keep talking to distract the death eaters so he wanted me to come and get it did he why 
 
 why malfoy sounded incredulously delighted because the only people who are permitted to retrieve a prophecy from the department of mysteries potter are those about whom it was made as the dark lord discovered when he attempted to use others to steal it for him 
 
 and why did he want to steal a prophecy about me 
 
 about both of you potter about both of you you ever wondered why the dark lord tried to kill you as a baby 
 
 harry stared into the slitted through which grey eyes were gleaming was this prophecy the reason parents had died the reason he carried his scar was the answer to all of this clutched in his hand 
 
 someone made a prophecy about voldemort and me he said quietly gazing at lucius malfoy his fingers tightening over the warm glass sphere in his hand it was hardly larger than a snitch and still gritty with dust and made me come and get it for him why he come and get it himself 
 
 get it himself shrieked bellatrix over a cackle of mad laughter 
 
 the dark lord walk into the ministry of magic when they are so sweetly ignoring his return the dark lord reveal himself to the aurors when at the moment they are wasting their time on my dear cousin 
 
 so got you doing his dirty work for him has he said harry like he tried to get sturgis to steal itand bode 
 
 very good potter very good said malfoy slowly but the dark lord knows you are not unintell 
 
 now yelled harry 
 
 five different voices behind him bellowed reducto five curses flew in five different directions and the shelves opposite them exploded as they hit the towering structure swayed as a hundred glass spheres burst apart figures unfurled into the air and floated there their voices echoing from who knew what past amid the torrent of crashing glass and splintered wood now raining down upon the floor 
 
 run harry yelled as the shelves swayed precariously and more glass spheres began to fall from above he seized a handful of robes and dragged her forwards holding one arm over his head as chunks of shelf and shards of glass thundered down upon them a death eater lunged forwards through the cloud of dust and harry elbowed him hard in the masked face they were all yelling there were cries of pain and thunderous crashes as the shelves collapsed upon themselves weirdly echoing fragments of the seers unleashed from their spheres 
 
 harry found the way ahead clear and saw ron ginny and luna sprint past him their arms over their heads something heavy struck him on the side of the face but he merely ducked his head and sprinted onwards a hand caught him by the shoulder he heard hermione shout stupefy the hand released him at once 
 
 they were at the end of row harry turned right and began to sprint in earnest he could hear footsteps right behind him and voice urging neville on straight ahead the door through which they had come was ajar harry could see the glittering light of the bell jar he pelted through the doorway the prophecy still clutched tight and safe in his hand and waited for the others to hurtle over the threshold before slamming the door behind them 
 
 colloportus gasped hermione and the door sealed itself with an odd squelching noise 
 
 wherewhere are the others gasped harry 
 
 he had thought ron luna and ginny were ahead of them that they would be waiting in this room but there was nobody there 
 
 they must have gone the wrong way whispered hermione terror in her face 
 
 listen whispered neville 
 
 footsteps and shouts echoed from behind the door they had just sealed harry put his ear close to the door to listen and heard lucius malfoy roar leave nott leave him i say his injuries will be nothing to the dark lord compared to losing that prophecy jugson come back here we need to organise split into pairs and search and forget be gentle with potter until got the prophecy you can kill the others if necessarybellatrix rodolphus you take the left crabbe rabastan go rightjugson dolohov the door straight aheadmacnair and avery through hererookwood over there mulciber come with me 
 
 what do we do hermione asked harry trembling from head to foot 
 
 well we stand here waiting for them to find us for a start said harry get away from this door 
 
 they ran as quietly as they could past the shimmering bell jar where the tiny egg was hatching and unhatching towards the exit into the circular hallway at the far end of the room they were almost there when harry heard something large and heavy collide with the door hermione had charmed shut 
 
 stand aside said a rough voice alohomora 
 
 as the door flew open harry hermione and neville dived under desks they could see the bottom of the two death eaters robes drawing nearer their feet moving rapidly 
 
 they run straight through to the hall said the rough voice 
 
 check under the desks said another 
 
 harry saw the knees of the death eaters bend poking his wand out from under the desk he shouted stupefy 
 
 a jet of red light hit the nearest death eater he fell backwards into a grandfather clock and knocked it over the second death eater however had leapt aside to avoid spell and was pointing his own wand at hermione who was crawling out from under the desk to get a better aim 
 
 avada 
 
 harry launched himself across the floor and grabbed the death eater around the knees causing him to topple and his aim to go awry neville overturned a desk in his anxiety to help and pointing his wand wildly at the struggling pair he cried 
 
 expelliarmus 
 
 both and the death wands flew out of their hands and soared back towards the entrance to the hall of prophecy both scrambled to their feet and charged after them the death eater in front harry hot on his heels and neville bringing up the rear plainly horrorstruck by what he had done 
 
 get out of the way harry yelled neville clearly determined to repair the damage 
 
 harry flung himself sideways as neville took aim again and shouted 
 
 stupefy 
 
 the jet of red light flew right over the death eaters shoulder and hit a cabinet on the wall full of variously shaped the cabinet fell to the floor and burst apart glass flying everywhere sprang back up on to the wall fully mended then fell down again and shattered 
 
 the death eater had snatched up his wand which lay on the floor beside the glittering bell jar harry ducked down behind another desk as the man turned his mask had slipped so that he see he ripped it off with his free hand and shouted stup 
 
 stupefy screamed hermione who had just caught up with them the jet of red light hit the death eater in the middle of his chest he froze his arm still raised his wand fell to the floor with a flatter and he collapsed backwards towards the bell jar harry expected to hear a clunk for the man to hit solid glass and slide off the jar on to the floor but instead his head sank through the surface of the bell jar as though it were nothing but a soap bubble and he came to rest sprawled on his back on the table with his head lying inside the jar full of glittering wind 
 
 accio wand cried hermione wand flew from a dark corner into her hand and she threw it to him 
 
 thanks he said right get out of 
 
 look out said neville horrified he was staring at the death head in the bell jar 
 
 all three of them raised their wands again but none of them struck they were all gazing appalled at what was happening to the head 
 
 it was shrinking very fast growing balder and balder the black hair and stubble retracting into his skull his cheeks becoming smooth his skull round and covered with a peachlike fuzz 
 
 a head now sat grotesquely on top of the thick muscled neck of the death eater as he struggled to get up again but even as they watched their mouths open the head began to swell to its previous proportions again thick black hair was sprouting from the pate and chin 
 
 time said hermione in an awestruck voice time 
 
 the death eater shook his ugly head again trying to clear it but before he could pull himself together it began to shrink back to babyhood once more 
 
 there was a shout from a room nearby then a crash and a scream 
 
 ron harry yelled turning quickly from the monstrous transformation taking place before them ginny luna 
 
 harry hermione screamed 
 
 the death eater had pulled his head out of the bell jar his appearance was utterly bizarre his tiny head bawling loudly while his thick arms flailed dangerously in all directions narrowly missing harry who had ducked harry raised his wand but to his amazement hermione seized his arm 
 
 you hurt a baby 
 
 there was no time to argue the point harry could hear more footsteps growing louder from the hall of prophecy and knew too late that he ought not to have shouted and given away their position 
 
 come on he said and leaving the ugly death eater staggering behind them they took off for the door that stood open at the other end of the room leading back into the black hallway 
 
 they had run halfway towards it when harry saw through the open door two more death eaters running across the black room towards them veering left he burst instead into a small dark cluttered office and slammed the door behind them 
 
 collo began hermione but before she could complete the spell the door had burst open and the two death eaters had come hurtling inside 
 
 with a cry of triumph both yelled 
 
 impedimenta 
 
 harry hermione and neville were all knocked backwards off their feet neville was thrown over the desk and disappeared from view hermione smashed into a bookcase and was promptly deluged in a cascade of heavy books the back of head slammed into the stone wall behind him tiny lights burst in front of his eyes and for a moment he was too dizzy and bewildered to react 
 
 got him yelled the death eater nearest harry in an office off 
 
 silencio cried hermione and the voice was extinguished he continued to mouth through the hole in his mask but no sound came out he was thrust aside by his fellow death eater 
 
 petrificus totalus shouted harry as the second death eater raised his wand his arms and legs snapped together and he fell forwards face down on to the rug at feet stiff as a board and unable to move 
 
 well done ha 
 
 but the death eater hermione had just struck dumb made a sudden slashing movement with his wand a streak of what looked like purple flame passed right across chest she gave a tiny oh as though of surprise and crumpled on to the floor where she lay motionless 
 
 hermione 
 
 harry fell to his knees beside her as neville crawled rapidly towards her from under the desk his wand held up in front of him the death eater kicked out hard at head as he emergedhis foot broke wand in two and connected with his face neville gave a howl of pain and recoiled clutching his mouth and nose harry twisted around his own wand held high and saw that the death eater had ripped off his mask and was pointing his wand directly at harry who recognised the long pale twisted face from the daily dolohov the wizard who had murdered the prewetts 
 
 dolohov grinned with his free hand he pointed from the prophecy still clutched in hand to himself then at hermione though he could no longer speak his meaning could not have been clearer give me the prophecy or you get the same as her 
 
 like you kill us all anyway the moment i hand it over said harry 
 
 a whine of panic inside his head was preventing him thinking properly he had one hand on shoulder which was still warm yet did not dare look at her properly let her be dead let her be dead my fault if dead 
 
 whaddever you do harry said neville fiercely from under the desk lowering his hands to show a clearly broken nose and blood pouring down his mouth and chin gib it to him 
 
 then there was a crash outside the door and dolohov looked over his shoulderthe death eater had appeared in the doorway his head bawling his great fists still flailing uncontrollably at everything around him harry seized his chance 
 
 petrificus totalus 
 
 the spell hit dolohov before he could block it and he toppled forwards across his comrade both of them rigid as boards and unable to move an inch 
 
 hermione harry said at once shaking her as the death eater blundered out of sight again hermione wake up 
 
 whaddid he do to her said neville crawling out from under the desk to kneel at her other side blood streaming from his rapidly swelling nose 
 
 i dunno 
 
 neville groped for wrist 
 
 a pulse harry sure id is 
 
 such a powerful wave of relief swept through harry that for a moment he felt 
 
 alive 
 
 yeah i dink so 
 
 there was a pause in which harry listened hard for the sound of more footsteps but all he could hear were the whimpers and blunderings of the death eater in the next room 
 
 neville not far from the exit harry whispered right next to that circular room if we can just get you across it and find the right door before any more death eaters come bet you can get hermione up the corridor and into the lift then you could find someone raise the alarm 
 
 and whad are you going do do said neville mopping his bleeding nose with his sleeve and frowning at harry 
 
 got to find the others said harry 
 
 well going do find dem wid you said neville firmly 
 
 but hermione 
 
 dake her wid us said neville firmly carry bedder at fighding dem dan i ab 
 
 he stood up and seized one of arms glaring at harry who hesitated then grabbed the other and helped hoist limp form over shoulders 
 
 wait said harry snatching up wand from the floor and shoving it into hand better take this 
 
 neville kicked aside the broken fragments of his own wand as they walked slowly towards the door 
 
 my going do kill be said neville thickly blood spattering from his nose as he spoke dat was by old wand 
 
 harry stuck his head out of the door and looked around cautiously the death eater was screaming and banging into things toppling grandfather clocks and overturning desks bawling and confused while the cabinet that harry now suspected had contained continued to fall shatter and repair itself on the wall behind them 
 
 never going to notice us he whispered keep close behind me 
 
 they crept out of the office and back towards the door into the black hallway which now seemed completely deserted they walked a few steps forwards neville tottering slightly due to weight the door of the time room swung shut behind them and the walls began to rotate once more the recent blow on the back of head seemed to have unsteadied him he narrowed his eyes swaying slightly until the walls stopped moving again with a sinking heart harry saw that fiery crosses had faded from the doors 
 
 so which way reck 
 
 but before they could make a decision as to which way to try a door to their right sprang open and three people fell out of it 
 
 ron croaked harry dashing towards them ginnyare you all 
 
 harry said ron giggling weakly lurching forwards seizing the front of robes and gazing at him with unfocused eyes there you are ha ha ha you look funny harry all messed up 
 
 face was very white and something dark was trickling from the corner of his mouth next moment his knees had given way but he still clutched the front of robes so that harry was pulled into a kind of bow 
 
 ginny harry said fearfully what happened 
 
 but ginny shook her head and slid down the wall into a sitting position panting and holding her ankle 
 
 i think her broken i heard something crack whispered luna who was bending over her and who alone seemed to be unhurt four of them chased us into a dark room full of planets it was a very odd place some of the time we were just floating in the dark 
 
 harry we saw uranus up close said ron still giggling feebly get it harry we saw uranusha ha ha 
 
 a bubble of blood grew at the corner of mouth and burst 
 
 anyway one of them grabbed foot i used the reductor curse and blew up pluto in his face but 
 
 luna gestured hopelessly at ginny who was breathing in a very shallow way her eyes still closed 
 
 and what about ron said harry fearfully as ron continued to giggle still hanging off the front of robes 
 
 i know what they hit him with said luna sadly but gone a bit funny i could hardly get him along at all 
 
 harry said ron pulling ear down to his mouth and still giggling weakly you know who this girl is harry loony loony lovegood ha ha ha 
 
 got to get out of here said harry firmly luna can you help ginny 
 
 yes said luna sticking her wand behind her ear for safekeeping then putting an arm around waist and pulling her up 
 
 only my ankle i can do it myself said ginny impatiently but next moment she had collapsed sideways and grabbed luna for support harry pulled arm over his shoulder just as so many months ago he had pulled he looked around they had a one in twelve chance of getting the exit right first time 
 
 he heaved ron towards a door they were within a few feet of it when another door across the hall burst open and three death eaters sped in led by bellatrix lestrange 
 
 there they are she shrieked 
 
 stunning spells shot across the room harry smashed his way through the door ahead flung ron unceremoniously from him and ducked back to help neville in with hermione they were all over the threshold just in time to slam the door against bellatrix 
 
 colloportus shouted harry and he heard three bodies slam into the door on the other side 
 
 it matter said a voice there are other ways got them here 
 
 harry span around they were back in the brain room and sure enough there were doors all around the walls he could hear footsteps in the hall behind them as more death eaters came running to join the first 
 
 lunaneville help me 
 
 the three of them tore around the room sealing the doors as they went harry crashed into a tbale and rolled over the top of it in his haste to reach the next door 
 
 colloportus 
 
 there were footsteps running along behind the doors every now and then another heavy body would launch itself against one so it creaked and shuddered luna and neville were bewitching the doors along the opposite wallthen as harry reached the very top of the room he heard luna cry 
 
 colloaaaaaaaaargh 
 
 he turned in time to see her flying through the air five death eaters were surging into the room through the door she had not reached in time luna hit a desk slid over its surface and on to the floor on the other side where she lay sprawled as still as hermione 
 
 get potter shrieked bellatrix and she ran at him he dodged her and sprinted back up the room he was safe as long as they thought they might hit the prophecy 
 
 hey said ron who had staggered to his feet and was now tottering drunkenly towards harry giggling hey harry there are brains in here ha ha ha that weird harry 
 
 ron get out of the way get down 
 
 but ron had already pointed his wand at the tank 
 
 honest harry brainslookaccio brain 
 
 the scene seemed momentarily frozen harry ginny and neville and each of the death eaters turned in spite of themselves to watch the top of the tank as a brain burst from the green liquid like a leaping fish for a moment it seemed suspended in midair then it soared towards ron spinning as it came and what looked like ribbons of moving images flew from it unravelling like rolls of film 
 
 ha ha ha harry look at it said ron watching it disgorge its gaudy innards harry come and touch it bet weird 
 
 ron no 
 
 harry did not know what would happen if ron touched the tentacles of thought now flying behind the brain but he was sure it would not be anything good he darted forwards but ron had already caught the brain in his outstretched hands 
 
 the moment they made contact with his skin the tentacles began wrapping themselves around arms like ropes 
 
 harry look happennonoi like itno stopstop 
 
 but the thin ribbons were spinning around chest now he tugged and tore at them as the brain was pulled tight against him like an body 
 
 diffindo yelled harry trying to sever the feelers wrapping themselves tightly around ron before his eyes but they would not break ron fell over still thrashing against his bonds 
 
 harry suffocate him screamed ginny immobilised by her broken ankle on the floor then a jet of red light flew from one of the death wands and hit her squarely in the face she keeled over sideways and lay there unconscious 
 
 stubefy shouted neville wheeling around and waving wand at the oncoming death eaters stubefy stubefy 
 
 but nothing happened 
 
 one of the death eaters shot their own stunning spell at neville it missed him by inches harry and neville were now the only two left fighting the five death eaters two of whom sent off streams of silver light like arrows which missed but left craters in the wall behind them harry ran for it as bellatrix lestrange raced right at him holding the prophecy high above his head he sprinted back up the room all he could think of doing was to draw the death eaters away from the others 
 
 it seemed to have worked they streaked after him knocking chairs and tables flying but not daring to bewitch him in case they hurt the prophecy and he dashed through the only door still open the one through which the death eaters themselves had come inwardly praying that neville would stay with ron and find some way of releasing him he ran a few feet into the new room and felt the floor vanish 
 
 he was falling down steep stone step after steep stone step bouncing on every tier until at last with a crash that knocked all the breath out of his body he landed flat on his back in the sunken pit where the stone archway stood on its dais the whole room was ringing with the death laughter he looked up and saw the five who had been in the brain room descending towards him while as many more emerged through other doorways and began leaping from bench to bench towards him harry got to his feet though his legs were trembling so badly they barely supported him the prophecy was still miraculously unbroken in his left hand his wand clutched tightly in his right he backed away looking around trying to keep all the death eaters within his sight the back of his legs hit something solid he had reached the dais where the archway stood he climbed backwards onto it 
 
 the death eaters all halted gazing at him some were panting as hard as he was one was bleeding badly dolohov freed of the curse was leering his wand pointing straight at face 
 
 potter your race is run drawled lucius malfoy pulling off his mask now hand me the prophecy like a good boy 
 
 letlet the others go and give it to you said harry desperately 
 
 a few of the death eaters laughed 
 
 you are not in a position to bargain potter said lucius malfoy his pale face flushed with pleasure you see there are ten of us and only one of you or dumbledore ever taught you how to count 
 
 dot alone shouted a voice from above them still god be 
 
 heart sank neville was scrambling down the stone benches towards them wand held fast in his trembling hand 
 
 nevilleno go back to ron 
 
 stubefy neville shouted again pointing his wand at each death eater in turn stubefy stube 
 
 one of the largest death eaters seized neville from behind pinioning his arms to his sides he struggled and kicked several of the death eaters laughed 
 
 longbottom it sneered lucius malfoy well your grandmother is used to losing family members to our cause your death will not come as a great shock 
 
 longbottom repeated bellatrix and a truly evil smile lit her gaunt face why i have had the pleasure of meeting your parents boy 
 
 i doe you hab roared neville and he fought so hard against his encircling grip that the death eater shouted someone stun him 
 
 no no no said bellatrix she looked transported alive with excitement as she glanced at harry then back at neville no see how long longbottom lasts before he cracks like his parents unless potter wants to give us the prophecy 
 
 gib id do dem roared neville who seemed beside himself kicking and writhing as bellatrix drew nearer to him and his captor her wand raised gib id do dem harry 
 
 bellatrix raised her wand crucio 
 
 neville screamed his legs drawn up to his chest so that the death eater holding him was momentarily holding him off the ground the death eater dropped him and he fell to the floor twitching and screaming in agony 
 
 that was just a taster said bellatrix raising her wand so that screams stopped and he lay sobbing at her feet she turned and gazed up at harry now potter either give us the prophecy or watch your little friend die the hard way 
 
 harry did not have to think there was no choice the prophecy was hot with the heat of his clutching hand as he held it out malfoy jumped forwards to take it 
 
 then high above them two more doors burst open and five more people sprinted into the room sirius lupin moody tonks and kingsley 
 
 malfoy turned and raised his wand but tonks had already sent a stunning spell right at him harry did not wait to see whether it had made contact but dived off the dais out of the way the death eaters were completely distracted by the appearance of the members of the order who were now raining spells down upon them as they jumped from step to step towards the sunken floor through the darting bodies the flashes of light harry could see neville crawling along he dodged another jet of red light and flung himself flat on the ground to reach neville 
 
 are you ok he yelled as another spell soared inches over their heads 
 
 yes said neville trying to pull himself up 
 
 and ron 
 
 i dink all righdhe was still fighding de brain when i lefd 
 
 the stone floor between them exploded as a spell hit it leaving a crater right where hand had been only seconds before both scrambled away from the spot then a thick arm came out of nowhere seized harry around the neck and pulled him upright so that his toes were barely touching the floor 
 
 give it to me growled a voice in his ear give me the prophecy 
 
 the man was pressing so tightly on windpipe that he could not breathe through watering eyes he saw sirius duelling with a death eater some ten feet away kingsley was fighting two at once tonks still halfway up the tiered seats was firing spells down at bellatrixnobody seemed to realise that harry was dying he turned his wand backwards towards the side but had no breath to utter an incantation and the free hand was groping towards the hand in which harry was grasping the prophecy 
 
 aargh 
 
 neville had come lunging out of nowhere unable to articulate a spell he had jabbed wand hard into the eyehole of the death mask the man relinquished harry at once with a howl of pain harry whirled around to face him and gasped 
 
 stupefy 
 
 the death eater keeled over backwards and his mask slipped off it was macnair killer one of his eyes now swollen and bloodshot 
 
 thanks harry said to neville pulling him aside as sirius and his death eater lurched past duelling so fiercely that their wands were blurs then foot made contact with something round and hard and he slipped for a moment he thought he had dropped the prophecy but then he saw magical eye spinning away across the floor 
 
 its owner was lying on his side bleeding from the head and his attacker was now bearing down upon harry and neville dolohov his long pale face twisted with glee 
 
 tarantallegra he shouted his wand pointing at neville whose legs went immediately into a kind of frenzied unbalancing him and causing him to fall to the floor again now potter 
 
 he made the same slashing movement with his wand that he had used on hermione just as harry yelled protego 
 
 harry felt something streak across his face like a blunt knife the force of it knocked him sideways and he fell over jerking legs but the shield charm had stopped the worst of the spell 
 
 dolohov raised his wand again accio proph 
 
 sirius had hurtled out of nowhere rammed dolohov with his shoulder and sent him flying out of the way the prophecy had again flown to the tips of fingers but he had managed to cling on to it now sirius and dolohov were duelling their wands flashing like swords sparks flying from their 
 
 dolohov drew back his wand to make the same slashing movement he had used on harry and hermione springing up harry yelled petrificus totalus once again arms and legs snapped together and he keeled over backwards landing with a crash on his back 
 
 nice one shouted sirius forcing head down as a pair of stunning spells flew towards them now i want you to get out of 
 
 they both ducked again a jet of green light had narrowly missed sirius across the room harry saw tonks fall from halfway up the stone steps her limp form toppling from stone seat to stone seat and bellatrix triumphant running back towards the fray 
 
 harry take the prophecy grab neville and run sirius yelled dashing to meet bellatrix harry did not see what happened next kingsley swayed across his field of vision battling with the pockmarked and no longer masked rookwood another jet of green light flew over head as he launched himself towards neville 
 
 can you stand he bellowed in ear as legs jerked and twitched uncontrollably put your arm round my neck 
 
 neville did so harry legs were still lying in every direction they would not support him and then out of nowhere a man lunged at them both fell backwards legs waving wildly like an overturned harry with his left arm held up in the air to try to save the small glass ball from being smashed 
 
 the prophecy give me the prophecy potter snarled lucus voice in his ear and harry felt the tip of wand pressing hard between his ribs 
 
 nogetoff me nevillecatch it 
 
 harry flung the prophecy across the floor neville span himself around on his back and scooped the ball to his chest malfoy pointed the wand instead at neville but harry jabbed his own wand back over his shoulder and yelled impedimenta 
 
 malfoy was blasted off his back as harry scrambled up again he looked around and saw malfoy smash into the dais on which sirius and bellatrix were now duelling malfoy aimed his wand at harry and neville again but before he could draw breath to strike lupin had jumped between them 
 
 harry round up the others and go 
 
 harry seized neville by the shoulder of his robes and lifted him bodily on to the first tier of stone steps legs twitched and jerked and would not support his weight harry heaved again with all the strength he possessed and they climbed another step 
 
 a spell hit the stone bench at heel it crumbled away and he fell back to the step below neville sank to the ground his legs still jerking and thrashing and he thrust the prophecy into his pocket 
 
 come on said harry desperately hauling at robes just try and push with your legs 
 
 he gave another stupendous heave and robes tore all along the left seamthe small ball dropped from his pocket and before either of them could catch it one of floundering feet kicked it it flew some ten feet to their right and smashed on the step beneath them as both of them stared at the place where it had broken appalled at what had happened a figure with hugely magnified eyes rose into the air unnoticed by any but them harry could see its mouth moving but in all the crashes and screams and yells surrounding them not one word of the prophecy could he hear the figure stopped speaking and dissolved into nothingness 
 
 harry sorry cried neville his face anguished as his legs continued to flounder so sorry harry i bean do 
 
 it matter harry shouted just try and stand get out of 
 
 dubbledore said neville his sweaty face suddenly transported staring over shoulder 
 
 what 
 
 dubbledore 
 
 harry turned to look where neville was staring directly above them framed in the doorway from the brain room stood albus dumbledore his wand aloft his face white and furious harry felt a kind of electric charge surge through every particle of his bodythey were saved 
 
 dumbledore sped down the steps past neville and harry who had no more thoughts of leaving dumbledore was already at the foot of the steps when the death eaters nearest realised he was there and yelled to the others one of the death eaters ran for it scrabbling like a monkey up the stone steps opposite spell pulled him back as easily and effortlessly as though he had hooked him with an invisible line 
 
 only one pair was still battling apparently unaware of the new arrival harry saw sirius duck jet of red light he was laughing at her 
 
 come on you can do better than that he yelled his voice echoing around the cavernous room 
 
 the second jet of light hit him squarely on the chest 
 
 the laughter had not quite died from his face but his eyes widened in shock 
 
 harry released neville though he was unaware of doing so he was jumping down the steps again pulling out his wand as dumbledore too turned towards the dais 
 
 it seemed to take sirius an age to fall his body curved in a graceful arc as he sank backwards through the ragged veil hanging from the arch 
 
 harry saw the look of mingled fear and surprise on his wasted face as he fell through the ancient doorway and disappeared behind the veil which fluttered for a moment as though in a high wind then fell back into place 
 
 harry heard bellatrix triumphant scream but knew it meant nothingsirius had only just fallen through the archway he would reappear from the other side any second 
 
 but sirius did not reappear 
 
 sirius harry yelled sirius 
 
 he had reached the floor his breath coming in searing gasps sirius must be just behind the curtain he harry would pull him back out 
 
 but as he reached the ground and sprinted towards the dais lupin grabbed harry around the chest holding him back 
 
 nothing you can do harry 
 
 get him save him only just gone through 
 
 too late harry 
 
 we can still reach him harry struggled hard and viciously but lupin would not let go 
 
 nothing you can do harry nothing gone 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the order of the phoenix 
 

lionfish nov chapter beyond the veilcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 black shapes were emerging out of thin air all around them blocking their way left and right eyes glinted through slits in hoods a dozen lit wand tips were pointing directly at their hearts ginny gave a gasp of horror 
 
 to me potter repeated the drawling voice of lucius malfoy as he held out his hand palm up 
 
 insides plummeted sickeningly they were trapped and outnumbered two to one 
 
 to me said malfoy yet again 
 
 sirius harry said 
 
 several of the death eaters laughed a harsh female voice from the midst of the shadowy figures to left said triumphantly the dark lord always knows 
 
 always echoed malfoy softly now give me the prophecy potter 
 
 i want to know where sirius is 
 
 i want to know where sirius is mimicked the woman to his left 
 
 she and her fellow death eaters had closed in so that they were mere feet away from harry and the others the light from their wands dazzling eyes 
 
 got him said harry ignoring the rising panic in his chest the dread he had been fighting since they had first entered the row here i know he is 
 
 the little baby woke up fwightened and fort what it dweamed was twoo said the woman in a horrible mock baby voice harry felt ron stir beside him 
 
 do anything harry muttered not yet 
 
 the woman who had mimicked him let out a raucous scream of laughter 
 
 you hear him you hear instructions to the other children as though he thinks of fighting us 
 
 oh you know potter as i do bellatrix said malfoy softly he has a great weakness for heroics the dark lord understands this about him now give me the prophecy potter 
 
 i know sirius is here said harry though panic was causing his chest to constrict and he felt as though he could not breathe properly i know got him 
 
 more of the death eaters laughed though the woman laughed loudest of all 
 
 time you learned the difference between life and dreams potter said malfoy now give me the prophecy or we start using wands 
 
 go on then said harry raising his own wand to chest height as he did so the five wands of ron hermione neville ginny and luna rose on either side of him the knot in stomach tightened if sirius really was not here he had led his friends to their deaths for no reason at all 
 
 but the death eaters did not strike 
 
 hand over the prophecy and no one need get hurt said malfoy coolly 
 
 it was turn to laugh 
 
 yeah right he said i give you thisprophecy is it and just let us skip off home will you 
 
 the words were hardly out of his mouth when the female death eater shrieked accio proph 
 
 harry was just ready for her he shouted protego before she had finished her spell and though the glass sphere slipped to the tips of his fingers he managed to cling on to it 
 
 oh he knows how to play little bitty baby potter she said her mad eyes staring through the slits in her hood very well then 
 
 i told you no lucius malfoy roared at the woman if you smash it 
 
 mind was racing the death eaters wanted this dusty sphere he had no interest in it he just wanted to get them all out of this alive to make sure none of his friends paid a terrible price for his stupidity 
 
 the woman stepped forward away from her fellows and pulled off her hood azkaban had hollowed bellatrix face making it gaunt and but it was alive with a feverish fanatical glow 
 
 you need more persuasion she said her chest rising and falling rapidly very welltake the smallest one she ordered the death eaters beside her let him watch while we torture the little girl do it 
 
 harry felt the others close in around ginny he stepped sideways so that he was right in front of her the prophecy held up to his chest 
 
 have to smash this if you want to attack any of us he told bellatrix i think your boss will be too pleased if you come back without it will he 
 
 she did not move she merely stared at him the tip of her tongue moistening her thin mouth 
 
 so said harry what kind of prophecy are we talking about anyway 
 
 he could not think what to do but to keep talking arm was pressed against his and he could feel him shaking he could feel one of the others quickened breath on the back of his head he was hoping they were all thinking hard about ways to get out of this because his mind was blank 
 
 what kind of prophecy repeated bellatrix the grin fading from her face you jest harry potter 
 
 nope not jesting said harry his eyes flicking from death eater to death eater looking for a weak link a space through which they could escape how come voldemort wants it 
 
 several of the death eaters let out low hisses 
 
 you dare speak his name whispered bellatrix 
 
 yeah said harry maintaining his tight grip on the glass ball expecting another attempt to bewitch it from him yeah got no problem with saying vol 
 
 shut your mouth bellatrix shrieked you dare speak his name with your unworthy lips you dare besmirch it with your tongue you dare 
 
 did you know a too said harry recklessly hermione gave a little moan in his ear voldemort yeah his mother was a witch but his dad was a muggleor has he been telling you lot 
 
 stupef 
 
 no 
 
 a jet of red light had shot from the end of bellatrix wand but malfoy had deflected it his spell caused hers to hit the shelf a foot to the left of harry and several of the glass orbs there shattered 
 
 two figures as ghosts fluid as smoke unfurled themselves from the fragments of broken glass upon the floor and each began to speak their voices vied with each other so that only fragments of what they were saying could be heard over malfoy and shouts 
 
 at the solstice will come a new said the figure of an old bearded man 
 
 do not attack we need the prophecy 
 
 he daredhe dares shrieked bellatrix incoherently he stands therefilthy 
 
 wait got the prophecy bawled malfoy 
 
 and none will come after said the figure of a young woman 
 
 the two figures that had burst from the shattered spheres had melted into thin air nothing remained of them or their erstwhile homes but fragments of glass upon the floor they had however given harry an idea the problem was going to be conveying it to the others 
 
 you told me so special about this prophecy supposed to be handing over he said playing for time he moved his foot slowly sideways feeling around for someone 
 
 do not play games with us potter said malfoy 
 
 not playing games said harry half his mind on the conversation half on his wandering foot and then he found toes and pressed down upon them a sharp intake of breath behind him told him they were 
 
 what she whispered 
 
 dumbledore never told you the reason you bear that scar was hidden in the bowels of the department of mysteries malfoy sneered 
 
 iwhat said harry and for a moment he quite forgot his plan what about my scar 
 
 what whispered hermione more urgently behind him 
 
 can this be said malfoy sounding maliciously delighted some of the death eaters were laughing again and under cover of their laughter harry hissed to hermione moving his lips as little as possible smash shelves 
 
 dumbledore never told you malfoy repeated well this explains why you come earlier potter the dark lord wondered why 
 
 when i say now 
 
 you come running when he showed you the place where it was hidden in your dreams he thought natural curiosity would make you want to hear the exact wording 
 
 did he said harry behind him he felt rather than heard hermione passing his message to the others and he sought to keep talking to distract the death eaters so he wanted me to come and get it did he why 
 
 why malfoy sounded incredulously delighted because the only people who are permitted to retrieve a prophecy from the department of mysteries potter are those about whom it was made as the dark lord discovered when he attempted to use others to steal it for him 
 
 and why did he want to steal a prophecy about me 
 
 about both of you potter about both of you you ever wondered why the dark lord tried to kill you as a baby 
 
 harry stared into the slitted through which grey eyes were gleaming was this prophecy the reason parents had died the reason he carried his scar was the answer to all of this clutched in his hand 
 
 someone made a prophecy about voldemort and me he said quietly gazing at lucius malfoy his fingers tightening over the warm glass sphere in his hand it was hardly larger than a snitch and still gritty with dust and made me come and get it for him why he come and get it himself 
 
 get it himself shrieked bellatrix over a cackle of mad laughter 
 
 the dark lord walk into the ministry of magic when they are so sweetly ignoring his return the dark lord reveal himself to the aurors when at the moment they are wasting their time on my dear cousin 
 
 so got you doing his dirty work for him has he said harry like he tried to get sturgis to steal itand bode 
 
 very good potter very good said malfoy slowly but the dark lord knows you are not unintell 
 
 now yelled harry 
 
 five different voices behind him bellowed reducto five curses flew in five different directions and the shelves opposite them exploded as they hit the towering structure swayed as a hundred glass spheres burst apart figures unfurled into the air and floated there their voices echoing from who knew what past amid the torrent of crashing glass and splintered wood now raining down upon the floor 
 
 run harry yelled as the shelves swayed precariously and more glass spheres began to fall from above he seized a handful of robes and dragged her forwards holding one arm over his head as chunks of shelf and shards of glass thundered down upon them a death eater lunged forwards through the cloud of dust and harry elbowed him hard in the masked face they were all yelling there were cries of pain and thunderous crashes as the shelves collapsed upon themselves weirdly echoing fragments of the seers unleashed from their spheres 
 
 harry found the way ahead clear and saw ron ginny and luna sprint past him their arms over their heads something heavy struck him on the side of the face but he merely ducked his head and sprinted onwards a hand caught him by the shoulder he heard hermione shout stupefy the hand released him at once 
 
 they were at the end of row harry turned right and began to sprint in earnest he could hear footsteps right behind him and voice urging neville on straight ahead the door through which they had come was ajar harry could see the glittering light of the bell jar he pelted through the doorway the prophecy still clutched tight and safe in his hand and waited for the others to hurtle over the threshold before slamming the door behind them 
 
 colloportus gasped hermione and the door sealed itself with an odd squelching noise 
 
 wherewhere are the others gasped harry 
 
 he had thought ron luna and ginny were ahead of them that they would be waiting in this room but there was nobody there 
 
 they must have gone the wrong way whispered hermione terror in her face 
 
 listen whispered neville 
 
 footsteps and shouts echoed from behind the door they had just sealed harry put his ear close to the door to listen and heard lucius malfoy roar leave nott leave him i say his injuries will be nothing to the dark lord compared to losing that prophecy jugson come back here we need to organise split into pairs and search and forget be gentle with potter until got the prophecy you can kill the others if necessarybellatrix rodolphus you take the left crabbe rabastan go rightjugson dolohov the door straight aheadmacnair and avery through hererookwood over there mulciber come with me 
 
 what do we do hermione asked harry trembling from head to foot 
 
 well we stand here waiting for them to find us for a start said harry get away from this door 
 
 they ran as quietly as they could past the shimmering bell jar where the tiny egg was hatching and unhatching towards the exit into the circular hallway at the far end of the room they were almost there when harry heard something large and heavy collide with the door hermione had charmed shut 
 
 stand aside said a rough voice alohomora 
 
 as the door flew open harry hermione and neville dived under desks they could see the bottom of the two death eaters robes drawing nearer their feet moving rapidly 
 
 they run straight through to the hall said the rough voice 
 
 check under the desks said another 
 
 harry saw the knees of the death eaters bend poking his wand out from under the desk he shouted stupefy 
 
 a jet of red light hit the nearest death eater he fell backwards into a grandfather clock and knocked it over the second death eater however had leapt aside to avoid spell and was pointing his own wand at hermione who was crawling out from under the desk to get a better aim 
 
 avada 
 
 harry launched himself across the floor and grabbed the death eater around the knees causing him to topple and his aim to go awry neville overturned a desk in his anxiety to help and pointing his wand wildly at the struggling pair he cried 
 
 expelliarmus 
 
 both and the death wands flew out of their hands and soared back towards the entrance to the hall of prophecy both scrambled to their feet and charged after them the death eater in front harry hot on his heels and neville bringing up the rear plainly horrorstruck by what he had done 
 
 get out of the way harry yelled neville clearly determined to repair the damage 
 
 harry flung himself sideways as neville took aim again and shouted 
 
 stupefy 
 
 the jet of red light flew right over the death eaters shoulder and hit a cabinet on the wall full of variously shaped the cabinet fell to the floor and burst apart glass flying everywhere sprang back up on to the wall fully mended then fell down again and shattered 
 
 the death eater had snatched up his wand which lay on the floor beside the glittering bell jar harry ducked down behind another desk as the man turned his mask had slipped so that he see he ripped it off with his free hand and shouted stup 
 
 stupefy screamed hermione who had just caught up with them the jet of red light hit the death eater in the middle of his chest he froze his arm still raised his wand fell to the floor with a flatter and he collapsed backwards towards the bell jar harry expected to hear a clunk for the man to hit solid glass and slide off the jar on to the floor but instead his head sank through the surface of the bell jar as though it were nothing but a soap bubble and he came to rest sprawled on his back on the table with his head lying inside the jar full of glittering wind 
 
 accio wand cried hermione wand flew from a dark corner into her hand and she threw it to him 
 
 thanks he said right get out of 
 
 look out said neville horrified he was staring at the death head in the bell jar 
 
 all three of them raised their wands again but none of them struck they were all gazing appalled at what was happening to the head 
 
 it was shrinking very fast growing balder and balder the black hair and stubble retracting into his skull his cheeks becoming smooth his skull round and covered with a peachlike fuzz 
 
 a head now sat grotesquely on top of the thick muscled neck of the death eater as he struggled to get up again but even as they watched their mouths open the head began to swell to its previous proportions again thick black hair was sprouting from the pate and chin 
 
 time said hermione in an awestruck voice time 
 
 the death eater shook his ugly head again trying to clear it but before he could pull himself together it began to shrink back to babyhood once more 
 
 there was a shout from a room nearby then a crash and a scream 
 
 ron harry yelled turning quickly from the monstrous transformation taking place before them ginny luna 
 
 harry hermione screamed 
 
 the death eater had pulled his head out of the bell jar his appearance was utterly bizarre his tiny head bawling loudly while his thick arms flailed dangerously in all directions narrowly missing harry who had ducked harry raised his wand but to his amazement hermione seized his arm 
 
 you hurt a baby 
 
 there was no time to argue the point harry could hear more footsteps growing louder from the hall of prophecy and knew too late that he ought not to have shouted and given away their position 
 
 come on he said and leaving the ugly death eater staggering behind them they took off for the door that stood open at the other end of the room leading back into the black hallway 
 
 they had run halfway towards it when harry saw through the open door two more death eaters running across the black room towards them veering left he burst instead into a small dark cluttered office and slammed the door behind them 
 
 collo began hermione but before she could complete the spell the door had burst open and the two death eaters had come hurtling inside 
 
 with a cry of triumph both yelled 
 
 impedimenta 
 
 harry hermione and neville were all knocked backwards off their feet neville was thrown over the desk and disappeared from view hermione smashed into a bookcase and was promptly deluged in a cascade of heavy books the back of head slammed into the stone wall behind him tiny lights burst in front of his eyes and for a moment he was too dizzy and bewildered to react 
 
 got him yelled the death eater nearest harry in an office off 
 
 silencio cried hermione and the voice was extinguished he continued to mouth through the hole in his mask but no sound came out he was thrust aside by his fellow death eater 
 
 petrificus totalus shouted harry as the second death eater raised his wand his arms and legs snapped together and he fell forwards face down on to the rug at feet stiff as a board and unable to move 
 
 well done ha 
 
 but the death eater hermione had just struck dumb made a sudden slashing movement with his wand a streak of what looked like purple flame passed right across chest she gave a tiny oh as though of surprise and crumpled on to the floor where she lay motionless 
 
 hermione 
 
 harry fell to his knees beside her as neville crawled rapidly towards her from under the desk his wand held up in front of him the death eater kicked out hard at head as he emergedhis foot broke wand in two and connected with his face neville gave a howl of pain and recoiled clutching his mouth and nose harry twisted around his own wand held high and saw that the death eater had ripped off his mask and was pointing his wand directly at harry who recognised the long pale twisted face from the daily dolohov the wizard who had murdered the prewetts 
 
 dolohov grinned with his free hand he pointed from the prophecy still clutched in hand to himself then at hermione though he could no longer speak his meaning could not have been clearer give me the prophecy or you get the same as her 
 
 like you kill us all anyway the moment i hand it over said harry 
 
 a whine of panic inside his head was preventing him thinking properly he had one hand on shoulder which was still warm yet did not dare look at her properly let her be dead let her be dead my fault if dead 
 
 whaddever you do harry said neville fiercely from under the desk lowering his hands to show a clearly broken nose and blood pouring down his mouth and chin gib it to him 
 
 then there was a crash outside the door and dolohov looked over his shoulderthe death eater had appeared in the doorway his head bawling his great fists still flailing uncontrollably at everything around him harry seized his chance 
 
 petrificus totalus 
 
 the spell hit dolohov before he could block it and he toppled forwards across his comrade both of them rigid as boards and unable to move an inch 
 
 hermione harry said at once shaking her as the death eater blundered out of sight again hermione wake up 
 
 whaddid he do to her said neville crawling out from under the desk to kneel at her other side blood streaming from his rapidly swelling nose 
 
 i dunno 
 
 neville groped for wrist 
 
 a pulse harry sure id is 
 
 such a powerful wave of relief swept through harry that for a moment he felt 
 
 alive 
 
 yeah i dink so 
 
 there was a pause in which harry listened hard for the sound of more footsteps but all he could hear were the whimpers and blunderings of the death eater in the next room 
 
 neville not far from the exit harry whispered right next to that circular room if we can just get you across it and find the right door before any more death eaters come bet you can get hermione up the corridor and into the lift then you could find someone raise the alarm 
 
 and whad are you going do do said neville mopping his bleeding nose with his sleeve and frowning at harry 
 
 got to find the others said harry 
 
 well going do find dem wid you said neville firmly 
 
 but hermione 
 
 dake her wid us said neville firmly carry bedder at fighding dem dan i ab 
 
 he stood up and seized one of arms glaring at harry who hesitated then grabbed the other and helped hoist limp form over shoulders 
 
 wait said harry snatching up wand from the floor and shoving it into hand better take this 
 
 neville kicked aside the broken fragments of his own wand as they walked slowly towards the door 
 
 my going do kill be said neville thickly blood spattering from his nose as he spoke dat was by old wand 
 
 harry stuck his head out of the door and looked around cautiously the death eater was screaming and banging into things toppling grandfather clocks and overturning desks bawling and confused while the cabinet that harry now suspected had contained continued to fall shatter and repair itself on the wall behind them 
 
 never going to notice us he whispered keep close behind me 
 
 they crept out of the office and back towards the door into the black hallway which now seemed completely deserted they walked a few steps forwards neville tottering slightly due to weight the door of the time room swung shut behind them and the walls began to rotate once more the recent blow on the back of head seemed to have unsteadied him he narrowed his eyes swaying slightly until the walls stopped moving again with a sinking heart harry saw that fiery crosses had faded from the doors 
 
 so which way reck 
 
 but before they could make a decision as to which way to try a door to their right sprang open and three people fell out of it 
 
 ron croaked harry dashing towards them ginnyare you all 
 
 harry said ron giggling weakly lurching forwards seizing the front of robes and gazing at him with unfocused eyes there you are ha ha ha you look funny harry all messed up 
 
 face was very white and something dark was trickling from the corner of his mouth next moment his knees had given way but he still clutched the front of robes so that harry was pulled into a kind of bow 
 
 ginny harry said fearfully what happened 
 
 but ginny shook her head and slid down the wall into a sitting position panting and holding her ankle 
 
 i think her broken i heard something crack whispered luna who was bending over her and who alone seemed to be unhurt four of them chased us into a dark room full of planets it was a very odd place some of the time we were just floating in the dark 
 
 harry we saw uranus up close said ron still giggling feebly get it harry we saw uranusha ha ha 
 
 a bubble of blood grew at the corner of mouth and burst 
 
 anyway one of them grabbed foot i used the reductor curse and blew up pluto in his face but 
 
 luna gestured hopelessly at ginny who was breathing in a very shallow way her eyes still closed 
 
 and what about ron said harry fearfully as ron continued to giggle still hanging off the front of robes 
 
 i know what they hit him with said luna sadly but gone a bit funny i could hardly get him along at all 
 
 harry said ron pulling ear down to his mouth and still giggling weakly you know who this girl is harry loony loony lovegood ha ha ha 
 
 got to get out of here said harry firmly luna can you help ginny 
 
 yes said luna sticking her wand behind her ear for safekeeping then putting an arm around waist and pulling her up 
 
 only my ankle i can do it myself said ginny impatiently but next moment she had collapsed sideways and grabbed luna for support harry pulled arm over his shoulder just as so many months ago he had pulled he looked around they had a one in twelve chance of getting the exit right first time 
 
 he heaved ron towards a door they were within a few feet of it when another door across the hall burst open and three death eaters sped in led by bellatrix lestrange 
 
 there they are she shrieked 
 
 stunning spells shot across the room harry smashed his way through the door ahead flung ron unceremoniously from him and ducked back to help neville in with hermione they were all over the threshold just in time to slam the door against bellatrix 
 
 colloportus shouted harry and he heard three bodies slam into the door on the other side 
 
 it matter said a voice there are other ways got them here 
 
 harry span around they were back in the brain room and sure enough there were doors all around the walls he could hear footsteps in the hall behind them as more death eaters came running to join the first 
 
 lunaneville help me 
 
 the three of them tore around the room sealing the doors as they went harry crashed into a tbale and rolled over the top of it in his haste to reach the next door 
 
 colloportus 
 
 there were footsteps running along behind the doors every now and then another heavy body would launch itself against one so it creaked and shuddered luna and neville were bewitching the doors along the opposite wallthen as harry reached the very top of the room he heard luna cry 
 
 colloaaaaaaaaargh 
 
 he turned in time to see her flying through the air five death eaters were surging into the room through the door she had not reached in time luna hit a desk slid over its surface and on to the floor on the other side where she lay sprawled as still as hermione 
 
 get potter shrieked bellatrix and she ran at him he dodged her and sprinted back up the room he was safe as long as they thought they might hit the prophecy 
 
 hey said ron who had staggered to his feet and was now tottering drunkenly towards harry giggling hey harry there are brains in here ha ha ha that weird harry 
 
 ron get out of the way get down 
 
 but ron had already pointed his wand at the tank 
 
 honest harry brainslookaccio brain 
 
 the scene seemed momentarily frozen harry ginny and neville and each of the death eaters turned in spite of themselves to watch the top of the tank as a brain burst from the green liquid like a leaping fish for a moment it seemed suspended in midair then it soared towards ron spinning as it came and what looked like ribbons of moving images flew from it unravelling like rolls of film 
 
 ha ha ha harry look at it said ron watching it disgorge its gaudy innards harry come and touch it bet weird 
 
 ron no 
 
 harry did not know what would happen if ron touched the tentacles of thought now flying behind the brain but he was sure it would not be anything good he darted forwards but ron had already caught the brain in his outstretched hands 
 
 the moment they made contact with his skin the tentacles began wrapping themselves around arms like ropes 
 
 harry look happennonoi like itno stopstop 
 
 but the thin ribbons were spinning around chest now he tugged and tore at them as the brain was pulled tight against him like an body 
 
 diffindo yelled harry trying to sever the feelers wrapping themselves tightly around ron before his eyes but they would not break ron fell over still thrashing against his bonds 
 
 harry suffocate him screamed ginny immobilised by her broken ankle on the floor then a jet of red light flew from one of the death wands and hit her squarely in the face she keeled over sideways and lay there unconscious 
 
 stubefy shouted neville wheeling around and waving wand at the oncoming death eaters stubefy stubefy 
 
 but nothing happened 
 
 one of the death eaters shot their own stunning spell at neville it missed him by inches harry and neville were now the only two left fighting the five death eaters two of whom sent off streams of silver light like arrows which missed but left craters in the wall behind them harry ran for it as bellatrix lestrange raced right at him holding the prophecy high above his head he sprinted back up the room all he could think of doing was to draw the death eaters away from the others 
 
 it seemed to have worked they streaked after him knocking chairs and tables flying but not daring to bewitch him in case they hurt the prophecy and he dashed through the only door still open the one through which the death eaters themselves had come inwardly praying that neville would stay with ron and find some way of releasing him he ran a few feet into the new room and felt the floor vanish 
 
 he was falling down steep stone step after steep stone step bouncing on every tier until at last with a crash that knocked all the breath out of his body he landed flat on his back in the sunken pit where the stone archway stood on its dais the whole room was ringing with the death laughter he looked up and saw the five who had been in the brain room descending towards him while as many more emerged through other doorways and began leaping from bench to bench towards him harry got to his feet though his legs were trembling so badly they barely supported him the prophecy was still miraculously unbroken in his left hand his wand clutched tightly in his right he backed away looking around trying to keep all the death eaters within his sight the back of his legs hit something solid he had reached the dais where the archway stood he climbed backwards onto it 
 
 the death eaters all halted gazing at him some were panting as hard as he was one was bleeding badly dolohov freed of the curse was leering his wand pointing straight at face 
 
 potter your race is run drawled lucius malfoy pulling off his mask now hand me the prophecy like a good boy 
 
 letlet the others go and give it to you said harry desperately 
 
 a few of the death eaters laughed 
 
 you are not in a position to bargain potter said lucius malfoy his pale face flushed with pleasure you see there are ten of us and only one of you or dumbledore ever taught you how to count 
 
 dot alone shouted a voice from above them still god be 
 
 heart sank neville was scrambling down the stone benches towards them wand held fast in his trembling hand 
 
 nevilleno go back to ron 
 
 stubefy neville shouted again pointing his wand at each death eater in turn stubefy stube 
 
 one of the largest death eaters seized neville from behind pinioning his arms to his sides he struggled and kicked several of the death eaters laughed 
 
 longbottom it sneered lucius malfoy well your grandmother is used to losing family members to our cause your death will not come as a great shock 
 
 longbottom repeated bellatrix and a truly evil smile lit her gaunt face why i have had the pleasure of meeting your parents boy 
 
 i doe you hab roared neville and he fought so hard against his encircling grip that the death eater shouted someone stun him 
 
 no no no said bellatrix she looked transported alive with excitement as she glanced at harry then back at neville no see how long longbottom lasts before he cracks like his parents unless potter wants to give us the prophecy 
 
 gib id do dem roared neville who seemed beside himself kicking and writhing as bellatrix drew nearer to him and his captor her wand raised gib id do dem harry 
 
 bellatrix raised her wand crucio 
 
 neville screamed his legs drawn up to his chest so that the death eater holding him was momentarily holding him off the ground the death eater dropped him and he fell to the floor twitching and screaming in agony 
 
 that was just a taster said bellatrix raising her wand so that screams stopped and he lay sobbing at her feet she turned and gazed up at harry now potter either give us the prophecy or watch your little friend die the hard way 
 
 harry did not have to think there was no choice the prophecy was hot with the heat of his clutching hand as he held it out malfoy jumped forwards to take it 
 
 then high above them two more doors burst open and five more people sprinted into the room sirius lupin moody tonks and kingsley 
 
 malfoy turned and raised his wand but tonks had already sent a stunning spell right at him harry did not wait to see whether it had made contact but dived off the dais out of the way the death eaters were completely distracted by the appearance of the members of the order who were now raining spells down upon them as they jumped from step to step towards the sunken floor through the darting bodies the flashes of light harry could see neville crawling along he dodged another jet of red light and flung himself flat on the ground to reach neville 
 
 are you ok he yelled as another spell soared inches over their heads 
 
 yes said neville trying to pull himself up 
 
 and ron 
 
 i dink all righdhe was still fighding de brain when i lefd 
 
 the stone floor between them exploded as a spell hit it leaving a crater right where hand had been only seconds before both scrambled away from the spot then a thick arm came out of nowhere seized harry around the neck and pulled him upright so that his toes were barely touching the floor 
 
 give it to me growled a voice in his ear give me the prophecy 
 
 the man was pressing so tightly on windpipe that he could not breathe through watering eyes he saw sirius duelling with a death eater some ten feet away kingsley was fighting two at once tonks still halfway up the tiered seats was firing spells down at bellatrixnobody seemed to realise that harry was dying he turned his wand backwards towards the side but had no breath to utter an incantation and the free hand was groping towards the hand in which harry was grasping the prophecy 
 
 aargh 
 
 neville had come lunging out of nowhere unable to articulate a spell he had jabbed wand hard into the eyehole of the death mask the man relinquished harry at once with a howl of pain harry whirled around to face him and gasped 
 
 stupefy 
 
 the death eater keeled over backwards and his mask slipped off it was macnair killer one of his eyes now swollen and bloodshot 
 
 thanks harry said to neville pulling him aside as sirius and his death eater lurched past duelling so fiercely that their wands were blurs then foot made contact with something round and hard and he slipped for a moment he thought he had dropped the prophecy but then he saw magical eye spinning away across the floor 
 
 its owner was lying on his side bleeding from the head and his attacker was now bearing down upon harry and neville dolohov his long pale face twisted with glee 
 
 tarantallegra he shouted his wand pointing at neville whose legs went immediately into a kind of frenzied unbalancing him and causing him to fall to the floor again now potter 
 
 he made the same slashing movement with his wand that he had used on hermione just as harry yelled protego 
 
 harry felt something streak across his face like a blunt knife the force of it knocked him sideways and he fell over jerking legs but the shield charm had stopped the worst of the spell 
 
 dolohov raised his wand again accio proph 
 
 sirius had hurtled out of nowhere rammed dolohov with his shoulder and sent him flying out of the way the prophecy had again flown to the tips of fingers but he had managed to cling on to it now sirius and dolohov were duelling their wands flashing like swords sparks flying from their 
 
 dolohov drew back his wand to make the same slashing movement he had used on harry and hermione springing up harry yelled petrificus totalus once again arms and legs snapped together and he keeled over backwards landing with a crash on his back 
 
 nice one shouted sirius forcing head down as a pair of stunning spells flew towards them now i want you to get out of 
 
 they both ducked again a jet of green light had narrowly missed sirius across the room harry saw tonks fall from halfway up the stone steps her limp form toppling from stone seat to stone seat and bellatrix triumphant running back towards the fray 
 
 harry take the prophecy grab neville and run sirius yelled dashing to meet bellatrix harry did not see what happened next kingsley swayed across his field of vision battling with the pockmarked and no longer masked rookwood another jet of green light flew over head as he launched himself towards neville 
 
 can you stand he bellowed in ear as legs jerked and twitched uncontrollably put your arm round my neck 
 
 neville did so harry legs were still lying in every direction they would not support him and then out of nowhere a man lunged at them both fell backwards legs waving wildly like an overturned harry with his left arm held up in the air to try to save the small glass ball from being smashed 
 
 the prophecy give me the prophecy potter snarled lucus voice in his ear and harry felt the tip of wand pressing hard between his ribs 
 
 nogetoff me nevillecatch it 
 
 harry flung the prophecy across the floor neville span himself around on his back and scooped the ball to his chest malfoy pointed the wand instead at neville but harry jabbed his own wand back over his shoulder and yelled impedimenta 
 
 malfoy was blasted off his back as harry scrambled up again he looked around and saw malfoy smash into the dais on which sirius and bellatrix were now duelling malfoy aimed his wand at harry and neville again but before he could draw breath to strike lupin had jumped between them 
 
 harry round up the others and go 
 
 harry seized neville by the shoulder of his robes and lifted him bodily on to the first tier of stone steps legs twitched and jerked and would not support his weight harry heaved again with all the strength he possessed and they climbed another step 
 
 a spell hit the stone bench at heel it crumbled away and he fell back to the step below neville sank to the ground his legs still jerking and thrashing and he thrust the prophecy into his pocket 
 
 come on said harry desperately hauling at robes just try and push with your legs 
 
 he gave another stupendous heave and robes tore all along the left seamthe small ball dropped from his pocket and before either of them could catch it one of floundering feet kicked it it flew some ten feet to their right and smashed on the step beneath them as both of them stared at the place where it had broken appalled at what had happened a figure with hugely magnified eyes rose into the air unnoticed by any but them harry could see its mouth moving but in all the crashes and screams and yells surrounding them not one word of the prophecy could he hear the figure stopped speaking and dissolved into nothingness 
 
 harry sorry cried neville his face anguished as his legs continued to flounder so sorry harry i bean do 
 
 it matter harry shouted just try and stand get out of 
 
 dubbledore said neville his sweaty face suddenly transported staring over shoulder 
 
 what 
 
 dubbledore 
 
 harry turned to look where neville was staring directly above them framed in the doorway from the brain room stood albus dumbledore his wand aloft his face white and furious harry felt a kind of electric charge surge through every particle of his bodythey were saved 
 
 dumbledore sped down the steps past neville and harry who had no more thoughts of leaving dumbledore was already at the foot of the steps when the death eaters nearest realised he was there and yelled to the others one of the death eaters ran for it scrabbling like a monkey up the stone steps opposite spell pulled him back as easily and effortlessly as though he had hooked him with an invisible line 
 
 only one pair was still battling apparently unaware of the new arrival harry saw sirius duck jet of red light he was laughing at her 
 
 come on you can do better than that he yelled his voice echoing around the cavernous room 
 
 the second jet of light hit him squarely on the chest 
 
 the laughter had not quite died from his face but his eyes widened in shock 
 
 harry released neville though he was unaware of doing so he was jumping down the steps again pulling out his wand as dumbledore too turned towards the dais 
 
 it seemed to take sirius an age to fall his body curved in a graceful arc as he sank backwards through the ragged veil hanging from the arch 
 
 harry saw the look of mingled fear and surprise on his wasted face as he fell through the ancient doorway and disappeared behind the veil which fluttered for a moment as though in a high wind then fell back into place 
 
 harry heard bellatrix triumphant scream but knew it meant nothingsirius had only just fallen through the archway he would reappear from the other side any second 
 
 but sirius did not reappear 
 
 sirius harry yelled sirius 
 
 he had reached the floor his breath coming in searing gasps sirius must be just behind the curtain he harry would pull him back out 
 
 but as he reached the ground and sprinted towards the dais lupin grabbed harry around the chest holding him back 
 
 nothing you can do harry 
 
 get him save him only just gone through 
 
 too late harry 
 
 we can still reach him harry struggled hard and viciously but lupin would not let go 
 
 nothing you can do harry nothing gone

 he lay facedown listening to the silence he was perfectly alone nobody was watching nobody else was there he was not perfectly sure that he was there himself 
 
 a long time later or maybe no time at all it came to him that he must exist must be more than disembodied thought because he was lying definitely lying on some surface therefore he had a sense of touch and the thing against which he lay existed too 
 
 almost as soon as he had reached this conclusion harry became conscious that he was naked convinced as he was of his total solitude this did not concern him but it did intrigue him slightly he wondered whether as he could feel he would be able to see in opening them he discovered that he had eyes 
 
 he lay in a bright mist though it was not like mist he had ever experienced before his surroundings were not hidden by cloudy vapor rather the cloudy vapor had not yet formed into surroundings the floor on which he lay seemed to be white neither warm nor cold but simply there a flat blank something on which to be 
 
 he sat up his body appeared unscathed he touched his face he was not wearing glasses anymore 
 
 then a noise reached him through the unformed nothingness that surrounded him the small soft thumpings of something that flapped flailed and struggled it was a pitiful noise yet also slightly indecent he had the uncomfortable feeling that he was eavesdropping on something furtive shameful 
 
 for the first time he wished he were clothed 
 
 barely had the wish formed in his head than robes appeared a short distance away he took them and pulled them on they were soft clean and warm it was extraordinary how they had appeared just like that the moment he had wanted them 
 
 he stood up looking around was he in some great room of requirement the longer he looked the more there was to see a great domed glass roof glittered high above him in sunlight perhaps it was a palace all was hushed and still except for those odd thumping and whimpering noises coming from somewhere close by in the mist 
 
 harry turned slowly on the spot and his surroundings seemed to invent themselves before his eyes a space bright and clean a hall larger by far than the great hall with that clear domed glass ceiling it was quite empty he was the only person there except for c he recoiled he had spotted the thing that was making the noises it had the form of a small naked child curled on the ground its skin raw and rough and it lay shuddering under a seat where it had been left unwanted stuffed out of sight struggling for breath 
 
 he was afraid of it small and fragile and wounded though it was he did not want to approach it nevertheless he drew slowly nearer ready to jump back at any moment soon he stood near enough to touch it yet he could not bring himself to do it he felt like a coward he ought to comfort it but it repulsed him 
 
 you cannot help 
 
 he spun around albus dumbledore was walking toward him sprightly and upright wearing sweeping robes of midnight blue 
 
 harry he spread his arms wide and his hands were both whole and white and undamaged you wonderful boy you brave brave man let us walk 
 
 stunned harry followed as dumbledore strode away from where the flayed child lay whimpering leading him to two seats that harry had not previously noticed set some distance away under that high sparkling ceiling dumbledore sat down in one of them and harry fell into the other staring at his old headmasters face dumbledores long silver hair and beard the piercingly blue eyes behind spectacles the crooked nose everything was as he had remembered it and yet 
 
 but youre dead said harry 
 
 oh yes said dumbledore 
 
 then im dead too 
 
 ah said dumbledore smiling still more broadly that is the question isnt it on the whole dear boy i think not 
 
 they looked at each other the old man still beaming 
 
 not repeated harry 
 
 not said dumbledore 
 
 but harry raised his hand instinctively toward the lightning scar it did not seem to be there but i should have died c i didnt defend myself i meant to let him kill me 
 
 and that said dumbledore will i think have made all the difference 
 
 happiness seemed to radiate from dumbledore like light like fire harry had never seen the man so utterly so palpably content 
 
 explain said harry 
 
 but you already know said dumbledore he twiddled his thumbs together 
 
 i let him kill me said harry didnt i 
 
 you did said dumbledore nodding go on 
 
 so the part of his soul that was in me 
 
 dumbledore nodded still more enthusiastically urging harry onward a broad smile of encouragement on his face 
 
 has it gone 
 
 oh yes said dumbledore yes he destroyed it your soul is whole and completely your own harry 
 
 but then 
 
 harry trembled over his shoulder to where the small maimed creature trembled under the chair 
 
 what is that professor 
 
 something that is beyond either of our help said dumbledore 
 
 but if voldemort used the killing curse harry started again and nobody died for me this time c how can i be alive 
 
 i think you know said dumbledore think back remember what he did in his ignorance in his greed and his cruelty 
 
 harry thought he let his gaze drift over his surroundings if it was indeed a palace in which they sat it was an odd one with chairs set in little rows and bits of railing here and there and still he and dumbledore and the stunted creatures under the chair were the only beings there then the answer rose to his lips easily without effort 
 
 he took my blood said harry 
 
 precisely said dumbledore he took your blood and rebuilt his living body with it your blood in his veins harry lilys protection inside both of you he tethered you to life while he lives 
 
 i live while he lives but i thought i thought it was the other way around i thought we both had to die or is it the same thing 
 
 he was distracted by the whimpering and thumping of the agonized creature behind them and glanced back at it yet again 
 
 are you sure we cant do anything 
 
 there is no help possible 
 
 then explain more said harry and dumbledore smiled 
 
 you were the seventh horcrux harry the horcrux he never meant to make he had rendered his soul so unstable that it broke apart when he committed those acts of unspeakable evil the murder of your parents the attempted killing of a child but what escaped from that room was even less than he knew he left more than his body behind he left part of himself latched to you the victim who had survived 
 
 and his knowledge remained woefully incomplete harry that which voldemort does not value he takes no trouble to comprehend of and childrens tales of love loyalty and innocence voldemort knows and understands nothing nothing that they all have a power beyond his own a power beyond the reach of any magic is a truth he has never grasped 
 
 he took your blood believing it would strengthen him he took into his body a tiny part of the enchantment your mother laid upon you when she died for you his body keeps her sacrifice alive and while that enchantment survives so do you and so does voldemorts one last hope for himself 
 
 dumbledore smiled at harry and harry stared at him 
 
 and you knew this you knew c all along 
 
 i guessed but my guesses have usually been good said dumbledore happily and they sat in silence for what seemed like a long time while the creature behind them continued to whimper and tremble 
 
 theres more said harry theres more to it why did my wand break the wand he borrowed 
 
 as to that i cannot be sure 
 
 have a guess then said harry and dumbledore laughed 
 
 what you must understand harry is that you and lord voldemort have journeyed together into realms of magic hitherto unknown and untested but here is what i think happened and it is unprecedented and no wandmaker could i think ever have predicted or explained it to voldemort 
 
 without meaning to as you now know lord voldemort doubled the bond between you when he returned to a human form a part of his soul was still attached to yours and thinking to strengthen himself he took a part of your mothers sacrifice into himself if he could only have understood the precise and terrible power of that sacrifice he would not perhaps have dared to touch your blood but then if he had been able to understand he could not be lord voldemort and might never have murdered at all 
 
 having ensured this connection having wrapped your destinies together more securely than ever two wizards were joined in history voldemort proceeded to attack you with a wand that shared a core with yours and now something very strange happened as we know the cores reacted in a way that lord voldemort who never knew that your wand was a twin of his had ever expected 
 
 he was more afraid than you were that night harry you had accepted even embraced the possibility of death something lord voldemort has never been able to do your courage won your wand overpowered his and in doing so something happened between those wands something that echoed the relationship between their masters 
 
 i believe that your wand imbibed some of the power and qualities of voldemorts wand that night which is to say that it contained a little of voldemort himself so your wand recognized him when he pursued you recognized a man who was both kin and mortal enemy and it regurgitated some of his own magic against him magic much more powerful than anything luciuss wand had ever performed your wand now contained the power of your enormous courage and of voldemorts own deadly skill what chance did that poor stick of lucius malfoys stand 
 
 but if my wand was so powerful how come hermione was able to break it asked harry 
 
 my dear boy its remarkable effects were directed only at voldemort who had tampered so with the deepest laws of magic only toward him was that wand abnormally powerful otherwise it was a wand like any other though a good one i am sure dumbledore finished kindly 
 
 harry sat in thought for a long time or perhaps seconds it was very hard to be sure of things like time here 
 
 he killed me with your wand 
 
 he failed to kill you with my wand dumbledore corrected harry i think we can agree that you are not dead c though of course he added as if fearing he had been discourteous i do not minimize your sufferings which i am sure were severe 
 
 i feel great at the moment though said harry looking down at his clean unblemished hands where are we exactly 
 
 well i was going to ask you that said dumbledore looking around where would you say that we are 
 
 until dumbledore had asked harry had not known now however he found that he had an answer ready to give 
 
 it looks he said slowly like kings cross station except a lo cleaner and empty and there are no trains as far as i can see 
 
 kings cross station dumbledore was chuckling immoderately good gracious really 
 
 well where do you think we are asked harry a little defensively 
 
 my dear boy i have no idea this is as they say your party 
 
 harry had no idea what this meant dumbledore was being infuriating he glared at him then remembered a much more pressing question than that of their current location 
 
 the deathly hallows he said and he was glad to see that the words wiped the smile from dumbledores face 
 
 ah yes he said he even looked a little worried 
 
 well 
 
 for the first time since harry had met dumbledore he looked less than an old man much less he looked fleetingly like a small boy caught in wrongdoing 
 
 can you forgive me he said can you forgive me for not trusting you for not telling you harry i only feared that you would fail as i had failed i only dreaded that you would make my mistakes i crave your pardon harry i have known for some time now that you are the better man 
 
 what are you talking about asked harry startled by dumbledores tone by the sudden tears in his eyes 
 
 the hallows the hallows murmured dumbledore a desperate mans dream 
 
 but theyre real 
 
 real and dangerous and a lure for fools said dumbledore and i was such a fool but you know dont you i have no secrets from you anymore you know 
 
 what do i know 
 
 dumbledore turned his whole body to face harry and tears still sparkled in the brilliantly blue eyes 
 
 master of death harry master of death was i better ultimately than voldemort 
 
 of course you were said harry of course c how can you ask that you never killed if you could avoid it 
 
 true true said dumbledore and he was like a child seeking reassurance yet i too sought a way to conquer death harry 
 
 not the way he did said harry after all his anger at dumbledore how odd it was to sit here beneath the high vaulted ceiling and defend dumbledore from himself hallows not horcruxes 
 
 hallows murmured dumbledore not horcruxes precisely 
 
 there was a pause the creature behind them whimpered but harry no longer looked around 
 
 grindelwald was looking for them too he asked 
 
 dumbledore closed his eyes for a moment and nodded 
 
 it was the thing above all that drew us together he said quietly two clever arrogant boys with a shared obsession he wanted to come to godrics hollow as i am sure you have guessed because of the grave of ignotus peverell he wanted to explore the place the third brother had died 
 
 so its true asked harry all of it the peverell brothers c 
 
 c were the three brothers of the tale said dumbledore nodding oh yes i think so whether they met death on a lonely road i think it more likely that the peverell brothers were simply gifted dangerous wizards who succeeded in creating those powerful objects the story of them being deaths own hallows seems to me the sort of legend that might have sprung up around such creations 
 
 the cloak as you know now traveled down through the ages father to son mother to daughter right down to ignotuss last living descendant who was born as ignotus was in the village of godrics hollow 
 
 dumbledore smiled at harry 
 
 me 
 
 you you have guessed i know why the cloak was in my possession on the night your parents died james had showed it to me just a few days previously it explained much of his undetected wrongdoing at school i could hardly believe what i was seeing i asked to borrow it to examine it i had long since given up my dream of uniting the hallows but i could not resist could not help taking a closer look it was a cloak the likes of which i had never seen immensely old perfect in every respect and then your father died and i had two hallows at last all to myself 
 
 his tone was unbearably bitter 
 
 the cloak wouldnt have helped them survive though harry said quickly voldemort knew where my mum and dad were the cloak couldnt have made them 
 
 true sighed dumbledore true 
 
 harry waited but dumbledore did not speak so he prompted him 
 
 so youd given up looking for the hallows when you saw the cloak 
 
 oh yes said dumbledore faintly it seemed that he forced himself to meet harrys eyes you know what happened you know you cannot despise me more than i despise myself 
 
 but i dont despise you c 
 
 then you should said dumbledore he drew a deep breath you know the secret of my sisters ill health what those muggles did what she became you know how my poor father sought revenge and paid the price died in azkaban you know how my mother gave up her own life to care for ariana 
 
 i resented it harry 
 
 dumbledore stated it baldly coldly he was looking now over the top of harrys head into the distance 
 
 i was gifted i was brilliant i wanted to escape i wanted to shine i wanted glory 
 
 do not misunderstand me he said and pain crossed the face so that he looked ancient again i loved them i loved my parents i loved my brother and my sister but i was selfish harry more selfish than you who are a remarkably selfless person could possibly imagine 
 
 so that when my mother died and i was left the responsibility of a damaged sister and a wayward brother i returned to my village in anger and bitterness trapped and wasted i thought and then of course he came 
 
 dumbledore looked directly into harrys eyes again 
 
 grindelwald you cannot imagine how his ideas caught me harry inflamed me muggles forced into subservience we wizards triumphant grindelwald and i the glorious young leaders of the revolution 
 
 oh i had a few scruples i assuaged my conscience with empty words it would all be for the greater good and any harm done would be repaid a hundredfold in benefits for wizards did i know in my heart of hearts what gellert grindelwald was i think i did but i closed my eyes if the plans we were making came to fruition all my dreams would come true 
 
 and at the heart of our schemes the deathly hallows how they fascinated him how they fascinated both of us the unbeatable wand the weapon that would lead us to power the resurrection stone c to him though i pretended not to know it it meant an army of inferi to me i confess it meant the return of my parents and the lifting of all responsibility from my shoulders 
 
 and the cloak somehow we never discussed the cloak much harry both of us could conceal ourselves well enough without the cloak the true magic of which of course is that it can be used to protect and shield others as well as its owner i thought that if we ever found it it might be useful in hiding ariana but our interest in the cloak was mainly that it completed the trio for the legend said that the man who had united all three objects would then be truly master of death which we took to mean invincible 
 
 invincible masters of death grindelwald and dumbledore two months of insanity of cruel dreams and neglect of the only two members of my family left to me 
 
 and then you know what happened reality returned in the form of my rough unlettered and infinitely more admirable brother i did not want to hear the truths he shouted at me i did not want to hear that i could not set forth and seek hallows with a fragile and unstable sister in tow 
 
 the argument became a fight grindelwald lost control that which i had always sensed in him though i pretended not to now sprang into terrible being and ariana after all my mothers care and caution lay dead upon the floor 
 
 dumbledore gave a little gasp and began to cry in earnest harry reached out and was glad to find that he could touch him he gripped his arm tightly and dumbledore gradually regained control 
 
 well grindelwald fled as anyone but i could have predicted he vanished with his plans for seizing power and his schemes for muggle torture and his dreams of the deathly hallows dreams in which i had encouraged him and helped him he ran while i was left to bury my sister and learn to live with my guilt and my terrible grief the price of my shame 
 
 years passed there were rumors about him they said he had procured a wand of immense power i meanwhile was offered the post of minister of magic not once but several times naturally i refused i had learned that i was not to be trusted with power 
 
 but youd have been better much better than fudge or scimgeour burst out harry 
 
 would i asked dumbledore heavily i am not so sure i had proven as a very young man that power was my weakness and my temptation it is a curious thing harry but perhaps those who are best suited to power are those who have never sought it those who like you have leadership thrust upon them and take up the mantle because they must and find to their own surprise that they wear it well 
 
 i was safer at hogwarts i think i was a good teacher c 
 
 you were the best c 
 
 c you are very kind harry but while i busied myself with the training of young wizards grindelwald was raising an army they say he feared me and perhaps he did but less i think than i feared him 
 
 oh not death said dumbledore in answer to harrys questioning look not what he could do to me magically i knew that we were evenly matched perhaps that i was a shade more skillful it was the truth i feared you see i never knew which of us in that last horrific fight had actually cast the curse that killed my sister you may call me cowardly you would be right harry i dreaded beyond all things the knowledge that it had been i who brought about her death not merely through my arrogance and stupidity but that i actually struck the blow that snuffed out her life 
 
 i think he knew it i think he knew what frightened me i delayed meeting him until finally it would have been too shameful to resist any longer people were dying and he seemed unstoppable and i had to do what i could 
 
 well you know what happened next i won the duel i won the wand 
 
 another silence harry did not ask whether dumbledore had ever found out who struck ariana dead he did not want to know and even less did he want dumbledore to have to tell him at last he knew what dumbledore would have seen when he looked in the mirror of erised and why dumbledore had been so understanding of the fascination it had exercised over harry 
 
 they sat in silence for a long time and the whipmerings of the creature behind them barely disturbed harry anymore 
 
 at last he said grindelwald tried to stop voldemort going after the wand he lied you know pretended he had never had it 
 
 dumbledore nodded looking down at his lap tears still glittering on the crooked nose 
 
 they say he showed remorse in later years alone in his cell at nurmengard i hope that is true i would like to think that he did feel the horror and shame of what he had done perhaps that lie to voldemort was his attempt to make amends to prevent voldemort from taking the hallow 
 
 or maybe from breaking into your tomb suggested harry and dumbledore dabbed his eyes 
 
 after another short pause harry said you tried to use the resurrection stone 
 
 dumbledore nodded 
 
 when i discovered it after all those years buried in the abandoned home of the gaunts c the hallow i had craved most of all though in my youth i had wanted it for very different reasons c i lost my head harry i quite forgot that i was not a horcrux that the ring was sure to carry a curse i picked it up and i put it on and for a second i imagined that i was about to see ariana and my mother and my father and to tell them how very very sorry i was 
 
 i was such a fool harry after all those years i had learned nothing i was unworthy to unite the deathly hallows i had proved it time and again and here was final proof 
 
 why said harry it was natural you wanted to see them again whats wrong with that 
 
 maybe a man in a million could unite the hallows harry i was fit only to possess the meanest of them the least extraordinary i was fit to own the elder wand and not boast of it and not to kill with it i was permitted to tame and use it because i took it not for gain but to save others from it 
 
 but the cloak i took out of vain curiousity and so it could never have worked for me as it works for you its true owners the stone i would have used in an attempt to drag back those who are at peace rather than enable my as you did you are the worthy possessor of the hallows 
 
 dumbledore patted harrys hand and harry looked up at the old man and smiled he could not help himself how could he remain angry with dumbledore now 
 
 why did you have to make it so difficult 
 
 dumbledores smile was tremulous 
 
 i am afraid i counted on miss granger to slow you up harry i was afraid that your hot head might dominate your good heart i was scared that if presented outright with the facts about those tempting objects you might seize the hallows as i did at the wrong time for the wrong reasons if you laid hands on them i wanted you to possess them safely you are the true master of death because the true master does not seek to run away from death he accepts that he must die and understands that there are far far worse things in the living world than dying 
 
 and voldemort never knew about the hallows 
 
 i do not think so because he did not recognize the resurrection stone he turned into a horcrux but even if he had known about them harry i doubt that he would have been interested in any except the first he would not think that he needed the cloak and as for the stone whom would he want to bring back from the dead he fears the dead he does not love 
 
 but you expected him to go after the wand 
 
 i have been sure that he would try ever since your wand beat voldemorts in the graveyard of little hangleton at first he was afraid that you had conquered him by superior skill once he had kidnapped ollivander however he discovered the existence of the twin cores he thought that explained everything yet the borrowed wand did no better against yours so voldemort instead of asking himself what quality it was in you that had made your wand so strong what gift you possessed that he did not naturally set out to find the one wand that they said would beat any other for him the elder wand has become an obsession to rival his obsession with you he believes that the elder wand removes his last weakness and makes him truly invincible poor severus 
 
 if you planned your death with snape you meant him to end up with the elder wand didnt you 
 
 i admit that was my intention said dumbledore but it did not work as i intended did it 
 
 no said harry that bit didnt work out 
 
 the creature behind them jerked and moaned and harry and dumbledore sate without talking for the longest time yet the realization of what would happen next settled gradually over harry in the long minutes like softly falling snow 
 
 ive got to go back havent i 
 
 that is up to you 
 
 ive got a choice 
 
 oh yes dumbledore smiled at him we are in kings cross you say i think that if you decided not to go back you would be able to lets say board a train 
 
 and where would it take me 
 
 on said dumbledore simply 
 
 silence again 
 
 voldemorts got the elder wand 
 
 true voldemort has the elder wand 
 
 but you want me to go back 
 
 i think said dumbledore that if you choose to return there is a chance that he may be finished for good i cannot promise it but i know this harry that you have less to fear from returning here than he does 
 
 harry glanced again at the raw looking thing that trembled and choked in the shadow beneath the distant chair 
 
 do not pity the dead harry pity the living and above all those who live without love by returning you may ensure that fewer souls are maimed fewer families are torn apart if that seems to you a worthy goal they we saw for the present 
 
 harry nodded and sighed leaving this place would not be nearly as hard as walking into the forest had been but it was warm and light and peaceful here and he knew that he was heading back to pain and the fear of more loss he stood up and dumbledore did the same and they looked for a long moment into each others faces 
 
 tell me one last thing said harry is this real or has this been happening inside my head 
 
 dumbledore beamed at him and his voice sounded loud and strong in harrys ears even though the bright mist was descending again obscuring his figure 
 
 of course it is happening inside your head harry but why on earth should that mean it is not real

 almost as soon as he had reached this conclusion harry became conscious that he was naked convinced as he was of his total solitude this did not concern him but it did intrigue him slightly he wondered whether as he could feel he would be able to see in opening them he discovered that he had eyes 
 
 he lay in a bright mist though it was not like mist he had ever experienced before his surroundings were not hidden by cloudy vapor rather the cloudy vapor had not yet formed into surroundings the floor on which he lay seemed to be white neither warm nor cold but simply there a flat blank something on which to be 
 
 he sat up his body appeared unscathed he touched his face he was not wearing glasses anymore 
 
 then a noise reached him through the unformed nothingness that surrounded him the small soft thumpings of something that flapped flailed and struggled it was a pitiful noise yet also slightly indecent he had the uncomfortable feeling that he was eavesdropping on something furtive shameful 
 
 for the first time he wished he were clothed 
 
 barely had the wish formed in his head than robes appeared a short distance away he took them and pulled them on they were soft clean and warm it was extraordinary how they had appeared just like that the moment he had wanted them 
 
 he stood up looking around was he in some great room of requirement the longer he looked the more there was to see a great domed glass roof glittered high above him in sunlight perhaps it was a palace all was hushed and still except for those odd thumping and whimpering noises coming from somewhere close by in the mist 
 
 harry turned slowly on the spot and his surroundings seemed to invent themselves before his eyes a space bright and clean a hall larger by far than the great hall with that clear domed glass ceiling it was quite empty he was the only person there except for c he recoiled he had spotted the thing that was making the noises it had the form of a small naked child curled on the ground its skin raw and rough and it lay shuddering under a seat where it had been left unwanted stuffed out of sight struggling for breath 
 
 he was afraid of it small and fragile and wounded though it was he did not want to approach it nevertheless he drew slowly nearer ready to jump back at any moment soon he stood near enough to touch it yet he could not bring himself to do it he felt like a coward he ought to comfort it but it repulsed him 
 
 you cannot help 
 
 he spun around albus dumbledore was walking toward him sprightly and upright wearing sweeping robes of midnight blue 
 
 harry he spread his arms wide and his hands were both whole and white and undamaged you wonderful boy you brave brave man let us walk 
 
 stunned harry followed as dumbledore strode away from where the flayed child lay whimpering leading him to two seats that harry had not previously noticed set some distance away under that high sparkling ceiling dumbledore sat down in one of them and harry fell into the other staring at his old headmasters face dumbledores long silver hair and beard the piercingly blue eyes behind spectacles the crooked nose everything was as he had remembered it and yet 
 
 but youre dead said harry 
 
 oh yes said dumbledore 
 
 then im dead too 
 
 ah said dumbledore smiling still more broadly that is the question isnt it on the whole dear boy i think not 
 
 they looked at each other the old man still beaming 
 
 not repeated harry 
 
 not said dumbledore 
 
 but harry raised his hand instinctively toward the lightning scar it did not seem to be there but i should have died c i didnt defend myself i meant to let him kill me 
 
 and that said dumbledore will i think have made all the difference 
 
 happiness seemed to radiate from dumbledore like light like fire harry had never seen the man so utterly so palpably content 
 
 explain said harry 
 
 but you already know said dumbledore he twiddled his thumbs together 
 
 i let him kill me said harry didnt i 
 
 you did said dumbledore nodding go on 
 
 so the part of his soul that was in me 
 
 dumbledore nodded still more enthusiastically urging harry onward a broad smile of encouragement on his face 
 
 has it gone 
 
 oh yes said dumbledore yes he destroyed it your soul is whole and completely your own harry 
 
 but then 
 
 harry trembled over his shoulder to where the small maimed creature trembled under the chair 
 
 what is that professor 
 
 something that is beyond either of our help said dumbledore 
 
 but if voldemort used the killing curse harry started again and nobody died for me this time c how can i be alive 
 
 i think you know said dumbledore think back remember what he did in his ignorance in his greed and his cruelty 
 
 harry thought he let his gaze drift over his surroundings if it was indeed a palace in which they sat it was an odd one with chairs set in little rows and bits of railing here and there and still he and dumbledore and the stunted creatures under the chair were the only beings there then the answer rose to his lips easily without effort 
 
 he took my blood said harry 
 
 precisely said dumbledore he took your blood and rebuilt his living body with it your blood in his veins harry lilys protection inside both of you he tethered you to life while he lives 
 
 i live while he lives but i thought i thought it was the other way around i thought we both had to die or is it the same thing 
 
 he was distracted by the whimpering and thumping of the agonized creature behind them and glanced back at it yet again 
 
 are you sure we cant do anything 
 
 there is no help possible 
 
 then explain more said harry and dumbledore smiled 
 
 you were the seventh horcrux harry the horcrux he never meant to make he had rendered his soul so unstable that it broke apart when he committed those acts of unspeakable evil the murder of your parents the attempted killing of a child but what escaped from that room was even less than he knew he left more than his body behind he left part of himself latched to you the victim who had survived 
 
 and his knowledge remained woefully incomplete harry that which voldemort does not value he takes no trouble to comprehend of and childrens tales of love loyalty and innocence voldemort knows and understands nothing nothing that they all have a power beyond his own a power beyond the reach of any magic is a truth he has never grasped 
 
 he took your blood believing it would strengthen him he took into his body a tiny part of the enchantment your mother laid upon you when she died for you his body keeps her sacrifice alive and while that enchantment survives so do you and so does voldemorts one last hope for himself 
 
 dumbledore smiled at harry and harry stared at him 
 
 and you knew this you knew c all along 
 
 i guessed but my guesses have usually been good said dumbledore happily and they sat in silence for what seemed like a long time while the creature behind them continued to whimper and tremble 
 
 theres more said harry theres more to it why did my wand break the wand he borrowed 
 
 as to that i cannot be sure 
 
 have a guess then said harry and dumbledore laughed 
 
 what you must understand harry is that you and lord voldemort have journeyed together into realms of magic hitherto unknown and untested but here is what i think happened and it is unprecedented and no wandmaker could i think ever have predicted or explained it to voldemort 
 
 without meaning to as you now know lord voldemort doubled the bond between you when he returned to a human form a part of his soul was still attached to yours and thinking to strengthen himself he took a part of your mothers sacrifice into himself if he could only have understood the precise and terrible power of that sacrifice he would not perhaps have dared to touch your blood but then if he had been able to understand he could not be lord voldemort and might never have murdered at all 
 
 having ensured this connection having wrapped your destinies together more securely than ever two wizards were joined in history voldemort proceeded to attack you with a wand that shared a core with yours and now something very strange happened as we know the cores reacted in a way that lord voldemort who never knew that your wand was a twin of his had ever expected 
 
 he was more afraid than you were that night harry you had accepted even embraced the possibility of death something lord voldemort has never been able to do your courage won your wand overpowered his and in doing so something happened between those wands something that echoed the relationship between their masters 
 
 i believe that your wand imbibed some of the power and qualities of voldemorts wand that night which is to say that it contained a little of voldemort himself so your wand recognized him when he pursued you recognized a man who was both kin and mortal enemy and it regurgitated some of his own magic against him magic much more powerful than anything luciuss wand had ever performed your wand now contained the power of your enormous courage and of voldemorts own deadly skill what chance did that poor stick of lucius malfoys stand 
 
 but if my wand was so powerful how come hermione was able to break it asked harry 
 
 my dear boy its remarkable effects were directed only at voldemort who had tampered so with the deepest laws of magic only toward him was that wand abnormally powerful otherwise it was a wand like any other though a good one i am sure dumbledore finished kindly 
 
 harry sat in thought for a long time or perhaps seconds it was very hard to be sure of things like time here 
 
 he killed me with your wand 
 
 he failed to kill you with my wand dumbledore corrected harry i think we can agree that you are not dead c though of course he added as if fearing he had been discourteous i do not minimize your sufferings which i am sure were severe 
 
 i feel great at the moment though said harry looking down at his clean unblemished hands where are we exactly 
 
 well i was going to ask you that said dumbledore looking around where would you say that we are 
 
 until dumbledore had asked harry had not known now however he found that he had an answer ready to give 
 
 it looks he said slowly like kings cross station except a lo cleaner and empty and there are no trains as far as i can see 
 
 kings cross station dumbledore was chuckling immoderately good gracious really 
 
 well where do you think we are asked harry a little defensively 
 
 my dear boy i have no idea this is as they say your party 
 
 harry had no idea what this meant dumbledore was being infuriating he glared at him then remembered a much more pressing question than that of their current location 
 
 the deathly hallows he said and he was glad to see that the words wiped the smile from dumbledores face 
 
 ah yes he said he even looked a little worried 
 
 well 
 
 for the first time since harry had met dumbledore he looked less than an old man much less he looked fleetingly like a small boy caught in wrongdoing 
 
 can you forgive me he said can you forgive me for not trusting you for not telling you harry i only feared that you would fail as i had failed i only dreaded that you would make my mistakes i crave your pardon harry i have known for some time now that you are the better man 
 
 what are you talking about asked harry startled by dumbledores tone by the sudden tears in his eyes 
 
 the hallows the hallows murmured dumbledore a desperate mans dream 
 
 but theyre real 
 
 real and dangerous and a lure for fools said dumbledore and i was such a fool but you know dont you i have no secrets from you anymore you know 
 
 what do i know 
 
 dumbledore turned his whole body to face harry and tears still sparkled in the brilliantly blue eyes 
 
 master of death harry master of death was i better ultimately than voldemort 
 
 of course you were said harry of course c how can you ask that you never killed if you could avoid it 
 
 true true said dumbledore and he was like a child seeking reassurance yet i too sought a way to conquer death harry 
 
 not the way he did said harry after all his anger at dumbledore how odd it was to sit here beneath the high vaulted ceiling and defend dumbledore from himself hallows not horcruxes 
 
 hallows murmured dumbledore not horcruxes precisely 
 
 there was a pause the creature behind them whimpered but harry no longer looked around 
 
 grindelwald was looking for them too he asked 
 
 dumbledore closed his eyes for a moment and nodded 
 
 it was the thing above all that drew us together he said quietly two clever arrogant boys with a shared obsession he wanted to come to godrics hollow as i am sure you have guessed because of the grave of ignotus peverell he wanted to explore the place the third brother had died 
 
 so its true asked harry all of it the peverell brothers c 
 
 c were the three brothers of the tale said dumbledore nodding oh yes i think so whether they met death on a lonely road i think it more likely that the peverell brothers were simply gifted dangerous wizards who succeeded in creating those powerful objects the story of them being deaths own hallows seems to me the sort of legend that might have sprung up around such creations 
 
 the cloak as you know now traveled down through the ages father to son mother to daughter right down to ignotuss last living descendant who was born as ignotus was in the village of godrics hollow 
 
 dumbledore smiled at harry 
 
 me 
 
 you you have guessed i know why the cloak was in my possession on the night your parents died james had showed it to me just a few days previously it explained much of his undetected wrongdoing at school i could hardly believe what i was seeing i asked to borrow it to examine it i had long since given up my dream of uniting the hallows but i could not resist could not help taking a closer look it was a cloak the likes of which i had never seen immensely old perfect in every respect and then your father died and i had two hallows at last all to myself 
 
 his tone was unbearably bitter 
 
 the cloak wouldnt have helped them survive though harry said quickly voldemort knew where my mum and dad were the cloak couldnt have made them 
 
 true sighed dumbledore true 
 
 harry waited but dumbledore did not speak so he prompted him 
 
 so youd given up looking for the hallows when you saw the cloak 
 
 oh yes said dumbledore faintly it seemed that he forced himself to meet harrys eyes you know what happened you know you cannot despise me more than i despise myself 
 
 but i dont despise you c 
 
 then you should said dumbledore he drew a deep breath you know the secret of my sisters ill health what those muggles did what she became you know how my poor father sought revenge and paid the price died in azkaban you know how my mother gave up her own life to care for ariana 
 
 i resented it harry 
 
 dumbledore stated it baldly coldly he was looking now over the top of harrys head into the distance 
 
 i was gifted i was brilliant i wanted to escape i wanted to shine i wanted glory 
 
 do not misunderstand me he said and pain crossed the face so that he looked ancient again i loved them i loved my parents i loved my brother and my sister but i was selfish harry more selfish than you who are a remarkably selfless person could possibly imagine 
 
 so that when my mother died and i was left the responsibility of a damaged sister and a wayward brother i returned to my village in anger and bitterness trapped and wasted i thought and then of course he came 
 
 dumbledore looked directly into harrys eyes again 
 
 grindelwald you cannot imagine how his ideas caught me harry inflamed me muggles forced into subservience we wizards triumphant grindelwald and i the glorious young leaders of the revolution 
 
 oh i had a few scruples i assuaged my conscience with empty words it would all be for the greater good and any harm done would be repaid a hundredfold in benefits for wizards did i know in my heart of hearts what gellert grindelwald was i think i did but i closed my eyes if the plans we were making came to fruition all my dreams would come true 
 
 and at the heart of our schemes the deathly hallows how they fascinated him how they fascinated both of us the unbeatable wand the weapon that would lead us to power the resurrection stone c to him though i pretended not to know it it meant an army of inferi to me i confess it meant the return of my parents and the lifting of all responsibility from my shoulders 
 
 and the cloak somehow we never discussed the cloak much harry both of us could conceal ourselves well enough without the cloak the true magic of which of course is that it can be used to protect and shield others as well as its owner i thought that if we ever found it it might be useful in hiding ariana but our interest in the cloak was mainly that it completed the trio for the legend said that the man who had united all three objects would then be truly master of death which we took to mean invincible 
 
 invincible masters of death grindelwald and dumbledore two months of insanity of cruel dreams and neglect of the only two members of my family left to me 
 
 and then you know what happened reality returned in the form of my rough unlettered and infinitely more admirable brother i did not want to hear the truths he shouted at me i did not want to hear that i could not set forth and seek hallows with a fragile and unstable sister in tow 
 
 the argument became a fight grindelwald lost control that which i had always sensed in him though i pretended not to now sprang into terrible being and ariana after all my mothers care and caution lay dead upon the floor 
 
 dumbledore gave a little gasp and began to cry in earnest harry reached out and was glad to find that he could touch him he gripped his arm tightly and dumbledore gradually regained control 
 
 well grindelwald fled as anyone but i could have predicted he vanished with his plans for seizing power and his schemes for muggle torture and his dreams of the deathly hallows dreams in which i had encouraged him and helped him he ran while i was left to bury my sister and learn to live with my guilt and my terrible grief the price of my shame 
 
 years passed there were rumors about him they said he had procured a wand of immense power i meanwhile was offered the post of minister of magic not once but several times naturally i refused i had learned that i was not to be trusted with power 
 
 but youd have been better much better than fudge or scimgeour burst out harry 
 
 would i asked dumbledore heavily i am not so sure i had proven as a very young man that power was my weakness and my temptation it is a curious thing harry but perhaps those who are best suited to power are those who have never sought it those who like you have leadership thrust upon them and take up the mantle because they must and find to their own surprise that they wear it well 
 
 i was safer at hogwarts i think i was a good teacher c 
 
 you were the best c 
 
 c you are very kind harry but while i busied myself with the training of young wizards grindelwald was raising an army they say he feared me and perhaps he did but less i think than i feared him 
 
 oh not death said dumbledore in answer to harrys questioning look not what he could do to me magically i knew that we were evenly matched perhaps that i was a shade more skillful it was the truth i feared you see i never knew which of us in that last horrific fight had actually cast the curse that killed my sister you may call me cowardly you would be right harry i dreaded beyond all things the knowledge that it had been i who brought about her death not merely through my arrogance and stupidity but that i actually struck the blow that snuffed out her life 
 
 i think he knew it i think he knew what frightened me i delayed meeting him until finally it would have been too shameful to resist any longer people were dying and he seemed unstoppable and i had to do what i could 
 
 well you know what happened next i won the duel i won the wand 
 
 another silence harry did not ask whether dumbledore had ever found out who struck ariana dead he did not want to know and even less did he want dumbledore to have to tell him at last he knew what dumbledore would have seen when he looked in the mirror of erised and why dumbledore had been so understanding of the fascination it had exercised over harry 
 
 they sat in silence for a long time and the whipmerings of the creature behind them barely disturbed harry anymore 
 
 at last he said grindelwald tried to stop voldemort going after the wand he lied you know pretended he had never had it 
 
 dumbledore nodded looking down at his lap tears still glittering on the crooked nose 
 
 they say he showed remorse in later years alone in his cell at nurmengard i hope that is true i would like to think that he did feel the horror and shame of what he had done perhaps that lie to voldemort was his attempt to make amends to prevent voldemort from taking the hallow 
 
 or maybe from breaking into your tomb suggested harry and dumbledore dabbed his eyes 
 
 after another short pause harry said you tried to use the resurrection stone 
 
 dumbledore nodded 
 
 when i discovered it after all those years buried in the abandoned home of the gaunts c the hallow i had craved most of all though in my youth i had wanted it for very different reasons c i lost my head harry i quite forgot that i was not a horcrux that the ring was sure to carry a curse i picked it up and i put it on and for a second i imagined that i was about to see ariana and my mother and my father and to tell them how very very sorry i was 
 
 i was such a fool harry after all those years i had learned nothing i was unworthy to unite the deathly hallows i had proved it time and again and here was final proof 
 
 why said harry it was natural you wanted to see them again whats wrong with that 
 
 maybe a man in a million could unite the hallows harry i was fit only to possess the meanest of them the least extraordinary i was fit to own the elder wand and not boast of it and not to kill with it i was permitted to tame and use it because i took it not for gain but to save others from it 
 
 but the cloak i took out of vain curiousity and so it could never have worked for me as it works for you its true owners the stone i would have used in an attempt to drag back those who are at peace rather than enable my as you did you are the worthy possessor of the hallows 
 
 dumbledore patted harrys hand and harry looked up at the old man and smiled he could not help himself how could he remain angry with dumbledore now 
 
 why did you have to make it so difficult 
 
 dumbledores smile was tremulous 
 
 i am afraid i counted on miss granger to slow you up harry i was afraid that your hot head might dominate your good heart i was scared that if presented outright with the facts about those tempting objects you might seize the hallows as i did at the wrong time for the wrong reasons if you laid hands on them i wanted you to possess them safely you are the true master of death because the true master does not seek to run away from death he accepts that he must die and understands that there are far far worse things in the living world than dying 
 
 and voldemort never knew about the hallows 
 
 i do not think so because he did not recognize the resurrection stone he turned into a horcrux but even if he had known about them harry i doubt that he would have been interested in any except the first he would not think that he needed the cloak and as for the stone whom would he want to bring back from the dead he fears the dead he does not love 
 
 but you expected him to go after the wand 
 
 i have been sure that he would try ever since your wand beat voldemorts in the graveyard of little hangleton at first he was afraid that you had conquered him by superior skill once he had kidnapped ollivander however he discovered the existence of the twin cores he thought that explained everything yet the borrowed wand did no better against yours so voldemort instead of asking himself what quality it was in you that had made your wand so strong what gift you possessed that he did not naturally set out to find the one wand that they said would beat any other for him the elder wand has become an obsession to rival his obsession with you he believes that the elder wand removes his last weakness and makes him truly invincible poor severus 
 
 if you planned your death with snape you meant him to end up with the elder wand didnt you 
 
 i admit that was my intention said dumbledore but it did not work as i intended did it 
 
 no said harry that bit didnt work out 
 
 the creature behind them jerked and moaned and harry and dumbledore sate without talking for the longest time yet the realization of what would happen next settled gradually over harry in the long minutes like softly falling snow 
 
 ive got to go back havent i 
 
 that is up to you 
 
 ive got a choice 
 
 oh yes dumbledore smiled at him we are in kings cross you say i think that if you decided not to go back you would be able to lets say board a train 
 
 and where would it take me 
 
 on said dumbledore simply 
 
 silence again 
 
 voldemorts got the elder wand 
 
 true voldemort has the elder wand 
 
 but you want me to go back 
 
 i think said dumbledore that if you choose to return there is a chance that he may be finished for good i cannot promise it but i know this harry that you have less to fear from returning here than he does 
 
 harry glanced again at the raw looking thing that trembled and choked in the shadow beneath the distant chair 
 
 do not pity the dead harry pity the living and above all those who live without love by returning you may ensure that fewer souls are maimed fewer families are torn apart if that seems to you a worthy goal they we saw for the present 
 
 harry nodded and sighed leaving this place would not be nearly as hard as walking into the forest had been but it was warm and light and peaceful here and he knew that he was heading back to pain and the fear of more loss he stood up and dumbledore did the same and they looked for a long moment into each others faces 
 
 tell me one last thing said harry is this real or has this been happening inside my head 
 
 dumbledore beamed at him and his voice sounded loud and strong in harrys ears even though the bright mist was descending again obscuring his figure 
 
 of course it is happening inside your head harry but why on earth should that mean it is not real 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the deathly hallows 
 


 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 fairy tales of hans christian andersen 
 the bird of popular song 
 by hans christian andersen 
 
 it is the earth wears a snowy garment and looks like 
 marble hewn out of the rock the air is bright and clear the wind 
 is sharp as a sword and the trees stand like branches 
 of white coral or blooming almond twigs and here it is keen as on the 
 lofty alps 
 
 the night is splendid in the gleam of the northern lights and 
 in the glitter of innumerable twinkling stars 
 
 but we sit in the warm room by the hot stove and talk about 
 the old times and we listen to this story 
 
 by the open sea was a grave and on the sat at 
 midnight the spirit of the buried hero who had been a king the 
 golden circlet gleamed on his brow his hair fluttered in the wind 
 and he was clad in steel and iron he bent his head mournfully and 
 sighed in deep sorrow as an unquiet spirit might sigh 
 
 and a ship came sailing by presently the sailors lowered the 
 anchor and landed among them was a singer and he approached the 
 royal spirit and said 
 
 why mournest thou and wherefore dost thou suffer thus 
 and the dead man answered 
 
 no one has sung the deeds of my life they are dead and 
 forgotten song doth not carry them forth over the lands nor into the 
 hearts of men therefore i have no rest and no peace 
 
 and he spoke of his works and of his warlike deeds which his 
 contemporaries had known but which had not been sung because there was no singer among his companions 
 
 then the old bard struck the strings of his harp and sang of 
 the youthful courage of the hero of the strength of the man and of 
 the greatness of his good deeds then the face of the dead one gleamed like the margin of the cloud in the moonlight gladly and of good courage the form arose in splendor and in majesty and vanished like the glancing of the northern light nought was to be seen but the green tufy mound with the stones on which no runic record has been graven but at the last sound of the harp there soared over the hill as though he had fluttered from the harp a little bird a 
 charming with ringing voice of the thrush with the 
 moving voice pathos of the human heart with a voice that told of 
 home like the voice that is heard by the bird of passage the 
 soared away over mountain and valley over field and 
 wood he was the bird of popular song who never dies 
 
 we hear his song we hear it now in the room while the white 
 bees are swarming without and the storm clutches the windows the 
 bird sings not alone the requiem of heroes he sings also sweet gentle 
 songs of love so many and so warm of northern fidelity and truth 
 he has stories in words and in tones he has proverbs and snatches of proverbs songs which like runes laid under a dead tongue 
 force him to speak and thus popular song tells of the land of his 
 birth 
 
 in the old heathen days in the times of the vikings the popular speech was enshrined in the harp of the bard 
 
 in the days of knightly castles when the strongest fist held 
 the scales of justice when only might was right and a peasant and 
 a dog were of equal importance where did the bird of song find 
 shelter and protection neither violence nor stupidity gave him a 
 thought 
 
 but in the gabled window of the knightly castle the lady of the 
 castle sat with the parchment roll before her and wrote down the 
 old recollections in song and legend while near her stood the old 
 woman from the wood and the travelling peddler who went wandering through the country as these told their tales there fluttered around them with twittering and song the bird of popular song who never dies so long as the earth has a hill upon which his foot may rest 
 
 and now he looks in upon us and sings without are the night and 
 the he lays the runes beneath our tongues and we know the land of our home heaven speaks to us in our native tongue in the voice of the bird of popular song the old remembrances awake the faded colors glow with a fresh lustre and story and song pour us a blessed draught which lifts up our minds and our thoughts so that the evening becomes as a christmas festival 
 
 the chase each other the ice cracks the storm 
 rules without for he has the might he is lord but not the lord of 
 all 
 
 it is winter time the wind is sharp as a sword the 
 chase each other it seems as though it had been snowing 
 for days and weeks and the snow lies like a great mountain over the 
 whole town like a heavy dream of the winter night everything on 
 the earth is hidden away only the golden cross of the church the 
 symbol of faith arises over the snow grave and gleams in the blue 
 air and in the bright sunshine 
 
 and over the buried town fly the birds of heaven the small and 
 the great they twitter and they sing as best they may each bird with 
 his beak 
 
 first comes the band of sparrows they pipe at every trifle in the 
 streets and lanes in the nests and the houses they have stories to 
 tell about the front buildings and the back buildings 
 
 we know the buried town they say everything living in it is 
 piep piep piep 
 
 the black ravens and crows flew on over the white snow 
 
 grub grub they cried something to be got down there 
 something to swallow and most important the opinion of most of them down there and the opinion is 
 the wild swans come flying on whirring pinions and sing of the 
 noble and the great that will still sprout in the hearts of men down 
 in the town which is resting beneath its snowy veil 
 
 no death is there life reigns yonder we hear it on the notes 
 that swell onward like the tones of the church organ which seize us 
 like sounds from the like the songs of ossian like the 
 rushing swoop of the wandering spirits wings what harmony that 
 harmony speaks to our hearts and lifts up our souls it is the bird 
 of popular song whom we hear 
 
 and at this moment the warm breath of heaven blows down from the 
 sky there are gaps in the snowy mountains the sun shines into the 
 clefts spring is coming the birds are returning and new races are 
 coming with the same home sounds in their hearts 
 
 hear the story of the year the night of the the 
 heavy dream of the winter night all shall be dissolved all shall 
 rise again in the beauteous notes of the bird of popular song who 
 never dies

 then the old bard struck the strings of his harp and sang of 
 the youthful courage of the hero of the strength of the man and of 
 the greatness of his good deeds then the face of the dead one gleamed like the margin of the cloud in the moonlight gladly and of good courage the form arose in splendor and in majesty and vanished like the glancing of the northern light nought was to be seen but the green tufy mound with the stones on which no runic record has been graven but at the last sound of the harp there soared over the hill as though he had fluttered from the harp a little bird a 
 charming with ringing voice of the thrush with the 
 moving voice pathos of the human heart with a voice that told of 
 home like the voice that is heard by the bird of passage the 
 soared away over mountain and valley over field and 
 wood he was the bird of popular song who never dies 
 
 we hear his song we hear it now in the room while the white 
 bees are swarming without and the storm clutches the windows the 
 bird sings not alone the requiem of heroes he sings also sweet gentle 
 songs of love so many and so warm of northern fidelity and truth 
 he has stories in words and in tones he has proverbs and snatches of proverbs songs which like runes laid under a dead tongue 
 force him to speak and thus popular song tells of the land of his 
 birth 
 
 in the old heathen days in the times of the vikings the popular speech was enshrined in the harp of the bard 
 
 in the days of knightly castles when the strongest fist held 
 the scales of justice when only might was right and a peasant and 
 a dog were of equal importance where did the bird of song find 
 shelter and protection neither violence nor stupidity gave him a 
 thought 
 
 but in the gabled window of the knightly castle the lady of the 
 castle sat with the parchment roll before her and wrote down the 
 old recollections in song and legend while near her stood the old 
 woman from the wood and the travelling peddler who went wandering through the country as these told their tales there fluttered around them with twittering and song the bird of popular song who never dies so long as the earth has a hill upon which his foot may rest 
 
 and now he looks in upon us and sings without are the night and 
 the he lays the runes beneath our tongues and we know the land of our home heaven speaks to us in our native tongue in the voice of the bird of popular song the old remembrances awake the faded colors glow with a fresh lustre and story and song pour us a blessed draught which lifts up our minds and our thoughts so that the evening becomes as a christmas festival 
 
 the chase each other the ice cracks the storm 
 rules without for he has the might he is lord but not the lord of 
 all 
 
 it is winter time the wind is sharp as a sword the 
 chase each other it seems as though it had been snowing 
 for days and weeks and the snow lies like a great mountain over the 
 whole town like a heavy dream of the winter night everything on 
 the earth is hidden away only the golden cross of the church the 
 symbol of faith arises over the snow grave and gleams in the blue 
 air and in the bright sunshine 
 
 and over the buried town fly the birds of heaven the small and 
 the great they twitter and they sing as best they may each bird with 
 his beak 
 
 first comes the band of sparrows they pipe at every trifle in the 
 streets and lanes in the nests and the houses they have stories to 
 tell about the front buildings and the back buildings 
 
 we know the buried town they say everything living in it is 
 piep piep piep 
 
 the black ravens and crows flew on over the white snow 
 
 grub grub they cried something to be got down there 
 something to swallow and most important the opinion of most of them down there and the opinion is 
 the wild swans come flying on whirring pinions and sing of the 
 noble and the great that will still sprout in the hearts of men down 
 in the town which is resting beneath its snowy veil 
 
 no death is there life reigns yonder we hear it on the notes 
 that swell onward like the tones of the church organ which seize us 
 like sounds from the like the songs of ossian like the 
 rushing swoop of the wandering spirits wings what harmony that 
 harmony speaks to our hearts and lifts up our souls it is the bird 
 of popular song whom we hear 
 
 and at this moment the warm breath of heaven blows down from the 
 sky there are gaps in the snowy mountains the sun shines into the 
 clefts spring is coming the birds are returning and new races are 
 coming with the same home sounds in their hearts 
 
 hear the story of the year the night of the the 
 heavy dream of the winter night all shall be dissolved all shall 
 rise again in the beauteous notes of the bird of popular song who 
 never dies

 book away of the twilight 
 chapter i 
 
 the lower chamber 
 on the following day at nightfall jean valjean knocked at the carriage gate of the gillenormand house 
 it was basque who received him basque was in the courtyard at the appointed hour as though he had received his orders 
 it sometimes happens that one says to a servant you will watch for mr so and so when he arrives 
 basque addressed jean valjean without waiting for the latter to approach him 
 monsieur le baron has charged me to inquire whether monsieur desires to go upstairs or to remain below 
 i will remain below replied jean valjean 
 basque who was perfectly respectful opened the door of the and said 
 i will go and inform madame 
 the room which jean valjean entered was a damp vaulted room on the ground floor which served as a cellar on occasion which opened on the street was paved with red squares and was badly lighted by a grated window 
 this chamber was not one of those which are harassed by the the head brush and the broom the dust rested tranquilly there 
 persecution of the spiders was not organized there 
 a fine web which spread far and wide and was very black and ornamented with dead flies formed a wheel on one of the the room which was small and was furnished with a heap of empty bottles piled up in one corner 
 the wall which was daubed with an ochre yellow wash was scaling off in large flakes 
 at one end there was a painted in black with a narrow shelf 
 a fire was burning there which indicated that jean reply 
 i will remain below had been foreseen 
 two were placed at the two corners of the fireplace between the chairs an old bedside rug which displayed more foundation thread than wool had been spread by way of a carpet 
 the chamber was lighted by the fire on the hearth and the twilight falling through the window 
 jean valjean was fatigued 
 for days he had neither eaten nor slept he threw himself into one of the 
 basque returned set a lighted candle on the and retired jean valjean his head drooping and his chin resting on his breast perceived neither basque nor the candle 
 all at once he drew himself up with a start 
 cosette was standing beside him 
 he had not seen her enter but he had felt that she was there 
 he turned round 
 he gazed at her 
 she was adorably lovely but what he was contemplating with that profound gaze was not her beauty but her soul 
 well exclaimed cosette father i knew that you were peculiar but i never should have expected this 
 what an idea 
 marius told me that you wish me to receive you here 
 yes it is my wish 
 i expected that reply 
 good 
 i warn you that i am going to make a scene for you 
 let us begin at the beginning 
 embrace me father 
 and she offered him her cheek 
 jean valjean remained motionless 
 you do not stir 
 i take note of it 
 attitude of guilt but never mind i pardon you 
 jesus christ said 
 offer the other cheek 
 here it is 
 and she presented her other cheek 
 jean valjean did not move 
 it seemed as though his feet were nailed to the pavement 
 this is becoming serious said cosette 
 what have i done to you i declare that i am perplexed 
 you owe me reparation 
 you will dine with us 
 i have dined 
 that is not true 
 i will get m gillenormand to scold you grandfathers are made to reprimand fathers 
 come 
 go upstairs with me to the immediately 
 impossible 
 here cosette lost ground a little 
 she ceased to command and passed to questioning 
 but why and you choose the ugliest chamber in the house in which to see me 
 horrible here 
 thou knowest 
 jean valjean caught himself up 
 you know madame that i am peculiar i have my freaks 
 cosette struck her tiny hands together 
 madame you know more novelties 
 what is the meaning of this 
 jean valjean directed upon her that heartrending smile to which he occasionally had recourse 
 you wished to be madame 
 you are so 
 not for you father 
 do not call me father 
 what 
 call me monsieur jean 
 jean if you like 
 you are no longer my father 
 i am no longer cosette monsieur jean what does this mean why these are revolutions they what has taken place come look me in the face and you live with us 
 and you have my chamber what have i done to you 
 has anything happened 
 nothing 
 well then 
 everything is as usual 
 why do you change your name 
 you have changed yours surely 
 he smiled again with the same smile as before and added 
 since you are madame pontmercy i certainly can be monsieur jean 
 i understand anything about it 
 all this is idiotic i shall ask permission of my husband for you to be monsieur jean i hope that he will not consent to it 
 you cause me a great deal of pain 
 one does have freaks but one does not cause little cosette grief 
 that is wrong 
 you have no right to be wicked you who are so good 
 he made no reply 
 she seized his hands with vivacity and raising them to her face with an irresistible movement she pressed them against her neck beneath her chin which is a gesture of profound tenderness 
 oh she said to him be good 
 and she went on 
 this is what i call being good 
 being nice and coming and living here there are birds here as there are in the rue with us quitting that hole of a rue de arme not giving us riddles to guess being like all the rest of the world dining with us breakfasting with us being my father 
 he loosed her hands 
 you no longer need a father you have a husband 
 cosette became angry 
 i no longer need a father 
 one really does not know what to say to things like that which are not common sense 
 if toussaint were here resumed jean valjean like a person who is driven to seek authorities and who clutches at every branch she would be the first to agree that it is true that i have always had ways of my own 
 there is nothing new in this 
 i always have loved my black corner 
 but it is cold here 
 one cannot see distinctly 
 it is abominable that it is to wish to be monsieur jean 
 i will not have you say you to me 
 just now as i was coming hither replied jean valjean i saw a piece of furniture in the rue saint louis 
 it was at a if i were a pretty woman i would treat myself to that bit of furniture 
 a very neat toilet table in the reigning style 
 what you call rosewood i think 
 it is inlaid the mirror is quite large 
 there are drawers 
 it is pretty 
 hou the villainous bear replied cosette 
 and with supreme grace setting her teeth and drawing back her lips she blew at jean valjean 
 she was a grace copying a cat 
 i am furious she resumed 
 ever since yesterday you have made me rage all of you 
 i am greatly vexed 
 i understand 
 you do not defend me against marius 
 marius will not uphold me against you i am all alone 
 i arrange a chamber prettily 
 if i could have put the good god there i would have done it 
 my chamber is left on my hands my lodger sends me into bankruptcy 
 i order a nice little dinner of nicolette 
 we will have nothing to do with your dinner madame and my father fauchelevent wants me to call him monsieur jean and to receive him in a frightful old ugly cellar where the walls have beards and where the crystal consists of empty bottles and the curtains are of spiders webs 
 you are singular i admit that is your style but people who get married are granted a truce you ought not to have begun being singular again instantly so you are going to be perfectly contented in your abominable rue de arme 
 i was very desperate indeed there that i was what have you against me 
 you cause me a great deal of grief fi 
 and becoming suddenly serious she gazed intently at jean valjean and added 
 are you angry with me because i am happy 
 ingenuousness sometimes unconsciously penetrates deep 
 this question which was simple for cosette was profound for jean valjean cosette had meant to scratch and she lacerated 
 jean valjean turned pale 
 he remained for a moment without replying then with an inexpressible intonation and speaking to himself he murmured 
 her happiness was the object of my life 
 now god may sign my dismissal 
 cosette thou art happy my day is over 
 ah you have said thou to me exclaimed cosette 
 and she sprang to his neck 
 jean valjean in bewilderment strained her wildly to his breast it almost seemed to him as though he were taking her back 
 thanks father said cosette 
 this enthusiastic impulse was on the point of becoming poignant for jean valjean 
 he gently removed arms and took his hat 
 well said cosette 
 i leave you madame they are waiting for you 
 and from the threshold he added 
 i have said thou to you 
 tell your husband that this shall not happen again 
 pardon me 
 jean valjean quitted the room leaving cosette stupefied at this enigmatical farewell

 when an event is taking place people express their opinions and wishes about it and as the event results from the collective activity of many people some one of the opinions or wishes expressed is sure to be fulfilled if but approximately when one of the opinions expressed is fulfilled that opinion gets connected with the event as a command preceding it 
 men are hauling a log each of them expresses his opinion as to how and where to haul it they haul the log away and it happens that this is done as one of them said he ordered it there we have command and power in their primary form the man who worked most with his hands could not think so much about what he was doing or reflect on or command what would result from the common activity while the man who commanded more would evidently work less with his hands on account of his greater verbal activity 
 when some larger concourse of men direct their activity to a common aim there is a yet sharper division of those who because their activity is given to directing and commanding take less less part in the direct work 
 when a man works alone he always has a certain set of reflections which as it seems to him directed his past activity justify his present activity and guide him in planning his future actions just the same is done by a concourse of people allowing those who do not take a direct part in the activity to devise considerations justifications and surmises concerning their collective activity 
 for reasons known or unknown to us the french began to drown and kill one another and corresponding to the event its justification appears in belief that this was necessary for the welfare of france for liberty and for equality people ceased to kill one another and this event was accompanied by its justification in the necessity for a centralization of power resistance to europe and so on men went from the west to the east killing their fellow men and the event was accompanied by phrases about the glory of france the baseness of england and so on history shows us that these justifications of the events have no common sense and are all contradictory as in the case of killing a man as the result of recognizing his rights and the killing of millions in russia for the humiliation of england but these justifications have a very necessary significance in their own day 
 these justifications release those who produce the events from moral responsibility these temporary aims are like the broom fixed in front of a locomotive to clear the snow from the rails in front they clear moral responsibilities from their path 
 without such justification there would be no reply to the simplest question that presents itself when examining each historical event how is it that millions of men commit collective crimes make war commit murder and so on 
 with the present complex forms of political and social life in europe can any event that is not prescribed decreed or ordered by monarchs ministers parliaments or newspapers be imagined is there any collective action which cannot find its justification in political unity in patriotism in the balance of power or in civilization so that every event that occurs inevitably coincides with some expressed wish and receiving a justification presents itself as the result of the will of one man or of several men 
 in whatever direction a ship moves the flow of the waves it cuts will always be noticeable ahead of it to those on board the ship the movement of those waves will be the only perceptible motion 
 only by watching closely moment by moment the movement of that flow and comparing it with the movement of the ship do we convince ourselves that every bit of it is occasioned by the forward movement of the ship and that we were led into error by the fact that we ourselves were imperceptibly moving 
 we see the same if we watch moment by moment the movement of historical characters that is the inevitable condition of all that occurs the continuity of movement in time and do not lose sight of the essential connection of historical persons with the masses 
 when the ship moves in one direction there is one and the same wave ahead of it when it turns frequently the wave ahead of it also turns frequently but wherever it may turn there always will be the wave anticipating its movement 
 whatever happens it always appears that just that event was foreseen and decreed wherever the ship may go the rush of water which neither directs nor increases its movement foams ahead of it and at a distance seems to us not merely to move of itself but to govern the movement also 
 examining only those expressions of the will of historical persons which as commands were related to events historians have assumed that the events depended on those commands but examining the events themselves and the connection in which the historical persons stood to the people we have found that they and their orders were dependent on events the incontestable proof of this deduction is that however many commands were issued the event does not take place unless there are other causes for it but as soon as an event occurs be it what it may then out of all the continually expressed wishes of different people some will always be found which by their meaning and their time of utterance are related as commands to the events 
 arriving at this conclusion we can reply directly and positively to these two essential questions of history 
 what is power 
 what force produces the movement of the nations 
 power is the relation of a given person to other individuals in which the more this person expresses opinions predictions and justifications of the collective action that is performed the less is his participation in that action 
 the movement of nations is caused not by power nor by intellectual activity nor even by a combination of the two as historians have supposed but by the activity of all the people who participate in the events and who always combine in such a way that those taking the largest direct share in the event take on themselves the least responsibility and vice versa 
 morally the wielder of power appears to cause the event physically it is those who submit to the power but as the moral activity is inconceivable without the physical the cause of the event is neither in the one nor in the other but in the union of the two 
 or in other words the conception of a cause is inapplicable to the phenomena we are examining 
 in the last analysis we reach the circle of infinity that final limit to which in every domain of thought reason arrives if it is not playing with the subject electricity produces heat heat produces electricity atoms attract each other and atoms repel one another 
 speaking of the interaction of heat and electricity and of atoms we cannot say why this occurs and we say that it is so because it is inconceivable otherwise because it must be so and that it is a law the same applies to historical events why war and revolution occur we do not know we only know that to produce the one or the other action people combine in a certain formation in which they all take part and we say that this is so because it is unthinkable otherwise or in other words that it is a law

 morally the wielder of power appears to cause the event physically it is those who submit to the power but as the moral activity is inconceivable without the physical the cause of the event is neither in the one nor in the other but in the union of the two 
 or in other words the conception of a cause is inapplicable to the phenomena we are examining 
 in the last analysis we reach the circle of infinity that final limit to which in every domain of thought reason arrives if it is not playing with the subject electricity produces heat heat produces electricity atoms attract each other and atoms repel one another 
 speaking of the interaction of heat and electricity and of atoms we cannot say why this occurs and we say that it is so because it is inconceivable otherwise because it must be so and that it is a law the same applies to historical events why war and revolution occur we do not know we only know that to produce the one or the other action people combine in a certain formation in which they all take part and we say that this is so because it is unthinkable otherwise or in other words that it is a law

 chapter viii 
 
 if history dealt only with external phenomena the establishment of this simple and obvious law would suffice and we should have finished our argument but the law of history relates to man a particle of matter cannot tell us that it does not feel the law of attraction or repulsion and that that law is untrue but man who is the subject of history says plainly i am free and am therefore not subject to the law 
 the presence of the problem of free will though unexpressed is felt at every step of history 
 all seriously thinking historians have involuntarily encountered this question all the contradictions and obscurities of history and the false path historical science has followed are due solely to the lack of a solution of that question 
 if the will of every man were free that is if each man could act as he pleased all history would be a series of disconnected incidents 
 if in a thousand years even one man in a million could act freely that is as he chose it is evident that one single free act of that in violation of the laws governing human action would destroy the possibility of the existence of any laws for the whole of humanity 
 if there be a single law governing the actions of men free will cannot exist for then will is subject to that law 
 in this contradiction lies the problem of free will which from most ancient times has occupied the best human minds and from most ancient times has been presented in its whole tremendous significance 
 the problem is that regarding man as a subject of observation from whatever point of view theological historical ethical or philosophic we find a general law of necessity to which he like all that exists is subject but regarding him from within ourselves as what we are conscious of we feel ourselves to be free 
 this consciousness is a source of quite apart from and independent of reason through his reason man observes himself but only through consciousness does he know himself 
 apart from consciousness of self no observation or application of reason is conceivable 
 to understand observe and draw conclusions man must first of all be conscious of himself as living a man is only conscious of himself as a living being by the fact that he wills that is is conscious of his volition but his will which forms the essence of his life man recognizes and can but recognize as free 
 if observing himself man sees that his will is always directed by one and the same law whether he observes the necessity of taking food using his brain or anything else he cannot recognize this direction of his will otherwise than as a limitation of it were it not free it could not be limited a will seems to him to be limited just because he is not conscious of it except as free 
 you say i am not and am not free but i have lifted my hand and let it fall everyone understands that this illogical reply is an irrefutable demonstration of freedom 
 that reply is the expression of a consciousness that is not subject to reason 
 if the consciousness of freedom were not a separate and independent source of it would be subject to reasoning and to experience but in fact such subjection does not exist and is inconceivable 
 a series of experiments and arguments proves to every man that he as an object of observation is subject to certain laws and man submits to them and never resists the laws of gravity or impermeability once he has become acquainted with them but the same series of experiments and arguments proves to him that the complete freedom of which he is conscious in himself is impossible and that his every action depends on his organization his character and the motives acting upon him yet man never submits to the deductions of these experiments and arguments having learned from experiment and argument that a stone falls downwards a man indubitably believes this and always expects the law that he has learned to be fulfilled 
 but learning just as certainly that his will is subject to laws he does not and cannot believe this 
 however often experiment and reasoning may show a man that under the same conditions and with the same character he will do the same thing as before yet when under the same conditions and with the same character he approaches for the thousandth time the action that always ends in the same way he feels as certainly convinced as before the experiment that he can act as he pleases every man savage or sage however incontestably reason and experiment may prove to him that it is impossible to imagine two different courses of action in precisely the same conditions feels that without this irrational conception which constitutes the essence of freedom he cannot imagine life he feels that however impossible it may be it is so for without this conception of freedom not only would he be unable to understand life but he would be unable to live for a single moment 
 he could not live because all efforts all his impulses to life are only efforts to increase freedom wealth and poverty fame and obscurity power and subordination strength and weakness health and disease culture and ignorance work and leisure repletion and hunger virtue and vice are only greater or lesser degrees of freedom 
 a man having no freedom cannot be conceived of except as deprived of life 
 if the conception of freedom appears to reason to be a senseless contradiction like the possibility of performing two actions at one and the same instant of time or of an effect without a cause that only proves that consciousness is not subject to reason 
 this unshakable irrefutable consciousness of freedom uncontrolled by experiment or argument recognized by all thinkers and felt by everyone without exception this consciousness without which no conception of man is possible constitutes the other side of the question 
 man is the creation of an and god what is sin the conception of which arises from the consciousness of freedom that is a question for theology 
 the actions of men are subject to general immutable laws expressed in statistics what is responsibility to society the conception of which results from the conception of freedom that is a question for jurisprudence 
 actions proceed from his innate character and the motives acting upon him what is conscience and the perception of right and wrong in actions that follows from the consciousness of freedom that is a question for ethics 
 man in connection with the general life of humanity appears subject to laws which determine that life but the same man apart from that connection appears to free how should the past life of nations and of humanity be regarded as the result of the free or as the result of the constrained activity of man that is a question for history 
 only in our day of the popularization of knowledge thanks to that most powerful engine of ignorance the diffusion of printed matter has the question of the freedom of will been put on a level on which the question itself cannot exist in our time the majority of advanced people that is the crowd of ignoramuses have taken the work of the naturalists who deal with one side of the question for a solution of the whole problem 
 they say and write and print that the soul and freedom do not exist for the life of man is expressed by muscular movements and muscular movements are conditioned by the activity of the nerves the soul and free will do not exist because at an unknown period of time we sprang from the apes they say this not at all suspecting that thousands of years ago that same law of necessity which with such ardor they are now trying to prove by physiology and comparative zoology was not merely acknowledged by all the religions and all the thinkers but has never been denied they do not see that the role of the natural sciences in this matter is merely to serve as an instrument for the illumination of one side of it for the fact that from the point of view of observation reason and the will are merely secretions of the brain and that man following the general law may have developed from lower animals at some unknown period of time only explains from a fresh side the truth admitted thousands of years ago by all the religious and philosophic theories that from the point of view of reason man is subject to the law of necessity but it does not advance by a breadth the solution of the question which has another opposite side based on the consciousness of freedom 
 if men descended from the apes at an unknown period of time that is as comprehensible as that they were made from a handful of earth at a certain period of time in the first case the unknown quantity is the time in the second case it is the origin and the question of how consciousness of freedom is to be reconciled with the law of necessity to which he is subject cannot be solved by comparative physiology and zoology for in a frog a rabbit or an ape we can observe only the muscular nervous activity but in man we observe consciousness as well as the muscular and nervous activity 
 the naturalists and their followers thinking they can solve this question are like plasterers set to plaster one side of the walls of a church who availing themselves of the absence of the chief superintendent of the work should in an access of zeal plaster over the windows icons woodwork and still unbuttressed walls and should be delighted that from their point of view as plasterers everything is now so smooth and regular

 book away of the twilight 
 chapter iii 
 
 they recall the garden of the rue plumet 
 this was the last time 
 after that last flash of light complete extinction ensued 
 no more familiarity no more with a kiss never more that word so profoundly sweet 
 my father he was at his own request and through his own complicity driven out of all his happinesses one after the other and he had this sorrow that after having lost cosette wholly in one day he was afterwards obliged to lose her again in detail 
 the eye eventually becomes accustomed to the light of a cellar in short it sufficed for him to have an apparition of cosette every day 
 his whole life was concentrated in that one hour 
 he seated himself close to her he gazed at her in silence or he talked to her of years gone by of her childhood of the convent of her little friends of those bygone days 
 one was on one of those early days in april already warm and fresh the moment of the great gayety the gardens which surrounded the windows of marius and cosette felt the emotion of waking the hawthorn was on the point of budding a jewelled garniture of gillyflowers spread over the ancient walls snapdragons yawned through the crevices of the stones amid the grass there was a charming beginning of daisies and buttercups the white butterflies of the year were making their first appearance the wind that minstrel of the eternal wedding was trying in the trees the first notes of that grand auroral symphony which the old poets called the said to said that we would go back to take a look at our garden in the rue plumet let us go thither 
 we must not be away they flitted like two swallows towards the spring 
 this garden of the rue plumet produced on them the effect of the dawn 
 they already had behind them in life something which was like the springtime of their love 
 the house in the rue plumet being held on a lease still belonged to cosette 
 they went to that garden and that house there they found themselves again there they forgot themselves that evening at the usual hour jean valjean came to the rue des went out with monsieur and has not yet returned basque said to him 
 he seated himself in silence and waited an hour 
 cosette did not return 
 he departed with drooping head 
 cosette was so intoxicated with her walk to their garden and so joyous at having lived a whole day in her past that she talked of nothing else on the morrow 
 she did not notice that she had not seen jean valjean 
 in what way did you go thither 
 jean valjean asked her 
 on foot 
 and how did you return 
 in a hackney carriage 
 for some time jean valjean had noticed the economical life led by the young people 
 he was troubled by it 
 marius economy was severe and that word had its absolute meaning for jean valjean he hazarded a query 
 why do you not have a carriage of your own 
 a pretty coupe would only cost you five hundred francs a month 
 you are rich 
 i know replied cosette 
 it is like toussaint resumed jean valjean 
 she is gone you have not replaced her 
 why 
 nicolette suffices 
 but you ought to have a maid 
 have i not marius 
 you ought to have a house of your own your own servants a carriage a box at the theatre 
 there is nothing too fine for you why not profit by your riches 
 wealth adds to happiness 
 cosette made no reply 
 jean visits were not abridged 
 far from it 
 when it is the heart which is slipping one does not halt on the downward slope 
 when jean valjean wished to prolong his visit and to induce forgetfulness of the hour he sang the praises of marius he pronounced him handsome noble courageous witty eloquent good 
 cosette outdid him jean valjean began again 
 they were never weary 
 word was inexhaustible those six letters contained volumes in this manner jean valjean contrived to remain a long time 
 it was so sweet to see cosette to forget by her side 
 it alleviated his wounds 
 it frequently happened that basque came twice to announce m gillenormand sends me to remind madame la baronne that dinner is served 
 on those days jean valjean was very thoughtful on his return home 
 was there then any truth in that comparison of the chrysalis which had presented itself to the mind of marius 
 was jean valjean really a chrysalis who would persist and who would come to visit his butterfly 
 one day he remained still longer than usual 
 on the following day he observed that there was no fire on the he thought no he furnished the explanation for is perfectly simple 
 it is april 
 the cold weather has ceased 
 heavens how cold it is here exclaimed cosette when she entered 
 why no said jean valjean 
 was it you who told basque not to make a fire then 
 yes since we are now in the month of may 
 but we have a fire until june 
 one is needed all the year in this cellar 
 i thought that a fire was unnecessary 
 that is exactly like one of your ideas retorted cosette 
 on the following day there was a fire 
 but the two were arranged at the other end of the room near the door what is the meaning of this thought jean valjean 
 he went for the and restored them to their ordinary place near the hearth 
 this fire lighted once more encouraged him however 
 he prolonged the conversation even beyond its customary limits 
 as he rose to take his leave cosette said to him 
 my husband said a queer thing to me yesterday 
 what was it 
 he said to me 
 cosette we have an income of thirty thousand livres that you own and three that my grandfather gives me 
 i replied 
 that makes thirty 
 he went on would you have the courage to live on the three thousand i answered 
 yes on nothing 
 provided that it was with you and then i asked 
 why do you say that to me 
 he replied i wanted to know 
 jean valjean found not a word to answer 
 cosette probably expected some explanation from him he listened in gloomy silence he went back to the rue de arme he was so deeply absorbed that he mistook the door and instead of entering his own house he entered the adjoining dwelling 
 it was only after having ascended nearly two stories that he perceived his error and went down again 
 his mind was swarming with conjectures 
 it was evident that marius had his doubts as to the origin of the six hundred thousand francs that he feared some source that was not pure who knows that he had even perhaps discovered that the money came from him jean valjean that he hesitated before this suspicious fortune and was disinclined to take it as his that both he and cosette should remain poor rather than that they should be rich with wealth that was not clean 
 moreover jean valjean began vaguely to surmise that he was being shown the door 
 on the following day he underwent something like a shock on entering the room 
 the had disappeared there was not a single chair of any sort 
 ah this exclaimed cosette as she entered no chairs where are the 
 they are no longer here replied jean valjean 
 this is too much 
 jean valjean stammered 
 it was i who told basque to remove them 
 and your reason 
 i have only a few minutes to stay 
 a brief stay is no reason for remaining standing 
 i think that basque needed the chairs for the 
 why 
 you have company this evening no doubt 
 we expect no one 
 jean valjean had not another word to say 
 cosette shrugged her shoulders 
 to have the chairs carried off 
 the other day you had the fire put out 
 how odd you are 
 adieu murmured jean valjean 
 he did not say 
 adieu cosette 
 but he had not the strength to say adieu madame 
 he went away utterly overwhelmed 
 this time he had understood 
 on the following day he did not come 
 cosette only observed the fact in the evening 
 why said she monsieur jean has not been here today 
 and she felt a slight twinge at her heart but she hardly perceived it being immediately diverted by a kiss from marius 
 on the following day he did not come 
 cosette paid no heed to this passed her evening and slept well that night as usual and thought of it only when she woke she was so happy 
 she speedily despatched nicolette to m house to inquire whether he were ill and why he had not come on the previous evening 
 nicolette brought back the reply of m jean that he was not ill 
 he was busy 
 he would come soon as soon as he was able 
 moreover he was on the point of taking a little journey 
 madame must remember that it was his custom to take trips from time to time 
 they were not to worry about him they were not to think of him 
 nicolette on entering m had repeated to him her mistress very words 
 that madame had sent her to inquire why m jean bad not come on the preceding is two days since i have been there said jean valjean gently 
 but the remark passed unnoticed by nicolette who did not report it to cosette

 book away of the twilight 
 chapter iii 
 
 they recall the garden of the rue plumet 
 this was the last time 
 after that last flash of light complete extinction ensued 
 no more familiarity no more with a kiss never more that word so profoundly sweet 
 my father he was at his own request and through his own complicity driven out of all his happinesses one after the other and he had this sorrow that after having lost cosette wholly in one day he was afterwards obliged to lose her again in detail 
 the eye eventually becomes accustomed to the light of a cellar in short it sufficed for him to have an apparition of cosette every day 
 his whole life was concentrated in that one hour 
 he seated himself close to her he gazed at her in silence or he talked to her of years gone by of her childhood of the convent of her little friends of those bygone days 
 one was on one of those early days in april already warm and fresh the moment of the great gayety the gardens which surrounded the windows of marius and cosette felt the emotion of waking the hawthorn was on the point of budding a jewelled garniture of gillyflowers spread over the ancient walls snapdragons yawned through the crevices of the stones amid the grass there was a charming beginning of daisies and buttercups the white butterflies of the year were making their first appearance the wind that minstrel of the eternal wedding was trying in the trees the first notes of that grand auroral symphony which the old poets called the said to said that we would go back to take a look at our garden in the rue plumet let us go thither 
 we must not be away they flitted like two swallows towards the spring 
 this garden of the rue plumet produced on them the effect of the dawn 
 they already had behind them in life something which was like the springtime of their love 
 the house in the rue plumet being held on a lease still belonged to cosette 
 they went to that garden and that house there they found themselves again there they forgot themselves that evening at the usual hour jean valjean came to the rue des went out with monsieur and has not yet returned basque said to him 
 he seated himself in silence and waited an hour 
 cosette did not return 
 he departed with drooping head 
 cosette was so intoxicated with her walk to their garden and so joyous at having lived a whole day in her past that she talked of nothing else on the morrow 
 she did not notice that she had not seen jean valjean 
 in what way did you go thither 
 jean valjean asked her 
 on foot 
 and how did you return 
 in a hackney carriage 
 for some time jean valjean had noticed the economical life led by the young people 
 he was troubled by it 
 marius economy was severe and that word had its absolute meaning for jean valjean he hazarded a query 
 why do you not have a carriage of your own 
 a pretty coupe would only cost you five hundred francs a month 
 you are rich 
 i know replied cosette 
 it is like toussaint resumed jean valjean 
 she is gone you have not replaced her 
 why 
 nicolette suffices 
 but you ought to have a maid 
 have i not marius 
 you ought to have a house of your own your own servants a carriage a box at the theatre 
 there is nothing too fine for you why not profit by your riches 
 wealth adds to happiness 
 cosette made no reply 
 jean visits were not abridged 
 far from it 
 when it is the heart which is slipping one does not halt on the downward slope 
 when jean valjean wished to prolong his visit and to induce forgetfulness of the hour he sang the praises of marius he pronounced him handsome noble courageous witty eloquent good 
 cosette outdid him jean valjean began again 
 they were never weary 
 word was inexhaustible those six letters contained volumes in this manner jean valjean contrived to remain a long time 
 it was so sweet to see cosette to forget by her side 
 it alleviated his wounds 
 it frequently happened that basque came twice to announce m gillenormand sends me to remind madame la baronne that dinner is served 
 on those days jean valjean was very thoughtful on his return home 
 was there then any truth in that comparison of the chrysalis which had presented itself to the mind of marius 
 was jean valjean really a chrysalis who would persist and who would come to visit his butterfly 
 one day he remained still longer than usual 
 on the following day he observed that there was no fire on the he thought no he furnished the explanation for is perfectly simple 
 it is april 
 the cold weather has ceased 
 heavens how cold it is here exclaimed cosette when she entered 
 why no said jean valjean 
 was it you who told basque not to make a fire then 
 yes since we are now in the month of may 
 but we have a fire until june 
 one is needed all the year in this cellar 
 i thought that a fire was unnecessary 
 that is exactly like one of your ideas retorted cosette 
 on the following day there was a fire 
 but the two were arranged at the other end of the room near the door what is the meaning of this thought jean valjean 
 he went for the and restored them to their ordinary place near the hearth 
 this fire lighted once more encouraged him however 
 he prolonged the conversation even beyond its customary limits 
 as he rose to take his leave cosette said to him 
 my husband said a queer thing to me yesterday 
 what was it 
 he said to me 
 cosette we have an income of thirty thousand livres that you own and three that my grandfather gives me 
 i replied 
 that makes thirty 
 he went on would you have the courage to live on the three thousand i answered 
 yes on nothing 
 provided that it was with you and then i asked 
 why do you say that to me 
 he replied i wanted to know 
 jean valjean found not a word to answer 
 cosette probably expected some explanation from him he listened in gloomy silence he went back to the rue de arme he was so deeply absorbed that he mistook the door and instead of entering his own house he entered the adjoining dwelling 
 it was only after having ascended nearly two stories that he perceived his error and went down again 
 his mind was swarming with conjectures 
 it was evident that marius had his doubts as to the origin of the six hundred thousand francs that he feared some source that was not pure who knows that he had even perhaps discovered that the money came from him jean valjean that he hesitated before this suspicious fortune and was disinclined to take it as his that both he and cosette should remain poor rather than that they should be rich with wealth that was not clean 
 moreover jean valjean began vaguely to surmise that he was being shown the door 
 on the following day he underwent something like a shock on entering the room 
 the had disappeared there was not a single chair of any sort 
 ah this exclaimed cosette as she entered no chairs where are the 
 they are no longer here replied jean valjean 
 this is too much 
 jean valjean stammered 
 it was i who told basque to remove them 
 and your reason 
 i have only a few minutes to stay 
 a brief stay is no reason for remaining standing 
 i think that basque needed the chairs for the 
 why 
 you have company this evening no doubt 
 we expect no one 
 jean valjean had not another word to say 
 cosette shrugged her shoulders 
 to have the chairs carried off 
 the other day you had the fire put out 
 how odd you are 
 adieu murmured jean valjean 
 he did not say 
 adieu cosette 
 but he had not the strength to say adieu madame 
 he went away utterly overwhelmed 
 this time he had understood 
 on the following day he did not come 
 cosette only observed the fact in the evening 
 why said she monsieur jean has not been here today 
 and she felt a slight twinge at her heart but she hardly perceived it being immediately diverted by a kiss from marius

 second epilogue 
 chapter ix 
 
 for the solution of the question of free will or inevitability history has this advantage over other branches of knowledge in which the question is dealt with that for history this question does not refer to the essence of free will but its manifestation in the past and under certain conditions 
 in regard to this question history stands to the other sciences as experimental science stands to abstract science 
 the subject for history is not will itself but our presentation of it 
 and so for history the insoluble mystery presented by the incompatibility of free will and inevitability does not exist as it does for theology ethics and philosophy history surveys a presentation of life in which the union of these two contradictions has already taken place 
 in actual life each historic event each human action is very clearly and definitely understood without any sense of contradiction although each event presents itself as partly free and partly compulsory 
 to solve the question of how freedom and necessity are combined and what constitutes the essence of these two conceptions the philosophy of history can and should follow a path contrary to that taken by other sciences instead of first defining the conceptions of freedom and inevitability in themselves and then ranging the phenomena of life under those definitions history should deduce a definition of the conception of freedom and inevitability themselves from the immense quantity of phenomena of which it is cognizant and that always appear dependent on these two elements 
 whatever presentation of the activity of many men or of an individual we may consider we always regard it as the result partly of free will and partly of the law of inevitability 
 whether we speak of the migration of the peoples and the incursions of the barbarians or of the decrees of napoleon iii or of action an hour ago in choosing one direction out of several for his walk we are unconscious of any contradiction the degree of freedom and inevitability governing the actions of these people is clearly defined for us 
 our conception of the degree of freedom often varies according to differences in the point of view from which we regard the event but every human action appears to us as a certain combination of freedom and inevitability in every action we examine we see a certain measure of freedom and a certain measure of inevitability and always the more freedom we see in any action the less inevitability do we perceive and the more inevitability the less freedom 
 the proportion of freedom to inevitability decreases and increases according to the point of view from which the action is regarded but their relation is always one of inverse proportion 
 a sinking man who clutches at another and drowns him or a hungry mother exhausted by feeding her baby who steals some food or a man trained to discipline who on duty at the word of command kills a defenseless man seem less guilty that is less free and more subject to the law of necessity to one who knows the circumstances in which these people were placed and more free to one who does not know that the man was himself drowning that the mother was hungry that the soldier was in the ranks and so on similarly a man who committed a murder twenty years ago and has since lived peaceably and harmlessly in society seems less guilty and his action more due to the law of inevitability to someone who considers his action after twenty years have elapsed than to one who examined it the day after it was committed and in the same way every action of an insane intoxicated or highly excited man appears less free and more inevitable to one who knows the mental condition of him who committed the action and seems more free and less inevitable to one who does not know it in all these cases the conception of freedom is increased or diminished and the conception of compulsion is correspondingly decreased or increased according to the point of view from which the action is regarded so that the greater the conception of necessity the smaller the conception of freedom and vice versa 
 religion the common sense of mankind the science of jurisprudence and history itself understand alike this relation between necessity and freedom 
 all cases without exception in which our conception of freedom and necessity is increased and diminished depend on three considerations 
 the relation to the external world of the man who commits the deeds 
 his relation to time 
 his relation to the causes leading to the action 
 the first consideration is the clearness of our perception of the relation to the external world and the greater or lesser clearness of our understanding of the definite position occupied by the man in relation to everything coexisting with him this is what makes it evident that a drowning man is less free and more subject to necessity than one standing on dry ground and that makes the actions of a man closely connected with others in a thickly populated district or of one bound by family official or business duties seem certainly less free and more subject to necessity than those of a man living in solitude and seclusion 
 if we consider a man alone apart from his relation to everything around him each action of his seems to us free but if we see his relation to anything around him if we see his connection with anything whatever with a man who speaks to him a book he reads the work on which he is engaged even with the air he breathes or the light that falls on the things about him we see that each of these circumstances has an influence on him and controls at least some side of his activity and the more we perceive of these influences the more our conception of his freedom diminishes and the more our conception of the necessity that weighs on him increases 
 the second consideration is the more or less evident time relation of the man to the world and the clearness of our perception of the place the action occupies in time that is the ground which makes the fall of the first man resulting in the production of the human race appear evidently less free than a entry into marriage today it is the reason why the life and activity of people who lived centuries ago and are connected with me in time cannot seem to me as free as the life of a contemporary the consequences of which are still unknown to me 
 the degree of our conception of freedom or inevitability depends in this respect on the greater or lesser lapse of time between the performance of the action and our judgment of it 
 if i examine an act i performed a moment ago in approximately the same circumstances as those i am in now my action appears to me undoubtedly free but if i examine an act performed a month ago then being in different circumstances i cannot help recognizing that if that act had not been committed much that resulted from it good agreeable and even essential would not have taken place if i reflect on an action still more remote ten years ago or more then the consequences of my action are still plainer to me and i find it hard to imagine what would have happened had that action not been performed the farther i go back in memory or what is the same thing the farther i go forward in my judgment the more doubtful becomes my belief in the freedom of my action 
 in history we find a very similar progress of conviction concerning the part played by free will in the general affairs of humanity a contemporary event seems to us to be indubitably the doing of all the known participants but with a more remote event we already see its inevitable results which prevent our considering anything else possible and the farther we go back in examining events the less arbitrary do they appear 
 the war appears to us undoubtedly the result of the crafty conduct of bismarck and so on the napoleonic wars still seem to us though already questionably to be the outcome of their heroes will but in the crusades we already see an event occupying its definite place in history and without which we cannot imagine the modern history of europe though to the chroniclers of the crusades that event appeared as merely due to the will of certain people in regard to the migration of the peoples it does not enter head today to suppose that the renovation of the european world depended on caprice the farther back in history the object of our observation lies the more doubtful does the free will of those concerned in the event become and the more manifest the law of inevitability 
 the third consideration is the degree to which we apprehend that endless chain of causation inevitably demanded by reason in which each phenomenon comprehended and therefore every action must have its definite place as a result of what has gone before and as a cause of what will follow 
 the better we are acquainted with the physiological psychological and historical laws deduced by observation and by which man is controlled and the more correctly we perceive the physiological psychological and historical causes of the action and the simpler the action we are observing and the less complex the character and mind of the man in question the more subject to inevitability and the less free do our actions and those of others appear 
 when we do not at all understand the cause of an action whether a crime a good action or even one that is simply nonmoral we ascribe a greater amount of freedom to it in the case of a crime we most urgently demand the punishment for such an act in the case of a virtuous act we rate its merit most highly in an indifferent case we recognize in it more individuality originality and independence but if even one of the innumerable causes of the act is known to us we recognize a certain element of necessity and are less insistent on punishment for the crime or the acknowledgment of the merit of the virtuous act or the freedom of the apparently original action that a criminal was reared among male factors mitigates his fault in our eyes the of a father or mother or with the possibility of a reward is more comprehensible than gratuitous and therefore seems less deserving of sympathy and less the result of free will the founder of a sect or party or an inventor impresses us less when we know how or by what the way was prepared for his activity if we have a large range of examples if our observation is constantly directed to seeking the correlation of cause and effect in actions their actions appear to us more under compulsion and less free the more correctly we connect the effects with the causes if we examined simple actions and had a vast number of such actions under observation our conception of their inevitability would be still greater the dishonest conduct of the son of a dishonest father the misconduct of a woman who had fallen into bad company a relapse into drunkenness and so on are actions that seem to us less free the better we understand their cause if the man whose actions we are considering is on a very low stage of mental development like a child a madman or a simpleton then knowing the causes of the act and the simplicity of the character and intelligence in question we see so large an element of necessity and so little free will that as soon as we know the cause prompting the action we can foretell the result 
 on these three considerations alone is based the conception of irresponsibility for crimes and the extenuating circumstances admitted by all legislative codes the responsibility appears greater or less according to our greater or lesser knowledge of the circumstances in which the man was placed whose action is being judged and according to the greater or lesser interval of time between the commission of the action and its investigation and according to the greater or lesser understanding of the causes that led to the action

 attraction and extinction 
 during the last months of spring and the first months of summer in the rare passersby in the marais the petty shopkeepers the loungers on thresholds noticed an old man neatly clad in black who emerged every day at the same hour towards nightfall from the rue de arme on the side of the rue passed in front of the blancs manteaux gained the rue and on arriving at the rue de turned to the left and entered the rue 
 there he walked at a slow pace with his head strained forward seeing nothing hearing nothing his eye immovably fixed on a point which seemed to be a star to him which never varied and which was no other than the corner of the rue des the nearer he approached the corner of the street the more his eye lighted up a sort of joy illuminated his pupils like an inward aurora he had a fascinated and much affected air his lips indulged in obscure movements as though he were talking to some one whom he did not see he smiled vaguely and advanced as slowly as possible one would have said that while desirous of reaching his destination he feared the moment when he should be close at hand 
 when only a few houses remained between him and that street which appeared to attract him his pace slackened to such a degree that at times one might have thought that he was no longer advancing at all the vacillation of his head and the fixity of his eyeballs suggested the thought of the magnetic needle seeking the pole whatever time he spent on arriving he was obliged to arrive at last he reached the rue des then he halted he trembled he thrust his head with a sort of melancholy timidity round the corner of the last house and gazed into that street and there was in that tragic look something which resembled the dazzling light of the impossible and the reflection from a paradise that was closed to him 
 then a tear which had slowly gathered in the corner of his lids and had become large enough to fall trickled down his cheek and sometimes stopped at his mouth the old man tasted its bitter flavor 
 thus he remained for several minutes as though made of stone then he returned by the same road and with the same step and in proportion as he retreated his glance died out 
 little by little this old man ceased to go as far as the corner of the rue des he halted half way in the rue sometimes a little further off sometimes a little nearer 
 one day he stopped at the corner of the rue and looked at the rue des from a distance then he shook his head slowly from right to left as though refusing himself something and retraced his steps 
 soon he no longer came as far as the rue he got as far as the rue pavee shook his head and turned back then he went no further than the rue des then he did not overstep the one would have said that he was a pendulum which was no longer wound up and whose oscillations were growing shorter before ceasing altogether 
 every day he emerged from his house at the same hour he undertook the same trip but he no longer completed it and perhaps without himself being aware of the fact he constantly shortened it his whole countenance expressed this single idea 
 what is the use his eye was dim no more radiance 
 his tears were also exhausted they no longer collected in the corner of his that thoughtful eye was dry 
 the old head was still craned forward his chin moved at times the folds in his gaunt neck were painful to behold sometimes when the weather was bad he had an umbrella under his arm but he never opened it 
 the good women of the quarter said 
 he is an innocent the children followed him and laughed

 when only a few houses remained between him and that street which appeared to attract him his pace slackened to such a degree that at times one might have thought that he was no longer advancing at all the vacillation of his head and the fixity of his eyeballs suggested the thought of the magnetic needle seeking the pole whatever time he spent on arriving he was obliged to arrive at last he reached the rue des then he halted he trembled he thrust his head with a sort of melancholy timidity round the corner of the last house and gazed into that street and there was in that tragic look something which resembled the dazzling light of the impossible and the reflection from a paradise that was closed to him 
 then a tear which had slowly gathered in the corner of his lids and had become large enough to fall trickled down his cheek and sometimes stopped at his mouth the old man tasted its bitter flavor 
 thus he remained for several minutes as though made of stone then he returned by the same road and with the same step and in proportion as he retreated his glance died out 
 little by little this old man ceased to go as far as the corner of the rue des he halted half way in the rue sometimes a little further off sometimes a little nearer 
 one day he stopped at the corner of the rue and looked at the rue des from a distance then he shook his head slowly from right to left as though refusing himself something and retraced his steps 
 soon he no longer came as far as the rue he got as far as the rue pavee shook his head and turned back then he went no further than the rue des then he did not overstep the one would have said that he was a pendulum which was no longer wound up and whose oscillations were growing shorter before ceasing altogether 
 every day he emerged from his house at the same hour he undertook the same trip but he no longer completed it and perhaps without himself being aware of the fact he constantly shortened it his whole countenance expressed this single idea 
 what is the use his eye was dim no more radiance 
 his tears were also exhausted they no longer collected in the corner of his that thoughtful eye was dry 
 the old head was still craned forward his chin moved at times the folds in his gaunt neck were painful to behold sometimes when the weather was bad he had an umbrella under his arm but he never opened it 
 the good women of the quarter said 
 he is an innocent the children followed him and laughed

 thus our conception of free will and inevitability gradually diminishes or increases according to the greater or lesser connection with the external world the greater or lesser remoteness of time and the greater or lesser dependence on the causes in relation to which we contemplate a life 
 so that if we examine the case of a man whose connection with the external world is well known where the time between the action and its examination is great and where the causes of the action are most accessible we get the conception of a maximum of inevitability and a minimum of free will if we examine a man little dependent on external conditions whose action was performed very recently and the causes of whose action are beyond our ken we get the conception of a minimum of inevitability and a maximum of freedom 
 in neither case however we may change our point of view however plain we may make to ourselves the connection between the man and the external world however inaccessible it may be to us however long or short the period of time however intelligible or incomprehensible the causes of the action may be can we ever conceive either complete freedom or complete necessity 
 to whatever degree we may imagine a man to be exempt from the influence of the external world we never get a conception of freedom in space every human action is inevitably conditioned by what surrounds him and by his own body i lift my arm and let it fall my action seems to me free but asking myself whether i could raise my arm in every direction i see that i raised it in the direction in which there was least obstruction to that action either from things around me or from the construction of my own body i chose one out of all the possible directions because in it there were fewest obstacles for my action to be free it was necessary that it should encounter no obstacles to conceive of a man being free we must imagine him outside space which is evidently impossible 
 however much we approximate the time of judgment to the time of the deed we never get a conception of freedom in time for if i examine an action committed a second ago i must still recognize it as not being free for it is irrevocably linked to the moment at which it was committed can i lift my arm i lift it but ask myself could i have abstained from lifting my arm at the moment that has already passed to convince myself of this i do not lift it the next moment but i am not now abstaining from doing so at the first moment when i asked the question time has gone by which i could not detain the arm i then lifted is no longer the same as the arm i now refrain from lifting nor is the air in which i lifted it the same that now surrounds me the moment in which the first movement was made is irrevocable and at that moment i could make only one movement and whatever movement i made would be the only one that i did not lift my arm a moment later does not prove that i could have abstained from lifting it then and since i could make only one movement at that single moment of time it could not have been any other to imagine it as free it is necessary to imagine it in the present on the boundary between the past and the future that is outside time which is impossible 
 however much the difficulty of understanding the causes may be increased we never reach a conception of complete freedom that is an absence of cause however inaccessible to us may be the cause of the expression of will in any action our own or the first demand of reason is the assumption of and search for a cause for without a cause no phenomenon is conceivable i raise my arm to perform an action independently of any cause but my wish to perform an action without a cause is the cause of my action 
 but even if imagining a man quite exempt from all influences examining only his momentary action in the present unevoked by any cause we were to admit so infinitely small a remainder of inevitability as equaled zero we should even then not have arrived at the conception of complete freedom in man for a being uninfluenced by the external world standing outside of time and independent of cause is no longer a man 
 in the same way we can never imagine the action of a man quite devoid of freedom and entirely subject to the law of inevitability 
 however we may increase our knowledge of the conditions of space in which man is situated that knowledge can never be complete for the number of those conditions is as infinite as the infinity of space and therefore so long as not all the conditions influencing men are defined there is no complete inevitability but a certain measure of freedom remains 
 however we may prolong the period of time between the action we are examining and the judgment upon it that period will be finite while time is infinite and so in this respect too there can never be absolute inevitability 
 however accessible may be the chain of causation of any action we shall never know the whole chain since it is endless and so again we never reach absolute inevitability 
 but besides this even if admitting the remaining minimum of freedom to equal zero we assumed in some given case as for instance in that of a dying man an unborn babe or an idiot complete absence of freedom by so doing we should destroy the very conception of man in the case we are examining for as soon as there is no freedom there is also no man and so the conception of the action of a man subject solely to the law of inevitability without any element of freedom is just as impossible as the conception of a completely free action 
 and so to imagine the action of a man entirely subject to the law of inevitability without any freedom we must assume the knowledge of an infinite number of space relations an infinitely long period of time and an infinite series of causes 
 to imagine a man perfectly free and not subject to the law of inevitability we must imagine him all alone beyond space beyond time and free from dependence on cause 
 in the first case if inevitability were possible without freedom we should have reached a definition of inevitability by the laws of inevitability itself that is a mere form without content 
 in the second case if freedom were possible without inevitability we should have arrived at unconditioned freedom beyond space time and cause which by the fact of its being unconditioned and unlimited would be nothing or mere content without form 
 we should in fact have reached those two fundamentals of which whole outlook on the universe is constructed the incomprehensible essence of life and the laws defining that essence 
 reason says space with all the forms of matter that give it visibility is infinite and cannot be imagined otherwise time is infinite motion without a moment of rest and is unthinkable otherwise the connection between cause and effect has no beginning and can have no end 
 consciousness says i alone am and all that exists is but me consequently i include space i measure flowing time by the fixed moment of the present in which alone i am conscious of myself as living consequently i am outside time i am beyond cause for i feel myself to be the cause of every manifestation of my life 
 reason gives expression to the laws of inevitability consciousness gives expression to the essence of freedom 
 freedom not limited by anything is the essence of life in consciousness inevitability without content is reason in its three forms 
 freedom is the thing examined inevitability is what examines freedom is the content inevitability is the form 
 only by separating the two sources of cognition related to one another as form to content do we get the mutually exclusive and separately incomprehensible conceptions of freedom and inevitability 
 only by uniting them do we get a clear conception of life 
 apart from these two concepts which in their union mutually define one another as form and content no conception of life is possible 
 all that we know of the life of man is merely a certain relation of free will to inevitability that is of consciousness to the laws of reason 
 all that we know of the external world of nature is only a certain relation of the forces of nature to inevitability or of the essence of life to the laws of reason 
 the great natural forces lie outside us and we are not conscious of them we call those forces gravitation inertia electricity animal force and so on but we are conscious of the force of life in man and we call that freedom 
 but just as the force of gravitation incomprehensible in itself but felt by every man is understood by us only to the extent to which we know the laws of inevitability to which it is subject from the first knowledge that all bodies have weight up to law so too the force of free will incomprehensible in itself but of which everyone is conscious is intelligible to us only in as far as we know the laws of inevitability to which it is subject from the fact that every man dies up to the knowledge of the most complex economic and historic laws 
 all knowledge is merely a bringing of this essence of life under the laws of reason 
 free will differs from every other force in that man is directly conscious of it but in the eyes of reason it in no way differs from any other force the forces of gravitation electricity or chemical affinity are only distinguished from one another in that they are differently defined by reason just so the force of free will is distinguished by reason from the other forces of nature only by the definition reason gives it freedom apart from necessity that is apart from the laws of reason that define it differs in no way from gravitation or heat or the force that makes things grow for reason it is only a momentary undefinable sensation of life 
 and as the undefinable essence of the force moving the heavenly bodies the undefinable essence of the forces of heat and electricity or of chemical affinity or of the vital force forms the content of astronomy physics chemistry botany zoology and so on just in the same way does the force of free will form the content of history but just as the subject of every science is the manifestation of this unknown essence of life while that essence itself can only be the subject of metaphysics even the manifestation of the force of free will in human beings in space in time and in dependence on cause forms the subject of history while free will itself is the subject of metaphysics 
 in the experimental sciences what we know we call the laws of inevitability what is unknown to us we call vital force vital force is only an expression for the unknown remainder over and above what we know of the essence of life 
 so also in history what is known to us we call laws of inevitability what is unknown we call free will free will is for history only an expression for the unknown remainder of what we know about the laws of human life

 marius as we have explained before his marriage had put no questions to m fauchelevent and since that time he had feared to put any to jean valjean 
 he had regretted the promise into which he had allowed himself to be drawn 
 he had often said to himself that he had done wrong in making that concession to despair 
 he had confined himself to gradually estranging jean valjean from his house and to effacing him as much as possible from mind 
 he had in a manner always placed himself between cosette and jean valjean sure that in this way she would not perceive nor think of the latter 
 it was more than effacement it was an eclipse 
 marius did what he considered necessary and just 
 he thought that he had serious reasons which the reader has already seen and others which will be seen later on for getting rid of jean valjean without harshness but without weakness 
 chance having ordained that he should encounter in a case which he had argued a former employee of the laffitte establishment he had acquired mysterious information without seeking it which he had not been able it is true to probe out of respect for the secret which he had promised to guard and out of consideration for jean perilous position 
 he believed at that moment that he had a grave duty to perform 
 the restitution of the six hundred thousand francs to some one whom he sought with all possible discretion

 she was conscious of marius will in the direction of monsieur jean she conformed to it 
 her husband had not been obliged to say anything to her she yielded to the vague but clear pressure of his tacit intentions and obeyed blindly 
 her obedience in this instance consisted in not remembering what marius forgot 
 she was not obliged to make any effort to accomplish this 
 without her knowing why herself and without his having any cause to accuse her of it her soul had become so wholly her that that which was shrouded in gloom in marius mind became overcast in hers 
 let us not go too far however in what concerns jean valjean this forgetfulness and obliteration were merely superficial 
 she was rather heedless than forgetful 
 at bottom she was sincerely attached to the man whom she had so long called her father but she loved her husband still more dearly 
 this was what had somewhat disturbed the balance of her heart which leaned to one side only 
 it sometimes happened that cosette spoke of jean valjean and expressed her surprise 
 then marius calmed her 
 he is absent i think 
 did not he say that he was setting out on a is true thought cosette 
 he had a habit of disappearing in this fashion 
 but not for so long 
 two or three times she despatched nicolette to inquire in the rue de arme whether m jean had returned from his journey 
 jean valjean caused the answer no to be given 
 cosette asked nothing more since she had but one need on earth marius 
 let us also say that on their side cosette and marius had also been absent 
 they had been to vernon 
 marius had taken cosette to his grave 
 marius gradually won cosette away from jean valjean

 moreover that which is called far too harshly in certain cases the ingratitude of children is not always a thing so deserving of reproach as it is supposed 
 it is the ingratitude of nature 
 nature as we have elsewhere said looks before her 
 nature divides living beings into those who are arriving and those who are departing

 second epilogue 
 chapter xi 
 
 history examines the manifestations of free will in connection with the external world in time and in dependence on cause that is it defines this freedom by the laws of reason and so history is a science only in so far as this free will is defined by those laws 
 the recognition of free will as something capable of influencing historical events that is as not subject to laws is the same for history as the recognition of a free force moving the heavenly bodies would be for astronomy 
 that assumption would destroy the possibility of the existence of laws that is of any science whatever if there is even a single body moving freely then the laws of kepler and newton are negatived and no conception of the movement of the heavenly bodies any longer exists if any single action is due to free will then not a single historical law can exist nor any conception of historical events 
 for history lines exist of the movement of human wills one end of which is hidden in the unknown but at the other end of which a consciousness of will in the present moves in space time and dependence on cause 
 the more this field of motion spreads out before our eyes the more evident are the laws of that movement to discover and define those laws is the problem of history 
 from the standpoint from which the science of history now regards its subject on the path it now follows seeking the causes of events in freewill a scientific enunciation of those laws is impossible for however free will may be restricted as soon as we recognize it as a force not subject to law the existence of law becomes impossible 
 only by reducing this element of free will to the infinitesimal that is by regarding it as an infinitely small quantity can we convince ourselves of the absolute inaccessibility of the causes and then instead of seeking causes history will take the discovery of laws as its problem 
 the search for these laws has long been begun and the new methods of thought which history must adopt are being worked out simultaneously with the toward which ever dissecting and dissecting the causes of phenomena the old method of history is moving 
 all human sciences have traveled along that path arriving at infinitesimals mathematics the most exact of sciences abandons the process of analysis and enters on the new process of the integration of unknown infinitely small quantities abandoning the conception of cause mathematics seeks law that is the property common to all unknown infinitely small elements 
 in another form but along the same path of reflection the other sciences have proceeded when newton enunciated the law of gravity he did not say that the sun or the earth had a property of attraction he said that all bodies from the largest to the smallest have the property of attracting one another that is leaving aside the question of the cause of the movement of the bodies he expressed the property common to all bodies from the infinitely large to the infinitely small the same is done by the natural sciences leaving aside the question of cause they seek for laws history stands on the same path and if history has for its object the study of the movement of the nations and of humanity and not the narration of episodes in the lives of individuals it too setting aside the conception of cause should seek the laws common to all the inseparably interconnected infinitesimal elements of free will

 that assumption would destroy the possibility of the existence of laws that is of any science whatever if there is even a single body moving freely then the laws of kepler and newton are negatived and no conception of the movement of the heavenly bodies any longer exists if any single action is due to free will then not a single historical law can exist nor any conception of historical events 
 for history lines exist of the movement of human wills one end of which is hidden in the unknown but at the other end of which a consciousness of will in the present moves in space time and dependence on cause 
 the more this field of motion spreads out before our eyes the more evident are the laws of that movement to discover and define those laws is the problem of history 
 from the standpoint from which the science of history now regards its subject on the path it now follows seeking the causes of events in freewill a scientific enunciation of those laws is impossible for however free will may be restricted as soon as we recognize it as a force not subject to law the existence of law becomes impossible 
 only by reducing this element of free will to the infinitesimal that is by regarding it as an infinitely small quantity can we convince ourselves of the absolute inaccessibility of the causes and then instead of seeking causes history will take the discovery of laws as its problem 
 the search for these laws has long been begun and the new methods of thought which history must adopt are being worked out simultaneously with the toward which ever dissecting and dissecting the causes of phenomena the old method of history is moving 
 all human sciences have traveled along that path arriving at infinitesimals mathematics the most exact of sciences abandons the process of analysis and enters on the new process of the integration of unknown infinitely small quantities abandoning the conception of cause mathematics seeks law that is the property common to all unknown infinitely small elements 
 in another form but along the same path of reflection the other sciences have proceeded when newton enunciated the law of gravity he did not say that the sun or the earth had a property of attraction he said that all bodies from the largest to the smallest have the property of attracting one another that is leaving aside the question of the cause of the movement of the bodies he expressed the property common to all bodies from the infinitely large to the infinitely small the same is done by the natural sciences leaving aside the question of cause they seek for laws history stands on the same path and if history has for its object the study of the movement of the nations and of humanity and not the narration of episodes in the lives of individuals it too setting aside the conception of cause should seek the laws common to all the inseparably interconnected infinitesimal elements of free will

 last flickerings of a lamp without oil 
 one day jean valjean descended his staircase took three steps in the street seated himself on a post on that same stone post where gavroche had found him meditating on the night between the th and the th of june he remained there a few moments then went up stairs again 
 this was the last oscillation of the pendulum 
 on the following day he did not leave his apartment 
 on the day after that he did not leave his bed 
 his portress who prepared his scanty repasts a few cabbages or potatoes with bacon glanced at the brown earthenware plate and exclaimed 
 but you ate nothing yesterday poor dear man 
 certainly i did replied jean valjean 
 the plate is quite full 
 look at the water jug 
 it is empty 
 that proves that you have drunk it does not prove that you have eaten 
 well said jean valjean what if i felt hungry only for water 
 that is called thirst and when one does not eat at the same time it is called fever 
 i will eat 
 or at trinity day 
 why not is it the thing to say 
 i will eat the idea of leaving my platter without even touching it 
 my ladyfinger potatoes were so good 
 jean valjean took the old hand 
 i promise you that i will eat them he said in his benevolent voice 
 i am not pleased with you replied the portress 
 jean valjean saw no other human creature than this good woman 
 there are streets in paris through which no one ever passes and houses to which no one ever comes 
 he was in one of those streets and one of those houses 
 while he still went out he had purchased of a coppersmith for a few sous a little copper crucifix which he had hung up on a nail opposite his bed 
 that gibbet is always good to look at 
 a week passed and jean valjean had not taken a step in his room 
 he still remained in bed 
 the portress said to her good man upstairs yonder does not get up he no longer eats he will not last long 
 that man has his sorrows that he has 
 you get it out of my head that his daughter has made a bad marriage 
 the porter replied with the tone of marital sovereignty 
 if rich let him have a doctor 
 if he is not rich let him go without 
 if he has no doctor he will die 
 and if he has one 
 he will die said the porter 
 the portress set to scraping away the grass from what she called her pavement with an old knife and as she tore out the blades she grumbled 
 a shame 
 such a neat old man 
 as white as a chicken 
 she caught sight of the doctor of the quarter as he passed the end of the street she took it upon herself to request him to come up stairs 
 on the second floor said she 
 you have only to enter 
 as the good man no longer stirs from his bed the door is always unlocked 
 the doctor saw jean valjean and spoke with him 
 when he came down again the portress interrogated him 
 well doctor 
 your sick man is very ill indeed 
 what is the matter with him 
 everything and nothing 
 he is a man who to all appearances has lost some person who is dear to him 
 people die of that 
 what did he say to you 
 he told me that he was in good health 
 shall you come again doctor 
 yes replied the doctor 
 but some one else besides must come

 chapter xii 
 
 from the time the law of copernicus was discovered and proved the mere recognition of the fact that it was not the sun but the earth that moves sufficed to destroy the whole cosmography of the ancients by disproving that law it might have been possible to retain the old conception of the movements of the bodies but without disproving it it would seem impossible to continue studying the ptolemaic worlds but even after the discovery of the law of copernicus the ptolemaic worlds were still studied for a long time 
 from the time the first person said and proved that the number of births or of crimes is subject to mathematical laws and that this or that mode of government is determined by certain geographical and economic conditions and that certain relations of population to soil produce migrations of peoples the foundations on which history had been built were destroyed in their essence 
 by refuting these new laws the former view of history might have been retained but without refuting them it would seem impossible to continue studying historic events as the results of free will for if a certain mode of government was established or certain migrations of peoples took place in consequence of such and such geographic ethnographic or economic conditions then the free will of those individuals who appear to us to have established that mode of government or occasioned the migrations can no longer be regarded as the cause 
 and yet the former history continues to be studied side by side with the laws of statistics geography political economy comparative philology and geology which directly contradict its assumptions 
 the struggle between the old views and the new was long and stubbornly fought out in physical philosophy theology stood on guard for the old views and accused the new of violating revelation but when truth conquered theology established itself just as firmly on the new foundation 
 just as prolonged and stubborn is the struggle now proceeding between the old and the new conception of history and theology in the same way stands on guard for the old view and accuses the new view of subverting revelation 
 in the one case as in the other on both sides the struggle provokes passion and stifles truth on the one hand there is fear and regret for the loss of the whole edifice constructed through the ages on the other is the passion for destruction 
 to the men who fought against the rising truths of physical philosophy it seemed that if they admitted that truth it would destroy faith in god in the creation of the firmament and in the miracle of joshua the son of nun to the defenders of the laws of copernicus and newton to voltaire for example it seemed that the laws of astronomy destroyed religion and he utilized the law of gravitation as a weapon against religion 
 just so it now seems as if we have only to admit the law of inevitability to destroy the conception of the soul of good and evil and all the institutions of state and church that have been built up on those conceptions 
 so too like voltaire in his time uninvited defenders of the law of inevitability today use that law as a weapon against religion though the law of inevitability in history like the law of copernicus in astronomy far from destroying even strengthens the foundation on which the institutions of state and church are erected 
 as in the question of astronomy then so in the question of history now the whole difference of opinion is based on the recognition or nonrecognition of something absolute serving as the measure of visible phenomena in astronomy it was the immovability of the earth in history it is the independence of personality free will 
 as with astronomy the difficulty of recognizing the motion of the earth lay in abandoning the immediate sensation of the fixity and of the motion of the planets so in history the difficulty of recognizing the subjection of personality to the laws of space time and cause lies in renouncing the direct feeling of the independence of own personality but as in astronomy the new view said it is true that we do not feel the movement of the earth but by admitting its immobility we arrive at absurdity while by admitting its motion which we do not feel we arrive at laws so also in history the new view says it is true that we are not conscious of our dependence but by admitting our free will we arrive at absurdity while by admitting our dependence on the external world on time and on cause we arrive at laws 
 in the first case it was necessary to renounce the consciousness of an unreal immobility in space and to recognize a motion we did not feel in the present case it is similarly necessary to renounce a freedom that does not exist and to recognize a dependence of which we are not conscious

 a pen is heavy to the man who lifted the cart 
 one evening jean valjean found difficulty in raising himself on his elbow he felt of his wrist and could not find his pulse his breath was short and halted at times he recognized the fact that he was weaker than he had ever been before 
 then no doubt under the pressure of some supreme preoccupation he made an effort drew himself up into a sitting posture and dressed himself 
 he put on his old clothes 
 as he no longer went out he had returned to them and preferred them 
 he was obliged to pause many times while dressing himself merely putting his arms through his waistcoat made the perspiration trickle from his forehead 
 since he had been alone he had placed his bed in the antechamber in order to inhabit that deserted apartment as little as possible 
 he opened the valise and drew from it outfit 
 he spread it out on his bed 
 the candlesticks were in their place on the he took from a drawer two wax candles and put them in the candlesticks 
 then although it was still broad was summer he lighted them 
 in the same way candles are to be seen lighted in broad daylight in chambers where there is a corpse 
 every step that he took in going from one piece of furniture to another exhausted him and he was obliged to sit down 
 it was not ordinary fatigue which expends the strength only to renew it it was the remnant of all movement possible to him it was life drained which flows away drop by drop in overwhelming efforts and which will never be renewed 
 the chair into which he allowed himself to fall was placed in front of that mirror so fatal for him so providential for marius in which he had read reversed writing on the blotting book 
 he caught sight of himself in this mirror and did not recognize himself 
 he was eighty years old before marius marriage he would have hardly been taken for fifty that year had counted for thirty 
 what he bore on his brow was no longer the wrinkles of age it was the mysterious mark of death 
 the hollowing of that pitiless nail could be felt there 
 his cheeks were pendulous the skin of his face had the color which would lead one to think that it already had earth upon it the corners of his mouth drooped as in the mask which the ancients sculptured on tombs 
 he gazed into space with an air of reproach one would have said that he was one of those grand tragic beings who have cause to complain of some one 
 he was in that condition the last phase of dejection in which sorrow no longer flows it is coagulated so to speak there is something on the soul like a clot of despair 
 night had come 
 he laboriously dragged a table and the old to the fireside and placed upon the table a pen some ink and some paper 
 that done he had a fainting fit 
 when he recovered consciousness he was thirsty 
 as he could not lift the jug he tipped it over painfully towards his mouth and swallowed a draught 
 as neither the pen nor the ink had been used for a long time the point of the pen had curled up the ink had dried away he was forced to rise and put a few drops of water in the ink which he did not accomplish without pausing and sitting down two or three times and he was compelled to write with the back of the pen 
 he wiped his brow from time to time 
 then he turned towards the bed and still seated for he could not stand he gazed at the little black gown and all those beloved objects 
 these contemplations lasted for hours which seemed minutes 
 all at once he shivered he felt that a child was taking possession of him he rested his elbows on the table which was illuminated by the candles and took up the pen 
 his hand trembled 
 he wrote slowly the few following lines 
 cosette i bless thee 
 i am going to explain to thee 
 thy husband was right in giving me to understand that i ought to go away but there is a little error in what he believed though he was in the right 
 he is excellent 
 love him well even after i am dead 
 monsieur pontmercy love my darling child well 
 cosette this paper will be found this is what i wish to say to thee thou wilt see the figures if i have the strength to recall them listen well this money is really thine 
 here is the whole matter 
 white jet comes from norway black jet comes from england black glass jewellery comes from germany 
 jet is the lightest the most precious the most costly 
 imitations can be made in france as well as in germany 
 what is needed is a little anvil two inches square and a lamp burning spirits of wine to soften the wax 
 the wax was formerly made with resin and lampblack and cost four livres the pound 
 i invented a way of making it with gum shellac and turpentine 
 it does not cost more than thirty sous and is much better 
 buckles are made with a violet glass which is stuck fast by means of this wax to a little framework of black iron 
 the glass must be violet for iron jewellery and black for gold jewellery 
 spain buys a great deal of it 
 it is the country of jet 
 here he paused the pen fell from his fingers he was seized by one of those sobs which at times welled up from the very depths of his being the poor man clasped his head in both hands and meditated 
 oh he exclaimed within himself lamentable cries heard by god alone all is over 
 i shall never see her more 
 she is a smile which passed over me 
 i am about to plunge into the night without even seeing her again 
 oh one minute one instant to hear her voice to touch her dress to gaze upon her upon her the angel and then to die 
 it is nothing to die what is frightful is to die without seeing her 
 she would smile on me she would say a word to me would that do any harm to any one 
 no all is over and forever 
 here i am all alone 
 my god 
 my god 
 i shall never see her again 
 at that moment there came a knock at the door

 chapter iv 
 
 a bottle of ink which only succeeded in whitening 
 that same day or to speak more accurately that same evening as marius left the table and was on the point of withdrawing to his study having a case to look over basque handed him a letter saying 
 the person who wrote the letter is in the antechamber 
 cosette had taken the arm and was strolling in the garden 
 a letter like a man may have an unprepossessing exterior 
 coarse paper coarsely very sight of certain missives is displeasing 
 the letter which basque had brought was of this sort 
 marius took it 
 it smelled of tobacco 
 nothing evokes a memory like an odor 
 marius recognized that tobacco 
 he looked at the superscription 
 to monsieur monsieur le baron pommerci 
 at his hotel 
 the recognition of the tobacco caused him to recognize the writing as well 
 it may be said that amazement has its lightning flashes 
 marius was as it were illuminated by one of these flashes 
 the sense of smell that mysterious aid to memory had just revived a whole world within him 
 this was certainly the paper the fashion of folding the dull tint of ink it was certainly the handwriting especially was it the same tobacco 
 the jondrette garret rose before his mind 
 thus strange freak of chance one of the two scents which he had so diligently sought the one in connection with which he had lately again exerted so many efforts and which he supposed to be forever lost had come and presented itself to him of its own accord 
 he eagerly broke the seal and read 
 monsieur le the supreme being had given me the talents i might have been baron thenard member of the institute academy of ciences but i am not 
 i only bear the same as him happy if this memory recommends me to the eccellence of your kindnesses 
 the benefit with which you will honor me will be reciprocle 
 i am in possession of a secret concerning an individual 
 this individual concerns you 
 i hold the secret at your disposal desiring to have the honor to be huseful to you 
 i will furnish you with the simple means of driving from your honorabel family that individual who has no right there madame la baronne being of lofty birth 
 the sanctuary of virtue cannot cohabit longer with crime without abdicating 
 i awate in the entichamber the orders of monsieur le baron 
 with respect 
 the letter was signed thenard 
 this signature was not false 
 it was merely a trifle abridged 
 moreover the rigmarole and the orthography completed the revelation 
 the certificate of origin was complete 
 marius emotion was profound 
 after a start of surprise he underwent a feeling of happiness 
 if he could now but find that other man of whom he was in search the man who had saved him marius there would be nothing left for him to desire 
 he opened the drawer of his secretary took out several put them in his pocket closed the secretary again and rang the bell 
 basque half opened the door 
 show the man in said marius 
 basque announced 
 monsieur thenard 
 a man entered 
 a fresh surprise for marius 
 the man who entered was an utter stranger to him 
 this man who was old moreover had a thick nose his chin swathed in a cravat green spectacles with a double screen of green taffeta over his eyes and his hair was plastered and flattened down on his brow on a level with his eyebrows like the wigs of english coachmen in high life 
 his hair was gray 
 he was dressed in black from head to foot in garments that were very threadbare but clean a bunch of seals depending from his fob suggested the idea of a watch 
 he held in his hand an old hat 
 he walked in a bent attitude and the curve in his spine augmented the profundity of his bow 
 the first thing that struck the observer was that this coat which was too ample although carefully buttoned had not been made for him 
 here a short digression becomes necessary 
 there was in paris at that epoch in a old lodging in the rue beautreillis near the arsenal an ingenious jew whose profession was to change villains into honest men 
 not for too long which might have proved embarrassing for the villain 
 the change was on sight for a day or two at the rate of thirty sous a day by means of a costume which resembled the honesty of the world in general as nearly as possible 
 this costumer was called the changer the pickpockets of paris had given him this name and knew him by no other 
 he had a tolerably complete wardrobe 
 the rags with which he tricked out people were almost probable 
 he had specialties and categories on each nail of his shop hung a social status threadbare and worn here the suit of a magistrate there the outfit of a cure beyond the outfit of a banker in one corner the costume of a retired military man elsewhere the habiliments of a man of letters and further on the dress of a statesman 
 this creature was the costumer of the immense drama which knavery plays in paris 
 his lair was the whence theft emerged and into which roguery retreated 
 a tattered knave arrived at this deposited his thirty sous and selected according to the part which he wished to play the costume which suited him and on descending the stairs once more the knave was a somebody 
 on the following day the clothes were faithfully returned and the changer who trusted the thieves with everything was never robbed 
 there was one inconvenience about these clothes they did not fit not having been made for those who wore them they were too tight for one too loose for another and did not adjust themselves to any one 
 every pickpocket who exceeded or fell short of the human average was ill at his ease in the costumes 
 it was necessary that one should not be either too fat or too lean 
 the changer had foreseen only ordinary men 
 he had taken the measure of the species from the first rascal who came to hand who is neither stout nor thin neither tall nor short 
 hence adaptations which were sometimes difficult and from which the clients extricated themselves as best they might 
 so much the worse for the exceptions 
 the suit of the statesman for instance black from head to foot and consequently proper would have been too large for pitt and too small for castelcicala 
 the costume of a statesman was designated as follows in the catalogue we copy 
 a coat of black cloth trowsers of black wool a silk waistcoat boots and linen 
 on the margin there stood 
 and a note which we also copy 
 in a separate box a neatly frizzed peruke green glasses seals and two small quills an inch long wrapped in cotton 
 all this belonged to the statesman the this whole costume was if we may so express ourselves debilitated the seams were white a vague yawned at one of the elbows moreover one of the coat buttons was missing on the breast but this was only detail as the hand of the statesman should always be thrust into his coat and laid upon his heart its function was to conceal the absent button 
 if marius had been familiar with the occult institutions of paris he would instantly have recognized upon the back of the visitor whom basque had just shown in the suit borrowed from the shop of the changer 
 marius disappointment on beholding another man than the one whom he expected to see turned to the disadvantage 
 he surveyed him from head to foot while that personage made exaggerated bows and demanded in a curt tone 
 what do you want 
 the man replied with an amiable grin of which the caressing smile of a crocodile will furnish some idea 
 it seems to me impossible that i should not have already had the honor of seeing monsieur le baron in society 
 i think i actually did meet monsieur personally several years ago at the house of madame la princesse bagration and in the of his lordship the vicomte dambray peer of france 
 it is always a good bit of tactics in knavery to pretend to recognize some one whom one does not know 
 marius paid attention to the manner of this speech 
 he spied on his accent and gesture but his disappointment increased the pronunciation was nasal and absolutely unlike the dry shrill tone which he had expected 
 he was utterly routed 
 i know neither madame bagration nor m dambray said he 
 i have never set foot in the house of either of them in my life 
 the reply was ungracious 
 the personage determined to be gracious at any cost insisted 
 then it must have been at that i have seen monsieur 
 i know chateaubriand very well 
 he is very affable 
 he sometimes says to me 
 thenard my friend you drink a glass of wine with me 
 marius brow grew more and more severe 
 i have never had the honor of being received by m de chateaubriand 
 let us cut it short 
 what do you want 
 the man bowed lower at that harsh voice 
 monsieur le baron deign to listen to me 
 there is in america in a district near panama a village called la joya 
 that village is composed of a single house a large square house of three stories built of bricks dried in the sun each side of the square five hundred feet in length each story retreating twelve feet back of the story below in such a manner as to leave in front a terrace which makes the circuit of the edifice in the centre an inner court where the provisions and munitions are kept no windows loopholes no doors ladders ladders to mount from the ground to the first terrace and from the first to the second and from the second to the third ladders to descend into the inner court no doors to the chambers no staircases to the chambers ladders in the evening the traps are closed the ladders are withdrawn carbines and blunderbusses trained from the loopholes no means of entering a house by day a citadel by night eight hundred inhabitants that is the village 
 why so many precautions because the country is dangerous it is full of cannibals 
 then why do people go there because the country is marvellous gold is found there 
 what are you driving at interrupted marius who had passed from disappointment to impatience 
 at this monsieur le baron 
 i am an old and weary diplomat 
 ancient civilization has thrown me on my own devices 
 i want to try savages 
 well 
 monsieur le baron egotism is the law of the world 
 the proletarian peasant woman who toils by the day turns round when the diligence passes by the peasant proprietress who toils in her field does not turn round 
 the dog of the poor man barks at the rich man the dog of the rich man barks at the poor man 
 each one for himself 
 the object of men 
 gold the loadstone 
 what then 
 finish 
 i should like to go and establish myself at la joya 
 there are three of us 
 i have my spouse and my young lady a very beautiful girl 
 the journey is long and costly 
 i need a little money 
 what concern is that of mine demanded marius 
 the stranger stretched his neck out of his cravat a gesture characteristic of the vulture and replied with an augmented smile 
 has not monsieur le baron perused my letter 
 there was some truth in this 
 the fact is that the contents of the epistle had slipped marius mind 
 he had seen the writing rather than read the letter 
 he could hardly recall it 
 but a moment ago a fresh start had been given him 
 he had noted that detail 
 my spouse and my young lady 
 he fixed a penetrating glance on the stranger 
 an examining judge could not have done the look better 
 he almost lay in wait for him 
 he confined himself to replying 
 state the case precisely 
 the stranger inserted his two hands in both his fobs drew himself up without straightening his dorsal column but scrutinizing marius in his turn with the green gaze of his spectacles 
 so be it monsieur le baron 
 i will be precise 
 i have a secret to sell to you 
 a secret 
 a secret 
 which concerns me 
 somewhat 
 what is the secret 
 marius scrutinized the man more and more as he listened to him 
 i commence gratis said the stranger 
 you will see that i am interesting 
 speak 
 monsieur le baron you have in your house a thief and an assassin 
 marius shuddered 
 in my house no said he 
 the imperturbable stranger brushed his hat with his elbow and went on 
 an assassin and a thief 
 remark monsieur le baron that i do not here speak of ancient deeds deeds of the past which have lapsed which can be effaced by limitation before the law and by repentance before god 
 i speak of recent deeds of actual facts as still unknown to justice at this hour 
 i continue 
 this man has insinuated himself into your confidence and almost into your family under a false name 
 i am about to tell you his real name 
 and to tell it to you for nothing 
 i am listening 
 his name is jean valjean 
 i know it 
 i am going to tell you equally for nothing who he is 
 say on 
 he is an 
 i know it 
 you know it since i have had the honor of telling you 
 no i knew it before 
 marius cold tone that double reply of i know it his laconicism which was not favorable to dialogue stirred up some smouldering wrath in the stranger 
 he launched a furious glance on the sly at marius which was instantly extinguished 
 rapid as it was this glance was of the kind which a man recognizes when he has once beheld it it did not escape marius 
 certain flashes can only proceed from certain souls the eye that of the thought glows with it spectacles hide nothing try putting a pane of glass over hell 
 the stranger resumed with a smile 
 i will not permit myself to contradict monsieur le baron 
 in any case you ought to perceive that i am well informed 
 now what i have to tell you is known to myself alone 
 this concerns the fortune of madame la baronne 
 it is an extraordinary secret 
 it is for sale i make you the first offer of it 
 cheap 
 twenty thousand francs 
 i know that secret as well as the others said marius 
 the personage felt the necessity of lowering his price a trifle 
 monsieur le baron say ten thousand francs and i will speak 
 i repeat to you that there is nothing which you can tell me 
 i know what you wish to say to me 
 a fresh flash gleamed in the eye 
 he exclaimed 
 but i must dine nevertheless 
 it is an extraordinary secret i tell you 
 monsieur le baron i will speak 
 i speak 
 give me twenty francs 
 marius gazed intently at him 
 i know your extraordinary secret just as i knew jean name just as i know your name

 i had the honor to write to you and to tell it to you

 and marius drew a from his pocket and flung it in his face 
 thanks 
 pardon me five hundred francs 
 monsieur le baron 
 and the man overcome bowed seized the note and examined it 
 five hundred francs he began again taken aback 
 and he stammered in a low voice 
 an honest rustler 
 un fafiot serieux 
 fafiot is the slang term for a derived from its rustling noise

 chapter iv 
 
 a bottle of ink which only succeeded in whitening 
 that same day or to speak more accurately that same evening as marius left the table and was on the point of withdrawing to his study having a case to look over basque handed him a letter saying 
 the person who wrote the letter is in the antechamber 
 cosette had taken the arm and was strolling in the garden 
 a letter like a man may have an unprepossessing exterior 
 coarse paper coarsely very sight of certain missives is displeasing 
 the letter which basque had brought was of this sort 
 marius took it 
 it smelled of tobacco 
 nothing evokes a memory like an odor 
 marius recognized that tobacco 
 he looked at the superscription 
 to monsieur monsieur le baron pommerci 
 at his hotel 
 the recognition of the tobacco caused him to recognize the writing as well 
 it may be said that amazement has its lightning flashes 
 marius was as it were illuminated by one of these flashes 
 the sense of smell that mysterious aid to memory had just revived a whole world within him 
 this was certainly the paper the fashion of folding the dull tint of ink it was certainly the handwriting especially was it the same tobacco 
 the jondrette garret rose before his mind 
 thus strange freak of chance one of the two scents which he had so diligently sought the one in connection with which he had lately again exerted so many efforts and which he supposed to be forever lost had come and presented itself to him of its own accord 
 he eagerly broke the seal and read 
 monsieur le the supreme being had given me the talents i might have been baron thenard member of the institute academy of ciences but i am not 
 i only bear the same as him happy if this memory recommends me to the eccellence of your kindnesses 
 the benefit with which you will honor me will be reciprocle 
 i am in possession of a secret concerning an individual 
 this individual concerns you 
 i hold the secret at your disposal desiring to have the honor to be huseful to you 
 i will furnish you with the simple means of driving from your honorabel family that individual who has no right there madame la baronne being of lofty birth 
 the sanctuary of virtue cannot cohabit longer with crime without abdicating 
 i awate in the entichamber the orders of monsieur le baron 
 with respect 
 the letter was signed thenard 
 this signature was not false 
 it was merely a trifle abridged 
 moreover the rigmarole and the orthography completed the revelation 
 the certificate of origin was complete 
 marius emotion was profound 
 after a start of surprise he underwent a feeling of happiness 
 if he could now but find that other man of whom he was in search the man who had saved him marius there would be nothing left for him to desire 
 he opened the drawer of his secretary took out several put them in his pocket closed the secretary again and rang the bell 
 basque half opened the door 
 show the man in said marius 
 basque announced 
 monsieur thenard 
 a man entered 
 a fresh surprise for marius 
 the man who entered was an utter stranger to him 
 this man who was old moreover had a thick nose his chin swathed in a cravat green spectacles with a double screen of green taffeta over his eyes and his hair was plastered and flattened down on his brow on a level with his eyebrows like the wigs of english coachmen in high life 
 his hair was gray 
 he was dressed in black from head to foot in garments that were very threadbare but clean a bunch of seals depending from his fob suggested the idea of a watch 
 he held in his hand an old hat 
 he walked in a bent attitude and the curve in his spine augmented the profundity of his bow 
 the first thing that struck the observer was that this coat which was too ample although carefully buttoned had not been made for him 
 here a short digression becomes necessary 
 there was in paris at that epoch in a old lodging in the rue beautreillis near the arsenal an ingenious jew whose profession was to change villains into honest men 
 not for too long which might have proved embarrassing for the villain 
 the change was on sight for a day or two at the rate of thirty sous a day by means of a costume which resembled the honesty of the world in general as nearly as possible 
 this costumer was called the changer the pickpockets of paris had given him this name and knew him by no other 
 he had a tolerably complete wardrobe 
 the rags with which he tricked out people were almost probable 
 he had specialties and categories on each nail of his shop hung a social status threadbare and worn here the suit of a magistrate there the outfit of a cure beyond the outfit of a banker in one corner the costume of a retired military man elsewhere the habiliments of a man of letters and further on the dress of a statesman 
 this creature was the costumer of the immense drama which knavery plays in paris 
 his lair was the whence theft emerged and into which roguery retreated 
 a tattered knave arrived at this deposited his thirty sous and selected according to the part which he wished to play the costume which suited him and on descending the stairs once more the knave was a somebody 
 on the following day the clothes were faithfully returned and the changer who trusted the thieves with everything was never robbed 
 there was one inconvenience about these clothes they did not fit not having been made for those who wore them they were too tight for one too loose for another and did not adjust themselves to any one 
 every pickpocket who exceeded or fell short of the human average was ill at his ease in the costumes 
 it was necessary that one should not be either too fat or too lean 
 the changer had foreseen only ordinary men 
 he had taken the measure of the species from the first rascal who came to hand who is neither stout nor thin neither tall nor short 
 hence adaptations which were sometimes difficult and from which the clients extricated themselves as best they might 
 so much the worse for the exceptions 
 the suit of the statesman for instance black from head to foot and consequently proper would have been too large for pitt and too small for castelcicala 
 the costume of a statesman was designated as follows in the catalogue we copy 
 a coat of black cloth trowsers of black wool a silk waistcoat boots and linen 
 on the margin there stood 
 and a note which we also copy 
 in a separate box a neatly frizzed peruke green glasses seals and two small quills an inch long wrapped in cotton 
 all this belonged to the statesman the this whole costume was if we may so express ourselves debilitated the seams were white a vague yawned at one of the elbows moreover one of the coat buttons was missing on the breast but this was only detail as the hand of the statesman should always be thrust into his coat and laid upon his heart its function was to conceal the absent button 
 if marius had been familiar with the occult institutions of paris he would instantly have recognized upon the back of the visitor whom basque had just shown in the suit borrowed from the shop of the changer 
 marius disappointment on beholding another man than the one whom he expected to see turned to the disadvantage 
 he surveyed him from head to foot while that personage made exaggerated bows and demanded in a curt tone 
 what do you want 
 the man replied with an amiable grin of which the caressing smile of a crocodile will furnish some idea

 book shadow supreme dawn 
 chapter iv 
 
 thenardier for it was really he was strangely surprised he would have been troubled had he been capable of such a thing 
 he had come to bring astonishment and it was he who had received it 
 this humiliation had been worth five hundred francs to him and taking it all in all he accepted it but he was none the less bewildered 
 he beheld this baron pontmercy for the first time and in spite of his disguise this baron pontmercy recognized him and recognized him thoroughly 
 and not only was this baron perfectly informed as to thenardier but he seemed well posted as to jean valjean 
 who was this almost beardless young man who was so glacial and so generous who knew names who knew all their names and who opened his purse to them who bullied rascals like a judge and who paid them like a dupe 
 thenardier the reader will remember although he had been marius neighbor had never seen him which is not unusual in paris he had formerly in a vague way heard his daughters talk of a very poor young man named marius who lived in the house 
 he had written to him without knowing him the letter with which the reader is acquainted 
 no connection between that marius and m le baron pontmercy was possible in his mind 
 as for the name pontmercy it will be recalled that on the battlefield of waterloo he had only heard the last two syllables for which he always entertained the legitimate scorn which one owes to what is merely an expression of thanks 
 however through his daughter azelma who had started on the scent of the married pair on the th of february and through his own personal researches he had succeeded in learning many things and from the depths of his own gloom he had contrived to grasp more than one mysterious clew 
 he had discovered by dint of industry or at least by dint of induction he had guessed who the man was whom he had encountered on a certain day in the grand sewer 
 from the man he had easily reached the name 
 he knew that madame la baronne pontmercy was cosette 
 but he meant to be discreet in that quarter 
 who was cosette 
 he did not know exactly himself 
 he did indeed catch an inkling of illegitimacy the history of fantine had always seemed to him equivocal but what was the use of talking about that in order to cause himself to be paid for his silence 
 he had or thought he had better wares than that for sale 
 and according to all appearances if he were to come and make to the baron pontmercy this without proof 
 your wife is a bastard the only result would be to attract the boot of the husband towards the loins of the revealer 
 from point of view the conversation with marius had not yet begun 
 he ought to have drawn back to have modified his strategy to have abandoned his position to have changed his front but nothing essential had been compromised as yet and he had five hundred francs in his pocket 
 moreover he had something decisive to say and even against this very and baron pontmercy he felt himself strong 
 for men of nature every dialogue is a combat 
 in the one in which he was about to engage what was his situation 
 he did not know to whom he was speaking but he did know of what he was speaking he made this rapid review of his inner forces and after having said 
 i am thenardier he waited 
 marius had become thoughtful 
 so he had hold of thenardier at last 
 that man whom he had so greatly desired to find was before him 
 he could honor colonel recommendation 
 he felt humiliated that that hero should have owned anything to this villain and that the letter of change drawn from the depths of the tomb by his father upon him marius had been protested up to that day 
 it also seemed to him in the complex state of his mind towards thenardier that there was occasion to avenge the colonel for the misfortune of having been saved by such a rascal 
 in any case he was content 
 he was about to deliver the shade from this unworthy creditor at last and it seemed to him that he was on the point of rescuing his memory from the debtors prison 
 by the side of this duty there was another to elucidate if possible the source of fortune 
 the opportunity appeared to present itself 
 perhaps thenardier knew something 
 it might prove useful to see the bottom of this man 
 he commenced with this 
 thenardier had caused the honest rustler to disappear in his fob and was gazing at marius with a gentleness that was almost tender 
 marius broke the silence 
 thenardier i have told you your name 
 now would you like to have me tell you your one that you came here to reveal to me 
 i have information of my own also 
 you shall see that i know more about it than you do 
 jean valjean as you have said is an assassin and a thief 
 a thief because he robbed a wealthy manufacturer whose ruin he brought about 
 an assassin because he assassinated javert 
 i understand sir ejaculated thenardier 
 i will make myself intelligible 
 in a certain arrondissement of the pas de calais there was in a man who had fallen out with justice and who under the name of m madeleine had regained his status and rehabilitated himself 
 this man had become a just man in the full force of the term 
 in a trade the manufacture of black glass goods he made the fortune of an entire city 
 as far as his personal fortune was concerned he made that also but as a secondary matter and in some sort by accident 
 he was the of the poor 
 he founded hospitals opened schools visited the sick dowered young girls supported widows and adopted orphans he was like the guardian angel of the country 
 he refused the cross he was appointed mayor 
 a liberated convict knew the secret of a penalty incurred by this man in former days he denounced him and had him arrested and profited by the arrest to come to paris and cause the banker have the fact from the cashier means of a false signature to hand over to him the sum of over half a million which belonged to m madeleine 
 this convict who robbed m madeleine was jean valjean 
 as for the other fact you have nothing to tell me about it either 
 jean valjean killed the agent javert he shot him with a pistol 
 i the person who is speaking to you was present 
 thenardier cast upon marius the sovereign glance of a conquered man who lays his hand once more upon the victory and who has just regained in one instant all the ground which he has lost 
 but the smile returned instantly 
 the triumph in the presence of his superior must be wheedling 
 thenardier contented himself with saying to marius 
 monsieur le baron we are on the wrong track 
 and he emphasized this phrase by making his bunch of seals execute an expressive whirl 
 what broke forth marius do you dispute that 
 these are facts 
 they are chimeras 
 the confidence with which monsieur le baron honors me renders it my duty to tell him so 
 truth and justice before all things 
 i do not like to see folks accused unjustly 
 monsieur le baron jean valjean did not rob m madeleine and jean valjean did not kill javert 
 this is too much 
 how is this 
 for two reasons 
 what are they 
 speak 
 this is the first 
 he did not rob m madeleine because it is jean valjean himself who was m madeleine 
 what tale are you telling me 
 and this is the second 
 he did not assassinate javert because the person who killed javert was javert 
 what do you mean to say 
 that javert committed suicide 
 prove it prove it cried marius beside himself 
 thenardier resumed scanning his phrase after the manner of the ancient alexandrine measure 
 
 but prove it 
 thenardier drew from his pocket a large envelope of gray paper which seemed to contain sheets folded in different sizes 
 i have my papers he said calmly 
 and he added 
 monsieur le baron in your interests i desired to know jean valjean thoroughly 
 i say that jean valjean and m madeleine are one and the same man and i say that javert had no other assassin than javert 
 if i speak it is because i have proofs 
 not manuscript proofs writing is suspicious handwriting is printed proofs 
 as he spoke thenardier extracted from the envelope two copies of newspapers yellow faded and strongly saturated with tobacco 
 one of these two newspapers broken at every fold and falling into rags seemed much older than the other 
 two facts two proofs remarked thenardier 
 and he offered the two newspapers unfolded to marius 
 the reader is acquainted with these two papers 
 one the most ancient a number of the drapeau blanc of the th of july the text of which can be seen in the first volume established the identity of m madeleine and jean valjean 
 the other a moniteur of the th of june announced the suicide of javert adding that it appeared from a verbal report of javert to the prefect that having been taken prisoner in the barricade of the rue de la chanvrerie he had owed his life to the magnanimity of an insurgent who holding him under his pistol had fired into the air instead of blowing out his brains 
 marius read 
 he had evidence a certain date irrefragable proof these two newspapers had not been printed expressly for the purpose of backing up statements the note printed in the moniteur had been an administrative communication from the prefecture of police 
 marius could not doubt 
 the information of the had been false and he himself had been deceived 
 jean valjean who had suddenly grown grand emerged from his cloud 
 marius could not repress a cry of joy 
 well then this unhappy wretch is an admirable man the whole of that fortune really belonged to him he is madeleine the providence of a whole countryside he is jean valjean savior he is a hero he is a saint 
 not a saint and not a hero said thenardier 
 an assassin and a robber 
 and he added in the tone of a man who begins to feel that he possesses some authority 
 let us be calm 
 robber words which marius thought had disappeared and which returned fell upon him like an 
 again said he 
 always ejaculated thenardier 
 jean valjean did not rob madeleine but he is a thief 
 he did not kill javert but he is a murderer 
 will you speak retorted marius of that miserable theft committed forty years ago and expiated as your own newspapers prove by a whole life of repentance of and of virtue 
 i say assassination and theft monsieur le baron and i repeat that i am speaking of actual facts 
 what i have to reveal to you is absolutely unknown 
 it belongs to unpublished matter 
 and perhaps you will find in it the source of the fortune so skilfully presented to madame la baronne by jean valjean 
 i say skilfully because by a gift of that nature it would not be so very unskilful to slip into an honorable house whose comforts one would then share and at the same stroke to conceal crime and to enjoy theft to bury name and to create for oneself a family 
 i might interrupt you at this point said marius but go on 
 monsieur le baron i will tell you all leaving the recompense to your generosity 
 this secret is worth massive gold 
 you will say to me 
 why do not you apply to jean valjean 
 for a very simple reason i know that he has stripped himself and stripped himself in your favor and i consider the combination ingenious but he has no longer a son he would show me his empty hands and since i am in need of some money for my trip to la joya i prefer you you who have it all to him who has nothing 
 i am a little fatigued permit me to take a chair 
 marius seated himself and motioned to him to do the same 
 thenardier installed himself on a tufted chair picked up his two newspapers thrust them back into their envelope and murmured as he pecked at the drapeau blanc with his nail 
 it cost me a good deal of trouble to get this one 
 that done he crossed his legs and stretched himself out on the back of the chair an attitude characteristic of people who are sure of what they are saying then he entered upon his subject gravely emphasizing his words 
 monsieur le baron on the th of june about a year ago on the day of the insurrection a man was in the grand sewer of paris at the point where the sewer enters the seine between the pont des invalides and the pont de jena 
 marius abruptly drew his chair closer to that of thenardier 
 thenardier noticed this movement and continued with the deliberation of an orator who holds his interlocutor and who feels his adversary palpitating under his words 
 this man forced to conceal himself and for reasons moreover which are foreign to politics had adopted the sewer as his domicile and had a key to it 
 it was i repeat on the th of june it might have been eight in the evening 
 the man hears a noise in the sewer 
 greatly surprised he hides himself and lies in wait 
 it was the sound of footsteps some one was walking in the dark and coming in his direction 
 strange to say there was another man in the sewer besides himself 
 the grating of the outlet from the sewer was not far off 
 a little light which fell through it permitted him to recognize the newcomer and to see that the man was carrying something on his back 
 he was walking in a bent attitude 
 the man who was walking in a bent attitude was an and what he was dragging on his shoulders was a corpse 
 assassination caught in the very act if ever there was such a thing 
 as for the theft that is understood one does not kill a man gratis 
 this convict was on his way to fling the body into the river 
 one fact is to be noticed that before reaching the exit grating this convict who had come a long distance in the sewer must necessarily have encountered a frightful quagmire where it seems as though he might have left the body but the sewermen would have found the assassinated man the very next day while at work on the quagmire and that did not suit the plans 
 he had preferred to traverse that quagmire with his burden and his exertions must have been terrible for it is impossible to risk life more completely i understand how he could have come out of that alive 
 marius chair approached still nearer 
 thenardier took advantage of this to draw a long breath 
 he went on 
 monsieur le baron a sewer is not the champ de mars 
 one lacks everything there even room 
 when two men are there they must meet 
 that is what happened 
 the man domiciled there and the were forced to bid each other greatly to the regret of both 
 the said to the see what i have on my back i must get out you have the key give it to me 
 that convict was a man of terrible strength 
 there was no way of refusing 
 nevertheless the man who had the key parleyed simply to gain time 
 he examined the dead man but he could see nothing except that the latter was young well dressed with the air of being rich and all disfigured with blood 
 while talking the man contrived to tear and pull off behind without the assassin perceiving it a bit of the assassinated coat 
 a document for conviction you understand a means of recovering the trace of things and of bringing home the crime to the criminal 
 he put this document for conviction in his pocket 
 after which he opened the grating made the man go out with his embarrassment on his back closed the grating again and ran off not caring to be mixed up with the remainder of the adventure and above all not wishing to be present when the assassin threw the assassinated man into the river 
 now you comprehend 
 the man who was carrying the corpse was jean valjean the one who had the key is speaking to you at this moment and the piece of the coat 
 thenardier completed his phrase by drawing from his pocket and holding on a level with his eyes nipped between his two thumbs and his two forefingers a strip of torn black cloth all covered with dark spots 
 marius had sprung to his feet pale hardly able to draw his breath with his eyes riveted on the fragment of black cloth and without uttering a word without taking his eyes from that fragment he retreated to the wall and fumbled with his right hand along the wall for a key which was in the lock of a cupboard near the chimney 
 he found the key opened the cupboard plunged his arm into it without looking and without his frightened gaze quitting the rag which thenardier still held outspread 
 but thenardier continued 
 monsieur le baron i have the strongest of reasons for believing that the assassinated young man was an opulent stranger lured into a trap by jean valjean and the bearer of an enormous sum of money 
 the young man was myself and here is the coat cried marius and he flung upon the floor an old black coat all covered with blood 
 then snatching the fragment from the hands of thenardier he crouched down over the coat and laid the torn morsel against the tattered skirt 
 the rent fitted exactly and the strip completed the coat 
 thenardier was petrified 
 this is what he thought 
 struck all of a heap 
 marius rose to his feet trembling despairing radiant 
 he fumbled in his pocket and stalked furiously to thenardier presenting to him and almost thrusting in his face his fist filled with for five hundred and a thousand francs 
 you are an infamous wretch you are a liar a calumniator a villain 
 you came to accuse that man you have only justified him you wanted to ruin him you have only succeeded in glorifying him 
 and it is you who are the thief 
 and it is you who are the assassin 
 i saw you thenardier jondrette in that lair on the rue de i know enough about you to send you to the galleys and even further if i choose 
 here are a thousand francs bully that you are 
 and he flung a thousand franc note at thenardier 
 ah 
 jondrette thenardier vile rascal 
 let this serve you as a lesson you dealer in secrets merchant of mysteries rummager of the shadows wretch 
 take these five hundred francs and get out of here 
 waterloo protects you 
 waterloo growled thenardier pocketing the five hundred francs along with the thousand 
 yes assassin 
 you there saved the life of a colonel 
 
 of a general said thenardier elevating his head 
 of a colonel repeated marius in a rage 
 i give a for a general 
 and you come here to commit infamies 
 i tell you that you have committed all crimes 
 go disappear 
 only be happy that is all that i desire 
 ah monster here are three thousand francs more 
 take them 
 you will depart for america with your daughter for your wife is dead you abominable liar 
 i shall watch over your departure you ruffian and at that moment i will count out to you twenty thousand francs 
 go get yourself hung elsewhere 
 monsieur le baron replied thenardier bowing to the very earth eternal gratitude 
 and thenardier left the room understanding nothing stupefied and delighted with this sweet crushing beneath sacks of gold and with that thunder which had burst forth over his head in 
 struck by lightning he was but he was also content and he would have been greatly angered had he had a lightning rod to ward off such lightning as that 
 let us finish with this man at once 
 two days after the events which we are at this moment narrating he set out thanks to marius care for america under a false name with his daughter azelma furnished with a draft on new york for twenty thousand francs 
 the moral wretchedness of thenardier the bourgeois who had missed his vocation was irremediable 
 he was in america what he had been in europe 
 contact with an evil man sometimes suffices to corrupt a good action and to cause evil things to spring from it 
 with marius money thenardier set up as a 
 as soon as thenardier had left the house marius rushed to the garden where cosette was still walking 
 cosette 
 cosette he cried 
 come come quick 
 let us go 
 basque a carriage 
 cosette come 
 ah 
 my god 
 it was he who saved my life 
 let us not lose a minute 
 put on your shawl 
 cosette thought him mad and obeyed 
 he could not breathe he laid his hand on his heart to restrain its throbbing 
 he paced back and forth with huge strides he embraced cosette 
 ah 
 cosette 
 i am an unhappy wretch said he 
 marius was bewildered 
 he began to catch a glimpse in jean valjean of some indescribably lofty and melancholy figure 
 an virtue supreme and sweet humble in its immensity appeared to him 
 the convict was transfigured into christ 
 marius was dazzled by this prodigy 
 he did not know precisely what he beheld but it was grand 
 in an instant a stood in front of the door 
 marius helped cosette in and darted in himself 
 driver said he rue de arme number 
 the carriage drove off 
 ah what happiness ejaculated cosette 
 rue de arme i did not dare to speak to you of that 
 we are going to see m jean 
 thy father 
 cosette thy father more than ever 
 cosette i guess it 
 you told me that you had never received the letter that i sent you by gavroche 
 it must have fallen into his hands 
 cosette he went to the barricade to save me 
 as it is a necessity with him to be an angel he saved others also he saved javert 
 he rescued me from that gulf to give me to you 
 he carried me on his back through that frightful sewer 
 ah 
 i am a monster of ingratitude 
 cosette after having been your providence he became mine 
 just imagine there was a terrible quagmire enough to drown one a hundred times over to drown one in mire 
 cosette he made me traverse it 
 i was unconscious i saw nothing i heard nothing i could know nothing of my own adventure 
 we are going to bring him back to take him with us whether he is willing or not he shall never leave us again 
 if only he is at home 
 provided only that we can find him i will pass the rest of my life in venerating him 
 yes that is how it should be do you see cosette 
 gavroche must have delivered my letter to him 
 all is explained 
 you understand 
 cosette did not understand a word 
 you are right she said to him 
 meanwhile the carriage rolled on

 book shadow supreme dawn 
 chapter iv 
 
 thenardier for it was really he was strangely surprised he would have been troubled had he been capable of such a thing 
 he had come to bring astonishment and it was he who had received it 
 this humiliation had been worth five hundred francs to him and taking it all in all he accepted it but he was none the less bewildered 
 he beheld this baron pontmercy for the first time and in spite of his disguise this baron pontmercy recognized him and recognized him thoroughly 
 and not only was this baron perfectly informed as to thenardier but he seemed well posted as to jean valjean 
 who was this almost beardless young man who was so glacial and so generous who knew names who knew all their names and who opened his purse to them who bullied rascals like a judge and who paid them like a dupe 
 thenardier the reader will remember although he had been marius neighbor had never seen him which is not unusual in paris he had formerly in a vague way heard his daughters talk of a very poor young man named marius who lived in the house 
 he had written to him without knowing him the letter with which the reader is acquainted 
 no connection between that marius and m le baron pontmercy was possible in his mind 
 as for the name pontmercy it will be recalled that on the battlefield of waterloo he had only heard the last two syllables for which he always entertained the legitimate scorn which one owes to what is merely an expression of thanks 
 however through his daughter azelma who had started on the scent of the married pair on the th of february and through his own personal researches he had succeeded in learning many things and from the depths of his own gloom he had contrived to grasp more than one mysterious clew 
 he had discovered by dint of industry or at least by dint of induction he had guessed who the man was whom he had encountered on a certain day in the grand sewer 
 from the man he had easily reached the name 
 he knew that madame la baronne pontmercy was cosette 
 but he meant to be discreet in that quarter 
 who was cosette 
 he did not know exactly himself 
 he did indeed catch an inkling of illegitimacy the history of fantine had always seemed to him equivocal but what was the use of talking about that in order to cause himself to be paid for his silence 
 he had or thought he had better wares than that for sale 
 and according to all appearances if he were to come and make to the baron pontmercy this without proof 
 your wife is a bastard the only result would be to attract the boot of the husband towards the loins of the revealer 
 from point of view the conversation with marius had not yet begun 
 he ought to have drawn back to have modified his strategy to have abandoned his position to have changed his front but nothing essential had been compromised as yet and he had five hundred francs in his pocket 
 moreover he had something decisive to say and even against this very and baron pontmercy he felt himself strong 
 for men of nature every dialogue is a combat 
 in the one in which he was about to engage what was his situation 
 he did not know to whom he was speaking but he did know of what he was speaking he made this rapid review of his inner forces and after having said 
 i am thenardier he waited 
 marius had become thoughtful 
 so he had hold of thenardier at last 
 that man whom he had so greatly desired to find was before him 
 he could honor colonel recommendation 
 he felt humiliated that that hero should have owned anything to this villain and that the letter of change drawn from the depths of the tomb by his father upon him marius had been protested up to that day 
 it also seemed to him in the complex state of his mind towards thenardier that there was occasion to avenge the colonel for the misfortune of having been saved by such a rascal 
 in any case he was content 
 he was about to deliver the shade from this unworthy creditor at last and it seemed to him that he was on the point of rescuing his memory from the debtors prison 
 by the side of this duty there was another to elucidate if possible the source of fortune 
 the opportunity appeared to present itself 
 perhaps thenardier knew something 
 it might prove useful to see the bottom of this man 
 he commenced with this 
 thenardier had caused the honest rustler to disappear in his fob and was gazing at marius with a gentleness that was almost tender 
 marius broke the silence 
 thenardier i have told you your name 
 now would you like to have me tell you your one that you came here to reveal to me 
 i have information of my own also 
 you shall see that i know more about it than you do 
 jean valjean as you have said is an assassin and a thief 
 a thief because he robbed a wealthy manufacturer whose ruin he brought about 
 an assassin because he assassinated javert 
 i understand sir ejaculated thenardier 
 i will make myself intelligible 
 in a certain arrondissement of the pas de calais there was in a man who had fallen out with justice and who under the name of m madeleine had regained his status and rehabilitated himself 
 this man had become a just man in the full force of the term 
 in a trade the manufacture of black glass goods he made the fortune of an entire city 
 as far as his personal fortune was concerned he made that also but as a secondary matter and in some sort by accident 
 he was the of the poor 
 he founded hospitals opened schools visited the sick dowered young girls supported widows and adopted orphans he was like the guardian angel of the country 
 he refused the cross he was appointed mayor 
 a liberated convict knew the secret of a penalty incurred by this man in former days he denounced him and had him arrested and profited by the arrest to come to paris and cause the banker have the fact from the cashier means of a false signature to hand over to him the sum of over half a million which belonged to m madeleine 
 this convict who robbed m madeleine was jean valjean 
 as for the other fact you have nothing to tell me about it either 
 jean valjean killed the agent javert he shot him with a pistol 
 i the person who is speaking to you was present 
 thenardier cast upon marius the sovereign glance of a conquered man who lays his hand once more upon the victory and who has just regained in one instant all the ground which he has lost 
 but the smile returned instantly 
 the triumph in the presence of his superior must be wheedling 
 thenardier contented himself with saying to marius 
 monsieur le baron we are on the wrong track 
 and he emphasized this phrase by making his bunch of seals execute an expressive whirl 
 what broke forth marius do you dispute that 
 these are facts 
 they are chimeras 
 the confidence with which monsieur le baron honors me renders it my duty to tell him so 
 truth and justice before all things 
 i do not like to see folks accused unjustly 
 monsieur le baron jean valjean did not rob m madeleine and jean valjean did not kill javert 
 this is too much 
 how is this 
 for two reasons 
 what are they

 this is the first

 as soon as thenardier had left the house marius rushed to the garden where cosette was still walking 
 cosette 
 cosette he cried 
 come come quick 
 let us go 
 basque a carriage 
 cosette come 
 ah 
 my god 
 it was he who saved my life 
 let us not lose a minute 
 put on your shawl 
 cosette thought him mad and obeyed 
 he could not breathe he laid his hand on his heart to restrain its throbbing 
 he paced back and forth with huge strides he embraced cosette 
 ah 
 cosette 
 i am an unhappy wretch said he 
 marius was bewildered 
 he began to catch a glimpse in jean valjean of some indescribably lofty and melancholy figure 
 an virtue supreme and sweet humble in its immensity appeared to him 
 the convict was transfigured into christ 
 marius was dazzled by this prodigy 
 he did not know precisely what he beheld but it was grand 
 in an instant a stood in front of the door 
 marius helped cosette in and darted in himself 
 driver said he rue de arme number 
 the carriage drove off 
 ah what happiness ejaculated cosette 
 rue de arme i did not dare to speak to you of that 
 we are going to see m jean 
 thy father 
 cosette thy father more than ever 
 cosette i guess it 
 you told me that you had never received the letter that i sent you by gavroche 
 it must have fallen into his hands 
 cosette he went to the barricade to save me 
 as it is a necessity with him to be an angel he saved others also he saved javert 
 he rescued me from that gulf to give me to you 
 he carried me on his back through that frightful sewer 
 ah 
 i am a monster of ingratitude 
 cosette after having been your providence he became mine 
 just imagine there was a terrible quagmire enough to drown one a hundred times over to drown one in mire 
 cosette he made me traverse it 
 i was unconscious i saw nothing i heard nothing i could know nothing of my own adventure 
 we are going to bring him back to take him with us whether he is willing or not he shall never leave us again 
 if only he is at home 
 provided only that we can find him i will pass the rest of my life in venerating him 
 yes that is how it should be do you see cosette 
 gavroche must have delivered my letter to him 
 all is explained 
 you understand 
 cosette did not understand a word 
 you are right she said to him 
 meanwhile the carriage rolled on

 book shadow supreme dawn 
 chapter v 
 
 a night behind which there is day 
 jean valjean turned round at the knock which he heard on his door 
 come in he said feebly 
 the door opened 
 cosette and marius made their appearance 
 cosette rushed into the room 
 marius remained on the threshold leaning against the jamb of the door 
 cosette said jean valjean 
 and he sat erect in his chair his arms outstretched and trembling haggard livid gloomy an immense joy in his eyes 
 cosette stifling with emotion fell upon jean breast 
 father said she 
 jean valjean overcome stammered 
 cosette she you 
 madame it is thou 
 ah my god 
 and pressed close in arms he exclaimed 
 it is thou thou art here 
 thou dost pardon me then 
 marius lowering his eyelids in order to keep his tears from flowing took a step forward and murmured between lips convulsively contracted to repress his sobs 
 my father 
 and you also you pardon me 
 jean valjean said to him 
 marius could find no words and jean valjean added 
 thanks 
 cosette tore off her shawl and tossed her hat on the bed 
 it embarrasses me said she 
 and seating herself on the old knees she put aside his white locks with an adorable movement and kissed his brow 
 jean valjean bewildered let her have her own way 
 cosette who only understood in a very confused manner redoubled her caresses as though she desired to pay marius debt 
 jean valjean stammered 
 how stupid people are 
 i thought that i should never see her again 
 imagine monsieur pontmercy at the very moment when you entered i was saying to myself 
 all is over 
 here is her little gown i am a miserable man i shall never see cosette again and i was saying that at the very moment when you were mounting the stairs 
 was not i an idiot 
 just see how idiotic one can be 
 one reckons without the good god 
 the good god says 
 you fancy that you are about to be abandoned stupid 
 no no things will not go so 
 come there is a good man yonder who is in need of an angel 
 and the angel comes and one sees cosette again and one sees little cosette once more 
 ah 
 i was very unhappy 
 for a moment he could not speak then he went on 
 i really needed to see cosette a little bit now and then 
 a heart needs a bone to gnaw 
 but i was perfectly conscious that i was in the way 
 i gave myself reasons 
 they do not want you keep in your own course one has not the right to cling eternally 
 ah 
 god be praised i see her once more 
 dost thou know cosette thy husband is very handsome 
 ah what a pretty embroidered collar thou hast on luckily 
 i am fond of that pattern 
 it was thy husband who chose it was it not 
 and then thou shouldst have some cashmere shawls 
 let me call her thou monsieur pontmercy 
 it will not be for long 
 and cosette began again 
 how wicked of you to have left us like that 
 where did you go 
 why have you stayed away so long 
 formerly your journeys only lasted three or four days 
 i sent nicolette the answer always was 
 he is absent 
 how long have you been back 
 why did you not let us know 
 do you know that you are very much changed 
 ah what a naughty father he has been ill and we have not known it 
 stay marius feel how cold his hand is 
 so you are here 
 monsieur pontmercy you pardon me repeated jean valjean 
 at that word which jean valjean had just uttered once more all that was swelling marius heart found vent 
 he burst forth 
 cosette do you hear he has come to that he asks my forgiveness 
 and do you know what he has done for me cosette 
 he has saved my life 
 he has done has given you to me 
 and after having saved me and after having given you to me cosette what has he done with himself 
 he has sacrificed himself 
 behold the man 
 and he says to me the ingrate to me the forgetful to me the pitiless to me the guilty one 
 thanks 
 cosette my whole life passed at the feet of this man would be too little 
 that barricade that sewer that furnace that that he traversed for me for thee cosette 
 he carried me away through all the deaths which he put aside before me and accepted for himself 
 every courage every virtue every heroism every sanctity he possesses 
 cosette that man is an angel 
 hush hush said jean valjean in a low voice 
 why tell all that 
 but you cried marius with a wrath in which there was veneration why did you not tell it to me 
 it is your own fault too 
 you save lives and you conceal it from them 
 you do more under the pretext of unmasking yourself you calumniate yourself 
 it is frightful 
 i told the truth replied jean valjean 
 no retorted marius the truth is the whole truth and that you did not tell 
 you were monsieur madeleine why not have said so 
 you saved javert why not have said so 
 i owed my life to you why not have said so 
 because i thought as you do 
 i thought that you were in the right 
 it was necessary that i should go away 
 if you had known about that affair of the sewer you would have made me remain near you 
 i was therefore forced to hold my peace 
 if i had spoken it would have caused embarrassment in every way 
 it would have embarrassed what embarrassed whom retorted marius 
 do you think that you are going to stay here 
 we shall carry you off 
 ah good heavens when i reflect that it was by an accident that i have learned all this 
 you form a part of ourselves 
 you are her father and mine 
 you shall not pass another day in this dreadful house 
 do not imagine that you will be here 
 said jean valjean i shall not be here but i shall not be with you 
 what do you mean replied marius 
 ah come now we are not going to permit any more journeys 
 you shall never leave us again 
 you belong to us 
 we shall not loose our hold of you 
 this time it is for good added cosette 
 we have a carriage at the door 
 i shall run away with you 
 if necessary i shall employ force 
 and she laughingly made a movement to lift the old man in her arms 
 your chamber still stands ready in our house she went on 
 if you only knew how pretty the garden is now 
 the azaleas are doing very well there 
 the walks are sanded with river sand there are tiny violet shells 
 you shall eat my strawberries 
 i water them myself 
 and no more madame no more monsieur jean we are living under a republic everybody says thou they marius 
 the programme is changed 
 if you only knew father i have had a sorrow there was a robin redbreast which had made her nest in a hole in the wall and a horrible cat ate her 
 my poor pretty little robin which used to put her head out of her window and look at me 
 i cried over it 
 i should have liked to kill the cat 
 but now nobody cries any more 
 everybody laughs everybody is happy 
 you are going to come with us 
 how delighted grandfather will be 
 you shall have your plot in the garden you shall cultivate it and we shall see whether your strawberries are as fine as mine 
 and then i shall do everything that you wish and then you will obey me prettily 
 jean valjean listened to her without hearing her 
 he heard the music of her voice rather than the sense of her words one of those large tears which are the sombre pearls of the soul welled up slowly in his eyes 
 he murmured 
 the proof that god is good is that she is here 
 father said cosette 
 jean valjean continued 
 it is quite true that it would be charming for us to live together 
 their trees are full of birds 
 i would walk with cosette 
 it is sweet to be among living people who bid each other who call to each other in the garden 
 people see each other from early morning 
 we should each cultivate our own little corner 
 she would make me eat her strawberries 
 i would make her gather my roses 
 that would be charming 
 only 
 he paused and said gently 
 it is a pity 
 the tear did not fall it retreated and jean valjean replaced it with a smile 
 cosette took both the old hands in hers 
 my god said she your hands are still colder than before 
 are you ill 
 do you suffer 
 i 
 no replied jean valjean 
 i am very well 
 only 
 he paused 
 only what 
 i am going to die presently 
 cosette and marius shuddered 
 to die exclaimed marius 
 yes but that is nothing said jean valjean 
 he took breath smiled and resumed 
 cosette thou wert talking to me go on so thy little robin is dead 
 speak so that i may hear thy voice 
 marius gazed at the old man in amazement 
 cosette uttered a heartrending cry 
 father my father you will live 
 you are going to live 
 i insist upon your living do you hear 
 jean valjean raised his head towards her with adoration 
 oh yes forbid me to die 
 who knows 
 perhaps i shall obey 
 i was on the verge of dying when you came 
 that stopped me it seemed to me that i was born again 
 you are full of strength and life cried marius 
 do you imagine that a person can die like this 
 you have had sorrow you shall have no more 
 it is i who ask your forgiveness and on my knees 
 you are going to live and to live with us and to live a long time 
 we take possession of you once more 
 there are two of us here who will henceforth have no other thought than your happiness 
 you see resumed cosette all bathed in tears that marius says that you shall not die 
 jean valjean continued to smile 
 even if you were to take possession of me monsieur pontmercy would that make me other than i am 
 no god has thought like you and myself and he does not change his mind it is useful for me to go 
 death is a good arrangement 
 god knows better than we what we need 
 may you be happy may monsieur pontmercy have cosette may youth wed the morning may there be around you my children lilacs and nightingales may your life be a beautiful sunny lawn may all the enchantments of heaven fill your souls and now let me who am good for nothing die it is certain that all this is right 
 come be reasonable nothing is possible now i am fully conscious that all is over 
 and then last night i drank that whole jug of water 
 how good thy husband is cosette 
 thou art much better off with him than with me 
 a noise became audible at the door 
 it was the doctor entering 
 and farewell doctor said jean valjean 
 here are my poor children 
 marius stepped up to the doctor 
 he addressed to him only this single word 
 monsieur but his manner of pronouncing it contained a complete question 
 the doctor replied to the question by an expressive glance 
 because things are not agreeable said jean valjean that is no reason for being unjust towards god 
 a silence ensued 
 all breasts were oppressed 
 jean valjean turned to cosette 
 he began to gaze at her as though he wished to retain her features for eternity 
 in the depths of the shadow into which he had already descended ecstasy was still possible to him when gazing at cosette 
 the reflection of that sweet face lighted up his pale visage 
 the doctor felt of his pulse 
 ah it was you that he wanted he murmured looking at cosette and marius 
 and bending down to marius ear he added in a very low voice 
 too late 
 jean valjean surveyed the doctor and marius serenely almost without ceasing to gaze at cosette 
 these barely articulate words were heard to issue from his mouth 
 it is nothing to die it is dreadful not to live 
 all at once he rose to his feet 
 these accesses of strength are sometimes the sign of the death agony 
 he walked with a firm step to the wall thrusting aside marius and the doctor who tried to help him detached from the wall a little copper crucifix which was suspended there and returned to his seat with all the freedom of movement of perfect health and said in a loud voice as he laid the crucifix on the table 
 behold the great martyr 
 then his chest sank in his head wavered as though the intoxication of the tomb were seizing hold upon him 
 his hands which rested on his knees began to press their nails into the stuff of his trousers 
 cosette supported his shoulders and sobbed and tried to speak to him but could not 
 among the words mingled with that mournful saliva which accompanies tears they distinguished words like the following 
 father do not leave us 
 is it possible that we have found you only to lose you again 
 it might be said that agony writhes 
 it goes comes advances towards the sepulchre and returns towards life 
 there is groping in the action of dying 
 jean valjean rallied after this shook his brow as though to make the shadows fall away from it and became almost perfectly lucid once more 
 he took a fold of sleeve and kissed it 
 he is coming back doctor he is coming back cried marius 
 you are good both of you said jean valjean 
 i am going to tell you what has caused me pain 
 what has pained me monsieur pontmercy is that you have not been willing to touch that money 
 that money really belongs to your wife 
 i will explain to you my children and for that reason also i am glad to see you 
 black jet comes from england white jet comes from norway 
 all this is in this paper which you will read 
 for bracelets i invented a way of substituting for slides of soldered sheet iron slides of iron laid together 
 it is prettier better and less costly 
 you will understand how much money can be made in that way 
 so fortune is really hers 
 i give you these details in order that your mind may be set at rest 
 the portress had come upstairs and was gazing in at the door 
 the doctor dismissed her 
 but he could not prevent this zealous woman from exclaiming to the dying man before she disappeared 
 would you like a priest 
 i have had one replied jean valjean 
 and with his finger he seemed to indicate a point above his head where one would have said that he saw some one 
 it is probable in fact that the bishop was present at this death agony 
 cosette gently slipped a pillow under his loins 
 jean valjean resumed 
 have no fear monsieur pontmercy i adjure you 
 the six hundred thousand francs really belong to cosette 
 my life will have been wasted if you do not enjoy them 
 we managed to do very well with those glass goods 
 we rivalled what is called berlin jewellery 
 however we could not equal the black glass of england 
 a gross which contains twelve hundred very well cut grains only costs three francs 
 when a being who is dear to us is on the point of death we gaze upon him with a look which clings convulsively to him and which would fain hold him back 
 cosette gave her hand to marius and both mute with anguish not knowing what to say to the dying man stood trembling and despairing before him 
 jean valjean sank moment by moment 
 he was failing he was drawing near to the gloomy horizon 
 his breath had become intermittent a little rattling interrupted it 
 he found some difficulty in moving his forearm his feet had lost all movement and in proportion as the wretchedness of limb and feebleness of body increased all the majesty of his soul was displayed and spread over his brow 
 the light of the unknown world was already visible in his eyes 
 his face paled and smiled 
 life was no longer there it was something else 
 his breath sank his glance grew grander 
 he was a corpse on which the wings could be felt 
 he made a sign to cosette to draw near then to marius the last minute of the last hour had evidently arrived 
 he began to speak to them in a voice so feeble that it seemed to come from a distance and one would have said that a wall now rose between them and him 
 draw near draw near both of you 
 i love you dearly 
 oh how good it is to die like this 
 and thou lovest me also my cosette 
 i knew well that thou still felt friendly towards thy poor old man 
 how kind it was of thee to place that pillow under my loins 
 thou wilt weep for me a little wilt thou not 
 not too much 
 i do not wish thee to have any real griefs 
 you must enjoy yourselves a great deal my children 
 i forgot to tell you that the profit was greater still on the buckles without tongues than on all the rest 
 a gross of a dozen dozens cost ten francs and sold for sixty 
 it really was a good business 
 so there is no occasion for surprise at the six hundred thousand francs monsieur pontmercy 
 it is honest money 
 you may be rich with a tranquil mind 
 thou must have a carriage a box at the theatres now and then and handsome ball dresses my cosette and then thou must give good dinners to thy friends and be very happy 
 i was writing to cosette a while ago 
 she will find my letter 
 i bequeath to her the two candlesticks which stand on the they are of silver but to me they are gold they are diamonds they change candles which are placed in them into i do not know whether the person who gave them to me is pleased with me yonder on high 
 i have done what i could 
 my children you will not forget that i am a poor man you will have me buried in the first plot of earth that you find under a stone to mark the spot 
 this is my wish 
 no name on the stone 
 if cosette cares to come for a little while now and then it will give me pleasure 
 and you too monsieur pontmercy 
 i must admit that i have not always loved you 
 i ask your pardon for that 
 now she and you form but one for me 
 i feel very grateful to you 
 i am sure that you make cosette happy 
 if you only knew monsieur pontmercy her pretty rosy cheeks were my delight when i saw her in the least pale i was sad 
 in the chest of drawers there is a for five hundred francs 
 i have not touched it 
 it is for the poor 
 cosette dost thou see thy little gown yonder on the bed dost thou recognize it 
 that was ten years ago however 
 how time flies 
 we have been very happy 
 all is over 
 do not weep my children i am not going very far i shall see you from there you will only have to look at night and you will see me smile 
 cosette dost thou remember montfermeil 
 thou wert in the forest thou wert greatly terrified dost thou remember how i took hold of the handle of the that was the first time that i touched thy poor little hand 
 it was so cold 
 ah your hands were red then mademoiselle they are very white now 
 and the big doll dost thou remember 
 thou didst call her catherine 
 thou regrettedest not having taken her to the convent 
 how thou didst make me laugh sometimes my sweet angel 
 when it had been raining thou didst float bits of straw on the gutters and watch them pass away 
 one day i gave thee a willow battledore and a shuttlecock with yellow blue and green feathers 
 thou hast forgotten it 
 thou wert roguish so young 
 thou didst play 
 thou didst put cherries in thy ears 
 those are things of the past 
 the forests through which one has passed with child the trees under which one has strolled the convents where one has concealed oneself the games the hearty laughs of childhood are shadows 
 i imagined that all that belonged to me 
 in that lay my stupidity 
 those thenardiers were wicked 
 thou must forgive them 
 cosette the moment has come to tell thee the name of thy mother 
 she was called fantine 
 remember that 
 kneel whenever thou utterest it 
 she suffered much 
 she loved thee dearly 
 she had as much unhappiness as thou hast had happiness 
 that is the way god apportions things 
 he is there on high he sees us all and he knows what he does in the midst of his great stars 
 i am on the verge of departure my children 
 love each other well and always 
 there is nothing else but that in the world 
 love for each other 
 you will think sometimes of the poor old man who died here 
 oh my cosette it is not my fault indeed that i have not seen thee all this time it cut me to the heart i went as far as the corner of the street i must have produced a queer effect on the people who saw me pass i was like a madman i once went out without my hat 
 i no longer see clearly my children i had still other things to say but never mind 
 think a little of me 
 come still nearer 
 i die happy 
 give me your dear and heads so that i may lay my hands upon them 
 cosette and marius fell on their knees in despair suffocating with tears each beneath one of jean hands 
 those august hands no longer moved 
 he had fallen backwards the light of the candles illuminated him 
 his white face looked up to heaven he allowed cosette and marius to cover his hands with kisses 
 he was dead 
 the night was starless and extremely dark 
 no doubt in the gloom some immense angel stood erect with wings outspread awaiting that soul

 oh yes forbid me to die 
 who knows 
 perhaps i shall obey 
 i was on the verge of dying when you came 
 that stopped me it seemed to me that i was born again 
 you are full of strength and life cried marius 
 do you imagine that a person can die like this 
 you have had sorrow you shall have no more 
 it is i who ask your forgiveness and on my knees 
 you are going to live and to live with us and to live a long time 
 we take possession of you once more 
 there are two of us here who will henceforth have no other thought than your happiness 
 you see resumed cosette all bathed in tears that marius says that you shall not die 
 jean valjean continued to smile 
 even if you were to take possession of me monsieur pontmercy would that make me other than i am 
 no god has thought like you and myself and he does not change his mind it is useful for me to go 
 death is a good arrangement 
 god knows better than we what we need 
 may you be happy may monsieur pontmercy have cosette may youth wed the morning may there be around you my children lilacs and nightingales may your life be a beautiful sunny lawn may all the enchantments of heaven fill your souls and now let me who am good for nothing die it is certain that all this is right 
 come be reasonable nothing is possible now i am fully conscious that all is over 
 and then last night i drank that whole jug of water 
 how good thy husband is cosette 
 thou art much better off with him than with me 
 a noise became audible at the door 
 it was the doctor entering 
 and farewell doctor said jean valjean 
 here are my poor children 
 marius stepped up to the doctor 
 he addressed to him only this single word 
 monsieur but his manner of pronouncing it contained a complete question 
 the doctor replied to the question by an expressive glance 
 because things are not agreeable said jean valjean that is no reason for being unjust towards god 
 a silence ensued 
 all breasts were oppressed 
 jean valjean turned to cosette 
 he began to gaze at her as though he wished to retain her features for eternity 
 in the depths of the shadow into which he had already descended ecstasy was still possible to him when gazing at cosette 
 the reflection of that sweet face lighted up his pale visage 
 the doctor felt of his pulse 
 ah it was you that he wanted he murmured looking at cosette and marius 
 and bending down to marius ear he added in a very low voice 
 too late 
 jean valjean surveyed the doctor and marius serenely almost without ceasing to gaze at cosette 
 these barely articulate words were heard to issue from his mouth 
 it is nothing to die it is dreadful not to live 
 all at once he rose to his feet 
 these accesses of strength are sometimes the sign of the death agony 
 he walked with a firm step to the wall thrusting aside marius and the doctor who tried to help him detached from the wall a little copper crucifix which was suspended there and returned to his seat with all the freedom of movement of perfect health and said in a loud voice as he laid the crucifix on the table 
 behold the great martyr 
 then his chest sank in his head wavered as though the intoxication of the tomb were seizing hold upon him 
 his hands which rested on his knees began to press their nails into the stuff of his trousers 
 cosette supported his shoulders and sobbed and tried to speak to him but could not 
 among the words mingled with that mournful saliva which accompanies tears they distinguished words like the following 
 father do not leave us 
 is it possible that we have found you only to lose you again 
 it might be said that agony writhes 
 it goes comes advances towards the sepulchre and returns towards life 
 there is groping in the action of dying 
 jean valjean rallied after this shook his brow as though to make the shadows fall away from it and became almost perfectly lucid once more 
 he took a fold of sleeve and kissed it 
 he is coming back doctor he is coming back cried marius 
 you are good both of you said jean valjean 
 i am going to tell you what has caused me pain 
 what has pained me monsieur pontmercy is that you have not been willing to touch that money 
 that money really belongs to your wife 
 i will explain to you my children and for that reason also i am glad to see you 
 black jet comes from england white jet comes from norway 
 all this is in this paper which you will read 
 for bracelets i invented a way of substituting for slides of soldered sheet iron slides of iron laid together 
 it is prettier better and less costly 
 you will understand how much money can be made in that way 
 so fortune is really hers 
 i give you these details in order that your mind may be set at rest 
 the portress had come upstairs and was gazing in at the door 
 the doctor dismissed her 
 but he could not prevent this zealous woman from exclaiming to the dying man before she disappeared 
 would you like a priest 
 i have had one replied jean valjean 
 and with his finger he seemed to indicate a point above his head where one would have said that he saw some one 
 it is probable in fact that the bishop was present at this death agony 
 cosette gently slipped a pillow under his loins 
 jean valjean resumed 
 have no fear monsieur pontmercy i adjure you 
 the six hundred thousand francs really belong to cosette 
 my life will have been wasted if you do not enjoy them 
 we managed to do very well with those glass goods 
 we rivalled what is called berlin jewellery 
 however we could not equal the black glass of england 
 a gross which contains twelve hundred very well cut grains only costs three francs 
 when a being who is dear to us is on the point of death we gaze upon him with a look which clings convulsively to him and which would fain hold him back 
 cosette gave her hand to marius and both mute with anguish not knowing what to say to the dying man stood trembling and despairing before him 
 jean valjean sank moment by moment 
 he was failing he was drawing near to the gloomy horizon 
 his breath had become intermittent a little rattling interrupted it 
 he found some difficulty in moving his forearm his feet had lost all movement and in proportion as the wretchedness of limb and feebleness of body increased all the majesty of his soul was displayed and spread over his brow 
 the light of the unknown world was already visible in his eyes 
 his face paled and smiled 
 life was no longer there it was something else 
 his breath sank his glance grew grander 
 he was a corpse on which the wings could be felt 
 he made a sign to cosette to draw near then to marius the last minute of the last hour had evidently arrived 
 he began to speak to them in a voice so feeble that it seemed to come from a distance and one would have said that a wall now rose between them and him 
 draw near draw near both of you 
 i love you dearly 
 oh how good it is to die like this 
 and thou lovest me also my cosette 
 i knew well that thou still felt friendly towards thy poor old man 
 how kind it was of thee to place that pillow under my loins 
 thou wilt weep for me a little wilt thou not 
 not too much 
 i do not wish thee to have any real griefs 
 you must enjoy yourselves a great deal my children 
 i forgot to tell you that the profit was greater still on the buckles without tongues than on all the rest 
 a gross of a dozen dozens cost ten francs and sold for sixty 
 it really was a good business 
 so there is no occasion for surprise at the six hundred thousand francs monsieur pontmercy 
 it is honest money 
 you may be rich with a tranquil mind 
 thou must have a carriage a box at the theatres now and then and handsome ball dresses my cosette and then thou must give good dinners to thy friends and be very happy 
 i was writing to cosette a while ago 
 she will find my letter 
 i bequeath to her the two candlesticks which stand on the they are of silver but to me they are gold they are diamonds they change candles which are placed in them into i do not know whether the person who gave them to me is pleased with me yonder on high 
 i have done what i could 
 my children you will not forget that i am a poor man you will have me buried in the first plot of earth that you find under a stone to mark the spot 
 this is my wish 
 no name on the stone 
 if cosette cares to come for a little while now and then it will give me pleasure 
 and you too monsieur pontmercy 
 i must admit that i have not always loved you 
 i ask your pardon for that 
 now she and you form but one for me 
 i feel very grateful to you 
 i am sure that you make cosette happy 
 if you only knew monsieur pontmercy her pretty rosy cheeks were my delight when i saw her in the least pale i was sad 
 in the chest of drawers there is a for five hundred francs 
 i have not touched it 
 it is for the poor 
 cosette dost thou see thy little gown yonder on the bed dost thou recognize it 
 that was ten years ago however 
 how time flies 
 we have been very happy 
 all is over 
 do not weep my children i am not going very far i shall see you from there you will only have to look at night and you will see me smile 
 cosette dost thou remember montfermeil 
 thou wert in the forest thou wert greatly terrified dost thou remember how i took hold of the handle of the that was the first time that i touched thy poor little hand 
 it was so cold 
 ah your hands were red then mademoiselle they are very white now 
 and the big doll dost thou remember 
 thou didst call her catherine 
 thou regrettedest not having taken her to the convent 
 how thou didst make me laugh sometimes my sweet angel 
 when it had been raining thou didst float bits of straw on the gutters and watch them pass away 
 one day i gave thee a willow battledore and a shuttlecock with yellow blue and green feathers 
 thou hast forgotten it 
 thou wert roguish so young 
 thou didst play 
 thou didst put cherries in thy ears 
 those are things of the past 
 the forests through which one has passed with child the trees under which one has strolled the convents where one has concealed oneself the games the hearty laughs of childhood are shadows 
 i imagined that all that belonged to me 
 in that lay my stupidity 
 those thenardiers were wicked 
 thou must forgive them 
 cosette the moment has come to tell thee the name of thy mother 
 she was called fantine 
 remember that 
 kneel whenever thou utterest it 
 she suffered much 
 she loved thee dearly 
 she had as much unhappiness as thou hast had happiness 
 that is the way god apportions things 
 he is there on high he sees us all and he knows what he does in the midst of his great stars 
 i am on the verge of departure my children 
 love each other well and always 
 there is nothing else but that in the world 
 love for each other 
 you will think sometimes of the poor old man who died here 
 oh my cosette it is not my fault indeed that i have not seen thee all this time it cut me to the heart i went as far as the corner of the street i must have produced a queer effect on the people who saw me pass i was like a madman i once went out without my hat 
 i no longer see clearly my children i had still other things to say but never mind 
 think a little of me 
 come still nearer 
 i die happy 
 give me your dear and heads so that i may lay my hands upon them 
 cosette and marius fell on their knees in despair suffocating with tears each beneath one of jean hands 
 those august hands no longer moved 
 he had fallen backwards the light of the candles illuminated him 
 his white face looked up to heaven he allowed cosette and marius to cover his hands with kisses 
 he was dead 
 the night was starless and extremely dark 
 no doubt in the gloom some immense angel stood erect with wings outspread awaiting that soul

 return of the jedi 
 vii 
 
 so the dark lord rumbled you have come to me 
 and you to me 
 the emperor is expecting you he believes you will turn to the dark side 
 i knowfather it was momentous act for address his father ashis father but done it now and kept himself under control and the momentwas past it was done he felt stronger for it he felt potent 
 so you have finally accepted the truth vader gloated 
 i have accepted the truth that you were once anakin skywalker my father 
 that name no longer has meaning for me it was a name long ago adifferent life a different universe could he truly once have been that man 
 it is the name of your true self gaze bore steadily down on the cloakedfigure you have only forgotten i know there is good in you the driven it fully away he molded with his voice tried to form the potentialreality with the strength of his belief why you could not destroy why you take me to your emperor now 
 vader seemed almost to smile through his mask at his use of he looked down at the lightsaber the captain had lightsaber so the boy was truly a jedi now a man grown he heldthe lightsaber up you have constructed another 
 this one is mine luke said quietly i no longer use yours 
 vader ignited the blade examined its humming brilliant light like an admiringcraftsman your skills are complete indeed you are as powerful as the emperorhas foreseen 
 they stood there for a moment the lightsaber between them sparks dove inand out of the cutting edge photons pushed to the brink by the energy pulsingbetween these two warriors 
 come with me father 
 vader shook his head ben once thought as you do 
 blame ben for your fall luke took a step closer then stopped 
 vader did not move you know the power of the dark side i mustobey my master 
 i will not will be forced to destroy me 
 if that is your destiny this was not his wish but the boy was itcame at last to blows yes he would destroy luke he could no long afford to holdback as he once had 
 search your feelings father you do this i feel the conflict within go of your hate 
 but vader hated no one he only lusted too blindly someone has filled yourmind with foolish ideas young one the emperor will show you the true nature ofthe force he is your master now 
 vader signaled to a squad of distant stormtroopers as he extinguished the guards approached luke and the dark lord faced one another fora long searching moment vader spoke just before the guards arrived 
 it is too late for me son 
 then my father is truly dead answered luke so what was to stop him fromkilling the evil one who stood before him now he wondered 
 noting perhaps 
 the vast rebel fleet hung poised in space ready to strike it was hundreds from the death in hyperspace all time was a moment and thedeadliness of an attack was measured not in distance but in precision 
 ships changed in formation from corner to side creating a faceted diamondshape to the if like a cobra the fleet was spreading its hood 
 the calculations required to launch such a meticulously coordinated offensive atlightspeed made it necessary to fix on a stationary it stationary relative tothe point of reentry from hyperspace the point chosen by the rebel command wasa small blue planet of the sullust system the armada was positioned around it unblinking cerulean world it looked like the eye of the serpent 
 the millennium falcon finished its rounds of the perimeter checkingfinal positions then pulled into place beneath the flagship the time had come 
 lando was at the controls of the falcon beside him his copilot jowled creature from switches monitoredreadouts and made final preparations for the jump to hyperspace 
 lando set his comlink to war channel last hand of the night his deal a tablefull of high favorite kind of game with dry mouth he made hissummary report to ackbar of the command ship admiral in position allfighters are accounted for 
 voice crackled back over the headset proceed with the groups assume attack coordinates 
 lando turned to his copilot with a quick smile worry my friends aredown there have that shield down on time he turned back to hisinstruments saying under his breath or this will be the shortest offensive of alltime 
 gzhung zhgodio the copilot commented 
 all right lando grunted stand by then he patted the control panel forgood luck even though his deepest belief was that a good gambler made his own what job was this time and han had almost never let lando that was a long time ago in a star system far far away 
 this time was different this time they were going to redefine luck and call itlando he smiled and patted the panel one more timejust right 
 up on the bridge of the star cruiser command ship ackbar paused lookedaround at his generals all was ready 
 are all groups in their attack coordinates he asked he knew they were 
 affirmative admiral 
 ackbar gazed out his meditatively at the starfield for perhaps thelast reflective moment he would ever have he spoke finally into the comlink warchannel all craft will begin the jump to hyperspace on my mark may the forcebe with us 
 he reached forward to the signal button 
 in the falcon lando stared at the identical galactic with foreboding theywere doing what a guerrilla force must never do engage the enemy like a traditionalarmy the imperial army fighting the guerrilla war was it won the rebels by contrast were always theylost and now here was the most dangerous alliance drawn into theopen to fight on the terms if the rebels lost this battle they lost the war 
 suddenly the signal light flashed on the control panel mark theattack was commenced 
 lando pulled back the conversion switch and opened up the throttle outsidethe cockpit the stars began streaking by the streaks grew brighter and longer asthe ships of the fleet roared in large segments at lightspeed keeping pace first withthe very photons of the radiant stars in the vicinity and then soaring through the warpinto hyperspace disappearing the flash of a muon 
 the blue crystal planet hovered in space alone once again staring the void 
 the strike squad crouched behind a woodsy ridge overlooking the imperialoutpost leia viewed the area through a small electronic scanner 
 two shuttles were being on the landing platform docking walkers were parked nearby troops stood around helped with watch carried supplies the massive shield generator hummed off to the side 
 flattened down in the bushes on the ridge with the strike force were severalewoks including wicket paploo teebo and warwick the rest stayed the knoll out of sight 
 leia put down the scanner and scuttled back to the others the entrance is onthe far side of that landing platform this going to be easy 
 ahrck grah rahr hrowrowhr chewbacca agreed 
 oh come on chewie han gave the wookiee a pained look gotteninto more heavily guarded places than that 
 frowh rahgh rahrahraff vrawgh gr chewie countered with a dismissinggesture 
 han thought of a second well the spice vaults of gargon for one 
 of course if i could just remember how i did it hanscratched his head poking his memory 
 suddenly paploo began chattering away pointing squealing he garbledsomething to wicket 
 he saying threepio leia asked 
 the golden droid exchanged a few terse sentences with paploo then wicketturned to leia with a hopeful grin 
 threepio too now looked at the princess apparently wicket know about aback entrance to this installation 
 han perked up at that a back door it how we did it 
 four imperial scouts kept watch over the entrance to the bunker from the earth far to the rear of the main section of the shield generatorcomplex their rocket bikes were parked nearby 
 in the undergrowth beyond the rebel strike squad lay in wait 
 grrr rowf rrrhl brhnnn chewbacca observed slowly 
 right chewie solo agreed with just those guards this should byeasier than breaking a bantha 
 it only takes one to sound the alarm leia cautioned 
 han grinned a bit overselfconfidently then have to do this realquietlike if luke can just keep vader off our backs like you said he said he oughta be no sweat just gotta hit those guards fast and quiet 
 threepio whispered to teebo and paploo explaining the problem and theobjective the ewoks babbled giddily a moment then paploo jumped up and racedthrough the underbrush 
 leia checked the instrument on her wrist running out of time in hyperspace by now 
 threepio muttered a question to teebo and received a short reply oh replied starting to rise to look into the clearing beside the bunker 
 stay down rasped solo 
 what is it threepio leia demanded 
 afraid our furry companion has gone and done something rush thedroid hoped he to be blamed for this 
 what are you talking about voice cut with an edge of fear 
 oh no look 
 paploo had scampered down through the bushes to where the scouts bikes wereparked now with the sickening horror of inevitability the rebel leaders watchedthe little ball of fur swing his pudgy body up onto one of the bikes and begin flippingswitches at random before anyone could do anything the engines ignitedwith a rumbling roar the four scouts looked over in surprise paploo grinnedmadly and continued flipping switches 
 leia held her forehead oh no no no 
 chewie barked han nodded so much for our surprise attack 
 the imperial scouts raced toward paploo just as the forward drive the little teddy bear into the forest he had all he could do just to hang onto the handlebar with his stubby paws three of the guards jumped on their ownbikes and sped off in pursuit of the hotrod ewok the fourth scout stayed at his the door of the bunker 
 leia was delighted if a bit incredulous 
 not bad for a ball of fuzz han admired he nodded at chewie and the twoof them slipped down toward the bunker 
 paploo meanwhile was sailing through the trees more lucky than in was going at fairly low velocity for what the bike could in was absolutely dizzy with speed and excitement it was terrifying but heloved it he could talk about this ride until the end of his life and then his childrenwould tell their children and it would get faster with each generation 
 for now though the imperial scouts were already pulling in sight behind a moment later they began firing laser bolts at him he decided finallyhad enough as he rounded the next tree just out of their sight he grabbed a vineand swung up into the branches several seconds later the three scouts tore byunderneath him pressing their pursuit to the limit he giggled furiously 
 back at the bunker the laser scout was undone subdued by chewbacca of his suit he was being carried into the woods now by two other members ofthe strike team the rest of the squad silently crouched forming a perimeter aroundthe entrance 
 han stood at the door checking the stolen code against the digits on the panel with natural speed he punched a series of buttons on the the door opened 
 leia peeked inside no sigh of life she motioned the others and entered thebunker han and chewie followed close on her heels soon the entire team washuddled inside the otherwise empty steel corridor leaving one lookout in the unconscious uniform han pushed a series of buttons on theinner panel closing the door behind them 
 leia thought briefly of hoped he could detain vader at least longenough to allow her to destroy this shield generator she hoped even more dearly hecould avoid such a confrontation altogether for she feared vader was the strongerof the two 
 furtively she led the way down the dark and tunnel 
 shuttle settled onto the docking bay of the death star like a bird like a nightmare insect luke and the dark lordemerged from the snout of the beast with a small escort of stormtroopers and walkedrapidly across the cavernous main bay to the tower elevator 
 royal guards awaited them there flanking the shaft bathed in a carmine opened the elevator door luke stepped forward 
 his mind was buzzing with what to do it was the emperor he was being takento now the emperor if luke could but focus keep his mind clear to see whatmust be do it 
 a great noise filled his head though like an underground wind 
 he hoped leia deactivated the deflector shield quickly and destroyed the while all three of them were here before anything else happened forthe closer luke came to the emperor the more anything he feared would happen ablack storm raged inside him he wanted to kill the emperor but then vader what would his father do and what if luke faced his father him him the thought was at once repugnant and then what for the first time luke had a brief murky image ofhimself standing on his body holding his blazing power and sittingat the right hand 
 he squeezed his eyes shut against this thought but it left a cold sweat on hisbrow as if hand had brushed him there and left its shallow imprint 
 the elevator door opened luke and vader walked out into the throne roomalone across the unlit antechamber up the grated stairs to stand before the and son side by side both dressed in black one masked and one the gaze of the malignant emperor 
 vader bowed to his master the emperor motioned him to rise though thedark lord did his bidding 
 welcome young skywalker the evil one smiled graciously i have beenexpecting you 
 luke stared back brazenly at the bent hooded figure defiantly smile grew even softer though even more fatherly he looked at 
 you no longer need these he added with noblesse made theslightest motion with his finger in the direction of wrists at that simply fell away clattering noisily to the floor 
 luke looked at his own now to reach out for the crush his windpipe in an instant 
 yet the emperor seemed gentle had he not just let luke free but he wasdevious too luke knew do not be fooled by appearances ben had told him theemperor was unarmed he could still strike but aggression part of thedark side he avoid that at all costs or could he use darkness then put it away he stared at his free handshe could have ended it all could he he had total freedom to choose what to do now yet he couldnot choose choice the sword he could kill the emperor he couldsuccumb to the arguments he could kill vaderand then he could evenbecome vader again this thought laughed at him like a broken clown until hepushed it back into a black corner of his brain 
 the emperor sat before him smiling the moment was convulsive withpossibilities 
 the moment passed he did nothing 
 tell me young skywalker the emperor said when he saw first strugglehad taken its course who has been involved in your training until now thesmile was thin hollow 
 luke was silent he would reveal nothing 
 oh i know it was kenobi at first the wicked ruler continued rubbinghis fingers together as if trying to remember then pausing his lips creased into asneer of course we are familiar with the talent kenobi had when itcame to training jedi he nodded politely in direction previous star pupil vader stood without responding without moving 
 luke tensed with fury at the defamation of of the emperor it was praise and he bridled even more knowing the emperor wasso nearly right he tried to bring his anger under control though for it seemed toplease the malevolent dictator greatly 
 palpatine noted the emotions on face and chuckled so in your earlytraining you have followed your path it would seem but alas isnow dead i believe his elder student here saw to that again he made a handmotion toward vader so tell me young continued yourtraining 
 that smile again like a knife luke held silent struggling to regain hiscomposure 
 the emperor tapped his fingers on the arm of the throne recalling there wasone calledyoda an aged master jediah i see by your countenance i have hit achord a resonant chord indeed yoda then 
 luke flashed with anger at himself now to have revealed so much anger and he strove to calm see all to shownothing only to be 
 this yoda the emperor mused lives he still 
 luke focused on the emptiness of space beyond the window behind chair the deep void where nothing was nothing he filled his mindwith this black nothing opaque save for the occasional flickering of starlight thatfiltered through the ether 
 ah cried emperor palpatine he lives not very good young almost hid this from me but you could not and you can not your deepestflickerings are to me apparent your nakedest soul that is my first lesson to beamed 
 luke a moment in the very faltering he found strength thushad ben and yoda both instructed him when you are attacked fall let power buffet you as strong wind topples the grass in time he willexpend himself and you will still be upright 
 the emperor watched face with cunning sure yoda taught you touse the force with great skill 
 the taunt had its desired face flushed his muscles flexed 
 he saw the emperor actually lick his lips at the sight of reaction lickhis lips and laugh from the bottom of his throat the bottom of his soul 
 luke paused for he saw something else as well something he seenbefore in the emperor fear 
 luke saw fear in the of luke fear of power fear thatthis power could be turned on the the same way vader hadturned it on kenobi luke saw this fear in the he knew odds had shifted slightly he had glimpsed the nakedest self 
 with sudden absolute calm luke stood upright he stared directly intc themalign hood 
 palpatine said nothing for a few moments returning the young his strengths and weaknesses he sat back at last pleased with this firstconfrontation i look forward to completing your training young skywalker intime you will call me master 
 for the first time luke felt steady enough to speak gravely will not convert me as you did my father 
 no my young jedi the emperor leaned forward gloating you will find thatit is you who are mistakenabout a great many things 
 palpatine suddenly stood came down from his throne walked up very close toluke stared venomously into the eyes at last luke saw the entire facewithin the hood eyes sunken like tombs the flesh decayed beneath skin weatheredby virulent storms lined by holocaust the grin a the breath corrupt 
 vader extended a gloved hand toward the emperor holding out emperor took it with a slow sort of glee then walked with it across the room tothe huge circular the death star had been revolving slowly so thesanctuary moon was now visible at the curving margin 
 palpatine looked at endor then back at the lightsaber in his hand ah yes weapon much like your he faced luke directly by now youmust know your father can never be turned from the dark side so will it be withyou 
 never soon i will die and you with me luke was confident of that allowed himself the luxury of a boast 
 the emperor laughed a vile laugh perhaps you refer to the imminent attackof your rebel fleet luke had a thick reeling moment then steadied himself theemperor went on i assure you we are quite safe from your friends here 
 vader walked toward the emperor stood at his side looking at luke 
 luke felt increasingly raw your overconfidence is your weakness hechallenged them 
 your faith in your friends is yours the emperor began smiling but then hismouth turned down his voice grew angry everything that has transpired has doneso according to my design your friends up there on the sanctuary into a trap and so is your rebel fleet 
 face twitched visibly the emperor saw this and really began to was i who allowed the alliance to know the location of the shield generator it isquite safe from your pitiful little entire legion of my troops awaits themthere 
 eyes darted from the emperor to vader and finally to the lightsaber inthe hand his mind quivered with alternatives suddenly everything wasout of control again he could count on nothing but himself and on himself hishold was tenuous 
 the emperor kept rattling on imperiously afraid the deflector shield willbe quite operational when your fleet arrives and that is only the beginning of of course i wish to spoil it for you 
 the situation was degenerating fast from perspective defeat afterdefeat was being piled on his head how much could he take and now anothersurprise coming there seemed to be no end to the rank deeds palpatine could carryout against the galaxy slowly infinitesimally luke raised his hand in the directionof the lightsaber 
 the emperor continued from here young skywalker you will witness thefinal destruction of the the end of your insignificant rebellion 
 luke was in torment he raised his hand further he realized both palpatineand vader were watching him he lowered his hand lowered his level of to restore his previous calm to find his center to see what it was he needed to do 
 the emperor smiled a thin dry smile he offered the lightsaber to want this you the hate is swelling in you now very good take yourjedi weapon use it i am unarmed strike me down with it give in your each passing moment you make yourself more my servant 
 his rasping laughter echoed off the walls like desert wind vader continuedstaring at luke 
 luke tried to hide his agony no never he thought desperately of ben andyoda they were part of the force now part of the energy that shaped it was itpossible for them to distort the vision by their presence no one wasinfallible ben had told the emperor see everything every future twist every reality to suit his gluttony ben thought luke if everi needed your guidance it is now where can i take this that it will not lead me toruin 
 as if in answer the emperor leered and put the lightsaber down on the controlchair near hand it is unavoidable the emperor said quietly it is yourdestiny you like your father are nowmine 
 luke had never felt so lost 
 han chewie leia and a dozen commandos made their way down thelabyrinthine corridors toward the area where the shield generator room was marked onthe stolen map yellow lights illuminated the low rafters casting long shadows ateach intersection at the first three turnings all remained quiet they saw no guardor worker 
 at the fourth six imperial stormtroopers stood a wary watch 
 there was no way around the section had to be traversed han and leia lookedat each other and shrugged there was nothing for it but to fight 
 with pistols drawn they barged into the entryway almost as if beenexpecting an attack the guards instantly crouched and began firing their own barrage of laserbolts followed ricocheting from girder to floor twostormtroopers were hit immediately a third lost his gun pinned behind arefrigerator console he was unable to do much but stay low 
 two more stood behind a fire door though and blasted each commando whotried to get through four went down the guards were virtually impregnablebehind their vulcanized virtually account for wookiees 
 chewbacca rushed the door physically dislodging it on top of the twostormtroopers they were crushed 
 leia shot the sixth guard as he stood to draw a bead on chewie the been crouching beneath the refrigeration unit suddenly bolted to go for raced after him a few long strides and brought him down with a flying was out cold 
 they checked themselves over accounted for casualties not too ithad been noisy have to hurry now before a general alarm was set thepower center that controlled the shield generator was very near and there would beno second chances 
 the rebel fleet broke out of hyperspace with an awesome roar amidglistening streamers of light battalion after battalion emerged in formation to fire offtoward the death star and its sanctuary moon hovering brightly in the close the entire navy was bearing down on its target the millennium falcon in thelead 
 lando was worried from the moment they came out of hyperspace he checkedhis screen reversed polarities queried the computer 
 the copilot was perplexed as well zhnh ahzi gngnohzh dzhy lyhz 
 but how could that be lando demanded got to be able to get somekind of reading on the shield up or down who was conning whom on this raid 
 nien nunb pointed at the control panel shaking his head dzhmbd 
 jammed how could they be jamming us if they 
 he grimaced at the onrushing death star as the implications of what justsaid sank in this was not a surprise attack after all it was a spider web 
 he hit the switch on his comlink break off the attack the still up 
 red voice shouted back over the headphones i get no reading areyou sure 
 pull up lando commanded all craft pull up 
 he banked hard to the left the fighters of the red squad veering close on his tail 
 some make it three flanking nicked the invisible deflectorshield spinning out of control exploding in flames along the shield surface noneof the others paused to look back 
 on the rebel star cruiser bridge alarms were screaming light flashing klaxonsblaring as the mammoth space cruiser abruptly altered its momentum trying tochange course in time to avoid collision with the shield officers were running frombattle stations to navigation controls other ships in the fleet could be seen through careening wildly in a hundred directions some slowing some speedingup 
 admiral ackbar spoke urgently but quietly into the comlink take evasiveaction green group steer course for holding sector mg blue group 
 a mon calamari controller across the bridge called out to ackbar with graveexcitement admiral we have enemy ships at sector rt and pb 
 the large central was coming alive it was no longer just thedeath star and the green moon behind it gloating isolated in space now themassive imperial fleet could be seen flying in perfect regimental formation out frombehind endor in two behemoth flanking to surround the rebel fleetfrom both sides like the pincers of a deadly scorpion 
 and the shield barricaded the alliance in front they had nowhere to go 
 ackbar spoke desperately into the comlink a trap prepare for attack 
 an anonymous fighter voice came back over the radio fighterscoming in here we go 
 the attack began the battle was joined 
 tie fighters were much faster than the bulky imperial cruisers sothey were the first to make contact with the rebel invaders savage dogfightsensued and soon the black sky was aglow with ruby explosions 
 an aide approached ackbar added power to the forward 
 good double power on the main battery and 
 suddenly the star cruiser was rocked by thermonuclear fireworks outside theobservation window 
 gold wing is hit hard another officer shouted stumbling up to the bridge 
 give them cover ackbar ordered we must have time he spoke againinto the comlink as yet another detonation rumbled the frigate all ships standyour position wait for my command to return 
 it was far too late for lando and his attack squadrons to heed that order were already way ahead of the pack heading straight for the oncoming imperialfleet 
 wedge antilles old buddy from the first campaign let the thataccompanied the falcon as they drew near the imperial defenders his voice cameover the comlink calm and experienced lock in attack positions 
 the wings split like dragonfly gossamers poised for increased maneuvering andpower 
 all wings report in said lando 
 red leader standing by wedge replied 
 green leader standing by 
 blue leader standing by 
 gray leader 
 this last transmission was interrupted by a display of pyrotechnics thatcompletely disintegrated gray wing 
 here they come wedge commented 
 accelerate to attack speed lando ordered draw fire away from ourcruisers as long as possible 
 copy gold leader wedge responded moving to point three acrossthe axis 
 two of them coming in at twenty degrees someone advised 
 i see them noted wedge cut left take the leader 
 watch yourself wedge three from above 
 yeah i 
 on it red leader 
 too many of them 
 taking a lot of fire back off 
 red four watch out 
 hit 
 the spun sparking across the starfield out of power into the void 
 picked one up watch it red six yelled at wedge 
 my negative where is he 
 red six a squadron of fighters has broken through 
 heading for the medical frigate after them 
 go ahead lando agreed going in four marks at point threefive cover me 
 right behind you gold leader red two red three pull in 
 hang on back there 
 close up formations blue group 
 good shooting red two 
 not bad said lando take out the other three 
 calrissian steered the falcon into the complete flip as his crew fired at theimperial fighters from the belly guns two were direct hits the third a glancingblow that caused the tie fighter to tumble into another of its own squads theheavens were absolutely thick with them but the falcon was faster by half thananything else that flew 
 within a matter of minutes the battlefield was a diffuse red glow spotted withpuffs of smoke blazing fireballs whirling spark showers spinning debris rumblingimplosions shafts of light tumbling machinery corpses wells ofblackness electron storms 
 it was a grim and dazzling spectacle and only beginning 
 nien nunb made a guttural aside to lando 
 right the pilot frowned only their fighters are attacking what arethose star destroyers waiting for looked like the emperor was trying to get therebels to buy some real estate he intending to sell 
 dzhng zhng the copilot warned as another squadron of tie fighters swoopeddown from above 
 i see em sure in the middle of it now he took a second to glanceat endor floating peacefully off to his right come on han old buddy let medown 
 han pressed the button on his and covered his head the reinforceddoor to the main control room blew into melted pieces the rebel squad stormedthrough the gaping portal 
 the stormtroopers inside seemed taken completely by surprise a few wereinjured by the exploding door the rest gawked in dismay as the rebels rushed themwith guns drawn han took the lead leia right behind chewie covered the rear 
 they herded all the personnel into one corner of the bunker three commandosguarded them there three more covered the exits the rest began placing theexplosive charges 
 leia studied one of the screens on the control panel hurry han look being attacked 
 solo looked over at the screen blast it with the shield still up against the wall 
 that is correct came a voice from the rear of the room just as you are 
 han and leia spun around to find dozens of imperial guns trained on them anentire legion had been hiding in the wall compartments of the bunker now in asingle moment the rebels were to run far too manystormtroopers to fight completely surrounded 
 more imperial troops charged through the door roughly disarming the stunnedcommandos 
 han chewie and leia exchanged helpless hopeless looks been last chance 
 failed 
 some distance from the main area of battle coasting safely in the center of theblanket of ships that constituted the imperial fleet was the flagship super stardestroyer on the bridge admiral piett watched the war through the enormousobservation as if viewing an elaborate demonstration or anentertainment 
 two fleet captains stood behind him respectfully silent also learning the elegantdesigns of their emperor 
 have the fleet hold here admiral piett ordered 
 the first captain hurried to carry out the order the second stepped up to thewindow beside the admiral we going to attack 
 piett smirked i have my orders from the emperor himself he hassomething special planned for this rebel scum he accented the specialness with along pause for the inquisitive captain to savor we are only to keep them fromescaping 
 the emperor lord vader and luke watched the aerial battle rage from thesafety of the throne room in the death star 
 it was a scene of pandemonium silent crystalline explosions surrounded bygreen violet or magenta auras wildly vicious dogfights gracefully floatingcrags of melted steel icicle sprays that might have been blood 
 luke watched in horror as another rebel ship toppled against the unseeabledeflector shield exploding in a fiery concussion 
 vader watched luke his boy was powerful stronger than still pliable not lost to the sickening weakly side of the force thathad to beg for everything it received or to the emperor who feared luke with reason 
 there was yet time to take luke for his retake him to join with himin dark majesty to rule the galaxy together it would only take patience and alittle wizardry to show luke the exquisite satisfactions of the dark way and to pryhim from the terrified clutch 
 vader knew luke had seen it fear he was a clever luke vader smiled grimly to himself he was his son 
 the emperor interrupted contemplation with a cackled remark to you can see my young apprentice the deflector shield is still in place yourfriends have failed and now he raised his spindly hand above his head to markthis moment witness the power of this fully armed and operational battle walked over to the comlink and spoke in a gravelly whisper as if to a at will commander 
 in shock and in foreknowledge luke looked out across the surface of the deathstar to the space battle beyond and to the bulk of the rebel fleet beyond that 
 down in the bowels of the death star commander jerjerrod gave an order itwas with mixed feelings that he issued the command because it meant the finaldestruction of the rebel meant an end to the state of jerjerrod cherished above all things but second to ongoing war itselfjerjerrod loved total annihilation so while tempered with regret this order was notentirely without thrill 
 at instruction a controller pulled a switch which ignited a blinkingpanel two hooded imperial soldiers pushed a series of buttons a thick beam oflight slowly pulsed from a long heavily blockaded shaft on the outer surface of thecompleted half of the death star a giant laser dish began to glow 
 luke watched in impotent horror as the unbelievably huge laser beam radiatedout from the muzzle of the death star it only an of therebel star cruisers that was surging in the midst of the heaviest fighting and in thenext instant the star cruiser was vaporized blown to dust returned to its mostelemental particles in a single burst of light 
 in the numbing grip of despair with the hollowest of voids devouring his eyes alone he saw again his lightsaber lying unattended on thethrone and in this bleak and livid moment the dark side was much with him

 return of the jedi 
 vii 
 
 so the dark lord rumbled you have come to me 
 and you to me 
 the emperor is expecting you he believes you will turn to the dark side 
 i knowfather it was momentous act for address his father ashis father but done it now and kept himself under control and the momentwas past it was done he felt stronger for it he felt potent 
 so you have finally accepted the truth vader gloated 
 i have accepted the truth that you were once anakin skywalker my father 
 that name no longer has meaning for me it was a name long ago adifferent life a different universe could he truly once have been that man 
 it is the name of your true self gaze bore steadily down on the cloakedfigure you have only forgotten i know there is good in you the driven it fully away he molded with his voice tried to form the potentialreality with the strength of his belief why you could not destroy why you take me to your emperor now 
 vader seemed almost to smile through his mask at his use of he looked down at the lightsaber the captain had lightsaber so the boy was truly a jedi now a man grown he heldthe lightsaber up you have constructed another 
 this one is mine luke said quietly i no longer use yours 
 vader ignited the blade examined its humming brilliant light like an admiringcraftsman your skills are complete indeed you are as powerful as the emperorhas foreseen 
 they stood there for a moment the lightsaber between them sparks dove inand out of the cutting edge photons pushed to the brink by the energy pulsingbetween these two warriors 
 come with me father 
 vader shook his head ben once thought as you do 
 blame ben for your fall luke took a step closer then stopped 
 vader did not move you know the power of the dark side i mustobey my master 
 i will not will be forced to destroy me 
 if that is your destiny this was not his wish but the boy was itcame at last to blows yes he would destroy luke he could no long afford to holdback as he once had 
 search your feelings father you do this i feel the conflict within go of your hate 
 but vader hated no one he only lusted too blindly someone has filled yourmind with foolish ideas young one the emperor will show you the true nature ofthe force he is your master now 
 vader signaled to a squad of distant stormtroopers as he extinguished the guards approached luke and the dark lord faced one another fora long searching moment vader spoke just before the guards arrived 
 it is too late for me son 
 then my father is truly dead answered luke so what was to stop him fromkilling the evil one who stood before him now he wondered 
 noting perhaps 
 the vast rebel fleet hung poised in space ready to strike it was hundreds from the death in hyperspace all time was a moment and thedeadliness of an attack was measured not in distance but in precision 
 ships changed in formation from corner to side creating a faceted diamondshape to the if like a cobra the fleet was spreading its hood 
 the calculations required to launch such a meticulously coordinated offensive atlightspeed made it necessary to fix on a stationary it stationary relative tothe point of reentry from hyperspace the point chosen by the rebel command wasa small blue planet of the sullust system the armada was positioned around it unblinking cerulean world it looked like the eye of the serpent 
 the millennium falcon finished its rounds of the perimeter checkingfinal positions then pulled into place beneath the flagship the time had come 
 lando was at the controls of the falcon beside him his copilot jowled creature from switches monitoredreadouts and made final preparations for the jump to hyperspace 
 lando set his comlink to war channel last hand of the night his deal a tablefull of high favorite kind of game with dry mouth he made hissummary report to ackbar of the command ship admiral in position allfighters are accounted for 
 voice crackled back over the headset proceed with the groups assume attack coordinates 
 lando turned to his copilot with a quick smile worry my friends aredown there have that shield down on time he turned back to hisinstruments saying under his breath or this will be the shortest offensive of alltime 
 gzhung zhgodio the copilot commented 
 all right lando grunted stand by then he patted the control panel forgood luck even though his deepest belief was that a good gambler made his own what job was this time and han had almost never let lando that was a long time ago in a star system far far away 
 this time was different this time they were going to redefine luck and call itlando he smiled and patted the panel one more timejust right 
 up on the bridge of the star cruiser command ship ackbar paused lookedaround at his generals all was ready 
 are all groups in their attack coordinates he asked he knew they were 
 affirmative admiral 
 ackbar gazed out his meditatively at the starfield for perhaps thelast reflective moment he would ever have he spoke finally into the comlink warchannel all craft will begin the jump to hyperspace on my mark may the forcebe with us 
 he reached forward to the signal button 
 in the falcon lando stared at the identical galactic with foreboding theywere doing what a guerrilla force must never do engage the enemy like a traditionalarmy the imperial army fighting the guerrilla war was it won the rebels by contrast were always theylost and now here was the most dangerous alliance drawn into theopen to fight on the terms if the rebels lost this battle they lost the war 
 suddenly the signal light flashed on the control panel mark theattack was commenced 
 lando pulled back the conversion switch and opened up the throttle outsidethe cockpit the stars began streaking by the streaks grew brighter and longer asthe ships of the fleet roared in large segments at lightspeed keeping pace first withthe very photons of the radiant stars in the vicinity and then soaring through the warpinto hyperspace disappearing the flash of a muon 
 the blue crystal planet hovered in space alone once again staring the void 
 the strike squad crouched behind a woodsy ridge overlooking the imperialoutpost leia viewed the area through a small electronic scanner 
 two shuttles were being on the landing platform docking walkers were parked nearby troops stood around helped with watch carried supplies the massive shield generator hummed off to the side 
 flattened down in the bushes on the ridge with the strike force were severalewoks including wicket paploo teebo and warwick the rest stayed the knoll out of sight 
 leia put down the scanner and scuttled back to the others the entrance is onthe far side of that landing platform this going to be easy 
 ahrck grah rahr hrowrowhr chewbacca agreed 
 oh come on chewie han gave the wookiee a pained look gotteninto more heavily guarded places than that 
 frowh rahgh rahrahraff vrawgh gr chewie countered with a dismissinggesture 
 han thought of a second well the spice vaults of gargon for one 
 of course if i could just remember how i did it hanscratched his head poking his memory 
 suddenly paploo began chattering away pointing squealing he garbledsomething to wicket 
 he saying threepio leia asked 
 the golden droid exchanged a few terse sentences with paploo then wicketturned to leia with a hopeful grin 
 threepio too now looked at the princess apparently wicket know about aback entrance to this installation 
 han perked up at that a back door it how we did it 
 four imperial scouts kept watch over the entrance to the bunker from the earth far to the rear of the main section of the shield generatorcomplex their rocket bikes were parked nearby 
 in the undergrowth beyond the rebel strike squad lay in wait 
 grrr rowf rrrhl brhnnn chewbacca observed slowly 
 right chewie solo agreed with just those guards this should byeasier than breaking a bantha 
 it only takes one to sound the alarm leia cautioned 
 han grinned a bit overselfconfidently then have to do this realquietlike if luke can just keep vader off our backs like you said he said he oughta be no sweat just gotta hit those guards fast and quiet 
 threepio whispered to teebo and paploo explaining the problem and theobjective the ewoks babbled giddily a moment then paploo jumped up and racedthrough the underbrush 
 leia checked the instrument on her wrist running out of time in hyperspace by now 
 threepio muttered a question to teebo and received a short reply oh replied starting to rise to look into the clearing beside the bunker 
 stay down rasped solo 
 what is it threepio leia demanded 
 afraid our furry companion has gone and done something rush thedroid hoped he to be blamed for this 
 what are you talking about voice cut with an edge of fear 
 oh no look 
 paploo had scampered down through the bushes to where the scouts bikes wereparked now with the sickening horror of inevitability the rebel leaders watchedthe little ball of fur swing his pudgy body up onto one of the bikes and begin flippingswitches at random before anyone could do anything the engines ignitedwith a rumbling roar the four scouts looked over in surprise paploo grinnedmadly and continued flipping switches 
 leia held her forehead oh no no no 
 chewie barked han nodded so much for our surprise attack 
 the imperial scouts raced toward paploo just as the forward drive the little teddy bear into the forest he had all he could do just to hang onto the handlebar with his stubby paws three of the guards jumped on their ownbikes and sped off in pursuit of the hotrod ewok the fourth scout stayed at his the door of the bunker 
 leia was delighted if a bit incredulous 
 not bad for a ball of fuzz han admired he nodded at chewie and the twoof them slipped down toward the bunker 
 paploo meanwhile was sailing through the trees more lucky than in was going at fairly low velocity for what the bike could in was absolutely dizzy with speed and excitement it was terrifying but heloved it he could talk about this ride until the end of his life and then his childrenwould tell their children and it would get faster with each generation 
 for now though the imperial scouts were already pulling in sight behind a moment later they began firing laser bolts at him he decided finallyhad enough as he rounded the next tree just out of their sight he grabbed a vineand swung up into the branches several seconds later the three scouts tore byunderneath him pressing their pursuit to the limit he giggled furiously 
 back at the bunker the laser scout was undone subdued by chewbacca of his suit he was being carried into the woods now by two other members ofthe strike team the rest of the squad silently crouched forming a perimeter aroundthe entrance 
 han stood at the door checking the stolen code against the digits on the panel with natural speed he punched a series of buttons on the the door opened 
 leia peeked inside no sigh of life she motioned the others and entered thebunker han and chewie followed close on her heels soon the entire team washuddled inside the otherwise empty steel corridor leaving one lookout in the unconscious uniform han pushed a series of buttons on theinner panel closing the door behind them 
 leia thought briefly of hoped he could detain vader at least longenough to allow her to destroy this shield generator she hoped even more dearly hecould avoid such a confrontation altogether for she feared vader was the strongerof the two 
 furtively she led the way down the dark and tunnel 
 shuttle settled onto the docking bay of the death star like a bird like a nightmare insect luke and the dark lordemerged from the snout of the beast with a small escort of stormtroopers and walkedrapidly across the cavernous main bay to the tower elevator 
 royal guards awaited them there flanking the shaft bathed in a carmine opened the elevator door luke stepped forward 
 his mind was buzzing with what to do it was the emperor he was being takento now the emperor if luke could but focus keep his mind clear to see whatmust be do it 
 a great noise filled his head though like an underground wind 
 he hoped leia deactivated the deflector shield quickly and destroyed the while all three of them were here before anything else happened forthe closer luke came to the emperor the more anything he feared would happen ablack storm raged inside him he wanted to kill the emperor but then vader what would his father do and what if luke faced his father him him the thought was at once repugnant and then what for the first time luke had a brief murky image ofhimself standing on his body holding his blazing power and sittingat the right hand 
 he squeezed his eyes shut against this thought but it left a cold sweat on hisbrow as if hand had brushed him there and left its shallow imprint 
 the elevator door opened luke and vader walked out into the throne roomalone across the unlit antechamber up the grated stairs to stand before the and son side by side both dressed in black one masked and one the gaze of the malignant emperor 
 vader bowed to his master the emperor motioned him to rise though thedark lord did his bidding 
 welcome young skywalker the evil one smiled graciously i have beenexpecting you 
 luke stared back brazenly at the bent hooded figure defiantly smile grew even softer though even more fatherly he looked at 
 you no longer need these he added with noblesse made theslightest motion with his finger in the direction of wrists at that simply fell away clattering noisily to the floor 
 luke looked at his own now to reach out for the crush his windpipe in an instant 
 yet the emperor seemed gentle had he not just let luke free but he wasdevious too luke knew do not be fooled by appearances ben had told him theemperor was unarmed he could still strike but aggression part of thedark side he avoid that at all costs or could he use darkness then put it away he stared at his free handshe could have ended it all could he he had total freedom to choose what to do now yet he couldnot choose choice the sword he could kill the emperor he couldsuccumb to the arguments he could kill vaderand then he could evenbecome vader again this thought laughed at him like a broken clown until hepushed it back into a black corner of his brain 
 the emperor sat before him smiling the moment was convulsive withpossibilities 
 the moment passed he did nothing 
 tell me young skywalker the emperor said when he saw first strugglehad taken its course who has been involved in your training until now thesmile was thin hollow 
 luke was silent he would reveal nothing 
 oh i know it was kenobi at first the wicked ruler continued rubbinghis fingers together as if trying to remember then pausing his lips creased into asneer of course we are familiar with the talent kenobi had when itcame to training jedi he nodded politely in direction previous star pupil vader stood without responding without moving 
 luke tensed with fury at the defamation of of the emperor it was praise and he bridled even more knowing the emperor wasso nearly right he tried to bring his anger under control though for it seemed toplease the malevolent dictator greatly 
 palpatine noted the emotions on face and chuckled so in your earlytraining you have followed your path it would seem but alas isnow dead i believe his elder student here saw to that again he made a handmotion toward vader so tell me young continued yourtraining 
 that smile again like a knife luke held silent struggling to regain hiscomposure 
 the emperor tapped his fingers on the arm of the throne recalling there wasone calledyoda an aged master jediah i see by your countenance i have hit achord a resonant chord indeed yoda then 
 luke flashed with anger at himself now to have revealed so much anger and he strove to calm see all to shownothing only to be 
 this yoda the emperor mused lives he still 
 luke focused on the emptiness of space beyond the window behind chair the deep void where nothing was nothing he filled his mindwith this black nothing opaque save for the occasional flickering of starlight thatfiltered through the ether 
 ah cried emperor palpatine he lives not very good young almost hid this from me but you could not and you can not your deepestflickerings are to me apparent your nakedest soul that is my first lesson to beamed 
 luke a moment in the very faltering he found strength thushad ben and yoda both instructed him when you are attacked fall let power buffet you as strong wind topples the grass in time he willexpend himself and you will still be upright 
 the emperor watched face with cunning sure yoda taught you touse the force with great skill 
 the taunt had its desired face flushed his muscles flexed 
 he saw the emperor actually lick his lips at the sight of reaction lickhis lips and laugh from the bottom of his throat the bottom of his soul 
 luke paused for he saw something else as well something he seenbefore in the emperor fear 
 luke saw fear in the of luke fear of power fear thatthis power could be turned on the the same way vader hadturned it on kenobi luke saw this fear in the he knew odds had shifted slightly he had glimpsed the nakedest self 
 with sudden absolute calm luke stood upright he stared directly intc themalign hood 
 palpatine said nothing for a few moments returning the young his strengths and weaknesses he sat back at last pleased with this firstconfrontation i look forward to completing your training young skywalker intime you will call me master 
 for the first time luke felt steady enough to speak gravely will not convert me as you did my father 
 no my young jedi the emperor leaned forward gloating you will find thatit is you who are mistakenabout a great many things 
 palpatine suddenly stood came down from his throne walked up very close toluke stared venomously into the eyes at last luke saw the entire facewithin the hood eyes sunken like tombs the flesh decayed beneath skin weatheredby virulent storms lined by holocaust the grin a the breath corrupt 
 vader extended a gloved hand toward the emperor holding out emperor took it with a slow sort of glee then walked with it across the room tothe huge circular the death star had been revolving slowly so thesanctuary moon was now visible at the curving margin 
 palpatine looked at endor then back at the lightsaber in his hand ah yes weapon much like your he faced luke directly by now youmust know your father can never be turned from the dark side so will it be withyou 
 never soon i will die and you with me luke was confident of that allowed himself the luxury of a boast 
 the emperor laughed a vile laugh perhaps you refer to the imminent attackof your rebel fleet luke had a thick reeling moment then steadied himself theemperor went on i assure you we are quite safe from your friends here 
 vader walked toward the emperor stood at his side looking at luke 
 luke felt increasingly raw your overconfidence is your weakness hechallenged them 
 your faith in your friends is yours the emperor began smiling but then hismouth turned down his voice grew angry everything that has transpired has doneso according to my design your friends up there on the sanctuary into a trap and so is your rebel fleet 
 face twitched visibly the emperor saw this and really began to was i who allowed the alliance to know the location of the shield generator it isquite safe from your pitiful little entire legion of my troops awaits themthere 
 eyes darted from the emperor to vader and finally to the lightsaber inthe hand his mind quivered with alternatives suddenly everything wasout of control again he could count on nothing but himself and on himself hishold was tenuous 
 the emperor kept rattling on imperiously afraid the deflector shield willbe quite operational when your fleet arrives and that is only the beginning of of course i wish to spoil it for you 
 the situation was degenerating fast from perspective defeat afterdefeat was being piled on his head how much could he take and now anothersurprise coming there seemed to be no end to the rank deeds palpatine could carryout against the galaxy slowly infinitesimally luke raised his hand in the directionof the lightsaber 
 the emperor continued from here young skywalker you will witness thefinal destruction of the the end of your insignificant rebellion 
 luke was in torment he raised his hand further he realized both palpatineand vader were watching him he lowered his hand lowered his level of to restore his previous calm to find his center to see what it was he needed to do 
 the emperor smiled a thin dry smile he offered the lightsaber to want this you the hate is swelling in you now very good take yourjedi weapon use it i am unarmed strike me down with it give in your each passing moment you make yourself more my servant 
 his rasping laughter echoed off the walls like desert wind vader continuedstaring at luke 
 luke tried to hide his agony no never he thought desperately of ben andyoda they were part of the force now part of the energy that shaped it was itpossible for them to distort the vision by their presence no one wasinfallible ben had told the emperor see everything every future twist every reality to suit his gluttony ben thought luke if everi needed your guidance it is now where can i take this that it will not lead me toruin 
 as if in answer the emperor leered and put the lightsaber down on the controlchair near hand it is unavoidable the emperor said quietly it is yourdestiny you like your father are nowmine 
 luke had never felt so lost 
 han chewie leia and a dozen commandos made their way down thelabyrinthine corridors toward the area where the shield generator room was marked onthe stolen map yellow lights illuminated the low rafters casting long shadows ateach intersection at the first three turnings all remained quiet they saw no guardor worker 
 at the fourth six imperial stormtroopers stood a wary watch 
 there was no way around the section had to be traversed han and leia lookedat each other and shrugged there was nothing for it but to fight 
 with pistols drawn they barged into the entryway almost as if beenexpecting an attack the guards instantly crouched and began firing their own barrage of laserbolts followed ricocheting from girder to floor twostormtroopers were hit immediately a third lost his gun pinned behind arefrigerator console he was unable to do much but stay low 
 two more stood behind a fire door though and blasted each commando whotried to get through four went down the guards were virtually impregnablebehind their vulcanized virtually account for wookiees 
 chewbacca rushed the door physically dislodging it on top of the twostormtroopers they were crushed 
 leia shot the sixth guard as he stood to draw a bead on chewie the been crouching beneath the refrigeration unit suddenly bolted to go for raced after him a few long strides and brought him down with a flying was out cold 
 they checked themselves over accounted for casualties not too ithad been noisy have to hurry now before a general alarm was set thepower center that controlled the shield generator was very near and there would beno second chances 
 the rebel fleet broke out of hyperspace with an awesome roar amidglistening streamers of light battalion after battalion emerged in formation to fire offtoward the death star and its sanctuary moon hovering brightly in the close the entire navy was bearing down on its target the millennium falcon in thelead 
 lando was worried from the moment they came out of hyperspace he checkedhis screen reversed polarities queried the computer 
 the copilot was perplexed as well zhnh ahzi gngnohzh dzhy lyhz 
 but how could that be lando demanded got to be able to get somekind of reading on the shield up or down who was conning whom on this raid 
 nien nunb pointed at the control panel shaking his head dzhmbd 
 jammed how could they be jamming us if they 
 he grimaced at the onrushing death star as the implications of what justsaid sank in this was not a surprise attack after all it was a spider web 
 he hit the switch on his comlink break off the attack the still up 
 red voice shouted back over the headphones i get no reading areyou sure 
 pull up lando commanded all craft pull up 
 he banked hard to the left the fighters of the red squad veering close on his tail 
 some make it three flanking nicked the invisible deflectorshield spinning out of control exploding in flames along the shield surface noneof the others paused to look back 
 on the rebel star cruiser bridge alarms were screaming light flashing klaxonsblaring as the mammoth space cruiser abruptly altered its momentum trying tochange course in time to avoid collision with the shield officers were running frombattle stations to navigation controls other ships in the fleet could be seen through careening wildly in a hundred directions some slowing some speedingup 
 admiral ackbar spoke urgently but quietly into the comlink take evasiveaction green group steer course for holding sector mg blue group 
 a mon calamari controller across the bridge called out to ackbar with graveexcitement admiral we have enemy ships at sector rt and pb 
 the large central was coming alive it was no longer just thedeath star and the green moon behind it gloating isolated in space now themassive imperial fleet could be seen flying in perfect regimental formation out frombehind endor in two behemoth flanking to surround the rebel fleetfrom both sides like the pincers of a deadly scorpion 
 and the shield barricaded the alliance in front they had nowhere to go 
 ackbar spoke desperately into the comlink a trap prepare for attack 
 an anonymous fighter voice came back over the radio fighterscoming in here we go 
 the attack began the battle was joined 
 tie fighters were much faster than the bulky imperial cruisers sothey were the first to make contact with the rebel invaders savage dogfightsensued and soon the black sky was aglow with ruby explosions 
 an aide approached ackbar added power to the forward 
 good double power on the main battery and 
 suddenly the star cruiser was rocked by thermonuclear fireworks outside theobservation window 
 gold wing is hit hard another officer shouted stumbling up to the bridge 
 give them cover ackbar ordered we must have time he spoke againinto the comlink as yet another detonation rumbled the frigate all ships standyour position wait for my command to return 
 it was far too late for lando and his attack squadrons to heed that order were already way ahead of the pack heading straight for the oncoming imperialfleet 
 wedge antilles old buddy from the first campaign let the thataccompanied the falcon as they drew near the imperial defenders his voice cameover the comlink calm and experienced lock in attack positions 
 the wings split like dragonfly gossamers poised for increased maneuvering andpower 
 all wings report in said lando 
 red leader standing by wedge replied 
 green leader standing by 
 blue leader standing by 
 gray leader 
 this last transmission was interrupted by a display of pyrotechnics thatcompletely disintegrated gray wing 
 here they come wedge commented 
 accelerate to attack speed lando ordered draw fire away from ourcruisers as long as possible 
 copy gold leader wedge responded moving to point three acrossthe axis 
 two of them coming in at twenty degrees someone advised 
 i see them noted wedge cut left take the leader 
 watch yourself wedge three from above 
 yeah i 
 on it red leader 
 too many of them 
 taking a lot of fire back off 
 red four watch out 
 hit 
 the spun sparking across the starfield out of power into the void 
 picked one up watch it red six yelled at wedge 
 my negative where is he 
 red six a squadron of fighters has broken through 
 heading for the medical frigate after them 
 go ahead lando agreed going in four marks at point threefive cover me 
 right behind you gold leader red two red three pull in 
 hang on back there 
 close up formations blue group 
 good shooting red two 
 not bad said lando take out the other three 
 calrissian steered the falcon into the complete flip as his crew fired at theimperial fighters from the belly guns two were direct hits the third a glancingblow that caused the tie fighter to tumble into another of its own squads theheavens were absolutely thick with them but the falcon was faster by half thananything else that flew 
 within a matter of minutes the battlefield was a diffuse red glow spotted withpuffs of smoke blazing fireballs whirling spark showers spinning debris rumblingimplosions shafts of light tumbling machinery corpses wells ofblackness electron storms 
 it was a grim and dazzling spectacle and only beginning 
 nien nunb made a guttural aside to lando 
 right the pilot frowned only their fighters are attacking what arethose star destroyers waiting for looked like the emperor was trying to get therebels to buy some real estate he intending to sell 
 dzhng zhng the copilot warned as another squadron of tie fighters swoopeddown from above 
 i see em sure in the middle of it now he took a second to glanceat endor floating peacefully off to his right come on han old buddy let medown 
 han pressed the button on his and covered his head the reinforceddoor to the main control room blew into melted pieces the rebel squad stormedthrough the gaping portal 
 the stormtroopers inside seemed taken completely by surprise a few wereinjured by the exploding door the rest gawked in dismay as the rebels rushed themwith guns drawn han took the lead leia right behind chewie covered the rear 
 they herded all the personnel into one corner of the bunker three commandosguarded them there three more covered the exits the rest began placing theexplosive charges 
 leia studied one of the screens on the control panel hurry han look being attacked 
 solo looked over at the screen blast it with the shield still up against the wall 
 that is correct came a voice from the rear of the room just as you are 
 han and leia spun around to find dozens of imperial guns trained on them anentire legion had been hiding in the wall compartments of the bunker now in asingle moment the rebels were to run far too manystormtroopers to fight completely surrounded 
 more imperial troops charged through the door roughly disarming the stunnedcommandos 
 han chewie and leia exchanged helpless hopeless looks been last chance 
 failed 
 some distance from the main area of battle coasting safely in the center of theblanket of ships that constituted the imperial fleet was the flagship super stardestroyer on the bridge admiral piett watched the war through the enormousobservation as if viewing an elaborate demonstration or anentertainment 
 two fleet captains stood behind him respectfully silent also learning the elegantdesigns of their emperor 
 have the fleet hold here admiral piett ordered 
 the first captain hurried to carry out the order the second stepped up to thewindow beside the admiral we going to attack 
 piett smirked i have my orders from the emperor himself he hassomething special planned for this rebel scum he accented the specialness with along pause for the inquisitive captain to savor we are only to keep them fromescaping 
 the emperor lord vader and luke watched the aerial battle rage from thesafety of the throne room in the death star 
 it was a scene of pandemonium silent crystalline explosions surrounded bygreen violet or magenta auras wildly vicious dogfights gracefully floatingcrags of melted steel icicle sprays that might have been blood 
 luke watched in horror as another rebel ship toppled against the unseeabledeflector shield exploding in a fiery concussion 
 vader watched luke his boy was powerful stronger than still pliable not lost to the sickening weakly side of the force thathad to beg for everything it received or to the emperor who feared luke with reason 
 there was yet time to take luke for his retake him to join with himin dark majesty to rule the galaxy together it would only take patience and alittle wizardry to show luke the exquisite satisfactions of the dark way and to pryhim from the terrified clutch 
 vader knew luke had seen it fear he was a clever luke vader smiled grimly to himself he was his son 
 the emperor interrupted contemplation with a cackled remark to you can see my young apprentice the deflector shield is still in place yourfriends have failed and now he raised his spindly hand above his head to markthis moment witness the power of this fully armed and operational battle walked over to the comlink and spoke in a gravelly whisper as if to a at will commander 
 in shock and in foreknowledge luke looked out across the surface of the deathstar to the space battle beyond and to the bulk of the rebel fleet beyond that 
 down in the bowels of the death star commander jerjerrod gave an order itwas with mixed feelings that he issued the command because it meant the finaldestruction of the rebel meant an end to the state of jerjerrod cherished above all things but second to ongoing war itselfjerjerrod loved total annihilation so while tempered with regret this order was notentirely without thrill 
 at instruction a controller pulled a switch which ignited a blinkingpanel two hooded imperial soldiers pushed a series of buttons a thick beam oflight slowly pulsed from a long heavily blockaded shaft on the outer surface of thecompleted half of the death star a giant laser dish began to glow 
 luke watched in impotent horror as the unbelievably huge laser beam radiatedout from the muzzle of the death star it only an of therebel star cruisers that was surging in the midst of the heaviest fighting and in thenext instant the star cruiser was vaporized blown to dust returned to its mostelemental particles in a single burst of light 
 in the numbing grip of despair with the hollowest of voids devouring his eyes alone he saw again his lightsaber lying unattended on thethrone and in this bleak and livid moment the dark side was much with him

 chapter viii 
 
 the last of the infantry hurriedly crossed the bridge squeezing together as they approached it as if passing through a funnel at last the baggage wagons had all crossed the crush was less and the last battalion came onto the bridge only squadron of hussars remained on the farther side of the bridge facing the enemy who could be seen from the hill on the opposite bank but was not yet visible from the bridge for the horizon as seen from the valley through which the river flowed was formed by the rising ground only half a mile away at the foot of the hill lay wasteland over which a few groups of our cossack scouts were moving suddenly on the road at the top of the high ground artillery and troops in blue uniform were seen these were the french a group of cossack scouts retired down the hill at a trot all the officers and men of squadron though they tried to talk of other things and to look in other directions thought only of what was there on the hilltop and kept constantly looking at the patches appearing on the skyline which they knew to be the troops the weather had cleared again since noon and the sun was descending brightly upon the danube and the dark hills around it it was calm and at intervals the bugle calls and the shouts of the enemy could be heard from the hill there was no one now between the squadron and the enemy except a few scattered skirmishers an empty space of some seven hundred yards was all that separated them the enemy ceased firing and that stern threatening inaccessible and intangible line which separates two hostile armies was all the more clearly felt 
 one step beyond that boundary line which resembles the line dividing the living from the dead lies uncertainty suffering and death and what is there who is there there beyond that field that tree that roof lit up by the sun no one knows but one wants to know you fear and yet long to cross that line and know that sooner or later it must be crossed and you will have to find out what is there just as you will inevitably have to learn what lies the other side of death but you are strong healthy cheerful and excited and are surrounded by other such excitedly animated and healthy men so thinks or at any rate feels anyone who comes in sight of the enemy and that feeling gives a particular glamour and glad keenness of impression to everything that takes place at such moments 
 on the high ground where the enemy was the smoke of a cannon rose and a ball flew whistling over the heads of the hussar squadron the officers who had been standing together rode off to their places the hussars began carefully aligning their horses silence fell on the whole squadron all were looking at the enemy in front and at the squadron commander awaiting the word of command a second and a third cannon ball flew past evidently they were firing at the hussars but the balls with rapid rhythmic whistle flew over the heads of the horsemen and fell somewhere beyond them the hussars did not look round but at the sound of each shot as at the word of command the whole squadron with its rows of faces so alike yet so different holding its breath while the ball flew past rose in the stirrups and sank back again the soldiers without turning their heads glanced at one another curious to see their comrades impression every face from to that of the bugler showed one common expression of conflict irritation and excitement around chin and mouth the quartermaster frowned looking at the soldiers as if threatening to punish them cadet mironov ducked every time a ball flew past rostov on the left flank mounted on his rook a handsome horse despite its game leg had the happy air of a schoolboy called up before a large audience for an examination in which he feels sure he will distinguish himself he was glancing at everyone with a clear bright expression as if asking them to notice how calmly he sat under fire but despite himself on his face too that same indication of something new and stern showed round the mouth 
 that curtseying there cadet miwonov not wight look at me cried denisov who unable to keep still on one spot kept turning his horse in front of the squadron 
 the black hairy face of vaska denisov and his whole short sturdy figure with the sinewy hairy hand and stumpy fingers in which he held the hilt of his naked saber looked just as it usually did especially toward evening when he had emptied his second bottle he was only redder than usual with his shaggy head thrown back like birds when they drink pressing his spurs mercilessly into the sides of his good horse bedouin and sitting as though falling backwards in the saddle he galloped to the other flank of the squadron and shouted in a hoarse voice to the men to look to their pistols he rode up to kirsten the staff captain on his steady mare came at a walk to meet him his face with its long mustache was serious as always only his eyes were brighter than usual 
 well what about it said he to denisov it come to a fight see we shall retire 
 the devil only knows what about muttered denisov ah wostov he cried noticing the bright face got it at last 
 and he smiled approvingly evidently pleased with the cadet rostov felt perfectly happy just then the commander appeared on the bridge denisov galloped up to him 
 your excellency let us attack them dwive them off 
 attack indeed said the colonel in a bored voice puckering up his face as if driving off a troublesome fly and why are you stopping here you see the skirmishers are retreating lead the squadron back 
 the squadron crossed the bridge and drew out of range of fire without having lost a single man the second squadron that had been in the front line followed them across and the last cossacks quitted the farther side of the river 
 the two pavlograd squadrons having crossed the bridge retired up the hill one after the other their colonel karl bogdanich schubert came up to squadron and rode at a footpace not far from rostov without taking any notice of him although they were now meeting for the first time since their encounter concerning telyanin rostov feeling that he was at the front and in the power of a man toward whom he now admitted that he had been to blame did not lift his eyes from the athletic back his nape covered with light hair and his red neck it seemed to rostov that bogdanich was only pretending not to notice him and that his whole aim now was to test the courage so he drew himself up and looked around him merrily then it seemed to him that bogdanich rode so near in order to show him his courage next he thought that his enemy would send the squadron on a desperate attack just to punish him rostov then he imagined how after the attack bogdanich would come up to him as he lay wounded and would magnanimously extend the hand of reconciliation 
 the figure of zherkov familiar to the pavlograds as he had but recently left their regiment rode up to the colonel after his dismissal from headquarters zherkov had not remained in the regiment saying he was not such a fool as to slave at the front when he could get more rewards by doing nothing on the staff and had succeeded in attaching himself as an orderly officer to prince bagration he now came to his former chief with an order from the commander of the rear guard 
 colonel he said addressing enemy with an air of gloomy gravity and glancing round at his comrades there is an order to stop and fire the bridge 
 an order to who asked the colonel morosely 
 i myself know to who replied the cornet in a serious tone but the prince told me to go and tell the colonel that the hussars must return quickly and fire the bridge 
 zherkov was followed by an officer of the suite who rode up to the colonel of hussars with the same order after him the stout nesvitski came galloping up on a cossack horse that could scarcely carry his weight 
 this colonel he shouted as he approached i told you to fire the bridge and now someone has gone and blundered they are all beside themselves over there and one make anything out 
 the colonel deliberately stopped the regiment and turned to nesvitski 
 you spoke to me of inflammable material said he but you said nothing about firing it 
 but my dear sir said nesvitski as he drew up taking off his cap and smoothing his hair wet with perspiration with his plump hand i telling you to fire the bridge when inflammable material had been put in position 
 i am not your dear sir mr staff officer and you did not tell me to burn the bridge i know the service and it is my habit orders strictly to obey you said the bridge would be burned but who would it burn i could not know by the holy spirit 
 ah always the way said nesvitski with a wave of the hand how did you get here said he turning to zherkov 
 on the same business but you are damp let me wring you out 
 you were saying mr staff officer continued the colonel in an offended tone 
 colonel interrupted the officer of the suite you must be quick or the enemy will bring up his guns to use grapeshot 
 the colonel looked silently at the officer of the suite at the stout staff officer and at zherkov and he frowned 
 i will the bridge fire he said in a solemn tone as if to announce that in spite of all the unpleasantness he had to endure he would still do the right thing 
 striking his horse with his long muscular legs as if it were to blame for everything the colonel moved forward and ordered the second squadron that in which rostov was serving under denisov to return to the bridge 
 there just as i thought said rostov to himself he wishes to test me his heart contracted and the blood rushed to his face let him see whether i am a coward he thought 
 again on all the bright faces of the squadron the serious expression appeared that they had worn when under fire rostov watched his enemy the colonel closely to find in his face confirmation of his own conjecture but the colonel did not once glance at rostov and looked as he always did when at the front solemn and stern then came the word of command 
 look sharp look sharp several voices repeated around him 
 their sabers catching in the bridles and their spurs jingling the hussars hastily dismounted not knowing what they were to do the men were crossing themselves rostov no longer looked at the colonel he had no time he was afraid of falling behind the hussars so much afraid that his heart stood still his hand trembled as he gave his horse into an charge and he felt the blood rush to his heart with a thud denisov rode past him leaning back and shouting something rostov saw nothing but the hussars running all around him their spurs catching and their sabers clattering 
 stretchers shouted someone behind him 
 rostov did not think what this call for stretchers meant he ran on trying only to be ahead of the others but just at the bridge not looking at the ground he came on some sticky trodden mud stumbled and fell on his hands the others outstripped him 
 at boss zides captain he heard the voice of the colonel who having ridden ahead had pulled up his horse near the bridge with a triumphant cheerful face 
 rostov wiping his muddy hands on his breeches looked at his enemy and was about to run on thinking that the farther he went to the front the better but bogdanich without looking at or recognizing rostov shouted to him 
 that running on the middle of the bridge to the right come back cadet he cried angrily and turning to denisov who showing off his courage had ridden on to the planks of the bridge 
 why run risks captain you should dismount he said 
 oh every bullet has its billet answered vaska denisov turning in his saddle 
 meanwhile nesvitski zherkov and the officer of the suite were standing together out of range of the shots watching now the small group of men with yellow shakos jackets braided with cord and blue riding breeches who were swarming near the bridge and then at what was approaching in the distance from the opposite side the blue uniforms and groups with horses easily recognizable as artillery 
 will they burn the bridge or not get there first will they get there and fire the bridge or will the french get within grapeshot range and wipe them out these were the questions each man of the troops on the high ground above the bridge involuntarily asked himself with a sinking heart watching the bridge and the hussars in the bright evening light and the blue tunics advancing from the other side with their bayonets and guns 
 ugh the hussars will get it hot said nesvitski they are within grapeshot range now 
 he have taken so many men said the officer of the suite 
 true enough answered nesvitski two smart fellows could have done the job just as well 
 ah your excellency put in zherkov his eyes fixed on the hussars but still with that naive air that made it impossible to know whether he was speaking in jest or in earnest ah your excellency how you look at things send two men and who then would give us the vladimir medal and ribbon but now even if they do get peppered the squadron may be recommended for honors and he may get a ribbon our bogdanich knows how things are done 
 there now said the officer of the suite grapeshot 
 he pointed to the french guns the limbers of which were being detached and hurriedly removed 
 on the french side amid the groups with cannon a cloud of smoke appeared then a second and a third almost simultaneously and at the moment when the first report was heard a fourth was seen then two reports one after another and a third 
 oh oh groaned nesvitski as if in fierce pain seizing the officer of the suite by the arm look a man has fallen fallen fallen 
 two i think 
 if i were tsar i would never go to war said nesvitski turning away 
 the french guns were hastily reloaded the infantry in their blue uniforms advanced toward the bridge at a run smoke appeared again but at irregular intervals and grapeshot cracked and rattled onto the bridge but this time nesvitski could not see what was happening there as a dense cloud of smoke arose from it the hussars had succeeded in setting it on fire and the french batteries were now firing at them no longer to hinder them but because the guns were trained and there was someone to fire at 
 the french had time to fire three rounds of grapeshot before the hussars got back to their horses two were misdirected and the shot went too high but the last round fell in the midst of a group of hussars and knocked three of them over 
 rostov absorbed by his relations with bogdanich had paused on the bridge not knowing what to do there was no one to hew down as he had always imagined battles to himself nor could he help to fire the bridge because he had not brought any burning straw with him like the other soldiers he stood looking about him when suddenly he heard a rattle on the bridge as if nuts were being spilt and the hussar nearest to him fell against the rails with a groan rostov ran up to him with the others again someone shouted stretchers four men seized the hussar and began lifting him 
 oooh for sake let me alone cried the wounded man but still he was lifted and laid on the stretcher 
 nicholas rostov turned away and as if searching for something gazed into the distance at the waters of the danube at the sky and at the sun how beautiful the sky looked how blue how calm and how deep how bright and glorious was the setting sun with what soft glitter the waters of the distant danube shone and fairer still were the faraway blue mountains beyond the river the nunnery the mysterious gorges and the pine forests veiled in the mist of their summits there was peace and happiness i should wishing for nothing else nothing if only i were there thought rostov in myself alone and in that sunshine there is so much happiness but here groans suffering fear and this uncertainty and hurry there they are shouting again and again are all running back somewhere and i shall run with them and it death is here above me and around another instant and i shall never again see the sun this water that gorge 
 at that instant the sun began to hide behind the clouds and other stretchers came into view before rostov and the fear of death and of the stretchers and love of the sun and of life all merged into one feeling of sickening agitation 
 o lord god thou who art in that heaven save forgive and protect me rostov whispered 
 the hussars ran back to the men who held their horses their voices sounded louder and calmer the stretchers disappeared from sight 
 well fwiend so smelt powdah shouted vaska denisov just above his ear 
 all over but i am a coward yes a coward thought rostov and sighing deeply he took rook his horse which stood resting one foot from the orderly and began to mount 
 was that grapeshot he asked denisov 
 yes and no mistake cried denisov you worked like wegular bwicks and nasty work an pleasant work hacking away at the dogs but this sort of thing is the very devil with them shooting at you like a target 
 and denisov rode up to a group that had stopped near rostov composed of the colonel nesvitski zherkov and the officer from the suite 
 well it seems that no one has noticed thought rostov and this was true no one had taken any notice for everyone knew the sensation which the cadet under fire for the first time had experienced 
 something for you to report said zherkov see if i get promoted to a sublieutenancy 
 inform the prince that i the bridge fired said the colonel triumphantly and gaily 
 and if he asks about the losses 
 a trifle said the colonel in his bass voice two hussars wounded and one knocked out he added unable to restrain a happy smile and pronouncing the phrase knocked out with ringing distinctness

 chapter viii 
 
 the last of the infantry hurriedly crossed the bridge squeezing together as they approached it as if passing through a funnel at last the baggage wagons had all crossed the crush was less and the last battalion came onto the bridge only squadron of hussars remained on the farther side of the bridge facing the enemy who could be seen from the hill on the opposite bank but was not yet visible from the bridge for the horizon as seen from the valley through which the river flowed was formed by the rising ground only half a mile away at the foot of the hill lay wasteland over which a few groups of our cossack scouts were moving suddenly on the road at the top of the high ground artillery and troops in blue uniform were seen these were the french a group of cossack scouts retired down the hill at a trot all the officers and men of squadron though they tried to talk of other things and to look in other directions thought only of what was there on the hilltop and kept constantly looking at the patches appearing on the skyline which they knew to be the troops the weather had cleared again since noon and the sun was descending brightly upon the danube and the dark hills around it it was calm and at intervals the bugle calls and the shouts of the enemy could be heard from the hill there was no one now between the squadron and the enemy except a few scattered skirmishers an empty space of some seven hundred yards was all that separated them the enemy ceased firing and that stern threatening inaccessible and intangible line which separates two hostile armies was all the more clearly felt 
 one step beyond that boundary line which resembles the line dividing the living from the dead lies uncertainty suffering and death and what is there who is there there beyond that field that tree that roof lit up by the sun no one knows but one wants to know you fear and yet long to cross that line and know that sooner or later it must be crossed and you will have to find out what is there just as you will inevitably have to learn what lies the other side of death but you are strong healthy cheerful and excited and are surrounded by other such excitedly animated and healthy men so thinks or at any rate feels anyone who comes in sight of the enemy and that feeling gives a particular glamour and glad keenness of impression to everything that takes place at such moments 
 on the high ground where the enemy was the smoke of a cannon rose and a ball flew whistling over the heads of the hussar squadron the officers who had been standing together rode off to their places the hussars began carefully aligning their horses silence fell on the whole squadron all were looking at the enemy in front and at the squadron commander awaiting the word of command a second and a third cannon ball flew past evidently they were firing at the hussars but the balls with rapid rhythmic whistle flew over the heads of the horsemen and fell somewhere beyond them the hussars did not look round but at the sound of each shot as at the word of command the whole squadron with its rows of faces so alike yet so different holding its breath while the ball flew past rose in the stirrups and sank back again the soldiers without turning their heads glanced at one another curious to see their comrades impression every face from to that of the bugler showed one common expression of conflict irritation and excitement around chin and mouth the quartermaster frowned looking at the soldiers as if threatening to punish them cadet mironov ducked every time a ball flew past rostov on the left flank mounted on his rook a handsome horse despite its game leg had the happy air of a schoolboy called up before a large audience for an examination in which he feels sure he will distinguish himself he was glancing at everyone with a clear bright expression as if asking them to notice how calmly he sat under fire but despite himself on his face too that same indication of something new and stern showed round the mouth 
 that curtseying there cadet miwonov not wight look at me cried denisov who unable to keep still on one spot kept turning his horse in front of the squadron 
 the black hairy face of vaska denisov and his whole short sturdy figure with the sinewy hairy hand and stumpy fingers in which he held the hilt of his naked saber looked just as it usually did especially toward evening when he had emptied his second bottle he was only redder than usual with his shaggy head thrown back like birds when they drink pressing his spurs mercilessly into the sides of his good horse bedouin and sitting as though falling backwards in the saddle he galloped to the other flank of the squadron and shouted in a hoarse voice to the men to look to their pistols he rode up to kirsten the staff captain on his steady mare came at a walk to meet him his face with its long mustache was serious as always only his eyes were brighter than usual 
 well what about it said he to denisov it come to a fight see we shall retire 
 the devil only knows what about muttered denisov ah wostov he cried noticing the bright face got it at last 
 and he smiled approvingly evidently pleased with the cadet rostov felt perfectly happy just then the commander appeared on the bridge denisov galloped up to him 
 your excellency let us attack them dwive them off 
 attack indeed said the colonel in a bored voice puckering up his face as if driving off a troublesome fly and why are you stopping here you see the skirmishers are retreating lead the squadron back 
 the squadron crossed the bridge and drew out of range of fire without having lost a single man the second squadron that had been in the front line followed them across and the last cossacks quitted the farther side of the river 
 the two pavlograd squadrons having crossed the bridge retired up the hill one after the other their colonel karl bogdanich schubert came up to squadron and rode at a footpace not far from rostov without taking any notice of him although they were now meeting for the first time since their encounter concerning telyanin rostov feeling that he was at the front and in the power of a man toward whom he now admitted that he had been to blame did not lift his eyes from the athletic back his nape covered with light hair and his red neck it seemed to rostov that bogdanich was only pretending not to notice him and that his whole aim now was to test the courage so he drew himself up and looked around him merrily then it seemed to him that bogdanich rode so near in order to show him his courage next he thought that his enemy would send the squadron on a desperate attack just to punish him rostov then he imagined how after the attack bogdanich would come up to him as he lay wounded and would magnanimously extend the hand of reconciliation 
 the figure of zherkov familiar to the pavlograds as he had but recently left their regiment rode up to the colonel after his dismissal from headquarters zherkov had not remained in the regiment saying he was not such a fool as to slave at the front when he could get more rewards by doing nothing on the staff and had succeeded in attaching himself as an orderly officer to prince bagration he now came to his former chief with an order from the commander of the rear guard 
 colonel he said addressing enemy with an air of gloomy gravity and glancing round at his comrades there is an order to stop and fire the bridge 
 an order to who asked the colonel morosely 
 i myself know to who replied the cornet in a serious tone but the prince told me to go and tell the colonel that the hussars must return quickly and fire the bridge 
 zherkov was followed by an officer of the suite who rode up to the colonel of hussars with the same order after him the stout nesvitski came galloping up on a cossack horse that could scarcely carry his weight 
 this colonel he shouted as he approached i told you to fire the bridge and now someone has gone and blundered they are all beside themselves over there and one make anything out 
 the colonel deliberately stopped the regiment and turned to nesvitski 
 you spoke to me of inflammable material said he but you said nothing about firing it 
 but my dear sir said nesvitski as he drew up taking off his cap and smoothing his hair wet with perspiration with his plump hand i telling you to fire the bridge when inflammable material had been put in position 
 i am not your dear sir mr staff officer and you did not tell me to burn the bridge i know the service and it is my habit orders strictly to obey you said the bridge would be burned but who would it burn i could not know by the holy spirit 
 ah always the way said nesvitski with a wave of the hand how did you get here said he turning to zherkov 
 on the same business but you are damp let me wring you out 
 you were saying mr staff officer continued the colonel in an offended tone 
 colonel interrupted the officer of the suite you must be quick or the enemy will bring up his guns to use grapeshot 
 the colonel looked silently at the officer of the suite at the stout staff officer and at zherkov and he frowned 
 i will the bridge fire he said in a solemn tone as if to announce that in spite of all the unpleasantness he had to endure he would still do the right thing 
 striking his horse with his long muscular legs as if it were to blame for everything the colonel moved forward and ordered the second squadron that in which rostov was serving under denisov to return to the bridge 
 there just as i thought said rostov to himself he wishes to test me his heart contracted and the blood rushed to his face let him see whether i am a coward he thought 
 again on all the bright faces of the squadron the serious expression appeared that they had worn when under fire rostov watched his enemy the colonel closely to find in his face confirmation of his own conjecture but the colonel did not once glance at rostov and looked as he always did when at the front solemn and stern then came the word of command 
 look sharp look sharp several voices repeated around him 
 their sabers catching in the bridles and their spurs jingling the hussars hastily dismounted not knowing what they were to do the men were crossing themselves rostov no longer looked at the colonel he had no time he was afraid of falling behind the hussars so much afraid that his heart stood still his hand trembled as he gave his horse into an charge and he felt the blood rush to his heart with a thud denisov rode past him leaning back and shouting something rostov saw nothing but the hussars running all around him their spurs catching and their sabers clattering 
 stretchers shouted someone behind him 
 rostov did not think what this call for stretchers meant he ran on trying only to be ahead of the others but just at the bridge not looking at the ground he came on some sticky trodden mud stumbled and fell on his hands the others outstripped him 
 at boss zides captain he heard the voice of the colonel who having ridden ahead had pulled up his horse near the bridge with a triumphant cheerful face 
 rostov wiping his muddy hands on his breeches looked at his enemy and was about to run on thinking that the farther he went to the front the better but bogdanich without looking at or recognizing rostov shouted to him 
 that running on the middle of the bridge to the right come back cadet he cried angrily and turning to denisov who showing off his courage had ridden on to the planks of the bridge 
 why run risks captain you should dismount he said 
 oh every bullet has its billet answered vaska denisov turning in his saddle 
 meanwhile nesvitski zherkov and the officer of the suite were standing together out of range of the shots watching now the small group of men with yellow shakos jackets braided with cord and blue riding breeches who were swarming near the bridge and then at what was approaching in the distance from the opposite side the blue uniforms and groups with horses easily recognizable as artillery 
 will they burn the bridge or not get there first will they get there and fire the bridge or will the french get within grapeshot range and wipe them out these were the questions each man of the troops on the high ground above the bridge involuntarily asked himself with a sinking heart watching the bridge and the hussars in the bright evening light and the blue tunics advancing from the other side with their bayonets and guns 
 ugh the hussars will get it hot said nesvitski they are within grapeshot range now 
 he have taken so many men said the officer of the suite 
 true enough answered nesvitski two smart fellows could have done the job just as well 
 ah your excellency put in zherkov his eyes fixed on the hussars but still with that naive air that made it impossible to know whether he was speaking in jest or in earnest ah your excellency how you look at things send two men and who then would give us the vladimir medal and ribbon but now even if they do get peppered the squadron may be recommended for honors and he may get a ribbon our bogdanich knows how things are done 
 there now said the officer of the suite grapeshot 
 he pointed to the french guns the limbers of which were being detached and hurriedly removed 
 on the french side amid the groups with cannon a cloud of smoke appeared then a second and a third almost simultaneously and at the moment when the first report was heard a fourth was seen then two reports one after another and a third 
 oh oh groaned nesvitski as if in fierce pain seizing the officer of the suite by the arm look a man has fallen fallen fallen 
 two i think 
 if i were tsar i would never go to war said nesvitski turning away 
 the french guns were hastily reloaded the infantry in their blue uniforms advanced toward the bridge at a run smoke appeared again but at irregular intervals and grapeshot cracked and rattled onto the bridge but this time nesvitski could not see what was happening there as a dense cloud of smoke arose from it the hussars had succeeded in setting it on fire and the french batteries were now firing at them no longer to hinder them but because the guns were trained and there was someone to fire at

 chapter 
 
 when jo came home that spring she had been struck with the change in beth no one spoke of it or seemed aware of it for it had come too gradually to startle those who saw her daily but to eyes sharpened by absence it was very plain and a heavy weight fell on heart as she saw her face it was no paler and but littler thinner than in the autumn yet there was a strange transparent look about it as if the mortal was being slowly refined away and the immortal shining through the frail flesh with an indescribably pathetic beauty jo saw and felt it but said nothing at the time and soon the first impression lost much of its power for beth seemed happy no one appeared to doubt that she was better and presently in other cares jo fora time forgot her fear 
 but when laurie was gone and peace prevailed again the vague anxiety returned and haunted her she had confessed her sins and been forgiven but when she showed her savings and proposed a mountain trip beth had thanked her heartily but begged not to go so far away from home another little visit to the seashore would suit her better and as grandma could not be prevailed upon to leave the babies jo took beth down to the quiet place where she could live much in the open air and let the fresh sea breezes blow a little color into her pale cheeks 
 it was not a fashionable place but even among the pleasant people there the girls made few friends preferring to live for one another beth was too shy to enjoy society and jo too wrapped up in her to care for anyone else so they were all in all to each other and came and went quite unconscious of the interest they exited in those about them who watched with sympathetic eyes the strong sister and the feeble one always together as if they felt instinctively that a long separation was not far away 
 they did feel it yet neither spoke of it for often between ourselves and those nearest and dearest to us there exists a reserve which it is very hard to overcome jo felt as if a veil had fallen between her heart and but when she put out her hand to lift it up there seemed something sacred in the silence and she waited for beth to speak she wondered and was thankful also that her parents did not seem to see what she saw and during the quiet weeks when the shadows grew so plain to her she said nothing of it to those at home believing that it would tell itself when beth came back no better she wondered still more if her sister really guessed the hard truth and what thoughts were passing through her mind during the long hours when she lay on the warm rocks with her head in lap while the winds blew healthfully over her and the sea made music at her feet 
 one day beth told her jo thought she was asleep she lay so still and putting down her book sat looking at her with wistful eyes trying to see signs of hope in the faint color on cheeks but she could not find enough to satisfy her for the cheeks were very thin and the hands seemed too feeble to hold even the rosy little shells they had been collecting it came to her then more bitterly than ever that beth was slowly drifting away form her and her arms instinctively tightened their hold upon the dearest treasure she possessed for a minute her eyes were too dim for seeing and when they cleared beth was looking up at her so tenderly that there was hardly any need for her to say jo dear glad you know it tried to tell you but i 
 there was no answer except her cheek against her own not even tears for when most deeply moved jo did not cry she was the weaker then land beth tried to comfort and sustain her with her arms about her and the soothing words she whispered in her ear 
 known it for a good while dear and now used to it it hard to think of or to bear try to see it so and be troubled about me because best indeed it is 
 is this what made you so unhappy in the autumn beth you did not feel it then land keep it to yourself so long did you asked jo refusing to see or say that it was best but glad to know that laurie had no part in trouble 
 yes i gave up hoping then but i like to own it i tried to think it was a sick fancy and would not let it trouble anyone but when i saw you all so well and strong and full of happy plans it was hard to feel that i could never be like you and then i was miserable jo 
 oh beth and you tell me let me comfort and help you how could you shut me out bear it all alone 
 voice was full of tender reproach and her heart ached to think of the solitary struggle that must have gone on while beth learned to say goodbye to health love and live and take up her cross so cheerfully 
 perhaps it was wrong but i tried to do right i sure no one said anything and i hoped i was mistaken it would have 
 been selfish to frighten you all when marmee was so anxious about meg and amy away and you so happy with least i thought so then 
 and i thought you loved him beth and i went away because i cried jo glad to say all the truth 
 beth looked so amazed at the idea that jo smiled in spite of her pain and added softly then you dearie i was afraid it was so and imagined your poor little heart full of lovelornity all that while 
 why jo how could i when he was so fond of you asked beth as innocently as a child i do love him dearly he is so good to me how can i help it but he could never be anything to me but my brother i hope he truly will be sometime 
 not through me said jo decidedly amy is left for him and they would suit excellently but i have no heart for such things now i care what becomes of anybody but you beth you must get well 
 i want to oh so much i try but every day i lose a little and feel more sure that i shall never gain it back like the tide jo when it turns it goes slowly but it be stopped 
 it shall be stopped your tide must not turn so soon nineteen is too young beth i let you go work and pray and fight against it keep you in spite of everything there must be ways it be too late god be so cruel as to take you from me cried poor jo rebelliously for her spirit was far less piously submissive than 
 simple sincere people seldom speak much of their piety it shows itself in acts rather than in words and has more influence than homilies or protestations beth could not reason upon or explain the faith that gave her courage and patience to give up life and cheerfully wait for death like a confiding child she asked no questions but left everything to god and nature father and mother of us all feeling sure that they and they only could teach and strengthen heart and spirit for this life and the life to come she did not rebuke jo with saintly speeches only loved her better for her passionate affection and clung more closely to the dear human love from which our father never means us to be weaned but through which he draws us closer to himself she could not say glad to go for life was very sweet for her she could only sob out i try to be she held fast to jo as the first bitter wave of this great sorrow broke over them together 
 by and by beth said with recovered serenity tell them this when we go home 
 i think they will see it without words sighed jo for now it seemed to her that beth changed every day 
 perhaps not heard that the people who love best are often blindest to such things if they see it you will tell them for me i want any secrets and kinder to prepare them meg has john and the babies to comfort her but you must stand by father and mother you jo 
 if i can but beth i give up yet going to believe that it is a sick fancy and not let you think true said jo trying to speak cheerfully 
 beth lay a minute thinking and then said in her quiet way i know how to express myself and try to anyone but you because i speak out except to my jo i only mean to say that i have a feeling that it never was intended i should live long not like the rest of you i never made any plans about what do when i grew up i never thought of being married as you all did i seem to imagine myself anything but stupid little beth trotting about at home of no use anywhere but there i never wanted to go away and the hard part now is the leaving you all not afraid but it seems as if i should be homesick for you even in heaven 
 jo could not speak and for several minutes there was no sound but the sigh of the wind and the lapping of the tide a gull flew by with the flash of sunshine on its silvery breast beth watched it till it vanished and her eyes were full of sadness a little sand bird came tripping over the beach peeping softly to itself as if enjoying the sun and sea it came quite close to beth and looked at her with a friendly eye and sat upon a warm stone dressing its wet feathers quite at home beth smiled and felt comforted for the tiny thing seemed to offer its small friendship and remind her that a pleasant world was still to be enjoyed 
 dear little bird see jo how tame it is i like peeps better than the gulls they are not so wild and handsome but they seem happy confiding little things i used to call them my birds last summer and mother said they reminded her of me busy creatures always near the shore and always chirping that contented little song of theirs you are the gull jo strong and wild fond of the storm and the wind flying far out to sea and happy all alone meg is the turtledove and amy is like the lark she write about trying to get up among the clouds but always dropping down into its nest again dear little girl so ambitious but her heart is good and tender and no matter how high she flies she never will forget home i hope i shall see her again but she seems so far away 
 she is coming in the spring and i mean that you shall be all ready to see and enjoy her going to have you well and rosy by that time began jo feeling that of all the changes in beth the talking change was the greatest for it seemed to cost no effort now and she thought aloud in a way quite unlike bashful beth 
 jo dear hope any more it do any good sure of that we be miserable but enjoy being together while we wait have happy times for i suffer much and i think the tide will go out easily if you help me 
 jo leaned down to kiss the tranquil face and with that silent kiss she dedicated herself soul and body to beth 
 she was right there was no need of any words when they got home for father and mother saw plainly now what they had prayed to be saved from seeing tired with her short journey beth went at once to bed saying how glad she was to be home and when jo went down she found that she would be spared the hard task of telling secret her father stood leaning his head on the mantelpiece and did not turn as she came in but her mother stretched out her arms as if for help and jo went to comfort her without a word

 and i thought you loved him beth and i went away because i cried jo glad to say all the truth 
 beth looked so amazed at the idea that jo smiled in spite of her pain and added softly then you dearie i was afraid it was so and imagined your poor little heart full of lovelornity all that while 
 why jo how could i when he was so fond of you asked beth as innocently as a child i do love him dearly he is so good to me how can i help it but he could never be anything to me but my brother i hope he truly will be sometime 
 not through me said jo decidedly amy is left for him and they would suit excellently but i have no heart for such things now i care what becomes of anybody but you beth you must get well 
 i want to oh so much i try but every day i lose a little and feel more sure that i shall never gain it back like the tide jo when it turns it goes slowly but it be stopped 
 it shall be stopped your tide must not turn so soon nineteen is too young beth i let you go work and pray and fight against it keep you in spite of everything there must be ways it be too late god be so cruel as to take you from me cried poor jo rebelliously for her spirit was far less piously submissive than 
 simple sincere people seldom speak much of their piety it shows itself in acts rather than in words and has more influence than homilies or protestations beth could not reason upon or explain the faith that gave her courage and patience to give up life and cheerfully wait for death like a confiding child she asked no questions but left everything to god and nature father and mother of us all feeling sure that they and they only could teach and strengthen heart and spirit for this life and the life to come she did not rebuke jo with saintly speeches only loved her better for her passionate affection and clung more closely to the dear human love from which our father never means us to be weaned but through which he draws us closer to himself she could not say glad to go for life was very sweet for her she could only sob out i try to be she held fast to jo as the first bitter wave of this great sorrow broke over them together 
 by and by beth said with recovered serenity tell them this when we go home 
 i think they will see it without words sighed jo for now it seemed to her that beth changed every day 
 perhaps not heard that the people who love best are often blindest to such things if they see it you will tell them for me i want any secrets and kinder to prepare them meg has john and the babies to comfort her but you must stand by father and mother you jo 
 if i can but beth i give up yet going to believe that it is a sick fancy and not let you think true said jo trying to speak cheerfully 
 beth lay a minute thinking and then said in her quiet way i know how to express myself and try to anyone but you because i speak out except to my jo i only mean to say that i have a feeling that it never was intended i should live long not like the rest of you i never made any plans about what do when i grew up i never thought of being married as you all did i seem to imagine myself anything but stupid little beth trotting about at home of no use anywhere but there i never wanted to go away and the hard part now is the leaving you all not afraid but it seems as if i should be homesick for you even in heaven 
 jo could not speak and for several minutes there was no sound but the sigh of the wind and the lapping of the tide a gull flew by with the flash of sunshine on its silvery breast beth watched it till it vanished and her eyes were full of sadness a little sand bird came tripping over the beach peeping softly to itself as if enjoying the sun and sea it came quite close to beth and looked at her with a friendly eye and sat upon a warm stone dressing its wet feathers quite at home beth smiled and felt comforted for the tiny thing seemed to offer its small friendship and remind her that a pleasant world was still to be enjoyed 
 dear little bird see jo how tame it is i like peeps better than the gulls they are not so wild and handsome but they seem happy confiding little things i used to call them my birds last summer and mother said they reminded her of me busy creatures always near the shore and always chirping that contented little song of theirs you are the gull jo strong and wild fond of the storm and the wind flying far out to sea and happy all alone meg is the turtledove and amy is like the lark she write about trying to get up among the clouds but always dropping down into its nest again dear little girl so ambitious but her heart is good and tender and no matter how high she flies she never will forget home i hope i shall see her again but she seems so far away 
 she is coming in the spring and i mean that you shall be all ready to see and enjoy her going to have you well and rosy by that time began jo feeling that of all the changes in beth the talking change was the greatest for it seemed to cost no effort now and she thought aloud in a way quite unlike bashful beth 
 jo dear hope any more it do any good sure of that we be miserable but enjoy being together while we wait have happy times for i suffer much and i think the tide will go out easily if you help me 
 jo leaned down to kiss the tranquil face and with that silent kiss she dedicated herself soul and body to beth 
 she was right there was no need of any words when they got home for father and mother saw plainly now what they had prayed to be saved from seeing tired with her short journey beth went at once to bed saying how glad she was to be home and when jo went down she found that she would be spared the hard task of telling secret her father stood leaning his head on the mantelpiece and did not turn as she came in but her mother stretched out her arms as if for help and jo went to comfort her without a word

lionfish nov chapter the parting of the wayscontents prev chapter next chapter 
 dumbledore stood up he stared down at barty crouch for a moment with disgust on his face then he raised his wand once more and ropes flew out of it ropes that twisted themselves around barty crouch binding him tightly he turned to professor mcgonagall 
 
 minerva could i ask you to stand guard here while i take harry upstairs 
 
 of course said professor mcgonagall she looked slightly nauseous as though she had just watched someone being sick however when she drew out her wand and pointed it at barty crouch her hand was quite steady 
 
 severus dumbledore turned to snape please tell madam pomfrey to come down here we need to get alastor moody into the hospital wing then go down into the grounds find cornelius fudge and bring him up to this office he will undoubtedly want to question crouch himself tell him i will be in the hospital wing in half an time if he needs me 
 
 snape nodded silently and swept out of the room 
 
 harry dumbledore said gently 
 
 harry got up and swayed again the pain in his leg which he had not noticed all the time he had been listening to crouch now returned in full measure he also realized that he was shaking dumbledore gripped his arm and helped him out into the dark corridor 
 
 i want you to come up to my office first harry he said quiedy as they headed up the passageway sirius is waiting for us there 
 
 harry nodded a kind of numbness and a sense of complete unreality were upon him but he did not care he was even glad of it he want to have to think about anything that had happened since he had first touched the triwizard cup he want to have to examine the memories fresh and sharp as photographs which kept flashing across his mind moody inside the trunk wormtail slumped on the ground cradling his stump of an arm voldemort rising from the steaming cauldron cedricdeadcedric asking to be returned to his parents 
 
 professor harry mumbled where are mr and mrs diggory 
 
 they are with professor sprout said dumbledore his voice which had been so calm throughout the interrogation of barty crouch shook very slightly for the first time she was head of house and knew him best 
 
 they had reached the stone gargoyle dumbledore gave the password it sprang aside and he and harry went up the moving spiral staircase to the oak door dumbledore pushed it open sirius was standing there his face was white and gaunt as it had been when he had escaped azkaban in one swift moment he had crossed the room 
 
 harry are you all right i knew it i knew something like this what happened 
 
 his hands shook as he helped harry into a chair in front of the desk 
 
 what happened he asked more urgently 
 
 dumbledore began to tell sirius everything barty crouch had said harry was only half listening so tired every bone in his body was aching he wanted nothing more than to sit here undisturbed for hours and hours until he fell asleep and have to think or feel anymore 
 
 there was a soft rush of wings fawkes the phoenix had left his perch flown across the office and landed on knee 
 
 lo fawkes said harry quietly he stroked the beautiful plumage fawkes blinked peacefully up at him there was something comforting about his warm weight 
 
 dumbledore stopped talking he sat down opposite harry behind his desk he was looking at harry who avoided his eyes dumbledore was going to question him he was going to make harry relive everything 
 
 i need to know what happened after you touched the portkey in the maze harry said dumbledore 
 
 we can leave that till morning we dumbledore said sirius harshly he had put a hand on shoulder let him have a sleep let him rest 
 
 harry felt a rush of gratitude toward sirius but dumbledore took no notice of words he leaned forward toward harry very unwillingly harry raised his head and looked into those blue eyes 
 
 if i thought i could help you dumbledore said gently by putting you into an enchanted sleep and allowing you to postpone the moment when you would have to think about what has happened tonight i would do it but i know better numbing the pain for a while will make it worse when you finally feel it you have shown bravery beyond anything i could have expected of you i ask you to demonstrate your courage one more time i ask you to tell us what happened 
 
 the phoenix let out one soft quavering note it shivered in the air and harry felt as though a drop of hot liquid had slipped down his throat into his stomach warming him and strengthening him 
 
 he took a deep breath and began to tell them as he spoke visions of everything that had passed that night seemed to rise before his eyes he saw the sparkling surface of the potion that had revived voldemort he saw the death eaters apparating between the graves around them he saw body lying on the ground beside the cup 
 
 once or twice sirius made a noise as though about to say something his hand still tight on shoulder but dumbledore raised his hand to stop him and harry was glad of this because it was easier to keep going now he had started it was even a relief he felt almost as though something poisonous were being extracted from him it was costing him every bit of determination he had to keep talking yet he sensed that once he had finished he would feel better 
 
 when harry told of wormtail piercing his arm with the dagger however sirius let out a vehement exclamation and dumbledore stood up so quickly that harry started dumbledore walked around the desk and told harry to stretch out his arm harry showed them both the place where his robes were torn and the cut beneath them 
 
 he said my blood would make him stronger than if used someone harry told dumbledore he said the protection my my mother left in me have it too and he was right he could touch me without hurting himself he touched my face 
 
 for a fleeting instant harry thought he saw a gleam of something like triumph in eyes but next second harry was sure he had imagined it for when dumbledore had returned to his seat behind the desk he looked as old and weary as harry had ever seen him 
 
 very well he said sitting down again voldemort has overcome that particular barrier harry continue please 
 
 harry went on he explained how voldemort had emerged from the cauldron and told them all he could remember of speech to the death eaters then he told how voldemort had untied him returned his wand to him and prepared to duel 
 
 but when he reached the part where the golden beam of light had connected his and wands he found his throat obstructed he tried to keep talking but the memories of what had come out of wand were flooding into his mind he could see cedric emerging see the old man bertha jorkinshis fatherhis mother 
 
 he was glad when sirius broke the silence 
 
 the wands connected he said looking from harry to dumbledore why 
 
 harry looked up at dumbledore again on whose face there was an arrested look 
 
 priori incantatem he muttered 
 
 his eyes gazed into and it was almost as though an invisible beam of understanding shot between them 
 
 the reverse spell effect said sirius sharply 
 
 exactly said dumbledore wand and wand share cores each of them contains a feather from the tail of the same phoenix this phoenix in fact he added and he pointed at the bird perching peacefully on knee 
 
 my feather came from fawkes harry said amazed 
 
 yes said dumbledore mr ollivander wrote to tell me you had bought the second wand the moment you left his shop four years ago 
 
 so what happens when a wand meets its brother said sirius 
 
 they will not work properly against each other said dumbledore if however the owners of the wands force the wands to do battlea very rare effect will take place one of the wands will force the other to regurgitate spells it has performed in reverse the most recent firstand then those which preceded it 
 
 he looked interrogatively at harry and harry nodded 
 
 which means said dumbledore slowly his eyes upon face that some form of cedric must have reappeared 
 
 harry nodded again 
 
 diggory came back to life said sirius sharply 
 
 no spell can reawaken the dead said dumbledore heavily all that would have happened is a kind of reverse echo a shadow of the living cedric would have emerged from the wandam i correct harry 
 
 he spoke to me harry said he was suddenly shaking again thethe ghost cedric or whatever he was spoke 
 
 an echo said dumbledore which retained appearance and character i am guessing other such forms appearedless recent victims of wand 
 
 an old man harry said his throat still constricted bertha jorkins and 
 
 your parents said dumbledore quietly 
 
 yes said harry 
 
 grip on shoulder was now so tight it was painful 
 
 the last murders the wand performed said dumbledore nodding in reverse order more would have appeared of course had you maintained the connection very well harry these echoes these shadowswhat did they do 
 
 harry described how the figures that had emerged from the wand had prowled the edges of the golden web how voldemort had seemed to fear them how the shadow of mother had told him what to do how had made its final request 
 
 at this point harry found he could not continue he looked around at sirius and saw that he had his face in his hands 
 
 harry suddenly became aware that fawkes had left his knee the phoenix had fluttered to the floor it was resting its beautiful head against injured leg and thick pearly tears were falling from its eyes onto the wound left by the spider the pain vanished the skin mended his leg was repaired 
 
 i will say it again said dumbledore as the phoenix rose into the air and resettled itself upon the perch beside the door you have shown bravery beyond anything i could have expected of you tonight harry you have shown bravery equal to those who died fighting voldemort at the height of his powers you have shouldered a grown burden and found yourself equal to it and you have now given us all we have a right to expect you will come with me to the hospital wing i do not want you returning to the dormitory tonight a sleeping potion and some peacesirius would you like to stay with him 
 
 sirius nodded and stood up he transformed back into the great black dog and walked with harry and dumbledore out of the office accompanying them down a flight of stairs to the hospital wing 
 
 when dumbledore pushed open the door harry saw mrs weasley bill ron and hermione grouped around a madam pomfrey they appeared to be demanding to know where harry was and what had happened to him all of them whipped around as harry dumbledore and the black dog entered and mrs weasley let out a kind of muffled scream 
 
 harry oh harry 
 
 she started to hurry toward him but dumbledore moved between them 
 
 molly he said holding up a hand please listen to me for a moment harry has been through a terrible ordeal tonight he has just had to relive it for me what he needs now is sleep and peace and quiet if he would like you all to stay with him he added looking around at ron hermione and bill too you may do so but i do not want you questioning him until he is ready to answer and certainly not this evening 
 
 mrs weasley nodded she was very white she rounded on ron hermione and bill as though they were being noisy and hissed did you hear he needs quiet 
 
 headmaster said madam pomfrey staring at the great black dog that was sirius may i ask what 
 
 this dog will be remaining with harry for a while said dumbledore simply i assure you he is extremely well trained harry i will wait while you get into bed 
 
 harry felt an inexpressible sense of gratitude to dumbledore for asking the others not to question him it as though he want them there but the thought of explaining it all over again the idea of reliving it one more time was more than he could stand 
 
 i will be back to see you as soon as i have met with fudge harry said dumbledore i would like you to remain here tomorrow until i have spoken to the school he left 
 
 as madam pomfrey led harry to a nearby bed he caught sight of the real moody lying motionless in a bed at the far end of the room his wooden leg and magical eye were lying on the bedside table 
 
 is he okay harry asked 
 
 be fine said madam pomfrey giving harry some pajamas and pulling screens around him he took off his robes pulled on the pajamas and got into bed ron hermione bill mrs weasley and the black dog came around the screen and settled themselves in chairs on either side of him ron and hermione were looking at him almost cautiously as though scared of him 
 
 all right he told them just tired 
 
 mrs eyes filled with tears as she smoothed his unnecessarily 
 
 madam pomfrey who had bustled off to her office returned holding a small bottle of some purple potion and a goblet 
 
 need to drink all of this harry she said a potion for dreamless sleep 
 
 harry took the goblet and drank a few mouthfuls he felt himself becoming drowsy at once everything around him became hazy the lamps around the hospital wing seemed to be winking at him in a friendly way through the screen around his bed his body felt as though it was sinking deeper into the warmth of the feather matress before he could finish the potion before he could say another word his exhaustion had carried him off to sleep 
 
 
 
 harry woke up so warm so very sleepy that he open his eyes wanting to drop off again the room was still dimly lit he was sure it was still nighttime and had a feeling that he have been asleep very long 
 
 then he heard whispering around him 
 
 wake him if they shut up 
 
 what are they shouting about nothing else can have happened can it 
 
 harry opened his eyes blearily someone had removed his glasses he could see the fuzzy outlines of mrs weasley and bill close by mrs weasley was on her feet 
 
 voice she whispered and minerva it but what are they arguing about 
 
 now harry could hear them too people shouting and running toward the hospital wing 
 
 regrettable but all the same minerva cornelius fudge was saying loudly 
 
 you should never have brought it inside the castle yelled professor mcgonagall when dumbledore finds out 
 
 harry heard the hospital doors burst open unnoticed by any of the people around his bed all of whom were staring at the door as bill pulled back the screens harry sat up and put his glasses back on 
 
 fudge came striding up the ward professors mcgonagall and snape were at his heels 
 
 dumbledore fudge demanded of mrs weasley 
 
 not here said mrs weasley angrily this is a hospital wing minister you think do better to 
 
 but the door opened and dumbledore came sweeping up the ward 
 
 what has happened said dumbledore sharply looking from fudge to professor mcgonagall why are you disturbing these people minerva surprised at you i asked you to stand guard over barty crouch 
 
 there is no need to stand guard over him anymore dumbledore she shrieked the minister has seen to that 
 
 harry had never seen professor mcgonagall lose control like this there were angry blotches of color in her cheeks and a hands were balled into fists she was trembling with fury 
 
 when we told mr fudge that we had caught the death eater responsible for events said snape in a low voice he seemed to feel his personal safety was in question he insisted on summoning a dementor to accompany him into the castle he brought it up to the office where barty crouch 
 
 i told him you would not agree dumbledore mcgonagall fumed i told him you would never allow dementors to set foot inside the castle but 
 
 my dear woman roared fudge who likewise looked angrier than harry had ever seen him as minister of magic it is my decision whether i wish to bring protection with me when interviewing a possibly dangerous 
 
 but professor voice drowned 
 
 the moment that that thing entered the room she screamed pointing at fudge trembling all over it swooped down on crouch and and 
 
 harry felt a chill in his stomach as professor mcgonagall struggled to find words to describe what had happened he did not need her to finish her sentence he knew what the dementor must have done it had administered its fatal kiss to barty crouch it had sucked his soul out through his mouth he was worse than dead 
 
 by all accounts he is no loss blustered fudge it seems he has been responsible for several deaths 
 
 but he cannot now give testimony cornelius said dumbledore he was staring hard at fudge as though seeing him plainly for the first time he cannot give evidence about why he killed those people 
 
 why he killed them well no mystery is it blustered fudge he was a raving lunatic from what minerva and severus have told me he seems to have thought he was doing it all on instructions 
 
 lord voldemort was giving him instructions cornelius dumbledore said those peoples deaths were mere of a plan to restore voldemort to full strength again the plan succeeded voldemort has been restored to his body 
 
 fudge looked as though someone had just swung a heavy weight into his face dazed and blinking he stared back at dumbledore as if he quite believe what he had just heard he began to sputter still goggling at dumbledore 
 
 preposterous come now dumbledore 
 
 as minerva and severus have doubtless told you said dumbledore we heard barty crouch confess under the influence of veritaserum he told us how he was smuggled out of azkaban and how voldemort learning of his continued existence from bertha jorkins went to free him from his father and used him to capture harry the plan worked i tell you crouch has helped voldemort to return 
 
 see here dumbledore said fudge and harry was astonished to see a slight smile dawning on his face you you seriously believe that back come now come nowcertainly crouch may have believed himself to be acting upon orders but to take the word of a lunatic like that dumbledore 
 
 when harry touched the triwizard cup tonight he was transported straight to voldemort said dumbledore steadily he witnessed lord rebirth i will explain it all to you if you will step up to my office 
 
 dumbledore glanced around at harry and saw that he was awake but shook his head and said i am afraid i cannot permit you to question harry tonight 
 
 curious smile lingered he too glanced at harry then looked back at dumbledore and said you are er prepared to take word on this are you dumbledore 
 
 there was a silence which was broken by sirius growling his hackles were raised and he was baring his teeth at fudge 
 
 certainly i believe harry said dumbledore his eyes were blazing now i heard confession and i heard account of what happened after he touched the triwizard cup the two stories make sense they explain everything that has happened since bertha jorkins disappeared last summer 
 
 fudge still had that strange smile on his face once again he glanced at harry before answering 
 
 you are prepared to believe that lord voldemort has returned on the word of a lunatic murderer and a boy whowell 
 
 fudge shot harry another look and harry suddenly understood 
 
 been reading rita skeeter mr fudge he said quietly 
 
 ron hermione mrs weasley and bill all jumped none of them had realized that harry was awake 
 
 fudge reddened slightly but a defiant and obstinate look came over his face 
 
 and if i have he said looking at dumbledore if i have discovered that been keeping certain facts about the boy very quiet a parselmouth eh and having funny turns all over the place 
 
 i assume that you are referring to the pains harry has been experiencing in his scar said dumbledore coolly 
 
 you admit that he has been having these pains then said fudge quickly headaches nightmares possibly hallucinations 
 
 listen to me cornelius said dumbledore taking a step toward fudge and once again he seemed to radiate that indefinable sense of power that harry had felt after dumbledore had stunned young crouch harry is as sane as you or i that scar upon his forehead has not addled his brains i believe it hurts him when lord voldemort is close by or feeling particularly murderous 
 
 fudge had taken half a step back from dumbledore but he looked no less stubborn 
 
 forgive me dumbledore but never heard of a curse scar acting as an alarm bell before 
 
 look i saw voldemort come back harry shouted he tried to get out of bed again but mrs weasley forced him back i saw the death eaters i can give you their names lucius malfoy 
 
 snape made a sudden movement but as harry looked at him eyes flew back to fudge 
 
 malfoy was cleared said fudge visibly affronted a very old family donations to excellent causes 
 
 macnair harry continued 
 
 also cleared now working for the ministry 
 
 avery nott crabbe goyle 
 
 you are merely repeating the names of those who were acquitted of being death eaters thirteen years ago said fudge angrily you could have found those names in old reports of the trials for heavens sake dumbledore the boy was full of some crackpot story at the end of last year too his tales are getting taller and still swallowing them the boy can talk to snakes dumbledore and you still think trustworthy 
 
 you fool professor mcgonagall cried cedric diggory mr crouch these deaths were not the random work of a lunatic 
 
 i see no evidence to the contrary shouted fudge now matching her anger his face purpling it seems to me that you are all determined to start a panic that will destabilize everything we have worked for these last thirteen years 
 
 harry believe what he was hearing he had always thought of fudge as a kindly figure a little blustering a little pompous but essentially but now a short angry wizard stood before him refusing to accept the prospect of disruption in his comfortable and ordered world to believe that voldemort could have risen 
 
 voldemort has returned dumbledore repeated if you accept that fact straightaway fudge and take the necessary measures we may still be able to save the situation the first and most essential step is to remove azkaban from the control of the dementors 
 
 preposterous shouted fudge again remove the dementors be kicked out of office for suggesting it half of us only feel safe in our beds at night because we know the dementors are standing guard at azkaban 
 
 the rest of us sleep less soundly in our beds cornelius knowing that you have put lord most dangerous supporters in the care of creatures who will join him the instant he asks them said dumbledore they will not remain loyal to you fudge voldemort can offer them much more scope for their powers and their pleasures than you can with the dementors behind him and his old supporters returned to him you will be to stop him regaining the sort of power he had thirteen years ago 
 
 fudge was opening and closing his mouth as though no words could express his outrage 
 
 the second step you must take and at once dumbledore pressed on is to send envoys to the giants 
 
 envoys to the giants fudge shrieked finding his tongue again what madness is this 
 
 extend them the hand of friendship now before it is too late said dumbledore or voldemort will persuade them as he did before that he alone among wizards will give them their rights and their freedom 
 
 you you cannot be serious fudge gasped shaking his head and retreating further from dumbledore if the magical community got wind that i had approached the giants people hate them dumbledore end of my career 
 
 you are blinded said dumbledore his voice rising now the aura of power around him palpable his eyes blazing once more by the love of the office you hold cornelius you place too much importance and you always have done on the purity of blood you fail to recognize that it matters not what someone is born but what they grow to be your dementor has just destroyed the last remaining member of a family as old as any and see what that man chose to make of his life i tell you now take the steps i have suggested and you will be remembered in office or out as one of the bravest and greatest ministers of magic we have ever known fail to act and history will remember you as the man who stepped aside and allowed voldemort a second chance to destroy the world we have tried to rebuild 
 
 insane whispered fudge still backing away mad 
 
 and then there was silence madam pomfrey was standing frozen at the foot of bed her hands over her mouth was still standing over harry her hand on his shoulder to prevent him from rising bill ron and hermione were staring at fudge 
 
 if your determination to shut your eyes will carry you as far as this cornelius said dumbledore we have reached a parting of the ways you must act as you see fit and i i shall act as i see fit 
 
 voice carried no hint of a threat it sounded like a mere statement but fudge bristled as though dumbledore were advancing upon him with a wand 
 
 now see here dumbledore he said waving a threatening finger given you free rein always had a lot of respect for you i might not have agreed with some of your decisions but kept quiet there many have let you hire werewolves or keep hagrid or decide what to teach your students without reference to the ministry but if going to work against me 
 
 the only one against whom i intend to work said dumbledore is lord voldemort if you are against him then we remain cornelius on the same side 
 
 it seemed fudge could think of no answer to this he rocked backward and forward on his small feet for a moment and spun his bowler hat in his hands finally he said with a hint of a plea in his voice he be back dumbledore he just be 
 
 snape strode forward past dumbledore pulling up the left sleeve of his robes as he went he stuck out his forearm and showed it to fudge who recoiled 
 
 there said snape harshly there the dark mark it is not as clear as it was an hour or so ago when it burned black but you can still see it every death eater had the sign burned into him by the dark lord it was a means of distinguishing one another and his means of summoning us to him when he touched the mark of any death eater we were to disapparate and apparate instantly at his side this mark has been growing clearer all year too why do you think karkaroff fled tonight we both felt the mark burn we both knew he had returned karkaroff fears the dark vengeance he betrayed too many of his fellow death eaters to be sure of a welcome back into the fold 
 
 fudge stepped back from snape too he was shaking his head he did not seem to have taken in a word snape had said he stared apparently repelled by the ugly mark on arm then looked up at dumbledore and whispered i know what you and your staff are playing at dumbledore but i have heard enough i have no more to add i will be in touch with you tomorrow dumbledore to discuss the running of this school i must return to the ministry 
 
 he had almost reached the door when he paused he turned around strode back down the dormitory and stopped at bed 
 
 your winnings he said shortly taking a large bag of gold out of his pocket and dropping it onto bedside table one thousand galleons there should have been a presentation ceremony but under the circumstances 
 
 he crammed his bowler hat onto his head and walked out of the room slamming the door behind him the moment he had disappeared dumbledore turned to look at the group around bed 
 
 there is work to be done he said mollyam i right in thinking that i can count on you and arthur 
 
 of course you can said mrs weasley she was white to the lips but she looked resolute we know what fudge is fondness for muggles that has held him back at the ministry all these years fudge thinks he lacks proper wizarding pride 
 
 then i need to send a message to arthur said dumbledore all those that we can persuade of the truth must be notified immediately and he is well placed to contact those at the ministry who are not as shortsighted as cornelius 
 
 go to dad said bill standing up go now 
 
 excellent said dumbledore tell him what has happened tell him i will be in direct contact with him shortly he will need to be discreet however if fudge thinks i am interfering at the ministry 
 
 leave it to me said bill 
 
 he clapped a hand on shoulder kissed his mother on the cheek pulled on his cloak and strode quickly from the room 
 
 minerva said dumbledore turning to professor mcgonagall i want to see hagrid in my office as soon as possible also if she will consent to come madame maxime 
 
 professor mcgonagall nodded and left without a word 
 
 poppy dumbledore said to madam pomfrey would you be very kind and go down to professor office where i think you will find a called winky in considerable distress do what you can for her and take her back to the kitchens i think dobby will look after her for us 
 
 very very well said madam pomfrey looking startled and she too left 
 
 dumbledore made sure that the door was closed and that madam footsteps had died away before he spoke again 
 
 and now he said it is time for two of our number to recognize each other for what they are siriusif you could resume your usual form 
 
 the great black dog looked up at dumbledore then in an instant turned back into a man 
 
 mrs weasley screamed and leapt back from the bed 
 
 sirius black she shrieked pointing at him 
 
 mum shut up ron yelled okay 
 
 snape had not yelled or jumped backward but the look on his face was one of mingled fury and horror 
 
 him he snarled staring at sirius whose face showed equal dislike what is he doing here 
 
 he is here at my invitation said dumbledore looking between them as are you severus i trust you both it is time for you to lay aside your old differences and trust each other 
 
 harry thought dumbledore was asking for a near miracle sirius and snape were eyeing each other with the utmost loathing 
 
 i will settle in the short term said dumbledore with a bite of impatience in his voice for a lack of open hostility you will shake hands you are on the same side now time is short and unless the few of us who know the truth do not stand united there is no hope for any us 
 
 very slowly but still glaring at each other as though each wished the other nothing but ill sirius and snape moved toward each other and shook hands they let go extremely quickly 
 
 that will do to be going on with said dumbledore stepping between them once more now i have work for each of you attitude though not unexpected changes everything sirius i need you to set off at once you are to alert remus lupin arabella figg mundungus fletcher the old crowd lie low at for a while i will contact you there 
 
 but said harry 
 
 he wanted sirius to stay he did not want to have to say goodbye again so quickly 
 
 see me very soon harry said sirius turning to him i promise you but i must do what i can you understand you 
 
 yeah said harry yeahof course i do 
 
 sirius grasped his hand briefly nodded to dumbledore transformed again into the black dog and ran the length of the room to the door whose handle he turned with a paw then he was gone 
 
 severus said dumbledore turning to snape you know what i must ask you to do if you are readyif you are prepared 
 
 i am said snape 
 
 he looked slightly paler than usual and his cold black eyes glittered strangely 
 
 then good luck said dumbledore and he watched with a trace of apprehension on his face as snape swept wordlessly after sirius 
 
 it was several minutes before dumbledore spoke again 
 
 i must go downstairs he said finally i must see the harry take the rest of your potion i will see all of you later 
 
 harry slumped back against his pillows as dumbledore disappeared hermione ron and mrs weasley were all looking at him none of them spoke for a very long time 
 
 got to take the rest of your potion harry mrs weasley said at last her hand nudged the sack of gold on his bedside cabinet as she reached for the bottle and the goblet you have a good long sleep try and think about something else for a whilethink about what going to buy with your winnings 
 
 i want that gold said harry in an expressionless voice you have it anyone can have it i have won it it been 
 
 the thing against which he had been fighting on and off ever since he had come out of the maze was threatening to overpower him he could feel a burning prickling feeling in the inner corners of his eyes he blinked and stared up at the ceiling 
 
 it your fault harry mrs weasley whispered 
 
 i told him to take the cup with me said harry 
 
 now the burning feeling was in his throat too he wished ron would look away 
 
 mrs weasley set the potion down on the bedside cabinet bent down and put her arms around harry he had no memory of ever being hugged like this as though by a mother the full weight of everything he had seen that night seemed to fall in upon him as mrs weasley held him to her his face his voice the sight of cedric dead on the ground all started spinning in his head until he could hardly bear it until he was screwing up his face against the howl of misery fighting to get out of him 
 
 there was a loud slamming noise and mrs weasley and harry broke apart hermione was standing by the window she was holding something tight in her hand 
 
 sorry she whispered 
 
 your potion harry said mrs weasley quickly wiping her eyes on the back of her hand 
 
 harry drank it in one gulp the effect was instantaneous heavy irresistible waves of dreamless sleep broke over him he fell back onto his pillows and thought no more 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the goblet of fire 
 

lionfish nov chapter the parting of the wayscontents prev chapter next chapter 
 dumbledore stood up he stared down at barty crouch for a moment with disgust on his face then he raised his wand once more and ropes flew out of it ropes that twisted themselves around barty crouch binding him tightly he turned to professor mcgonagall 
 
 minerva could i ask you to stand guard here while i take harry upstairs 
 
 of course said professor mcgonagall she looked slightly nauseous as though she had just watched someone being sick however when she drew out her wand and pointed it at barty crouch her hand was quite steady 
 
 severus dumbledore turned to snape please tell madam pomfrey to come down here we need to get alastor moody into the hospital wing then go down into the grounds find cornelius fudge and bring him up to this office he will undoubtedly want to question crouch himself tell him i will be in the hospital wing in half an time if he needs me 
 
 snape nodded silently and swept out of the room 
 
 harry dumbledore said gently 
 
 harry got up and swayed again the pain in his leg which he had not noticed all the time he had been listening to crouch now returned in full measure he also realized that he was shaking dumbledore gripped his arm and helped him out into the dark corridor 
 
 i want you to come up to my office first harry he said quiedy as they headed up the passageway sirius is waiting for us there 
 
 harry nodded a kind of numbness and a sense of complete unreality were upon him but he did not care he was even glad of it he want to have to think about anything that had happened since he had first touched the triwizard cup he want to have to examine the memories fresh and sharp as photographs which kept flashing across his mind moody inside the trunk wormtail slumped on the ground cradling his stump of an arm voldemort rising from the steaming cauldron cedricdeadcedric asking to be returned to his parents 
 
 professor harry mumbled where are mr and mrs diggory 
 
 they are with professor sprout said dumbledore his voice which had been so calm throughout the interrogation of barty crouch shook very slightly for the first time she was head of house and knew him best 
 
 they had reached the stone gargoyle dumbledore gave the password it sprang aside and he and harry went up the moving spiral staircase to the oak door dumbledore pushed it open sirius was standing there his face was white and gaunt as it had been when he had escaped azkaban in one swift moment he had crossed the room 
 
 harry are you all right i knew it i knew something like this what happened 
 
 his hands shook as he helped harry into a chair in front of the desk 
 
 what happened he asked more urgently 
 
 dumbledore began to tell sirius everything barty crouch had said harry was only half listening so tired every bone in his body was aching he wanted nothing more than to sit here undisturbed for hours and hours until he fell asleep and have to think or feel anymore 
 
 there was a soft rush of wings fawkes the phoenix had left his perch flown across the office and landed on knee 
 
 lo fawkes said harry quietly he stroked the beautiful plumage fawkes blinked peacefully up at him there was something comforting about his warm weight 
 
 dumbledore stopped talking he sat down opposite harry behind his desk he was looking at harry who avoided his eyes dumbledore was going to question him he was going to make harry relive everything 
 
 i need to know what happened after you touched the portkey in the maze harry said dumbledore 
 
 we can leave that till morning we dumbledore said sirius harshly he had put a hand on shoulder let him have a sleep let him rest 
 
 harry felt a rush of gratitude toward sirius but dumbledore took no notice of words he leaned forward toward harry very unwillingly harry raised his head and looked into those blue eyes 
 
 if i thought i could help you dumbledore said gently by putting you into an enchanted sleep and allowing you to postpone the moment when you would have to think about what has happened tonight i would do it but i know better numbing the pain for a while will make it worse when you finally feel it you have shown bravery beyond anything i could have expected of you i ask you to demonstrate your courage one more time i ask you to tell us what happened 
 
 the phoenix let out one soft quavering note it shivered in the air and harry felt as though a drop of hot liquid had slipped down his throat into his stomach warming him and strengthening him 
 
 he took a deep breath and began to tell them as he spoke visions of everything that had passed that night seemed to rise before his eyes he saw the sparkling surface of the potion that had revived voldemort he saw the death eaters apparating between the graves around them he saw body lying on the ground beside the cup 
 
 once or twice sirius made a noise as though about to say something his hand still tight on shoulder but dumbledore raised his hand to stop him and harry was glad of this because it was easier to keep going now he had started it was even a relief he felt almost as though something poisonous were being extracted from him it was costing him every bit of determination he had to keep talking yet he sensed that once he had finished he would feel better 
 
 when harry told of wormtail piercing his arm with the dagger however sirius let out a vehement exclamation and dumbledore stood up so quickly that harry started dumbledore walked around the desk and told harry to stretch out his arm harry showed them both the place where his robes were torn and the cut beneath them 
 
 he said my blood would make him stronger than if used someone harry told dumbledore he said the protection my my mother left in me have it too and he was right he could touch me without hurting himself he touched my face 
 
 for a fleeting instant harry thought he saw a gleam of something like triumph in eyes but next second harry was sure he had imagined it for when dumbledore had returned to his seat behind the desk he looked as old and weary as harry had ever seen him 
 
 very well he said sitting down again voldemort has overcome that particular barrier harry continue please 
 
 harry went on he explained how voldemort had emerged from the cauldron and told them all he could remember of speech to the death eaters then he told how voldemort had untied him returned his wand to him and prepared to duel 
 
 but when he reached the part where the golden beam of light had connected his and wands he found his throat obstructed he tried to keep talking but the memories of what had come out of wand were flooding into his mind he could see cedric emerging see the old man bertha jorkinshis fatherhis mother 
 
 he was glad when sirius broke the silence 
 
 the wands connected he said looking from harry to dumbledore why 
 
 harry looked up at dumbledore again on whose face there was an arrested look 
 
 priori incantatem he muttered 
 
 his eyes gazed into and it was almost as though an invisible beam of understanding shot between them 
 
 the reverse spell effect said sirius sharply 
 
 exactly said dumbledore wand and wand share cores each of them contains a feather from the tail of the same phoenix this phoenix in fact he added and he pointed at the bird perching peacefully on knee 
 
 my feather came from fawkes harry said amazed 
 
 yes said dumbledore mr ollivander wrote to tell me you had bought the second wand the moment you left his shop four years ago 
 
 so what happens when a wand meets its brother said sirius 
 
 they will not work properly against each other said dumbledore if however the owners of the wands force the wands to do battlea very rare effect will take place one of the wands will force the other to regurgitate spells it has performed in reverse the most recent firstand then those which preceded it 
 
 he looked interrogatively at harry and harry nodded 
 
 which means said dumbledore slowly his eyes upon face that some form of cedric must have reappeared 
 
 harry nodded again 
 
 diggory came back to life said sirius sharply 
 
 no spell can reawaken the dead said dumbledore heavily all that would have happened is a kind of reverse echo a shadow of the living cedric would have emerged from the wandam i correct harry 
 
 he spoke to me harry said he was suddenly shaking again thethe ghost cedric or whatever he was spoke 
 
 an echo said dumbledore which retained appearance and character i am guessing other such forms appearedless recent victims of wand 
 
 an old man harry said his throat still constricted bertha jorkins and 
 
 your parents said dumbledore quietly 
 
 yes said harry 
 
 grip on shoulder was now so tight it was painful 
 
 the last murders the wand performed said dumbledore nodding in reverse order more would have appeared of course had you maintained the connection very well harry these echoes these shadowswhat did they do 
 
 harry described how the figures that had emerged from the wand had prowled the edges of the golden web how voldemort had seemed to fear them how the shadow of mother had told him what to do how had made its final request 
 
 at this point harry found he could not continue he looked around at sirius and saw that he had his face in his hands 
 
 harry suddenly became aware that fawkes had left his knee the phoenix had fluttered to the floor it was resting its beautiful head against injured leg and thick pearly tears were falling from its eyes onto the wound left by the spider the pain vanished the skin mended his leg was repaired 
 
 i will say it again said dumbledore as the phoenix rose into the air and resettled itself upon the perch beside the door you have shown bravery beyond anything i could have expected of you tonight harry you have shown bravery equal to those who died fighting voldemort at the height of his powers you have shouldered a grown burden and found yourself equal to it and you have now given us all we have a right to expect you will come with me to the hospital wing i do not want you returning to the dormitory tonight a sleeping potion and some peacesirius would you like to stay with him 
 
 sirius nodded and stood up he transformed back into the great black dog and walked with harry and dumbledore out of the office accompanying them down a flight of stairs to the hospital wing 
 
 when dumbledore pushed open the door harry saw mrs weasley bill ron and hermione grouped around a madam pomfrey they appeared to be demanding to know where harry was and what had happened to him all of them whipped around as harry dumbledore and the black dog entered and mrs weasley let out a kind of muffled scream 
 
 harry oh harry 
 
 she started to hurry toward him but dumbledore moved between them 
 
 molly he said holding up a hand please listen to me for a moment harry has been through a terrible ordeal tonight he has just had to relive it for me what he needs now is sleep and peace and quiet if he would like you all to stay with him he added looking around at ron hermione and bill too you may do so but i do not want you questioning him until he is ready to answer and certainly not this evening 
 
 mrs weasley nodded she was very white she rounded on ron hermione and bill as though they were being noisy and hissed did you hear he needs quiet 
 
 headmaster said madam pomfrey staring at the great black dog that was sirius may i ask what 
 
 this dog will be remaining with harry for a while said dumbledore simply i assure you he is extremely well trained harry i will wait while you get into bed 
 
 harry felt an inexpressible sense of gratitude to dumbledore for asking the others not to question him it as though he want them there but the thought of explaining it all over again the idea of reliving it one more time was more than he could stand 
 
 i will be back to see you as soon as i have met with fudge harry said dumbledore i would like you to remain here tomorrow until i have spoken to the school he left 
 
 as madam pomfrey led harry to a nearby bed he caught sight of the real moody lying motionless in a bed at the far end of the room his wooden leg and magical eye were lying on the bedside table 
 
 is he okay harry asked 
 
 be fine said madam pomfrey giving harry some pajamas and pulling screens around him he took off his robes pulled on the pajamas and got into bed ron hermione bill mrs weasley and the black dog came around the screen and settled themselves in chairs on either side of him ron and hermione were looking at him almost cautiously as though scared of him 
 
 all right he told them just tired 
 
 mrs eyes filled with tears as she smoothed his unnecessarily 
 
 madam pomfrey who had bustled off to her office returned holding a small bottle of some purple potion and a goblet 
 
 need to drink all of this harry she said a potion for dreamless sleep 
 
 harry took the goblet and drank a few mouthfuls he felt himself becoming drowsy at once everything around him became hazy the lamps around the hospital wing seemed to be winking at him in a friendly way through the screen around his bed his body felt as though it was sinking deeper into the warmth of the feather matress before he could finish the potion before he could say another word his exhaustion had carried him off to sleep 
 
 
 
 harry woke up so warm so very sleepy that he open his eyes wanting to drop off again the room was still dimly lit he was sure it was still nighttime and had a feeling that he have been asleep very long 
 
 then he heard whispering around him 
 
 wake him if they shut up 
 
 what are they shouting about nothing else can have happened can it 
 
 harry opened his eyes blearily someone had removed his glasses he could see the fuzzy outlines of mrs weasley and bill close by mrs weasley was on her feet 
 
 voice she whispered and minerva it but what are they arguing about 
 
 now harry could hear them too people shouting and running toward the hospital wing 
 
 regrettable but all the same minerva cornelius fudge was saying loudly 
 
 you should never have brought it inside the castle yelled professor mcgonagall when dumbledore finds out 
 
 harry heard the hospital doors burst open unnoticed by any of the people around his bed all of whom were staring at the door as bill pulled back the screens harry sat up and put his glasses back on 
 
 fudge came striding up the ward professors mcgonagall and snape were at his heels 
 
 dumbledore fudge demanded of mrs weasley 
 
 not here said mrs weasley angrily this is a hospital wing minister you think do better to 
 
 but the door opened and dumbledore came sweeping up the ward 
 
 what has happened said dumbledore sharply looking from fudge to professor mcgonagall why are you disturbing these people minerva surprised at you i asked you to stand guard over barty crouch 
 
 there is no need to stand guard over him anymore dumbledore she shrieked the minister has seen to that 
 
 harry had never seen professor mcgonagall lose control like this there were angry blotches of color in her cheeks and a hands were balled into fists she was trembling with fury 
 
 when we told mr fudge that we had caught the death eater responsible for events said snape in a low voice he seemed to feel his personal safety was in question he insisted on summoning a dementor to accompany him into the castle he brought it up to the office where barty crouch 
 
 i told him you would not agree dumbledore mcgonagall fumed i told him you would never allow dementors to set foot inside the castle but 
 
 my dear woman roared fudge who likewise looked angrier than harry had ever seen him as minister of magic it is my decision whether i wish to bring protection with me when interviewing a possibly dangerous 
 
 but professor voice drowned 
 
 the moment that that thing entered the room she screamed pointing at fudge trembling all over it swooped down on crouch and and 
 
 harry felt a chill in his stomach as professor mcgonagall struggled to find words to describe what had happened he did not need her to finish her sentence he knew what the dementor must have done it had administered its fatal kiss to barty crouch it had sucked his soul out through his mouth he was worse than dead 
 
 by all accounts he is no loss blustered fudge it seems he has been responsible for several deaths 
 
 but he cannot now give testimony cornelius said dumbledore he was staring hard at fudge as though seeing him plainly for the first time he cannot give evidence about why he killed those people 
 
 why he killed them well no mystery is it blustered fudge he was a raving lunatic from what minerva and severus have told me he seems to have thought he was doing it all on instructions 
 
 lord voldemort was giving him instructions cornelius dumbledore said those peoples deaths were mere of a plan to restore voldemort to full strength again the plan succeeded voldemort has been restored to his body 
 
 fudge looked as though someone had just swung a heavy weight into his face dazed and blinking he stared back at dumbledore as if he quite believe what he had just heard he began to sputter still goggling at dumbledore 
 
 preposterous come now dumbledore 
 
 as minerva and severus have doubtless told you said dumbledore we heard barty crouch confess under the influence of veritaserum he told us how he was smuggled out of azkaban and how voldemort learning of his continued existence from bertha jorkins went to free him from his father and used him to capture harry the plan worked i tell you crouch has helped voldemort to return 
 
 see here dumbledore said fudge and harry was astonished to see a slight smile dawning on his face you you seriously believe that back come now come nowcertainly crouch may have believed himself to be acting upon orders but to take the word of a lunatic like that dumbledore 
 
 when harry touched the triwizard cup tonight he was transported straight to voldemort said dumbledore steadily he witnessed lord rebirth i will explain it all to you if you will step up to my office 
 
 dumbledore glanced around at harry and saw that he was awake but shook his head and said i am afraid i cannot permit you to question harry tonight 
 
 curious smile lingered he too glanced at harry then looked back at dumbledore and said you are er prepared to take word on this are you dumbledore 
 
 there was a silence which was broken by sirius growling his hackles were raised and he was baring his teeth at fudge 
 
 certainly i believe harry said dumbledore his eyes were blazing now i heard confession and i heard account of what happened after he touched the triwizard cup the two stories make sense they explain everything that has happened since bertha jorkins disappeared last summer 
 
 fudge still had that strange smile on his face once again he glanced at harry before answering 
 
 you are prepared to believe that lord voldemort has returned on the word of a lunatic murderer and a boy whowell 
 
 fudge shot harry another look and harry suddenly understood 
 
 been reading rita skeeter mr fudge he said quietly 
 
 ron hermione mrs weasley and bill all jumped none of them had realized that harry was awake 
 
 fudge reddened slightly but a defiant and obstinate look came over his face 
 
 and if i have he said looking at dumbledore if i have discovered that been keeping certain facts about the boy very quiet a parselmouth eh and having funny turns all over the place 
 
 i assume that you are referring to the pains harry has been experiencing in his scar said dumbledore coolly 
 
 you admit that he has been having these pains then said fudge quickly headaches nightmares possibly hallucinations 
 
 listen to me cornelius said dumbledore taking a step toward fudge and once again he seemed to radiate that indefinable sense of power that harry had felt after dumbledore had stunned young crouch harry is as sane as you or i that scar upon his forehead has not addled his brains i believe it hurts him when lord voldemort is close by or feeling particularly murderous 
 
 fudge had taken half a step back from dumbledore but he looked no less stubborn 
 
 forgive me dumbledore but never heard of a curse scar acting as an alarm bell before 
 
 look i saw voldemort come back harry shouted he tried to get out of bed again but mrs weasley forced him back i saw the death eaters i can give you their names lucius malfoy 
 
 snape made a sudden movement but as harry looked at him eyes flew back to fudge 
 
 malfoy was cleared said fudge visibly affronted a very old family donations to excellent causes 
 
 macnair harry continued 
 
 also cleared now working for the ministry 
 
 avery nott crabbe goyle 
 
 you are merely repeating the names of those who were acquitted of being death eaters thirteen years ago said fudge angrily you could have found those names in old reports of the trials for heavens sake dumbledore the boy was full of some crackpot story at the end of last year too his tales are getting taller and still swallowing them the boy can talk to snakes dumbledore and you still think trustworthy 
 
 you fool professor mcgonagall cried cedric diggory mr crouch these deaths were not the random work of a lunatic 
 
 i see no evidence to the contrary shouted fudge now matching her anger his face purpling it seems to me that you are all determined to start a panic that will destabilize everything we have worked for these last thirteen years 
 
 harry believe what he was hearing he had always thought of fudge as a kindly figure a little blustering a little pompous but essentially but now a short angry wizard stood before him refusing to accept the prospect of disruption in his comfortable and ordered world to believe that voldemort could have risen 
 
 voldemort has returned dumbledore repeated if you accept that fact straightaway fudge and take the necessary measures we may still be able to save the situation the first and most essential step is to remove azkaban from the control of the dementors 
 
 preposterous shouted fudge again remove the dementors be kicked out of office for suggesting it half of us only feel safe in our beds at night because we know the dementors are standing guard at azkaban 
 
 the rest of us sleep less soundly in our beds cornelius knowing that you have put lord most dangerous supporters in the care of creatures who will join him the instant he asks them said dumbledore they will not remain loyal to you fudge voldemort can offer them much more scope for their powers and their pleasures than you can with the dementors behind him and his old supporters returned to him you will be to stop him regaining the sort of power he had thirteen years ago 
 
 fudge was opening and closing his mouth as though no words could express his outrage 
 
 the second step you must take and at once dumbledore pressed on is to send envoys to the giants 
 
 envoys to the giants fudge shrieked finding his tongue again what madness is this 
 
 extend them the hand of friendship now before it is too late said dumbledore or voldemort will persuade them as he did before that he alone among wizards will give them their rights and their freedom 
 
 you you cannot be serious fudge gasped shaking his head and retreating further from dumbledore if the magical community got wind that i had approached the giants people hate them dumbledore end of my career 
 
 you are blinded said dumbledore his voice rising now the aura of power around him palpable his eyes blazing once more by the love of the office you hold cornelius you place too much importance and you always have done on the purity of blood you fail to recognize that it matters not what someone is born but what they grow to be your dementor has just destroyed the last remaining member of a family as old as any and see what that man chose to make of his life i tell you now take the steps i have suggested and you will be remembered in office or out as one of the bravest and greatest ministers of magic we have ever known fail to act and history will remember you as the man who stepped aside and allowed voldemort a second chance to destroy the world we have tried to rebuild 
 
 insane whispered fudge still backing away mad 
 
 and then there was silence madam pomfrey was standing frozen at the foot of bed her hands over her mouth was still standing over harry her hand on his shoulder to prevent him from rising bill ron and hermione were staring at fudge 
 
 if your determination to shut your eyes will carry you as far as this cornelius said dumbledore we have reached a parting of the ways you must act as you see fit and i i shall act as i see fit 
 
 voice carried no hint of a threat it sounded like a mere statement but fudge bristled as though dumbledore were advancing upon him with a wand 
 
 now see here dumbledore he said waving a threatening finger given you free rein always had a lot of respect for you i might not have agreed with some of your decisions but kept quiet there many have let you hire werewolves or keep hagrid or decide what to teach your students without reference to the ministry but if going to work against me 
 
 the only one against whom i intend to work said dumbledore is lord voldemort if you are against him then we remain cornelius on the same side 
 
 it seemed fudge could think of no answer to this he rocked backward and forward on his small feet for a moment and spun his bowler hat in his hands finally he said with a hint of a plea in his voice he be back dumbledore he just be 
 
 snape strode forward past dumbledore pulling up the left sleeve of his robes as he went he stuck out his forearm and showed it to fudge who recoiled 
 
 there said snape harshly there the dark mark it is not as clear as it was an hour or so ago when it burned black but you can still see it every death eater had the sign burned into him by the dark lord it was a means of distinguishing one another and his means of summoning us to him when he touched the mark of any death eater we were to disapparate and apparate instantly at his side this mark has been growing clearer all year too why do you think karkaroff fled tonight we both felt the mark burn we both knew he had returned karkaroff fears the dark vengeance he betrayed too many of his fellow death eaters to be sure of a welcome back into the fold 
 
 fudge stepped back from snape too he was shaking his head he did not seem to have taken in a word snape had said he stared apparently repelled by the ugly mark on arm then looked up at dumbledore and whispered i know what you and your staff are playing at dumbledore but i have heard enough i have no more to add i will be in touch with you tomorrow dumbledore to discuss the running of this school i must return to the ministry 
 
 he had almost reached the door when he paused he turned around strode back down the dormitory and stopped at bed 
 
 your winnings he said shortly taking a large bag of gold out of his pocket and dropping it onto bedside table one thousand galleons there should have been a presentation ceremony but under the circumstances 
 
 he crammed his bowler hat onto his head and walked out of the room slamming the door behind him the moment he had disappeared dumbledore turned to look at the group around bed 
 
 there is work to be done he said mollyam i right in thinking that i can count on you and arthur 
 
 of course you can said mrs weasley she was white to the lips but she looked resolute we know what fudge is fondness for muggles that has held him back at the ministry all these years fudge thinks he lacks proper wizarding pride 
 
 then i need to send a message to arthur said dumbledore all those that we can persuade of the truth must be notified immediately and he is well placed to contact those at the ministry who are not as shortsighted as cornelius 
 
 go to dad said bill standing up go now 
 
 excellent said dumbledore tell him what has happened tell him i will be in direct contact with him shortly he will need to be discreet however if fudge thinks i am interfering at the ministry 
 
 leave it to me said bill 
 
 he clapped a hand on shoulder kissed his mother on the cheek pulled on his cloak and strode quickly from the room 
 
 minerva said dumbledore turning to professor mcgonagall i want to see hagrid in my office as soon as possible also if she will consent to come madame maxime 
 
 professor mcgonagall nodded and left without a word 
 
 poppy dumbledore said to madam pomfrey would you be very kind and go down to professor office where i think you will find a called winky in considerable distress do what you can for her and take her back to the kitchens i think dobby will look after her for us 
 
 very very well said madam pomfrey looking startled and she too left 
 
 dumbledore made sure that the door was closed and that madam footsteps had died away before he spoke again 
 
 and now he said it is time for two of our number to recognize each other for what they are siriusif you could resume your usual form 
 
 the great black dog looked up at dumbledore then in an instant turned back into a man 
 
 mrs weasley screamed and leapt back from the bed 
 
 sirius black she shrieked pointing at him 
 
 mum shut up ron yelled okay 
 
 snape had not yelled or jumped backward but the look on his face was one of mingled fury and horror 
 
 him he snarled staring at sirius whose face showed equal dislike what is he doing here 
 
 he is here at my invitation said dumbledore looking between them as are you severus i trust you both it is time for you to lay aside your old differences and trust each other 
 
 harry thought dumbledore was asking for a near miracle sirius and snape were eyeing each other with the utmost loathing 
 
 i will settle in the short term said dumbledore with a bite of impatience in his voice for a lack of open hostility you will shake hands you are on the same side now time is short and unless the few of us who know the truth do not stand united there is no hope for any us 
 
 very slowly but still glaring at each other as though each wished the other nothing but ill sirius and snape moved toward each other and shook hands they let go extremely quickly 
 
 that will do to be going on with said dumbledore stepping between them once more now i have work for each of you attitude though not unexpected changes everything sirius i need you to set off at once you are to alert remus lupin arabella figg mundungus fletcher the old crowd lie low at for a while i will contact you there 
 
 but said harry 
 
 he wanted sirius to stay he did not want to have to say goodbye again so quickly 
 
 see me very soon harry said sirius turning to him i promise you but i must do what i can you understand you 
 
 yeah said harry yeahof course i do 
 
 sirius grasped his hand briefly nodded to dumbledore transformed again into the black dog and ran the length of the room to the door whose handle he turned with a paw then he was gone 
 
 severus said dumbledore turning to snape you know what i must ask you to do if you are readyif you are prepared 
 
 i am said snape 
 
 he looked slightly paler than usual and his cold black eyes glittered strangely 
 
 then good luck said dumbledore and he watched with a trace of apprehension on his face as snape swept wordlessly after sirius 
 
 it was several minutes before dumbledore spoke again 
 
 i must go downstairs he said finally i must see the harry take the rest of your potion i will see all of you later 
 
 harry slumped back against his pillows as dumbledore disappeared hermione ron and mrs weasley were all looking at him none of them spoke for a very long time 
 
 got to take the rest of your potion harry mrs weasley said at last her hand nudged the sack of gold on his bedside cabinet as she reached for the bottle and the goblet you have a good long sleep try and think about something else for a whilethink about what going to buy with your winnings 
 
 i want that gold said harry in an expressionless voice you have it anyone can have it i have won it it been 
 
 the thing against which he had been fighting on and off ever since he had come out of the maze was threatening to overpower him he could feel a burning prickling feeling in the inner corners of his eyes he blinked and stared up at the ceiling 
 
 it your fault harry mrs weasley whispered 
 
 i told him to take the cup with me said harry 
 
 now the burning feeling was in his throat too he wished ron would look away 
 
 mrs weasley set the potion down on the bedside cabinet bent down and put her arms around harry he had no memory of ever being hugged like this as though by a mother the full weight of everything he had seen that night seemed to fall in upon him as mrs weasley held him to her his face his voice the sight of cedric dead on the ground all started spinning in his head until he could hardly bear it until he was screwing up his face against the howl of misery fighting to get out of him 
 
 there was a loud slamming noise and mrs weasley and harry broke apart hermione was standing by the window she was holding something tight in her hand 
 
 sorry she whispered 
 
 your potion harry said mrs weasley quickly wiping her eyes on the back of her hand 
 
 harry drank it in one gulp the effect was instantaneous heavy irresistible waves of dreamless sleep broke over him he fell back onto his pillows and thought no more

lionfish nov chapter the only one he ever fearedcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 he gone harry yelled 
 
 he did not believe it he would not believe it still he fought lupin with every bit of strength he had lupin did not understand people hid behind that curtain harry had heard them whispering the first time he had entered the room sirius was hiding simply lurking out of sight 
 
 sirius he bellowed sirius 
 
 he come back harry said lupin his voice breaking as he struggled to contain harry he come back because d 
 
 heisnot dead roared harry sirius 
 
 there was movement going on around them pointless bustling the flashes of more spells to harry it was meaningless noise the deflected curses flying past them did not matter nothing mattered except that lupin should stop pretending that siriuswho was standing feet from them behind that old curtainwas not going to emerge at any moment shaking back his dark hair and eager to the battle 
 
 lupin dragged harry away from the dais harry still staring at the archway was angry at sirius now for keeping him waiting 
 
 but some part of him realised even as he fought to break free from lupin that sirius had never kept him waiting before sirius had risked everything always to see harry to help him if sirius was not reappearing out of that archway when harry was yelling for him as though his life depended on it the only possible explanation was that he could not come back that he really was 
 
 dumbledore had most of the remaining death eaters grouped in the middle of the room seemingly immobilised by invisible ropes moody had crawled across the room to where tonks lay and was attempting to revive her behind the dais there were still flashes of light grunts and crieskingsley had run forward to continue duel with bellatrix 
 
 harry 
 
 neville had slid down the stone benches one by one to the place where harry stood harry was no longer struggling against lupin who maintained a precautionary grip on his arm nevertheless 
 
 harry really sorry said neville his legs were still dancing uncontrollably was dad manwas sirius black aa friend of yours 
 
 harry nodded 
 
 here said lupin quietly and pointing his wand at legs he said finite the spell was lifted legs fell back to the floor and remained still face was pale find the others where are they all neville 
 
 lupin turned away from the archway as he spoke it sounded as though every word was causing him pain 
 
 all back dere said neville a brain addacked ron bud i dink all righdand unconscious bud we could feel a bulse 
 
 there was a loud bang and a yell from behind the dais harry saw kingsley hit the ground yelling in pain bellatrix lestrange turned tail and ran as dumbledore whipped around he aimed a spell at her but she deflected it she was halfway up the steps now 
 
 harryno cried lupin but harry had already ripped his arm from slackened grip 
 
 she killed sirius bellowed harry she killed kill her 
 
 and he was off scrambling up the stone benches people were shouting behind him but he did not care the hem of robes whipped out of sight ahead and they were back in the room where the brains were swimming 
 
 she aimed a curse over her shoulder the tank rose into the air and tipped harry was deluged in the potion within the brains slipped and slid over him and began spinning their long coloured tentacles but he shouted wingardium leviosa and they flew off him up into the air slipping and sliding he ran on towards the door he leapt over luna who was groaning on the floor past ginny who said harrywhat past ron who giggled feebly and hermione who was still unconscious he wrenched open the door into the circular black hall and saw bellatrix disappearing through a door on the other side of the room beyond her was the corridor leading back to the lifts 
 
 he ran but she had slammed the door behind her and the walls were already rotating once more he was surrounded by streaks of blue light from the whirling candelabra 
 
 the exit he shouted desperately as the wall rumbled to a halt again the way out 
 
 the room seemed to have been waiting for him to ask the door right behind him flew open and the corridor towards the lifts stretched ahead of him and empty he ran 
 
 he could hear a lift clattering ahead he sprinted up the passageway swung around the corner and slammed his fist on to the button to call a second lift it jangled and banged lower and lower the grilles slid open and harry dashed inside now hammering the button marked atrium the doors slid shut and he was rising 
 
 he forced his way out of the lift before the grilles were fully open and looked around bellatrix was almost at the telephone lift at the other end of the hall but she looked back as he sprinted towards her and aimed another spell at him he dodged behind the fountain of magical brethren the spell zoomed past him and hit the gates at the other end of the atrium so that they rang like bells there were no more footsteps she had stopped running he crouched behind the statues listening 
 
 come out come out little harry she called in her mock baby voice which echoed off the polished wooden floors what did you come after me for then i thought you were here to avenge my dear cousin 
 
 i am shouted harry and a score of ghostly seemed to chorus i am i am i am all around the room 
 
 aaaaaah did you love him little baby potter 
 
 hatred rose in harry such as he had never known before he flung himself out from behind the fountain and bellowed crucio 
 
 bellatrix screamed the spell had knocked her off her feet but she did not writhe and shriek with pain as neville hadshe was already back on her feet breathless no longer laughing harry dodged behind the golden fountain again her hit the head of the handsome wizard which was blown off and landed twenty feet away gouging long scratches into the wooden floor 
 
 never used an unforgivable curse before have you boy she yelled she had abandoned her baby voice now you need to mean them potter you need to really want to cause painto enjoy itrighteous anger hurt me for show you how it is done shall i give you a lesson 
 
 harry was edging around the fountain on the other side when she screamed crucio and he was forced to duck down again as the arm holding its bow span off and landed with a crash on the floor a short distance from the golden head 
 
 potter you cannot win against me she cried 
 
 he could hear her moving to the right trying to get a clear shot of him he backed around the statue away from her crouching behind the legs his head level with the 
 
 i was and am the dark most loyal servant i learned the dark arts from him and i know spells of such power that you pathetic little boy can never hope to compete 
 
 stupefy yelled harry he had edged right around to where the goblin stood beaming up at the now headless wizard and taken aim at her back as she peered around the fountain she reacted so fast he barely had time to duck 
 
 protego 
 
 the jet of red light his own stunning spell bounced back at him harry scrambled back behind the fountain and one of the ears went flying across the room 
 
 potter going to give you one chance shouted bellatrix give me the prophecyroll it out towards me nowand i may spare your life 
 
 well going to have to kill me because gone harry roared and as he shouted it pain seared across his forehead his scar was on fire again and he felt a surge of fury that was quite unconnected with his own rage and he knows said harry with a mad laugh to match own your dear old mate voldemort knows gone not going to be happy with you is he 
 
 what what do you mean she cried and for the first time there was fear in her voice 
 
 the prophecy smashed when i was trying to get neville up the steps what do you think say about that then 
 
 his scar seared and burned the pain of it was making his eyes stream 
 
 liar she shrieked but he could hear the terror behind the anger now got it potter and you will give it to me accio prophecy accio prophecy 
 
 harry laughed again because he knew it would incense her the pain building in his head so badly he thought his skull might burst he waved his empty hand from behind the goblin and withdrew it quickly as she sent another jet of green light flying at him 
 
 nothing there he shouted nothing to summon it smashed and nobody heard what it said tell your boss that 
 
 no she screamed it true lying master i tried i trieddo not punish me 
 
 waste your breath yelled harry his eyes screwed up against the pain in his scar now more terrible than ever he hear you from here 
 
 i potter said a high cold voice 
 
 harry opened his eyes 
 
 tall thin and his terrible snakelike face white and gaunt his scarlet eyes staring lord voldemort had appeared in the middle of the hall his wand pointing at harry who stood frozen quite unable to move 
 
 so you smashed my prophecy said voldemort softly staring at harry with those pitiless red eyes no bella he is not lying i see the truth looking at me from within his worthless mind months of preparation months of effort and my death eaters have let harry potter thwart me again 
 
 master i am sorry i knew not i was fighting the animagus black sobbed bellatrix flinging herself down at feet as he paced slowly nearer master you should know 
 
 be quiet bella said voldemort dangerously i shall deal with you in a moment do you think i have entered the ministry of magic to hear your snivelling apologies 
 
 but masterhe is herehe is below 
 
 voldemort paid no attention 
 
 i have nothing more to say to you potter he said quietly you have irked me too often for too long avada kedavra 
 
 harry had not even opened his mouth to resist his mind was blank his wand pointing uselessly at the floor 
 
 but the headless golden statue of the wizard in the fountain had sprung alive leaping from its plinth to land with a crash on the floor between harry and voldemort the spell merely glanced off its chest as the statue flung out its arms to protect harry 
 
 what cried voldemort staring around and then he breathed dumbledore 
 
 harry looked behind him his heart pounding dumbledore was standing in front of the golden gates 
 
 voldemort raised his wand and another jet of green light streaked at dumbledore who turned and was gone in a whirling of his cloak next second he had reappeared behind voldemort and waved his wand towards the remnants of the fountain the other statues sprang to life the statue of the witch ran at bellatrix who screamed and sent spells streaming uselessly off its chest before it dived at her pinning her to the floor meanwhile the goblin and the scuttled towards the fireplaces set along the wall and the centaur galloped at voldemort who vanished and reappeared beside the pool the headless statue thrust harry backwards away from the fight as dumbledore advanced on voldemort and the golden centaur cantered around them both 
 
 it was foolish to come here tonight tom said dumbledore calmly the aurors are on their way 
 
 by which time i shall be gone and you will be dead spat voldemort he sent another killing curse at dumbledore but missed instead hitting the security desk which burst into flame 
 
 dumbledore flicked his own wand the force of the spell that emanated from it was such that harry though shielded by his golden guard felt his hair stand on end as it passed and this time voldemort was forced to conjure a shining silver shield out of thin air to deflect it the spell whatever it was caused no visible damage to the shield though a deep note reverberated from itan oddly chilling sound 
 
 you do not seek to kill me dumbledore called voldemort his scarlet eyes narrowed over the top of the shield above such brutality are you 
 
 we both know that there are other ways of destroying a man tom dumbledore said calmly continuing to walk towards voldemort as though he had not a fear in the world as though nothing had happened to interrupt his stroll up the hall merely taking your life would not satisfy me i admit 
 
 there is nothing worse than death dumbledore snarled voldemort 
 
 you are quite wrong said dumbledore still closing in upon voldemort and speaking as lightly as though they were discussing the matter over drinks harry felt scared to see him walking along undefended shieldless he wanted to cry out a warning but his headless guard kept shunting him backwards towards the wall blocking his every attempt to get out from behind it indeed your failure to understand that there are things much worse than death has always been your greatest weakness 
 
 another jet of green light flew from behind the silver shield this time it was the centaur galloping in front of dumbledore that took the blast and shattered into a hundred pieces but before the fragments had even hit the floor dumbledore had drawn back his wand and waved it as though brandishing a whip a long thin flame flew from the tip it wrapped itself around voldemort shield and all for a moment it seemed dumbledore had won but then the fiery rope became a serpent which relinquished its hold on voldemort at once and turned hissing furiously to face dumbledore 
 
 voldemort vanished the snake reared from the floor ready to strike 
 
 there was a burst of flame in midair above dumbledore just as voldemort reappeared standing on the plinth in the middle of the pool where so recently the five statues had stood 
 
 look out harry yelled 
 
 but even as he shouted another jet of green light flew at dumbledore from wand and the snake struck 
 
 fawkes swooped down in front of dumbledore opened his beak wide and swallowed the jet of green light whole he burst into flame and fell to the floor small wrinkled and flightless at the same moment dumbledore brandished his wand in one long fluid movementthe snake which had been an instant from sinking its fangs into him flew high into the air and vanished in a wisp of dark smoke and the water in the pool rose up and covered voldemort like a cocoon of molten glass 
 
 for a few seconds voldemort was visible only as a dark rippling faceless figure shimmering and indistinct upon the plinth clearly struggling to throw off the suffocating mass 
 
 then he was gone and the water fell with a crash back into its pool slopping wildly over the sides drenching the polished floor 
 
 master screamed bellatrix 
 
 sure it was over sure voldemort had decided to flee harry made to run out from behind his statue guard but dumbledore bellowed stay where you are harry 
 
 for the first time dumbledore sounded frightened harry could not see why the hall was quite empty but for themselves the sobbing bellatrix still trapped under the witch statue and the baby phoenix fawkes croaking feebly on the floor 
 
 then scar burst open and he knew he was dead it was pain beyond imagining pain past endurance 
 
 he was gone from the hall he was locked in the coils of a creature with red eyes so tightly bound that harry did not know where his body ended and the creatures began they were fused together bound by pain and there was no escape 
 
 and when the creature spoke it used mouth so that in his agony he felt his jaw move 
 
 kill me now dumbledore 
 
 blinded and dying every part of him screaming for release harry felt the creature use him again 
 
 if death is nothing dumbledore kill the boy 
 
 let the pain stop thought harry let him kill us end it dumbledore death is nothing compared to this 
 
 and see sirius again 
 
 and as heart filled with emotion the creatures coils loosened the pain was gone harry was lying face down on the floor his glasses gone shivering as though he lay upon ice not wood 
 
 and there were voices echoing through the hall more voices than there should have been harry opened his eyes saw his glasses lying by the heel of the headless statue that had been guarding him but which now lay flat on its back cracked and immobile he put them on and raised his head a little to find crooked nose inches from his own 
 
 are you all right harry 
 
 yes said harry shaking so violently he could not hold his head up properly yeah voldemort wherewho are all 
 
 the atrium was full of people the floor was reflecting the emerald green flames that had burst into fire in all the fireplaces along one wall and streams of witches and wizards were emerging from them as dumbledore pulled him back to his feet harry saw the tiny gold statues of the and the goblin leading a cornelius fudge forward 
 
 he was there shouted a man with a ponytail who was pointing at a pile of golden rubble on the other side of the hall where bellatrix had lain trapped only moments before i saw him mr fudge i swear it was he grabbed a woman and disapparated 
 
 i know williamson i know i saw him too gibbered fudge who was wearing pyjamas under his pinstriped cloak and was gasping as though he had just run miles beardherehere in the ministry of heavens aboveit seem possiblemy wordhow can this be 
 
 if you proceed downstairs into the department of mysteries cornelius said dumbledore apparently satisfied that harry was all right and walking forwards so that the newcomers realised he was there for the first time a few of them raised their wands others simply looked amazed the statues of the elf and goblin applauded and fudge jumped so much that his feet left the will find several escaped death eaters contained in the death chamber bound by an jinx and awaiting your decision as to what to do with them 
 
 dumbledore gasped fudge beside himself with amazement youhereii 
 
 he looked wildly around at the aurors he had brought with him and it could not have been clearer that he was in half a mind to cry seize him 
 
 cornelius i am ready to fight your menand win again said dumbledore in a thunderous voice but a few minutes ago you saw proof with your own eyes that i have been telling you the truth for a year lord voldemort has returned you have been chasing the wrong man for twelve months and it is time you listened to sense 
 
 blustered fudge looking around as though hoping somebody was going to tell him what to do when nobody did he said very welldawlish williamson go down to the department of mysteries and see dumbledore youyou will need to tell me exactlythe fountain of magical brethrenwhat happened he added in a kind of whimper staring around at the floor where the remains of the statues of the witch wizard and centaur now lay scattered 
 
 we can discuss that after i have sent harry back to hogwarts said dumbledore 
 
 harryharry potter 
 
 fudge wheeled around and stared at harry who was still standing against the wall beside the fallen statue that had guarded him during dumbledore and duel 
 
 hehere said fudge goggling at harry all this about 
 
 i shall explain everything repeated dumbledore when harry is back at school 
 
 he walked away from the pool to the place where the golden head lay on the floor he pointed his wand at it and muttered portus the head glowed blue and trembled noisily against the wooden floor for a few seconds then became still once more 
 
 now see here dumbledore said fudge as dumbledore picked up the head and walked back to harry carrying it you got authorisation for that portkey you do things like that right in front of the minister for magic youyou 
 
 his voice faltered as dumbledore surveyed him magisterially over his spectacles 
 
 you will give the order to remove dolores umbridge from hogwarts said dumbledore you will tell your aurors to stop searching for my care of magical creatures teacher so that he can return to work i will give you dumbledore pulled a watch with twelve hands from his pocket and surveyed an hour of my time tonight in which i think we shall be more than able to cover the important points of what has happened here after that i shall need to return to my school if you need more help from me you are of course more than welcome to contact me at hogwarts letters addressed to the headmaster will find me 
 
 fudge goggled worse than ever his mouth was open and his round face grew pinker under his rumpled grey hair 
 
 iyou 
 
 dumbledore turned his back on him 
 
 take this portkey harry 
 
 he held out the golden head of the statue and harry placed his hand on it past caring what he did next or where he went 
 
 i shall see you in half an hour said dumbledore quietly one two three 
 
 harry felt the familiar sensation of a hook being jerked behind his navel the polished wooden floor was gone from beneath his feet the atrium fudge and dumbledore had all disappeared and he was flying forwards in a whirlwind of colour and sound

 for the first time dumbledore sounded frightened harry could not see why the hall was quite empty but for themselves the sobbing bellatrix still trapped under the witch statue and the baby phoenix fawkes croaking feebly on the floor 
 
 then scar burst open and he knew he was dead it was pain beyond imagining pain past endurance 
 
 he was gone from the hall he was locked in the coils of a creature with red eyes so tightly bound that harry did not know where his body ended and the creatures began they were fused together bound by pain and there was no escape 
 
 and when the creature spoke it used mouth so that in his agony he felt his jaw move 
 
 kill me now dumbledore 
 
 blinded and dying every part of him screaming for release harry felt the creature use him again 
 
 if death is nothing dumbledore kill the boy 
 
 let the pain stop thought harry let him kill us end it dumbledore death is nothing compared to this 
 
 and see sirius again 
 
 and as heart filled with emotion the creatures coils loosened the pain was gone harry was lying face down on the floor his glasses gone shivering as though he lay upon ice not wood 
 
 and there were voices echoing through the hall more voices than there should have been harry opened his eyes saw his glasses lying by the heel of the headless statue that had been guarding him but which now lay flat on its back cracked and immobile he put them on and raised his head a little to find crooked nose inches from his own 
 
 are you all right harry 
 
 yes said harry shaking so violently he could not hold his head up properly yeah voldemort wherewho are all 
 
 the atrium was full of people the floor was reflecting the emerald green flames that had burst into fire in all the fireplaces along one wall and streams of witches and wizards were emerging from them as dumbledore pulled him back to his feet harry saw the tiny gold statues of the and the goblin leading a cornelius fudge forward 
 
 he was there shouted a man with a ponytail who was pointing at a pile of golden rubble on the other side of the hall where bellatrix had lain trapped only moments before i saw him mr fudge i swear it was he grabbed a woman and disapparated 
 
 i know williamson i know i saw him too gibbered fudge who was wearing pyjamas under his pinstriped cloak and was gasping as though he had just run miles beardherehere in the ministry of heavens aboveit seem possiblemy wordhow can this be 
 
 if you proceed downstairs into the department of mysteries cornelius said dumbledore apparently satisfied that harry was all right and walking forwards so that the newcomers realised he was there for the first time a few of them raised their wands others simply looked amazed the statues of the elf and goblin applauded and fudge jumped so much that his feet left the will find several escaped death eaters contained in the death chamber bound by an jinx and awaiting your decision as to what to do with them 
 
 dumbledore gasped fudge beside himself with amazement youhereii 
 
 he looked wildly around at the aurors he had brought with him and it could not have been clearer that he was in half a mind to cry seize him 
 
 cornelius i am ready to fight your menand win again said dumbledore in a thunderous voice but a few minutes ago you saw proof with your own eyes that i have been telling you the truth for a year lord voldemort has returned you have been chasing the wrong man for twelve months and it is time you listened to sense 
 
 blustered fudge looking around as though hoping somebody was going to tell him what to do when nobody did he said very welldawlish williamson go down to the department of mysteries and see dumbledore youyou will need to tell me exactlythe fountain of magical brethrenwhat happened he added in a kind of whimper staring around at the floor where the remains of the statues of the witch wizard and centaur now lay scattered 
 
 we can discuss that after i have sent harry back to hogwarts said dumbledore 
 
 harryharry potter 
 
 fudge wheeled around and stared at harry who was still standing against the wall beside the fallen statue that had guarded him during dumbledore and duel 
 
 hehere said fudge goggling at harry all this about 
 
 i shall explain everything repeated dumbledore when harry is back at school 
 
 he walked away from the pool to the place where the golden head lay on the floor he pointed his wand at it and muttered portus the head glowed blue and trembled noisily against the wooden floor for a few seconds then became still once more 
 
 now see here dumbledore said fudge as dumbledore picked up the head and walked back to harry carrying it you got authorisation for that portkey you do things like that right in front of the minister for magic youyou 
 
 his voice faltered as dumbledore surveyed him magisterially over his spectacles 
 
 you will give the order to remove dolores umbridge from hogwarts said dumbledore you will tell your aurors to stop searching for my care of magical creatures teacher so that he can return to work i will give you dumbledore pulled a watch with twelve hands from his pocket and surveyed an hour of my time tonight in which i think we shall be more than able to cover the important points of what has happened here after that i shall need to return to my school if you need more help from me you are of course more than welcome to contact me at hogwarts letters addressed to the headmaster will find me 
 
 fudge goggled worse than ever his mouth was open and his round face grew pinker under his rumpled grey hair 
 
 iyou 
 
 dumbledore turned his back on him 
 
 take this portkey harry 
 
 he held out the golden head of the statue and harry placed his hand on it past caring what he did next or where he went 
 
 i shall see you in half an hour said dumbledore quietly one two three 
 
 harry felt the familiar sensation of a hook being jerked behind his navel the polished wooden floor was gone from beneath his feet the atrium fudge and dumbledore had all disappeared and he was flying forwards in a whirlwind of colour and sound 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the order of the phoenix 
 


 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 fairy tales of hans christian andersen 
 the bishop of borglum and his warriors 
 by hans christian andersen 
 
 our scene is laid in northern jutland in the wild 
 moor we hear what is called the the peculiar 
 roar of the north sea as it breaks against the western coast of 
 jutland it rolls and thunders with a sound that penetrates for 
 miles into the land and we are quite near the roaring before us 
 rises a great mound of sand a mountain we have long seen and towards which we are wending our way driving slowly along through the deep sand on this mountain of sand is a lofty old building the convent of borglum in one of its wings the larger one there is still a church 
 
 and at this convent we now arrive in the late evening hour but the 
 weather is clear in the bright june night around us and the eye can 
 range far far over field and moor to the bay of aalborg over heath 
 and meadow and far across the deep blue sea 
 
 now we are there and roll past between barns and other farm 
 buildings and at the left of the gate we turn aside to the old castle 
 farm where the lime trees stand in lines along the walls and 
 sheltered from the wind and weather grow so luxuriantly that their 
 twigs and leaves almost conceal the windows 
 
 we mount the winding staircase of stone and march through the 
 long passages under the heavy the wind moans very 
 strangely here both within and without it is hardly known how but 
 the people say yes people say a great many things when they are 
 frightened or want to frighten others they say that the old dead 
 glide silently past us into the church where mass is 
 sung they can be heard in the rushing of the storm and their singing 
 brings up strange thoughts in the hearers thoughts of the old times 
 into which we are carried back 
 
 on the coast a ship is stranded and the warriors are 
 there and spare not those whom the sea has spared the sea washes 
 away the blood that has flowed from the cloven skulls the stranded 
 goods belong to the bishop and there is a store of goods here the 
 sea casts up tubs and barrels filled with costly wine for the 
 convent cellar and in the convent is already good store of beer and 
 mead there is plenty in the kitchen dead game and poultry hams 
 and sausages and fat fish swim in the ponds without 
 
 the bishop of borglum is a mighty lord he has great 
 possessions but still he longs for more everything must bow before 
 the mighty olaf glob his rich cousin at thyland is dead and his 
 widow is to have the rich inheritance but how comes it that one 
 relation is always harder towards another than even strangers would 
 be the husband had possessed all thyland with the 
 exception of the church property her son was not at home in his 
 boyhood he had already started on a journey for his desire was to see foreign lands and strange people for years there had been no news of him perhaps he had been long laid in the grave and would never come back to his home to rule where his mother then ruled 
 
 what has a woman to do with rule said the bishop 
 he summoned the widow before a law court but what did he gain 
 thereby the widow had never been disobedient to the law and was 
 strong in her just rights 
 
 bishop olaf of borglum what dost thou purpose what writest 
 thou on yonder smooth parchment sealing it with thy seal and 
 intrusting it to the horsemen and servants who ride away far away 
 to the city of the pope 
 
 it is the time of falling leaves and of stranded ships and soon 
 icy winter will come 
 
 twice had icy winter returned before the bishop welcomed the 
 horsemen and servants back to their home they came from rome with a papal decree a ban or bull against the widow who had dared to offend the pious bishop cursed be she and all that belongs to her 
 
 let her be expelled from the congregation and the church let no man stretch forth a helping hand to her and let friends and relations 
 avoid her as a plague and a pestilence 
 
 what will not bend must break said the bishop of borglum 
 and all forsake the widow but she holds fast to her god he is 
 her helper and defender 
 
 one servant only an old maid remained faithful to her and 
 with the old servant the widow herself followed the plough and the 
 crop grew although the land had been cursed by the pope and by the 
 bishop 
 
 thou child of perdition i will yet carry out my purpose 
 cried the bishop of borglum now will i lay the hand of the pope upon thee to summon thee before the tribunal that shall condemn thee 
 
 then did the widow yoke the last two oxen that remained to her 
 to a wagon and mounted up on the wagon with her old servant and 
 travelled away across the heath out of the danish land as a 
 stranger she came into a foreign country where a strange tongue was 
 spoken and where new customs prevailed farther and farther she 
 journeyed to where green hills rise into mountains and the vine 
 clothes their sides strange merchants drive by her and they look 
 anxiously after their wagons laden with merchandise they fear an 
 attack from the armed followers of the the two poor 
 women in their humble vehicle drawn by two black oxen travel 
 fearlessly through the dangerous sunken road and through the 
 darksome forest and now they were in franconia and there met them a stalwart knight with a train of twelve armed followers he 
 paused gazed at the strange vehicle and questioned the women as to 
 the goal of their journey and the place whence they came then one 
 of them mentioned thyland in denmark and spoke of her sorrows of her woes which were soon to cease for so divine providence had willed it for the stranger knight is the son he seized her hand he embraced her and the mother wept for years she had not been able to weep but had only bitten her lips till the blood started 
 it is the time of falling leaves and of stranded ships and soon 
 will icy winter come 
 
 the sea rolled to the shore for the cellar 
 in the kitchen the deer roasted on the spit before the fire at 
 borglum it was warm and cheerful in the heated rooms while cold 
 winter raged without when a piece of news was brought to the 
 bishop jens glob of thyland has come back and his mother with 
 him jens glob laid a complaint against the bishop and summoned 
 him before the temporal and the spiritual court 
 
 that will avail him little said the bishop best leave off thy 
 efforts knight jens 
 again it is the time of falling leaves and stranded ships icy 
 winter comes again and the white bees are swarming and sting the 
 face till they melt 
 
 keen weather say the people as they step in 
 jens glob stands so deeply wrapped in thought that he singes 
 the skirt of his wide garment 
 
 thou borglum bishop he exclaims i shall subdue thee after 
 all under the shield of the pope the law cannot reach thee but jens 
 glob shall reach thee 
 
 then he writes a letter to his olaf hase in 
 sallingland and prays that knight to meet him on christmas eve at 
 mass in the church at widberg the bishop himself is to read the 
 mass and consequently will journey from borglum to thyland and 
 this is known to jens glob 
 
 moorland and meadow are covered with ice and snow the marsh 
 will bear horse and rider the bishop with his priests and armed 
 men they ride the shortest way through the waving reeds where the 
 wind moans sadly 
 
 blow thy brazen trumpet thou trumpeter clad in it 
 sounds merrily in the clear air so they ride on over heath and 
 moorland over what is the garden of fata morgana in the hot summer though now icy like all the country towards the church of widberg 
 
 the wind is blowing his trumpet too blowing it harder and harder 
 he blows up a storm a terrible storm that increases more and more 
 towards the church they ride as fast as they may through the storm 
 the church stands firm but the storm careers on over field and 
 moorland over land and sea 
 
 bishop reaches the church but olaf hase will scarce 
 do so however hard he may ride he journeys with his warriors on 
 the farther side of the bay in order that he may help jens glob 
 now that the bishop is to be summoned before the judgment seat of 
 the highest 
 
 the church is the judgment hall the altar is the council table 
 the lights burn clear in the heavy brass candelabra the storm reads 
 out the accusation and the sentence roaming in the air over moor 
 and heath and over the rolling waters no can sail over 
 the bay in such weather as this 
 
 olaf hase makes halt at ottesworde there he dismisses his 
 warriors presents them with their horses and harness and gives 
 them leave to ride home and greet his wife he intends to risk his 
 life alone in the roaring waters but they are to bear witness for him 
 that it is not his fault if jens glob stands without reinforcement 
 in the church at widberg the faithful warriors will not leave him 
 but follow him out into the deep waters ten of them are carried away but olaf hase and two of the youngest men reach the farther have still four miles to ride 
 
 it is past midnight it is christmas the wind has abated the 
 church is lighted up the gleaming radiance shines through the 
 and pours out over meadow and heath the mass has long been finished silence reigns in the church and the wax is heard dropping from the candles to the stone pavement and now olaf hase arrives 
 in the forecourt jens glob greets him kindly and says 
 i have just made an agreement with the bishop 
 sayest thou so replied olaf hase then neither thou nor the 
 bishop shall quit this church alive 
 
 and the sword leaps from the scabbard and olaf hase deals a 
 blow that makes the panel of the church door which jens glob 
 hastily closes between them fly in fragments 
 
 hold brother first hear what the agreement was that i made i 
 have slain the bishop and his warriors and priests they will have 
 no word more to say in the matter nor will i speak again of all the 
 wrong that my mother has endured 
 
 the long wicks of the altar lights glimmer red but there is a 
 redder gleam upon the pavement where the bishop lies with cloven 
 skull and his dead warriors around him in the quiet of the holy 
 christmas night 
 
 and four days afterwards the bells toll for a funeral in the 
 convent of borglum the murdered bishop and the slain warriors and 
 priests are displayed under a black canopy surrounded by candelabra decked with crape there lies the dead man in the black cloak wrought with silver the crozier in the powerless hand that was once so mighty the incense rises in clouds and the monks chant the funeral hymn it sounds like a wail it sounds like a sentence of wrath and condemnation that must be heard far over the land carried by the wind sung by the wind the wail that sometimes is silent but never dies for ever again it rises in song singing even into our own 
 time this legend of the bishop of borglum and his hard nephew it is 
 heard in the dark night by the frightened husbandman driving by in 
 the heavy sandy road past the convent of borglum it is heard by the 
 sleepless listener in the rooms at borglum and not 
 only to the ear of superstition is the sighing and the tread of 
 hurrying feet audible in the long echoing passages leading to the 
 convent door that has long been locked the door still seems to 
 open and the lights seem to flame in the brazen candlesticks the 
 fragrance of incense arises the church gleams in its ancient 
 splendor and the monks sing and say the mass over the slain bishop 
 who lies there in the black mantle with the 
 crozier in his powerless hand and on his pale proud forehead gleams 
 the red wound like fire and there burn the worldly mind and the 
 wicked thoughts 
 
 sink down into his grave into oblivion ye terrible shapes of the 
 times of old 
 hark to the raging of the angry wind sounding above the rolling 
 sea a storm approaches without calling aloud for human lives the 
 sea has not put on a new mind with the new time this night it is a 
 horrible pit to devour up lives and perhaps it may be a 
 glassy mirror even as in the old time that we have buried sleep 
 sweetly if thou canst sleep 
 
 now it is morning 
 
 the new time flings sunshine into the room the wind still keeps 
 up mightily a wreck is announced as in the old time 
 
 during the night down yonder by lokken the little fishing 
 village with the roofs we can see it up here from the 
 window a ship has come ashore it has struck and is fast embedded in the sand but the rocket apparatus has thrown a rope on board and 
 formed a bridge from the wreck to the mainland and all on board are 
 saved and reach the land and are wrapped in warm blankets and 
 they are invited to the farm at the convent of borglum in 
 comfortable rooms they encounter hospitality and friendly faces 
 they are addressed in the language of their country and the piano 
 sounds for them with melodies of their native land and before these 
 have died away the chord has been struck the wire of thought that 
 reaches to the land of the sufferers announces that they are 
 rescued then their anxieties are dispelled and at even they join 
 in the dance at the feast given in the great hall at borglum 
 waltzes and styrian dances are given and danish popular songs and 
 melodies of foreign lands in these modern times 
 blessed be thou new time speak thou of summer and of purer 
 gales send thy sunbeams gleaming into our hearts and thoughts on thy glowing canvas let them be painted the dark legends of the rough hard times that are past

 chapter vi

 letter to m daelli 
 publisher of the italian translation of les miserables in milan 
 october 
 
 you are right sir when you tell me that les miserables is written for all nations 
 i do not know whether it will be read by all but i wrote it for all 
 it is addressed to england as well as to spain to italy as well as to france to germany as well as to ireland to republics which have slaves as well as to empires which have serfs 
 social problems overstep frontiers 
 the sores of the human race those great sores which cover the globe do not halt at the red or blue lines traced upon the map 
 in every place where man is ignorant and despairing in every place where woman is sold for bread wherever the child suffers for lack of the book which should instruct him and of the hearth which should warm him the book of les miserables knocks at the door and says 
 open to me i come for you 
 at the hour of civilization through which we are now passing and which is still so sombre the name is man he is agonizing in all climes and he is groaning in all languages 
 your italy is no more exempt from the evil than is our france 
 your admirable italy has all miseries on the face of it 
 does not banditism that raging form of pauperism inhabit your mountains 
 few nations are more deeply eaten by that ulcer of convents which i have endeavored to fathom 
 in spite of your possessing rome milan naples palermo turin florence sienna pisa mantua bologna ferrara genoa venice a heroic history sublime ruins magnificent ruins and superb cities you are like ourselves poor 
 you are covered with marvels and vermin 
 assuredly the sun of italy is splendid but alas azure in the sky does not prevent rags on man 
 like us you have prejudices superstitions tyrannies fanaticisms blind laws lending assistance to ignorant customs 
 you taste nothing of the present nor of the future without a flavor of the past being mingled with it 
 you have a barbarian the monk and a savage the lazzarone 
 the social question is the same for you as for us 
 there are a few less deaths from hunger with you and a few more from fever your social hygiene is not much better than ours shadows which are protestant in england are catholic in italy but under different names the vescovo is identical with the bishop and it always means night and of pretty nearly the same quality 
 to explain the bible badly amounts to the same thing as to understand the gospel badly 
 is it necessary to emphasize this 
 must this melancholy parallelism be yet more completely verified 
 have you not indigent persons 
 glance below 
 have you not parasites 
 glance up 
 does not that hideous balance whose two scales pauperism and parasitism so mournfully preserve their mutual equilibrium oscillate before you as it does before us 
 where is your army of schoolmasters the only army which civilization acknowledges 
 where are your free and compulsory schools 
 does every one know how to read in the land of dante and of michael angelo 
 have you made public schools of your barracks 
 have you not like ourselves an opulent and a paltry budget of education 
 have not you also that passive obedience which is so easily converted into soldierly obedience military establishment which pushes the regulations to the extreme of firing upon garibaldi that is to say upon the living honor of italy 
 let us subject your social order to examination let us take it where it stands and as it stands let us view its flagrant offences show me the woman and the child 
 it is by the amount of protection with which these two feeble creatures are surrounded that the degree of civilization is to be measured 
 is prostitution less heartrending in naples than in paris 
 what is the amount of truth that springs from your laws and what amount of justice springs from your tribunals 
 do you chance to be so fortunate as to be ignorant of the meaning of those gloomy words 
 public prosecution legal infamy prison the scaffold the executioner the death penalty 
 italians with you as with us beccaria is dead and farinace is alive 
 and then let us scrutinize your state reasons 
 have you a government which comprehends the identity of morality and politics 
 you have reached the point where you grant amnesty to heroes 
 something very similar has been done in france 
 stay let us pass miseries in review let each one contribute his pile you are as rich as we 
 have you not like ourselves two condemnations religious condemnation pronounced by the priest and social condemnation decreed by the judge 
 oh great nation of italy thou resemblest the great nation of france 
 alas our brothers you are like ourselves miserables 
 from the depths of the gloom wherein you dwell you do not see much more distinctly than we the radiant and distant portals of eden 
 only the priests are mistaken 
 these holy portals are before and not behind us 
 i resume 
 this book les miserables is no less your mirror than ours 
 certain men certain castes rise in revolt against this book i understand that 
 mirrors those revealers of the truth are hated that does not prevent them from being of use 
 as for myself i have written for all with a profound love for my own country but without being engrossed by france more than by any other nation 
 in proportion as i advance in life i grow more simple and i become more and more patriotic for humanity 
 this is moreover the tendency of our age and the law of radiance of the french revolution books must cease to be exclusively french italian german spanish or english and become european i say more human if they are to correspond to the enlargement of civilization 
 hence a new logic of art and of certain requirements of composition which modify everything even the conditions formerly narrow of taste and language which must grow broader like all the rest 
 in france certain critics have reproached me to my great delight with having transgressed the bounds of what they call french taste i should be glad if this eulogium were merited 
 in short i am doing what i can i suffer with the same universal suffering and i try to assuage it i possess only the puny forces of a man and i cry to all 
 help me 
 this sir is what your letter prompts me to say i say it for you and for your country 
 if i have insisted so strongly it is because of one phrase in your letter 
 you write 
 there are italians and they are numerous who say 
 this book les miserables is a french book 
 it does not concern us 
 let the french read it as a history we read it as a 
 i repeat whether we be italians or frenchmen misery concerns us all 
 ever since history has been written ever since philosophy has meditated misery has been the garment of the human race the moment has at length arrived for tearing off that rag and for replacing upon the naked limbs of the the sinister fragment of the past with the grand purple robe of the dawn 
 if this letter seems to you of service in enlightening some minds and in dissipating some prejudices you are at liberty to publish it sir 
 accept i pray you a renewed assurance of my very distinguished sentiments

 the waiter replied 
 it is a paper that those gentlemen left for these ladies 
 why did you not bring it at once 
 because said the waiter the gentlemen ordered me not to deliver it to the ladies for an hour 
 favourite snatched the paper from the hand

 what is that demanded favourite 
 the waiter replied 
 it is a paper that those gentlemen left for these ladies 
 why did you not bring it at once 
 because said the waiter the gentlemen ordered me not to deliver it to the ladies for an hour 
 favourite snatched the paper from the hand 
 it was in fact a letter 
 stop said she there is no address but this is what is written on it 
 this is the surprise 
 she tore the letter open hastily opened it and read she knew how to read 
 our beloved 
 you must know that we have parents 
 do not know much about such things 
 they are called fathers and mothers by the civil code which is puerile and honest 
 now these parents groan these old folks implore us these good men and these good women call us prodigal sons they desire our return and offer to kill calves for virtuous we obey them

 postscriptum 
 the dinner is paid for 
 the four young women looked at each other 
 favourite was the first to break the silence 
 well she exclaimed a very pretty farce all the same 
 it is very droll said zephine 
 that must have been idea resumed makes me in love with him 
 no sooner is he gone than he is is an adventure indeed 
 no said dahlia it was one of tholomyes ideas 
 that is evident 
 in that case retorted favourite death to blachevelle and long live tholomyes 
 long live tholomyes exclaimed dahlia and zephine 
 and they burst out laughing 
 fantine laughed with the rest 
 an hour later when she had returned to her room she was her first love affair as we have said she had given herself to this tholomyes as to a husband and the poor girl had a child 
 a merry end to mirth 
 when the young girls were left alone they leaned two by two on the chatting craning out their heads and talking from one window to the other 
 they saw the young men emerge from the cafe bombarda arm in latter turned round made signs to them smiled and disappeared in that dusty sunday throng which makes a weekly invasion into the 
 be long cried fantine 
 what are they going to bring us said zephine 
 it will certainly be something pretty said dahlia 
 for my part said favourite i want it to be of gold 
 their attention was soon distracted by the movements on the shore of the lake which they could see through the branches of the large trees and which diverted them greatly 
 it was the hour for the departure of the and all the for the south and west passed through the the majority followed the quay and went through the passy barrier 
 from moment to moment some huge vehicle painted yellow and black heavily loaded noisily harnessed rendered shapeless by trunks tarpaulins and valises full of heads which immediately disappeared rushed through the crowd with all the sparks of a forge with dust for smoke and an air of fury grinding the pavements changing all the into uproar delighted the young girls 
 favourite exclaimed 
 what a row 
 one would say that it was a pile of chains flying away 
 it chanced that one of these vehicles which they could only see with difficulty through the thick elms halted for a moment then set out again at a gallop 
 this surprised fantine 
 odd said she 
 i thought the diligence never stopped 
 favourite shrugged her shoulders 
 this fantine is surprising 
 i am coming to take a look at her out of curiosity 
 she is dazzled by the simplest things 
 suppose a am a traveller i say to the diligence i will go on in advance you shall pick me up on the quay as you pass 
 the diligence passes sees me halts and takes me 
 that is done every day 
 you do not know life my dear 
 in this manner a certain time elapsed 
 all at once favourite made a movement like a person who is just waking up 
 well said she and the surprise 
 yes by the way joined in dahlia the famous surprise 
 they are a very long time about it said fantine 
 as fantine concluded this sigh the waiter who had served them at dinner entered

 return of the jedi 
 viii 
 
 admiral ackbar stood on the bridge in stunned disbelief looking out the observationwindow at the place where a moment before the rebel star cruiser liberty had justbeen engaged in a furious battle now there was nothing only emptyspace powdered with a fine dust that sparkled in the light of more distant stared in silence 
 around him confusion was rampant flustered controllers were still trying tocontact the liberty while fleet captains ran from screen to port shouting 
 an aide handed ackbar the comlink general voice was comingthrough 
 this is gold leader that blast came from the death star death star is operational 
 we saw it ackbar answered wearily all craft prepare to retreat 
 not going to give up and run lando shouted back come a longway to be in this game 
 we have no choice general calrissian our cruisers repel firepower ofthat magnitude 
 you get a second chance at this admiral han will have that got to give him more time head for those star destroyers 
 ackbar looked around him a huge charge of flak rumbled the ship painting abrief waxen light over the window calrissian was right there would be no secondchance it was now or it was the end 
 he turned to his first star captain move the fleet forward 
 yes sir the man paused sir we stand much of a chance againstthose star destroyers they us and more heavily armored 
 i know ackbar said softly 
 the captain left an aide approached 
 forward ships have made contact with the imperial fleet sir 
 concentrate your fire on their power generators if we can knock out theirshields our fighters might stand a chance against them 
 the ship was rocked by another laserbolt hit to one of the aftgyrostabilizers 
 intensify auxiliary shields someone yelled 
 the pitch of the battle augmented another notch 
 beyond the window of the throne room the rebel fleet was being decimated inthe soundless vacuum of space while inside the only sound was the cackle luke continued his spiral into desperation as the death star laserbeam incinerated ship after ship 
 the emperor hissed your fleet is your friends on the endor moonwill not survive he pushed a comlink button on the arm of his throne and spokeinto it with relish commander jerjerrod should the rebel manage to blow up theshield generator you will turned this battle station onto the endor moon and destroyit 
 yes your highness came the voice over the receiver but we have severalbattalions stationed on 
 you will destroy it the whisper was more final than any scream 
 yes your highness 
 palpatine turned back to former shaking with glee the latter withoutrage 
 there is no escape my young pupil the alliance will will yourfriends 
 face was contorted reflecting his spirit vader watched him carefully asdid the emperor the lightsaber began to shake on its resting place the hand was trembling his lips pulled back in grimace his teeth grinding 
 the emperor smiled good i can feel your anger i am weapon strike me down with all of your hatred and your journey toward thedark side will be complete he laughed and laughed 
 luke was able to resist no longer the lightsaber rattled violently on the thronea moment then flew into his hand impelled by the force he ignited it a momentlater and swung it with his full weight downward toward the skull 
 in that instant blade flashed into view parrying attack an inchabove the head sparks flew like forging steel bathing face in a hellish glare 
 luke jumped back and turned lightsaber upraised to face his father vaderextended his own blade poised to do battle 
 the emperor sighed with pleasure and sat in his throne facing sole audience to this dire aggrieved contest 
 han leia chewbacca and the rest of the strike team were escorted out of thebunker by their captors the sight that greeted them was substantially different fromthe way the grassy area had appeared when entered the clearing was nowfilled with imperial troops 
 hundreds of them in white or black standing at ease someviewing the scene from atop their walkers some leaning on their speederbikes if the situation had appeared hopeless inside the bunker it looked even worsenow 
 han and leia turned to each other full of feeling all struggled for dreamed now even so had each other for a short while atleast come together from opposite ends of a wasteland of emotionalisolation han had never known love so enamored of himself was he leia hadnever known love so wrapped up in social upheaval was she so intent on embracingall of humanity and somewhere between his glassy infatuation for the one and herglowing fervor for the all found a shady place where two could huddle feel nourished 
 but that too was cut short now the end seemed near so much was there tosay they find a single word instead they only joined hands speakingthrough their fingers in these final minutes of companionship 
 when threepio and artoo jauntily entered the clearing beeping andjabbering excitedly to each other they stopped cold in their tracks when they sawwhat the clearing had becomeand found all eyes suddenly focused on them 
 oh dear threepio whimpered in a second he and artoo had turned aroundand run right back into the woods from which just come six stormtrooperscharged in after them 
 the imperial soldiers were in time to see the two droids duck behind a large twenty yards into the forest they rushed after the robots as they roundedthe tree they found artoo and threepio standing there quietly waiting to be guards moved to take them they moved too slowly 
 fifteen ewoks dropped out of the overhanging branches quickly overpoweringthe imperial troops with rocks and clubs at that in a horn to his lips and sounded three long blasts from its bell thatwas the signal for the ewoks to attack 
 hundreds of them descended upon the clearing from all sides throwingthemselves against the might of the imperial army with unrestrained zeal the scenewas unabridged chaos 
 stormtroopers fired their laser pistols at the furry creatures killing or to be overrun by dozens more in their place biker scouts chasedsquealing ewoks into the were knocked from their bikes by volleys ofrocks launched from the trees 
 in the first confused moments of the attack chewie dove into the foliage whilehan and leia hit the dirt in the cover of the arches that flanked the bunker all around kept them pinned from leaving the bunker door itself wasclosed again and locked 
 han punched out the stolen code on the control panel this time thedoor open it had been reprogrammed as soon as been caught theterminal work now he muttered 
 leia stretched for a laser pistol lying in the dirt just out of reach beside a felledstormtrooper shots were crisscrossing from every direction though 
 we need artoo she shouted 
 han nodded took out his comlink pushed the sequence that signaled the littledroid and reached for the weapon leia get as the fighting stormed all aroundthem 
 artoo and threepio were huddled behind a log when artoo got the suddenly blurted out an excited whistle and shot off toward the battlefield 
 artoo threepio shouted where are you going wait for me nearlybeside himself the golden droid tore off after his best friend 
 biker scouts raced over and around the scurrying droids blasting away at theewoks who grew fiercer every time their fur was scorched the little bears werehanging on the legs of the imperial walkers hobbling the appendages with lengths ofvine or injuring the joint mechanisms by forcing pebbles and twigs into the were knocking scouts off their bikes by stringing vine between trees at throatlevel they were throwing rocks jumping out of trees impaling with with nets they were everywhere 
 scores of them rallied behind chewbacca who had grown rather fond of themduring the course of the previous night become their mascot and they hislittle country cousins so it was with a special ferocity now that they came to aid chewie was flinging stormtroopers left and right in a selfless wookieefrenzy any time he saw them physically formed equally cadres to donothing but follow chewbacca and throw themselves upon any soldiers who startedgetting the upper hand with him 
 it was a wild strange battle 
 artoo and threepio finally made it to the bunker door han and leia providedcover fire with guns finally managed to scrounge artoo moved quickly tothe terminal plugged in his computer arm began scanning before evencomputed the weather codes though a laser bolt explosion ripped the cable arm spilling him to the dirt 
 his head began to smolder his fittings to leak all of a sudden everycompartment sprang open every nozzle gushed or smoked every wheel stopped threepio rushed to his wounded companion as han examined thebunker terminal 
 maybe i can hotwire this thing solo mumbled 
 meanwhile the ewoks had erected a primitive catapult at the other side of thefield they fired a large boulder at one of the machine vibratedseriously but did not topple it turned and headed for the catapult laser cannonfiring the ewoks scattered when the walker was ten feet away the ewokschopped a mass of restraining vines and two huge balanced trunks crashed down ontop of the imperial war wagon halting it for good 
 the next phase of the assault began ewoks in started dropping rocks on the stormtroopers or withspears teebo who led the attack was hit in the wing with laser fire during the firstvolley and crashed into a gnarled root a charging walker clumped forward to crushhim but wicket swooped down just in time yanking teebo to safety in swervingout of the way though wicket smashed into a racing speeder allwent tumbling into the dense foliage 
 and so it went 
 the casualties mounted 
 high above it was no different a thousand deadly dogfights and cannonbombardments were erupting all over the skies while the death star laser beammethodically disintegrated the rebel ships 
 in the millennium falcon lando steered like a maniac through an obstaclecourse of the giant floating imperial star laser bolts with flak outracing tie fighters 
 desperately he was shouting into his comlink over the noise of continuousexplosions talking to ackbar in the alliance command ship i said closer movein as close as you can and engage the star destroyers at point blank waythe death star be able to fire at us without knocking out its own ships 
 but no ever gone nose to nose at that range between supervessels liketheir destroyers and our cruisers ackbar fumed at the theiroptions were running out 
 great yelled lando skimming over the surface of the destroyer inventing a new kind of combat 
 we know nothing about the tactics of such a confrontation ackbar protested 
 we know as much as they do lando hollered and think we knowmore bluffing was always dangerous in the last hand but sometimes when allyour money was in the pot it was the only way to lando never played tolose 
 at that we last long against star destroyers ackbar wasalready feeling giddy with resignation 
 last longer than we will against that death star and we might just take afew of them with us lando whooped with a jolt one of his forward guns wasblown away he put the falcon into a controlled spin and careened around the bellyof the imperial leviathan 
 with little else to lose ackbar decided to try strategy in the nextminutes dozens of rebel cruisers moved in astronomically close to the imperial the colossal antagonists began blasting away at each other like tanksat twenty paces while hundreds of tiny fighters raced across their surfaces zippingbetween laser bolts as they chased around the massive hulls 
 slowly luke and vader circled lightsaber high above his head luke readiedhis attack from classic the dark lord held a lateral stance in classicanswer without announcement luke brought his blade straight whenvader moved to parry luke feinted and cut low vader counterparried let theimpact direct his sword toward throatbut luke met the riposte and steppedback the first blows traded without injury again they circled 
 vader was impressed with speed pleased even it was a pity let the boy kill the emperor yet luke ready for that was still a chance luke would return to his friends if he destroyed the emperornow he needed more extensive tutelage by both vader be ready to assume his place at right hand ruling thegalaxy 
 so vader had to shephered the boy through periods like this stop him from doingdamage in the wrong in the right places prematurely 
 before vader could gather his thoughts much further though luke more aggressively he advanced in a flurry of lunges each met with aloud crack of phosphorescent saber the dark lord retreated a step at everyslash swiveling once to bring his cutting beam up luke batted it vader back yet again the lord of the sith momentarily lost his footing onthe stairs and tumbled to his knees 
 luke stood above him at the top of the staircase heady with his own power itwas in his hands now he knew it was he could take vader take his blade take hislife take his place at the side yes even that luke bury thethought this time he gloried in it he engorged himself with its juices felt itspower tingle his cheeks it made him feverish this thought with lust sooverpowering as to totally obliterate all other considerations 
 he had the power the choice was his 
 and then another thought emerged slowly compulsive as an ardent lover hecould destroy the emperor too destroy them both and rule the galaxy avengeand conquer 
 it was a profound moment for luke dizzying yet he did not swoon nordid he recoil 
 he took one step forward 
 for the first time the thought entered consciousness that his son mightbest him he was astounded by the strength luke had acquired since their last the cloud to mention the timing which was honed to this was an unexpected circumstance unexpected andunwelcome vader felt humiliation crawling in on the tail of his first reaction whichwas surprise and his second which was fear and then the edge of the humiliationcurled up to reveal bald anger and now he wanted revenge 
 these things were mirrored each facet by the young jedi who now toweredabove him the emperor watching joyously saw this and goaded luke on to revelin his darkness use your aggressive feelings boy yes let the hate flowthrough you become one with it let it nourish you 
 luke faltered a realized what was happening he was suddenlyconfused again what did he want what should he do his brief exultation hismicrosecond of dark now in a wash of indecision veiled awakening from a passionate flirtation 
 he took a step back lowered his sword relaxed and tried to drive the hatredfrom his being 
 in that instant vader attacked he lunged half up the stairs forcing luke toreverse defensively he bound the blade with his own but luke disengagedand leaped to the safety of an overhead gantry vader jumped over the railing to thefloor beneath the platform on which luke stood 
 i will not fight you father luke stated 
 you are unwise to lower your defenses vader warned his anger was did not want to win if the boy was not battling to the fullest but ifwinning meant he had to kill the boy who fightthen he could do that he wanted luke to be aware of those consequences he wanted luke to knowthis was no longer just a game this was darkness 
 luke heard something else though your thoughts betray you father i feelthe good in youthe conflict you could not bring yourself to kill me destroy me now twice before in have killed him but in the dogfight over the first death star and laterin the lightsaber duel on bespin he thought of leia briefly now howvader had had her in his clutches once had even tortured herbut kill winced to think of her agony but quickly pushed that from his mind the pointwas clear to him now though so often so murky there was still good in his father 
 this accusation really made vader angry he could tolerate much from theinsolent child but this was insufferable he must teach this boy a lesson he wouldnever forget or die learning once again you underestimate the power of the darkside 
 vader threw his scintillating sliced through the supports holding up thegantry on which luke was perched then swept around and flew back into luke tumbled to the ground then rolled down another level under the tiltingplatform in the shadow of the darkened overhang he was out of sight vaderpaced the area like a cat seeking the boy but he enter the shadows of theoverhang 
 you cannot hide forever luke 
 have to come in and get me replied the disembodied voice 
 i will not give you the advantage that easily vader felt his intentionsincreasingly ambiguous in this conflict the purity of his evil was being boy was clever knew he must move with extreme caution now 
 i wish no advantage father i will not fight you heretake my knew full well this might be his end but so be it he would not use darknessto fight darkness perhaps it would be left to leia after all to carry on the him perhaps she would know a way he know perhaps she could finda path for now though he could see only two paths and one was into one was not 
 luke put his lightsaber on the ground and rolled it along the floor toward stopped halfway between them in the middle of the low overhead area the darklord reached out his lightsaber jumped into it he hooked it to hisbelt and with grave uncertainty entered the shadowy overhang 
 he was picking up additional feelings from luke now new crosscurrents ofdoubt remorse regret abandonment shades of pain but somehow nowdirectly related to vader to others toendor ah that was sanctuarymoon where his friends would soon die luke would learn soon enough friendshipwas different on the dark side a different thing altogether 
 give yourself to the dark side luke he entreated it is the only way youcan save your friends yes your thoughts betray you son your feelings for themare strong especially for 
 vader stopped he sensed something 
 luke withdrew further into shadow he tried to hide but there was no way tohide what was in his was in pain her agony cried to him now and hisspirit cried with her he tried to shut it out to shut it up but the cry was loud and stifle it leave it alone had to cradle it openly to give it solace 
 consciousness invaded that private place 
 no screamed luke 
 vader was incredulous sister sister he bellowed your feelings havenow betrayed her tootwins he roared triumphantly was wise to hideher but now his failure is complete his smile was clear to luke through the the shadows through all the realms of darkness if you will not turned tothe dark side perhaps she will 
 this then was breaking point for leia was last unflagginghope if vader turned his twisted misguided cravings on her 
 never he screamed his lightsaber flew off belt into his own as it came to him 
 he rushed to his father with a frenzy never known nor had vader thegladiators battled fiercely sparks flying from the clash of their radiant weapons but itwas soon evident that the advantage was all and he was pressing it theylocked swords body to body when luke pushed vader back to break the clinch thedark lord hit his head on an overhanging beam in the cramped space he stumbledbackward even farther out of the area luke pursued him relentlessly 
 blow upon blow luke forced vader to onto the bridge thatcrossed the vast seemingly bottomless shaft to the power core each stroke saber pummeled vader like accusations like screams like shards of hate 
 the dark lord was driven to his knees he raised his blade to block yetanother luke slashed right hand off at the wrist 
 the hand along with bits of metal wires and electronic devices clattereduselessly away while lightsaber tumbled over the edge of the span into theendless shaft below without a trace 
 luke stared at his twitching severed mechanical then at hisown artificial realized suddenly just how much becomelike his father like the man he hated 
 trembling he stood above vader the point of his glowing blade at the throat he wanted to destroy this thing of darkness this thing that was oncehis father this thing that washim 
 suddenly the emperor was there looking on chuckling with agitation good kill him your hate has made you powerful your destiny and take your place at my side 
 luke stared at his father beneath him then at the emperor then back at was it was the darkness he hated not his father not even theemperor but the darkness in them in them and in himself 
 and the only way to destroy the darkness way to renounce it for good and stood suddenly erect and made the decision for which spent his life inpreparation 
 he hurled his lightsaber away never never will i turn to the dark have failed palpatine i am a jedi as my father was before me 
 the glee turned to a sullen rage so be it jedi if you will not beturned you will be destroyed 
 palpatine raised his spidery arms toward luke blinding white bolts of energycoruscated from his fingers shot across the room like sorcerous lightning and torethrough the insides looking for ground the young jedi was at onceconfounded and in never heard of such a power such a corruption of theforce let alone experienced it 
 but if it was it could be luke raised his armsto deflect the bolts initially he was lightning rebounded from histouch harmlessly into the walls soon though the shocks came with such speedand power they coursed over and into him and he could only shrink before with pain his knees buckling his powers at ebb 
 vader crawled like a wounded animal to his side 
 on endor the battle of the bunker continued stormtroopers kept irradiatingewoks with sophisticated weaponry while the fuzzy little warriors bashed away at theimperial troops with clubs tumbled walkers with logpiles and vine lassoedspeeder bikes with and 
 they felled trees on their foes they dug pits which they covered withbranches and then lured the walkers to chase them until the clumsy armored vehiclestoppled into the dugouts they started rockslides they dammed a small nearbystream and then opened the floodgates deluging a host of troops and two morewalkers they ganged up and then ran away they jumped on top of walkers fromhigh branches and poured pouches of burning in the they usedknives and spears and slings and made scary to confound and dismaythe enemy they were fearless opponents 
 their example made even chewie bolder than was his wont he started havingso much fun swinging on vines and bashing heads he nearly forgot about his laserpistol 
 he swung onto the roof of a walker at one point with teebo and wicket clingingto his back they landed with a thud atop the lurching contraption then made such abanging racket trying to hang on one of stormtroopers inside opened the top hatch tosee what was happening before he could fire his gun chewie plucked him out anddashed him to the and teebo immediately dove into the hatch andsubdued the other trooper 
 ewoks drive an imperial walker much the way they drive but with exhilaration chewie was almost thrown off the top severaltimes but even barking angrily down into the cockpit seem to have ewoks just giggled squealed and careened into another speeder bike 
 chewie climbed down inside it took him half a minute to master technology was pretty standardized and then methodically oneby one he began approaching the other unsuspecting imperial walkers and blastingthem to dust most had no idea what was happening 
 as the giant began going up in flames the ewoks were rallied behind walker the wookiee was turning the tide of battle 
 han meanwhile was still working furiously at the control panel wiressparked each time he refastened another connection but the door kept not crouched at his back firing her laser pistol giving him cover 
 he motioned her at last give me a hand i think got it figured out holdthis 
 he handed her one of the wires she holstered her weapon took the wire hegave her and held it in position as he brought two others over from opposite ends ofthe panel 
 here goes nothing he said 
 the three wires sparked the connection was made there was a sudden loudwhump as a second blast door crashed down in front of the first doubling theimpregnable barrier 
 great now we have two doors to get through leia muttered 
 at that moment she was hit in the arm by a laser bolt and knocked to theground 
 han rushed over to her leia no he cried trying to stop the bleeding 
 princess leia are you all right threepio fretted 
 not bad she shook her head 
 hold it shouted a voice one move and both dead 
 they froze looked up two stormtroopers stood before them weapons 
 stand up one ordered hands raised 
 han and leia looked at each other fixed their gazes deep in each there in the wells of their souls for a suspended eternal moment during whichall was felt understood touched shared 
 gaze was drawn down to surreptitiously eased outher gun and was holding it now at the ready the action was hidden from thetroopers because han was standing in front of leia their view 
 he looked again into her eyes comprehending with a last heartfelt smile hewhispered i love you 
 i know she answered simply 
 then the moment was over and at an unspoken instantaneous signal hanwhirled out of the line of fire as leia blasted at the stormtroopers 
 the air was filled with laser glinting haze like an electronstorm buffeted the area sheared by intense flares 
 as the smoke cleared a giant imperial walker approached stood before him andstopped han looked up to see its laser cannons aimed directly in his face heraised his arms and took a tentative step forward he really sure what he wasgoing to do stay back he said quietly to leia measuring the distance to themachine in his mind 
 that was when the hatch on top of the walker popped open and chewbaccastuck his head out with an ingratiating smile 
 ahr rahr barked the wookiee 
 solo could have kissed him chewie get down here started forward to greet his partner then stopped in no wait an idea

 han and leia turned to each other full of feeling all struggled for dreamed now even so had each other for a short while atleast come together from opposite ends of a wasteland of emotionalisolation han had never known love so enamored of himself was he leia hadnever known love so wrapped up in social upheaval was she so intent on embracingall of humanity and somewhere between his glassy infatuation for the one and herglowing fervor for the all found a shady place where two could huddle feel nourished 
 but that too was cut short now the end seemed near so much was there tosay they find a single word instead they only joined hands speakingthrough their fingers in these final minutes of companionship 
 when threepio and artoo jauntily entered the clearing beeping andjabbering excitedly to each other they stopped cold in their tracks when they sawwhat the clearing had becomeand found all eyes suddenly focused on them 
 oh dear threepio whimpered in a second he and artoo had turned aroundand run right back into the woods from which just come six stormtrooperscharged in after them 
 the imperial soldiers were in time to see the two droids duck behind a large twenty yards into the forest they rushed after the robots as they roundedthe tree they found artoo and threepio standing there quietly waiting to be guards moved to take them they moved too slowly 
 fifteen ewoks dropped out of the overhanging branches quickly overpoweringthe imperial troops with rocks and clubs at that in a horn to his lips and sounded three long blasts from its bell thatwas the signal for the ewoks to attack 
 hundreds of them descended upon the clearing from all sides throwingthemselves against the might of the imperial army with unrestrained zeal the scenewas unabridged chaos 
 stormtroopers fired their laser pistols at the furry creatures killing or to be overrun by dozens more in their place biker scouts chasedsquealing ewoks into the were knocked from their bikes by volleys ofrocks launched from the trees 
 in the first confused moments of the attack chewie dove into the foliage whilehan and leia hit the dirt in the cover of the arches that flanked the bunker all around kept them pinned from leaving the bunker door itself wasclosed again and locked 
 han punched out the stolen code on the control panel this time thedoor open it had been reprogrammed as soon as been caught theterminal work now he muttered 
 leia stretched for a laser pistol lying in the dirt just out of reach beside a felledstormtrooper shots were crisscrossing from every direction though 
 we need artoo she shouted 
 han nodded took out his comlink pushed the sequence that signaled the littledroid and reached for the weapon leia get as the fighting stormed all aroundthem 
 artoo and threepio were huddled behind a log when artoo got the suddenly blurted out an excited whistle and shot off toward the battlefield 
 artoo threepio shouted where are you going wait for me nearlybeside himself the golden droid tore off after his best friend 
 biker scouts raced over and around the scurrying droids blasting away at theewoks who grew fiercer every time their fur was scorched the little bears werehanging on the legs of the imperial walkers hobbling the appendages with lengths ofvine or injuring the joint mechanisms by forcing pebbles and twigs into the were knocking scouts off their bikes by stringing vine between trees at throatlevel they were throwing rocks jumping out of trees impaling with with nets they were everywhere 
 scores of them rallied behind chewbacca who had grown rather fond of themduring the course of the previous night become their mascot and they hislittle country cousins so it was with a special ferocity now that they came to aid chewie was flinging stormtroopers left and right in a selfless wookieefrenzy any time he saw them physically formed equally cadres to donothing but follow chewbacca and throw themselves upon any soldiers who startedgetting the upper hand with him 
 it was a wild strange battle 
 artoo and threepio finally made it to the bunker door han and leia providedcover fire with guns finally managed to scrounge artoo moved quickly tothe terminal plugged in his computer arm began scanning before evencomputed the weather codes though a laser bolt explosion ripped the cable arm spilling him to the dirt 
 his head began to smolder his fittings to leak all of a sudden everycompartment sprang open every nozzle gushed or smoked every wheel stopped threepio rushed to his wounded companion as han examined thebunker terminal 
 maybe i can hotwire this thing solo mumbled 
 meanwhile the ewoks had erected a primitive catapult at the other side of thefield they fired a large boulder at one of the machine vibratedseriously but did not topple it turned and headed for the catapult laser cannonfiring the ewoks scattered when the walker was ten feet away the ewokschopped a mass of restraining vines and two huge balanced trunks crashed down ontop of the imperial war wagon halting it for good 
 the next phase of the assault began ewoks in started dropping rocks on the stormtroopers or withspears teebo who led the attack was hit in the wing with laser fire during the firstvolley and crashed into a gnarled root a charging walker clumped forward to crushhim but wicket swooped down just in time yanking teebo to safety in swervingout of the way though wicket smashed into a racing speeder allwent tumbling into the dense foliage 
 and so it went 
 the casualties mounted 
 high above it was no different a thousand deadly dogfights and cannonbombardments were erupting all over the skies while the death star laser beammethodically disintegrated the rebel ships 
 in the millennium falcon lando steered like a maniac through an obstaclecourse of the giant floating imperial star laser bolts with flak outracing tie fighters 
 desperately he was shouting into his comlink over the noise of continuousexplosions talking to ackbar in the alliance command ship i said closer movein as close as you can and engage the star destroyers at point blank waythe death star be able to fire at us without knocking out its own ships 
 but no ever gone nose to nose at that range between supervessels liketheir destroyers and our cruisers ackbar fumed at the theiroptions were running out 
 great yelled lando skimming over the surface of the destroyer inventing a new kind of combat 
 we know nothing about the tactics of such a confrontation ackbar protested 
 we know as much as they do lando hollered and think we knowmore bluffing was always dangerous in the last hand but sometimes when allyour money was in the pot it was the only way to lando never played tolose 
 at that we last long against star destroyers ackbar wasalready feeling giddy with resignation 
 last longer than we will against that death star and we might just take afew of them with us lando whooped with a jolt one of his forward guns wasblown away he put the falcon into a controlled spin and careened around the bellyof the imperial leviathan 
 with little else to lose ackbar decided to try strategy in the nextminutes dozens of rebel cruisers moved in astronomically close to the imperial the colossal antagonists began blasting away at each other like tanksat twenty paces while hundreds of tiny fighters raced across their surfaces zippingbetween laser bolts as they chased around the massive hulls 
 slowly luke and vader circled lightsaber high above his head luke readiedhis attack from classic the dark lord held a lateral stance in classicanswer without announcement luke brought his blade straight whenvader moved to parry luke feinted and cut low vader counterparried let theimpact direct his sword toward throatbut luke met the riposte and steppedback the first blows traded without injury again they circled 
 vader was impressed with speed pleased even it was a pity let the boy kill the emperor yet luke ready for that was still a chance luke would return to his friends if he destroyed the emperornow he needed more extensive tutelage by both vader be ready to assume his place at right hand ruling thegalaxy 
 so vader had to shephered the boy through periods like this stop him from doingdamage in the wrong in the right places prematurely 
 before vader could gather his thoughts much further though luke more aggressively he advanced in a flurry of lunges each met with aloud crack of phosphorescent saber the dark lord retreated a step at everyslash swiveling once to bring his cutting beam up luke batted it vader back yet again the lord of the sith momentarily lost his footing onthe stairs and tumbled to his knees 
 luke stood above him at the top of the staircase heady with his own power itwas in his hands now he knew it was he could take vader take his blade take hislife take his place at the side yes even that luke bury thethought this time he gloried in it he engorged himself with its juices felt itspower tingle his cheeks it made him feverish this thought with lust sooverpowering as to totally obliterate all other considerations 
 he had the power the choice was his 
 and then another thought emerged slowly compulsive as an ardent lover hecould destroy the emperor too destroy them both and rule the galaxy avengeand conquer 
 it was a profound moment for luke dizzying yet he did not swoon nordid he recoil 
 he took one step forward 
 for the first time the thought entered consciousness that his son mightbest him he was astounded by the strength luke had acquired since their last the cloud to mention the timing which was honed to this was an unexpected circumstance unexpected andunwelcome vader felt humiliation crawling in on the tail of his first reaction whichwas surprise and his second which was fear and then the edge of the humiliationcurled up to reveal bald anger and now he wanted revenge 
 these things were mirrored each facet by the young jedi who now toweredabove him the emperor watching joyously saw this and goaded luke on to revelin his darkness use your aggressive feelings boy yes let the hate flowthrough you become one with it let it nourish you 
 luke faltered a realized what was happening he was suddenlyconfused again what did he want what should he do his brief exultation hismicrosecond of dark now in a wash of indecision veiled awakening from a passionate flirtation 
 he took a step back lowered his sword relaxed and tried to drive the hatredfrom his being 
 in that instant vader attacked he lunged half up the stairs forcing luke toreverse defensively he bound the blade with his own but luke disengagedand leaped to the safety of an overhead gantry vader jumped over the railing to thefloor beneath the platform on which luke stood 
 i will not fight you father luke stated 
 you are unwise to lower your defenses vader warned his anger was did not want to win if the boy was not battling to the fullest but ifwinning meant he had to kill the boy who fightthen he could do that he wanted luke to be aware of those consequences he wanted luke to knowthis was no longer just a game this was darkness 
 luke heard something else though your thoughts betray you father i feelthe good in youthe conflict you could not bring yourself to kill me destroy me now twice before in have killed him but in the dogfight over the first death star and laterin the lightsaber duel on bespin he thought of leia briefly now howvader had had her in his clutches once had even tortured herbut kill winced to think of her agony but quickly pushed that from his mind the pointwas clear to him now though so often so murky there was still good in his father 
 this accusation really made vader angry he could tolerate much from theinsolent child but this was insufferable he must teach this boy a lesson he wouldnever forget or die learning once again you underestimate the power of the darkside 
 vader threw his scintillating sliced through the supports holding up thegantry on which luke was perched then swept around and flew back into luke tumbled to the ground then rolled down another level under the tiltingplatform in the shadow of the darkened overhang he was out of sight vaderpaced the area like a cat seeking the boy but he enter the shadows of theoverhang 
 you cannot hide forever luke 
 have to come in and get me replied the disembodied voice 
 i will not give you the advantage that easily vader felt his intentionsincreasingly ambiguous in this conflict the purity of his evil was being boy was clever knew he must move with extreme caution now 
 i wish no advantage father i will not fight you heretake my knew full well this might be his end but so be it he would not use darknessto fight darkness perhaps it would be left to leia after all to carry on the him perhaps she would know a way he know perhaps she could finda path for now though he could see only two paths and one was into one was not 
 luke put his lightsaber on the ground and rolled it along the floor toward stopped halfway between them in the middle of the low overhead area the darklord reached out his lightsaber jumped into it he hooked it to hisbelt and with grave uncertainty entered the shadowy overhang 
 he was picking up additional feelings from luke now new crosscurrents ofdoubt remorse regret abandonment shades of pain but somehow nowdirectly related to vader to others toendor ah that was sanctuarymoon where his friends would soon die luke would learn soon enough friendshipwas different on the dark side a different thing altogether 
 give yourself to the dark side luke he entreated it is the only way youcan save your friends yes your thoughts betray you son your feelings for themare strong especially for 
 vader stopped he sensed something 
 luke withdrew further into shadow he tried to hide but there was no way tohide what was in his was in pain her agony cried to him now and hisspirit cried with her he tried to shut it out to shut it up but the cry was loud and stifle it leave it alone had to cradle it openly to give it solace 
 consciousness invaded that private place 
 no screamed luke 
 vader was incredulous sister sister he bellowed your feelings havenow betrayed her tootwins he roared triumphantly was wise to hideher but now his failure is complete his smile was clear to luke through the the shadows through all the realms of darkness if you will not turned tothe dark side perhaps she will 
 this then was breaking point for leia was last unflagginghope if vader turned his twisted misguided cravings on her 
 never he screamed his lightsaber flew off belt into his own as it came to him 
 he rushed to his father with a frenzy never known nor had vader thegladiators battled fiercely sparks flying from the clash of their radiant weapons but itwas soon evident that the advantage was all and he was pressing it theylocked swords body to body when luke pushed vader back to break the clinch thedark lord hit his head on an overhanging beam in the cramped space he stumbledbackward even farther out of the area luke pursued him relentlessly 
 blow upon blow luke forced vader to onto the bridge thatcrossed the vast seemingly bottomless shaft to the power core each stroke saber pummeled vader like accusations like screams like shards of hate 
 the dark lord was driven to his knees he raised his blade to block yetanother luke slashed right hand off at the wrist 
 the hand along with bits of metal wires and electronic devices clattereduselessly away while lightsaber tumbled over the edge of the span into theendless shaft below without a trace 
 luke stared at his twitching severed mechanical then at hisown artificial realized suddenly just how much becomelike his father like the man he hated 
 trembling he stood above vader the point of his glowing blade at the throat he wanted to destroy this thing of darkness this thing that was oncehis father this thing that washim 
 suddenly the emperor was there looking on chuckling with agitation good kill him your hate has made you powerful your destiny and take your place at my side 
 luke stared at his father beneath him then at the emperor then back at was it was the darkness he hated not his father not even theemperor but the darkness in them in them and in himself 
 and the only way to destroy the darkness way to renounce it for good and stood suddenly erect and made the decision for which spent his life inpreparation 
 he hurled his lightsaber away never never will i turn to the dark have failed palpatine i am a jedi as my father was before me 
 the glee turned to a sullen rage so be it jedi if you will not beturned you will be destroyed 
 palpatine raised his spidery arms toward luke blinding white bolts of energycoruscated from his fingers shot across the room like sorcerous lightning and torethrough the insides looking for ground the young jedi was at onceconfounded and in never heard of such a power such a corruption of theforce let alone experienced it 
 but if it was it could be luke raised his armsto deflect the bolts initially he was lightning rebounded from histouch harmlessly into the walls soon though the shocks came with such speedand power they coursed over and into him and he could only shrink before with pain his knees buckling his powers at ebb 
 vader crawled like a wounded animal to his side 
 on endor the battle of the bunker continued stormtroopers kept irradiatingewoks with sophisticated weaponry while the fuzzy little warriors bashed away at theimperial troops with clubs tumbled walkers with logpiles and vine lassoedspeeder bikes with and 
 they felled trees on their foes they dug pits which they covered withbranches and then lured the walkers to chase them until the clumsy armored vehiclestoppled into the dugouts they started rockslides they dammed a small nearbystream and then opened the floodgates deluging a host of troops and two morewalkers they ganged up and then ran away they jumped on top of walkers fromhigh branches and poured pouches of burning in the they usedknives and spears and slings and made scary to confound and dismaythe enemy they were fearless opponents 
 their example made even chewie bolder than was his wont he started havingso much fun swinging on vines and bashing heads he nearly forgot about his laserpistol 
 he swung onto the roof of a walker at one point with teebo and wicket clingingto his back they landed with a thud atop the lurching contraption then made such abanging racket trying to hang on one of stormtroopers inside opened the top hatch tosee what was happening before he could fire his gun chewie plucked him out anddashed him to the and teebo immediately dove into the hatch andsubdued the other trooper 
 ewoks drive an imperial walker much the way they drive but with exhilaration chewie was almost thrown off the top severaltimes but even barking angrily down into the cockpit seem to have ewoks just giggled squealed and careened into another speeder bike 
 chewie climbed down inside it took him half a minute to master technology was pretty standardized and then methodically oneby one he began approaching the other unsuspecting imperial walkers and blastingthem to dust most had no idea what was happening 
 as the giant began going up in flames the ewoks were rallied behind walker the wookiee was turning the tide of battle 
 han meanwhile was still working furiously at the control panel wiressparked each time he refastened another connection but the door kept not crouched at his back firing her laser pistol giving him cover 
 he motioned her at last give me a hand i think got it figured out holdthis 
 he handed her one of the wires she holstered her weapon took the wire hegave her and held it in position as he brought two others over from opposite ends ofthe panel 
 here goes nothing he said 
 the three wires sparked the connection was made there was a sudden loudwhump as a second blast door crashed down in front of the first doubling theimpregnable barrier 
 great now we have two doors to get through leia muttered 
 at that moment she was hit in the arm by a laser bolt and knocked to theground 
 han rushed over to her leia no he cried trying to stop the bleeding 
 princess leia are you all right threepio fretted 
 not bad she shook her head 
 hold it shouted a voice one move and both dead 
 they froze looked up two stormtroopers stood before them weapons 
 stand up one ordered hands raised 
 han and leia looked at each other fixed their gazes deep in each there in the wells of their souls for a suspended eternal moment during whichall was felt understood touched shared 
 gaze was drawn down to surreptitiously eased outher gun and was holding it now at the ready the action was hidden from thetroopers because han was standing in front of leia their view 
 he looked again into her eyes comprehending with a last heartfelt smile hewhispered i love you 
 i know she answered simply 
 then the moment was over and at an unspoken instantaneous signal hanwhirled out of the line of fire as leia blasted at the stormtroopers 
 the air was filled with laser glinting haze like an electronstorm buffeted the area sheared by intense flares 
 as the smoke cleared a giant imperial walker approached stood before him andstopped han looked up to see its laser cannons aimed directly in his face heraised his arms and took a tentative step forward he really sure what he wasgoing to do stay back he said quietly to leia measuring the distance to themachine in his mind 
 that was when the hatch on top of the walker popped open and chewbaccastuck his head out with an ingratiating smile 
 ahr rahr barked the wookiee 
 solo could have kissed him chewie get down here started forward to greet his partner then stopped in no wait an idea

 chapter ix 
 
 pursued by the french army of a hundred thousand men under the command of bonaparte encountering a population that was unfriendly to it losing confidence in its allies suffering from shortness of supplies and compelled to act under conditions of war unlike anything that had been foreseen the russian army of thousand men commanded by kutuzov was hurriedly retreating along the danube stopping where overtaken by the enemy and fighting rearguard actions only as far as necessary to enable it to retreat without losing its heavy equipment there had been actions at lambach amstetten and melk but despite the courage and endurance acknowledged even by the enemy with which the russians fought the only consequence of these actions was a yet more rapid retreat austrian troops that had escaped capture at ulm and had joined kutuzov at braunau now separated from the russian army and kutuzov was left with only his own weak and exhausted forces the defense of vienna was no longer to be thought of instead of an offensive the plan of which carefully prepared in accord with the modern science of strategics had been handed to kutuzov when he was in vienna by the austrian hofkriegsrath the sole and almost unattainable aim remaining for him was to effect a junction with the forces that were advancing from russia without losing his army as mack had done at ulm 
 on the of october kutuzov with his army crossed to the left bank of the danube and took up a position for the first time with the river between himself and the main body of the french on the thirtieth he attacked division which was on the left bank and broke it up in this action for the first time trophies were taken banners cannon and two enemy generals for the first time after a retreat the russian troops had halted and after a fight had not only held the field but had repulsed the french though the troops were exhausted and had lost a third of their number in killed wounded sick and stragglers though a number of sick and wounded had been abandoned on the other side of the danube with a letter in which kutuzov entrusted them to the humanity of the enemy and though the big hospitals and the houses in krems converted into military hospitals could no longer accommodate all the sick and wounded yet the stand made at krems and the victory over mortier raised the spirits of the army considerably throughout the whole army and at headquarters most joyful though erroneous rumors were rife of the imaginary approach of columns from russia of some victory gained by the austrians and of the retreat of the frightened bonaparte 
 prince andrew during the battle had been in attendance on the austrian general schmidt who was killed in the action his horse had been wounded under him and his own arm slightly grazed by a bullet as a mark of the commander in special favor he was sent with the news of this victory to the austrian court now no longer at vienna which was threatened by the french but at brunn despite his apparently delicate build prince andrew could endure physical fatigue far better than many very muscular men and on the night of the battle having arrived at krems excited but not weary with dispatches from dokhturov to kutuzov he was sent immediately with a special dispatch to brunn to be so sent meant not only a reward but an important step toward promotion 
 the night was dark but starry the road showed black in the snow that had fallen the previous day the day of the battle reviewing his impressions of the recent battle picturing pleasantly to himself the impression his news of a victory would create or recalling the given him by the commander in chief and his fellow officers prince andrew was galloping along in a post chaise enjoying the feelings of a man who has at length begun to attain a happiness as soon as he closed his eyes his ears seemed filled with the rattle of the wheels and the sensation of victory then he began to imagine that the russians were running away and that he himself was killed but he quickly roused himself with a feeling of joy as if learning afresh that this was not so but that on the contrary the french had run away he again recalled all the details of the victory and his own calm courage during the battle and feeling reassured he dozed off the dark starry night was followed by a bright cheerful morning the snow was thawing in the sunshine the horses galloped quickly and on both sides of the road were forests of different kinds fields and villages 
 at one of the post stations he overtook a convoy of russian wounded the russian officer in charge of the transport lolled back in the front cart shouting and scolding a soldier with coarse abuse in each of the long german carts six or more pale dirty bandaged men were being jolted over the stony road some of them were talking he heard russian words others were eating bread the more severely wounded looked silently with the languid interest of sick children at the envoy hurrying past them 
 prince andrew told his driver to stop and asked a soldier in what action they had been wounded day before yesterday on the danube answered the soldier prince andrew took out his purse and gave the soldier three gold pieces 
 for them all he said to the officer who came up 
 get well soon lads he continued turning to the soldiers plenty to do still 
 what news sir asked the officer evidently anxious to start a conversation 
 good news go on he shouted to the driver and they galloped on 
 it was already quite dark when prince andrew rattled over the paved streets of brunn and found himself surrounded by high buildings the lights of shops houses and street lamps fine carriages and all that atmosphere of a large and active town which is always so attractive to a soldier after camp life despite his rapid journey and sleepless night prince andrew when he drove up to the palace felt even more vigorous and alert than he had done the day before only his eyes gleamed feverishly and his thoughts followed one another with extraordinary clearness and rapidity he again vividly recalled the details of the battle no longer dim but definite and in the concise form concise form in which he imagined himself stating them to the emperor francis he vividly imagined the casual questions that might be put to him and the answers he would give he expected to be at once presented to the emperor at the chief entrance to the palace however an official came running out to meet him and learning that he was a special messenger led him to another entrance 
 to the right from the corridor euer hochgeboren there you will find the adjutant on duty said the official he will conduct you to the minister of war 
 the adjutant on duty meeting prince andrew asked him to wait and went in to the minister of war five minutes later he returned and bowing with particular courtesy ushered prince andrew before him along a corridor to the cabinet where the minister of war was at work the adjutant by his elaborate courtesy appeared to wish to ward off any attempt at familiarity on the part of the russian messenger 
 prince joyous feeling was considerably weakened as he approached the door of the room he felt offended and without his noticing it the feeling of offense immediately turned into one of disdain which was quite uncalled for his fertile mind instantly suggested to him a point of view which gave him a right to despise the adjutant and the minister away from the smell of powder they probably think it easy to gain victories he thought his eyes narrowed disdainfully he entered the room of the minister of war with peculiarly deliberate steps this feeling of disdain was heightened when he saw the minister seated at a large table reading some papers and making pencil notes on them and for the first two or three minutes taking no notice of his arrival a wax candle stood at each side of the bent bald head with its gray temples he went on reading to the end without raising his eyes at the opening of the door and the sound of footsteps 
 take this and deliver it said he to his adjutant handing him the papers and still taking no notice of the special messenger 
 prince andrew felt that either the actions of army interested the minister of war less than any of the other matters he was concerned with or he wanted to give the russian special messenger that impression but that is a matter of perfect indifference to me he thought the minister drew the remaining papers together arranged them evenly and then raised his head he had an intellectual and distinctive head but the instant he turned to prince andrew the firm intelligent expression on his face changed in a way evidently deliberate and habitual to him his face took on the stupid artificial smile which does not even attempt to hide its artificiality of a man who is continually receiving many petitioners one after another 
 from general field marshal kutuzov he asked i hope it is good news there has been an encounter with mortier a victory it was high time 
 he took the dispatch which was addressed to him and began to read it with a mournful expression 
 oh my god my god schmidt he exclaimed in german what a calamity what a calamity 
 having glanced through the dispatch he laid it on the table and looked at prince andrew evidently considering something 
 ah what a calamity you say the affair was decisive but mortier is not captured again he pondered i am very glad you have brought good news though death is a heavy price to pay for the victory his majesty will no doubt wish to see you but not today i thank you you must have a rest be at the levee tomorrow after the parade however i will let you know 
 the stupid smile which had left his face while he was speaking reappeared 
 au revoir thank you very much his majesty will probably desire to see you he added bowing his head 
 when prince andrew left the palace he felt that all the interest and happiness the victory had afforded him had been now left in the indifferent hands of the minister of war and the polite adjutant the whole tenor of his thoughts instantaneously changed the battle seemed the memory of a remote event long past

 prince joyous feeling was considerably weakened as he approached the door of the room he felt offended and without his noticing it the feeling of offense immediately turned into one of disdain which was quite uncalled for his fertile mind instantly suggested to him a point of view which gave him a right to despise the adjutant and the minister away from the smell of powder they probably think it easy to gain victories he thought his eyes narrowed disdainfully he entered the room of the minister of war with peculiarly deliberate steps this feeling of disdain was heightened when he saw the minister seated at a large table reading some papers and making pencil notes on them and for the first two or three minutes taking no notice of his arrival a wax candle stood at each side of the bent bald head with its gray temples he went on reading to the end without raising his eyes at the opening of the door and the sound of footsteps 
 take this and deliver it said he to his adjutant handing him the papers and still taking no notice of the special messenger 
 prince andrew felt that either the actions of army interested the minister of war less than any of the other matters he was concerned with or he wanted to give the russian special messenger that impression but that is a matter of perfect indifference to me he thought the minister drew the remaining papers together arranged them evenly and then raised his head he had an intellectual and distinctive head but the instant he turned to prince andrew the firm intelligent expression on his face changed in a way evidently deliberate and habitual to him his face took on the stupid artificial smile which does not even attempt to hide its artificiality of a man who is continually receiving many petitioners one after another 
 from general field marshal kutuzov he asked i hope it is good news there has been an encounter with mortier a victory it was high time 
 he took the dispatch which was addressed to him and began to read it with a mournful expression 
 oh my god my god schmidt he exclaimed in german what a calamity what a calamity 
 having glanced through the dispatch he laid it on the table and looked at prince andrew evidently considering something 
 ah what a calamity you say the affair was decisive but mortier is not captured again he pondered i am very glad you have brought good news though death is a heavy price to pay for the victory his majesty will no doubt wish to see you but not today i thank you you must have a rest be at the levee tomorrow after the parade however i will let you know 
 the stupid smile which had left his face while he was speaking reappeared 
 au revoir thank you very much his majesty will probably desire to see you he added bowing his head 
 when prince andrew left the palace he felt that all the interest and happiness the victory had afforded him had been now left in the indifferent hands of the minister of war and the polite adjutant the whole tenor of his thoughts instantaneously changed the battle seemed the memory of a remote event long past

 chapter 
 
 
 at three in the afternoon all the fashionable world at nice may be seen on the promenade des charming place for the wide walk bordered with palms flowers and tropical shrubs is bounded on one side by the sea on the other by the grand drive lined with hotels and villas while beyond lie orange orchards and the hills many nations are represented many languages spoken many costumes worn and on a sunny day the spectacle is as gay and brilliant as a carnival haughty english lively french sober germans handsome spaniards ugly russians meek jews americans all drive sit or saunter here chatting over the news and criticzing the latest celebrity who has or dickens victor emmanuel or the queen of the sandwich islands the equipages are as varied as the company and attract as much attention especially the low basket barouches in which ladies drive themselves with a pair of dashing ponies gay nets to keep their voluminous flounces from overflowing the diminutive vehicles and little grooms on the perch behind 
 along this walk on christmas day a tall young man walked slowly with his hands behind him and a somewhat absent expression of countenance he looked like an italian was dressed like an englishman and had the independent air of an combination which caused sundry pairs of feminine eyes to look approvingly after him and sundry dandies in black velvet suits with neckties buff gloves and orange flowers in their buttonholes to shrug their shoulders and then envy him his inches there were plenty of pretty faces to admire but the young man took little notice of them except to glance now and then at some blonde girl in blue presently he strolled out of the promenade and stood a moment at the crossing as if undecided whether to go and listen to the band in the jardin publique or to wander along the beach toward castle hill the quick trot of ponies feet made him look up as one of the little carriages containing a single young lady came rapidly down the street the lady was young blonde and dressed in blue he stared a minute then his whole face woke up and waving his hat like a boy he hurried forward to meet her 
 oh laurie is it really you i thought never come cried amy dropping the reins and holding out both hands to the great scandalization of a french mamma who hastened her steps lest she should be demoralized by beholding the free manners of these mad english 
 i was detained by the way but i promised to spend christmas with you and here i am 
 how is your grandfather when did you come where are you staying 
 very the chauvain i called at your hotel but you were out 
 i have so much to say i know where to begin get in and we can talk at our ease i was going for a drive and longing for company saving up for tonight 
 what happens then a ball 
 a christmas party at out hotel there are many americans there and they give it in honor of the day go with us of course aunt will be charmed 
 thank you where now asked laurie leaning back and folding his arms a proceeding which suited amy who preferred to drive for her parasol whip and blue reins over the white ponies backs afforded her infinite satisfaction 
 going to the bankers first for letters and then to castle hill the view is so lovely and i like to feed the peacocks have you ever been there 
 often years ago but i mind having a look at it 
 now tell me all about yourself the last i heard of you your grandfather wrote that he expected you from berlin yes i spent a month there and then joined him in paris where he has settled for the winter he has friends there and finds plenty to amuse him so i go and come and we got on capitally 
 a sociable arrangement said amy missing something in manner though she tell what 
 why you see he hates to travel and i hate to keep still so we each suit ourselves and there is no trouble i am often with him and he enjoys my adventures while i like to feel that someone is glad to see me when i get back from my wanderings dirty old hole it he added with a look of disgust as they drove along the boulevard to the place napoleon in the old city 
 the dirt is picturesque so i mind the river and the hills are delicious and these glimpses of the narrow cross streets are my delight now we shall have to wait for that procession to pass going to the church of st john 
 while laurie listlessly watched the procession of priests under their canopies nuns bearing lighted tapers and some brotherhood in blue chanting as they walked amy watched him and felt a new sort of shyness steal over her for he was changed and she could not find the boy she left in the man beside her he was handsomer than ever and greatly improved she thought but now that the flush of pleasure at meeting her was over he looked tired and sick nor exactly unhappy but older and graver than a year or two of prosperous life should have made him she understand it and did not venture to ask questions so she shook her head and touched up her ponies as the procession wound away across the arches of the paglioni bridge and vanished in the church 
 que she said airing her french which had improved in quantity if not in quality since she came abroad 
 that mademoiselle has made good use of her time and the result is charming replied laurie bowing with his hand on his heart and an admiring look 
 she blushed with pleasure but somehow the compliment did not satisfy her like the blunt praises he used to give her at home when he promenaded round her on festival occasions and tole her she was altogether jolly with a hearty smile and an approving pat on the head she like the new tone for though not blase it sounded indifferent in spite of the look 
 if the way going to grow up i wish stay a boy she thought with a curious sense of disappointment and discomfort trying meantime to seem quite easy and gay 
 at she found the precious home letters and giving the reins to laurie read them luxuriously as they wound up the shady road between green hedges where tea roses bloomed as freshly as in june 
 beth is very poorly mother says i often think i ought to go home but they all say stay so i do for i shall never have another chance like this said amy looking sober over one page 
 i think you are right there you could do nothing at home and it is a great comfort to them to know that you are well and happy and enjoying so much my dear 
 he drew a little nearer and looked more like his old self as he said that and the fear that sometimes weighed on heart was lightened for the look the act the brotherly my dear seemed to assure her that if any trouble did come she would not be alone in a strange land presently she laughed and showed him a small sketch of jo in her scribbling suit with the bow rampantly erect upon her cap and issuing from her mouth the words genius burns 
 laurie smiled took it put it in his vest pocket to keep it from blowing away and listened with interest to the lively letter amy read him 
 this will be a regularly merry christmas to me with presents in the morning you and letters in the afternoon and a party at night said amy as they alighted among the ruins of the old fort and a flock of splendid peacocks came trooping about them tamely waiting to be fed while amy stood laughing on the bank above him as she scattered crumbs to the brilliant birds laurie looked at her as she had looked at him with a natural curiosity to see what changes time and absence had wrought he found nothing to perplex or disappoint much to admire and approve for overlooking a few little affectations of speech and manner she was as sprightly and graceful as ever with the addition of that indescribable something in dress and bearing which we call elegance always mature for her age she had gained a certain aplomb in both carriage and conversation which made her seem more of a woman of the world than she was but her old petulance now and then showed itself her strong will still held its own and her native frankness was unspoiled by foreign polish 
 laurie did not read all this while he watched her feed the peacocks but he saw enough to satisfy and interest him and carried away a pretty little picture of a girl standing in the sunshine which brought out the soft hue of her dress the fresh color of her cheeks the golden gloss of her hair and made her a prominent figure in the pleasant scene 
 as they came up onto the stone plateau that crowns the hill amy waved her hand as if welcoming him to her favorite haunt and said pointing here and there do you remember the cathedral and the corso the fishermen dragging their nets in the bay and the lovely road to villa franca tower just below and best of all that speck far out to sea which they say ils corsica 
 i remember not much changed he answered without enthusiasm 
 what jo would give for a sight of that famous speck said amy feeling in good spirits and anxious to see him so also 
 yes was all he said but he turned and strained his eyes to see the island which a greater usurper than even napoleon now made interesting in his sight 
 take a good look at it for her sake and then come and tell me what you have been doing with yourself all this while said amy seating herself ready for a good talk 
 but she did not get it for though he joined her and answered all her questions freely she could only learn that he had roved about the continent and been to greece so after idling away an hour they drove home again and having paid his respects to mrs carrol laurie left them promising to return in the evening 
 it must be recorded of amy that she deliberately prinked that night time and absence had done its work on both the young people she had seen her old friend in a new light not as our boy but as a handsome and agreeable man and she was conscious of a very natural desire to find favor in his sight amy knew her good points and made the most of them with the taste and skill which is a fortune to a poor and pretty woman 
 tarlatan and tulle were cheap at nice so she enveloped herself in them on such occasions and following the sensible english fashion of simple dress for young girls got up charming little toilettes with fresh flowers a few trinkets and all manner of dainty devices which were both inexpensive and effective it must be confessed that the artist sometimes got possession of the woman and indulged in antique coiffures statuesque attitudes and classic draperies but dear heart we all have out little weaknesses and find it easy to pardon such in the young who satisfy our eyes with their comeliness and keep our hearts merry with their artless vanities 
 i do want him to think i look well and tell them so at home said amy to herself as she put on old white silk ball dress and covered it with a cloud of fresh illusion out of which her white shoulders and golden head emerged with a most artistic effect her hair she had the sense to let alone after gathering up the thick waves and curls into a knot at the back of her head 
 not the fashion but becoming and i afford to make a fright of myself she used to say when advised to frizzle puff or braid as the latest style commanded 
 having no ornaments fine enough for this important occasion amy looped her fleecy skirts with rosy clusters of azalea and framed the white shoulders in delicate green vines remembering the painted boots she surveyed her white satin slippers with girlish satisfaction and chassed down the room admiring her aristocratic feet all by herself 
 my new fan just matches my flowers my gloves fit to a charm and the real lace on mouchoir gives an air to my whole dress if i only had a classical nose and mouth i should be perfectly happy she said surveying herself with a critical eye and a candle in each hand 
 in spite of this affliction she looked unusually gay and graceful as she glided away she seldom did not suit her style she thought for being tall the stately and junoesque was more appropriate than the sportive or piquante she walked up and down the long saloon while waiting for laurie and once arranged herself under the chandelier which had a good effect upon her hair then she thought better of it and went away to the other end of the room as if ashamed of the girlish desire to have the first view a propitious one it so happened that she could not have done a better thing for laurie came in so quietly she did not hear him and as she stood at the distant window with her head half turned and one hand gathering up her dress the slender white figure against the red curtains was as effective as a statue 
 good evening diana said laurie with the look of satisfaction she liked to see in his eyes when they rested on her 
 good evening apollo she answered smiling back at him for he too looked unusually debonair and the thought of entering the ballroom on the arm of such a personable man caused amy to pity the four plain misses davis from the bottom of her heart 
 here are your flowers i arranged them myself remembering that you like what hannah calls a said laurie handing her a delicate nosegay in a holder that she had long coveted as she daily passed it in window 
 how kind you are she exclaimed gratefully if known you were coming have had something ready for you today though not as pretty as this afraid 
 thank you it what it should be but you have improved it he added as she snapped the silver bracelet on her wrist 
 please 
 i thought you liked that sort of thing 
 not from you it sound natural and i like your old bluntness better 
 glad of it he answered with a look of relief then buttoned her gloves for her and asked if his tie was straight just as he used to do when they went to parties together at home 
 the company assembled in the long salle a manger that evening was such as one sees nowhere but on the continent the hospitable americans had invited every acquaintance they had in nice and having no prejudice against titles secured a few to add luster to their christmas ball 
 a russian prince condescended to sit in a corner for an hour and talk with a massive lady dressed like mother in black velvet with a pearl bridle under her chin a polish count aged eighteen devoted himself to the ladies who pronounced him a fascinating dear and a german serene something having come to supper alone roamed vaguely about seeking what he might devour baron private secretary a largenosed jew in tight boots affably beamed upon the world as if his name crowned him with a golden halo a stout frenchman who knew the emperor came to indulge his mania for dancing and lady de jones a british matron adorned the scene with her little family of eight of course there were many american girls handsome english ditto and a few plain but piquante french demoiselles likewise the usual set of traveling young gentlemen who disported themselves gaily while mammas of all nations lined the walls and smiled upon them benignly when they danced with their daughters 
 any young girl can imagine state of mind when she took the stage that night leaning on arm she knew she looked well she loved to dance she felt that her foot was on her native heath in a ballroom and enjoyed the delightful sense of power which comes when young girls first discover the new and lovely kingdom they are born to rule by virtue of beauty youth and womanhood she did pity the davis girls who were awkward plain and destitute of escort except a grim papa and three grimmer maiden aunts and she bowed to them in her friendliest manner as she passed which was good of her as it permitted them to see her dress and burn with curiosity to know who her friend might be with the first burst of the band color rose her eyes began to sparkle and her feet to tap the floor impatiently for she danced well and wanted laurie to know it therefore the shock she received can better be imagined than described when he said in a perfectly tranquil tone do you care to dance 
 one usually does at a ball 
 her amazed look and quick answer caused laurie to repair his error as fast as possible 
 i meant the first dance may i have the honor 
 i can give you one if i put off the count he dances devinely but he will excuse me as you are an old friend said amy hoping that the name would have a good effect and show laurie that she was not to be trifled with nice little boy but rather a short pole to support a daughter of the gods devinely tall and most devinely fair 
 was all the satisfaction she got however 
 the set in which they found themselves was composed of english and amy was compelled to walk decorously through a cotillion feeling all the while as if she could dance the tarantella with relish laurie resigned her to the nice little boy and went to do his duty to flo without securing amy for the joys to come which reprehensible want of forethought was properly punished for she immediately engaged herself till supper meaning to relent if he then gave any signs penitence she showed him her ball book with demure satisfaction when he strolled instead of rushed up to claim her for the next a glorious polka redowa but his polite regrets impose upon her and when she galloped away with the count she saw laurie sit down by her aunt with an actual expression of relief 
 that was unpardonable and amy took no more notice of him for a long while except a word now and then when she came to her chaperon between the dances for a necessary pin or a rest her anger had a good effect however for she hid it under a smiling face and seemed unusually blithe and brilliant eyes followed her with pleasure for she neither romped nor sauntered but danced with spirit and grace making the delightsome pastime what it should be he very naturally fell to studying her from this new point of view and before the evening was half over had decided that little amy was going to make a very charming woman 
 it was a lively scene for soon the spirit of the social season took possession of everyone and christmas merriment made all faces shine hearts happy and heels light the musicians fiddled tooted and banged as if they enjoyed it everybody danced who could and those who admired their neighbors with uncommon warmth the air was dark with davises and many jones gamboled like a flock of young giraffes the golden secretary darted through the room like a meteor with a dashing frenchwoman who carped the floor with her pink satin train the serene teuton found the supper table and was happy eating steadily through the bill of fare and dismayed the garcons by the ravages he committed but the friend covered himself with glory for he danced everything whether he knew it or not and introduced impromptu pirouettes when the figures bewildered him the boyish abandon of that stout man was charming to behold for though he carried weight he danced like an ball he ran he flew he pranced his face glowed his bald head shown his coattails waved wildly his pumps actually twinkled in the air and when the music stopped he wiped the drops from his brow and beamed upon his fellow men like a french pickwick without glasses 
 amy and her pole distinguished themselves by equal enthusiasm but more graceful agility and laurie found himself involuntarily keeping time to the rhythmic rise and fall of the white slippers as they flew by as indefatigably as if winged when little vladimir finally relinquished her with assurances that he was desolated to leave so early she was ready to rest and see how her recreant knight had borne his punishment 
 it had been successful for at blighted affections find a balm in friendly society and young nerves will thrill young blood dance and healthy young spirits rise when subjected to the enchantment of beauty light music and motion laurie had a look as he rose to give her his seat and when he hurried away to bring her some supper she said to herself with a satisfied smile ah i thought that would do him good 
 you look like femme peinte par he said as he fanned her with one hand and held her coffee cup in the other 
 my rouge come off and amy rubbed her brilliant cheek and showed him her white glove with a sober simplicity that made him laugh outright 
 what do you call this stuff he asked touching a fold of her dress that had blown over his knee 
 illusion 
 good name for it very thing it 
 as old as the hills you have seen it on dozens of girls and you never found out that it was pretty till now stupide 
 i never saw it on you before which accounts for the mistake you see 
 none of that it is forbidden rather take coffee than compliments just now no lounge it makes me nervous 
 laurie sat bold upright and meekly took her empty plate feeling an odd sort of pleasure in having little amy order him about for she had lost her shyness now and felt an irrestible desire to trample on him as girls have a delightful way of doing when lords of creation show any signs of subjection 
 where did you learn all this sort of thing he asked with a quizzical look 
 as this sort of thing is rather a vague expression would you kindly explain returned amy knowing perfectly well what he meant but wickedly leaving him to describe what is indescribable 
 general air the style the the know laughed laurie breaking down and helping himself out of his quandary with the new word 
 amy was gratified but of course show it and demurely answered foreign life polishes one in spite of self i study as well as play and as for a little gesture toward her tulle is cheap posies to be had for nothing and i am used to making the most of my poor little things 
 amy rather regretted that last sentence fearing it in good taste but laurie liked her better for it and found himself both admiring and respecting the brave patience that made the most of opportunity and the cheerful spirit that covered poverty with flowers amy did not know why he looked at her so kindly now why he filled up her book with his own name and devoted himself to her for the rest of the evening in the most delightful manner but the impulse that wrought this agreeable change was the result of one of the new impressions which both of them were unconsciously giving and receiving

 the company assembled in the long salle a manger that evening was such as one sees nowhere but on the continent the hospitable americans had invited every acquaintance they had in nice and having no prejudice against titles secured a few to add luster to their christmas ball 
 a russian prince condescended to sit in a corner for an hour and talk with a massive lady dressed like mother in black velvet with a pearl bridle under her chin a polish count aged eighteen devoted himself to the ladies who pronounced him a fascinating dear and a german serene something having come to supper alone roamed vaguely about seeking what he might devour baron private secretary a largenosed jew in tight boots affably beamed upon the world as if his name crowned him with a golden halo a stout frenchman who knew the emperor came to indulge his mania for dancing and lady de jones a british matron adorned the scene with her little family of eight of course there were many american girls handsome english ditto and a few plain but piquante french demoiselles likewise the usual set of traveling young gentlemen who disported themselves gaily while mammas of all nations lined the walls and smiled upon them benignly when they danced with their daughters 
 any young girl can imagine state of mind when she took the stage that night leaning on arm she knew she looked well she loved to dance she felt that her foot was on her native heath in a ballroom and enjoyed the delightful sense of power which comes when young girls first discover the new and lovely kingdom they are born to rule by virtue of beauty youth and womanhood she did pity the davis girls who were awkward plain and destitute of escort except a grim papa and three grimmer maiden aunts and she bowed to them in her friendliest manner as she passed which was good of her as it permitted them to see her dress and burn with curiosity to know who her friend might be with the first burst of the band color rose her eyes began to sparkle and her feet to tap the floor impatiently for she danced well and wanted laurie to know it therefore the shock she received can better be imagined than described when he said in a perfectly tranquil tone do you care to dance 
 one usually does at a ball 
 her amazed look and quick answer caused laurie to repair his error as fast as possible 
 i meant the first dance may i have the honor 
 i can give you one if i put off the count he dances devinely but he will excuse me as you are an old friend said amy hoping that the name would have a good effect and show laurie that she was not to be trifled with nice little boy but rather a short pole to support a daughter of the gods devinely tall and most devinely fair 
 was all the satisfaction she got however 
 the set in which they found themselves was composed of english and amy was compelled to walk decorously through a cotillion feeling all the while as if she could dance the tarantella with relish laurie resigned her to the nice little boy and went to do his duty to flo without securing amy for the joys to come which reprehensible want of forethought was properly punished for she immediately engaged herself till supper meaning to relent if he then gave any signs penitence she showed him her ball book with demure satisfaction when he strolled instead of rushed up to claim her for the next a glorious polka redowa but his polite regrets impose upon her and when she galloped away with the count she saw laurie sit down by her aunt with an actual expression of relief 
 that was unpardonable and amy took no more notice of him for a long while except a word now and then when she came to her chaperon between the dances for a necessary pin or a rest her anger had a good effect however for she hid it under a smiling face and seemed unusually blithe and brilliant eyes followed her with pleasure for she neither romped nor sauntered but danced with spirit and grace making the delightsome pastime what it should be he very naturally fell to studying her from this new point of view and before the evening was half over had decided that little amy was going to make a very charming woman 
 it was a lively scene for soon the spirit of the social season took possession of everyone and christmas merriment made all faces shine hearts happy and heels light the musicians fiddled tooted and banged as if they enjoyed it everybody danced who could and those who admired their neighbors with uncommon warmth the air was dark with davises and many jones gamboled like a flock of young giraffes the golden secretary darted through the room like a meteor with a dashing frenchwoman who carped the floor with her pink satin train the serene teuton found the supper table and was happy eating steadily through the bill of fare and dismayed the garcons by the ravages he committed but the friend covered himself with glory for he danced everything whether he knew it or not and introduced impromptu pirouettes when the figures bewildered him the boyish abandon of that stout man was charming to behold for though he carried weight he danced like an ball he ran he flew he pranced his face glowed his bald head shown his coattails waved wildly his pumps actually twinkled in the air and when the music stopped he wiped the drops from his brow and beamed upon his fellow men like a french pickwick without glasses 
 amy and her pole distinguished themselves by equal enthusiasm but more graceful agility and laurie found himself involuntarily keeping time to the rhythmic rise and fall of the white slippers as they flew by as indefatigably as if winged when little vladimir finally relinquished her with assurances that he was desolated to leave so early she was ready to rest and see how her recreant knight had borne his punishment 
 it had been successful for at blighted affections find a balm in friendly society and young nerves will thrill young blood dance and healthy young spirits rise when subjected to the enchantment of beauty light music and motion laurie had a look as he rose to give her his seat and when he hurried away to bring her some supper she said to herself with a satisfied smile ah i thought that would do him good 
 you look like femme peinte par he said as he fanned her with one hand and held her coffee cup in the other 
 my rouge come off and amy rubbed her brilliant cheek and showed him her white glove with a sober simplicity that made him laugh outright 
 what do you call this stuff he asked touching a fold of her dress that had blown over his knee 
 illusion 
 good name for it very thing it 
 as old as the hills you have seen it on dozens of girls and you never found out that it was pretty till now stupide 
 i never saw it on you before which accounts for the mistake you see 
 none of that it is forbidden rather take coffee than compliments just now no lounge it makes me nervous 
 laurie sat bold upright and meekly took her empty plate feeling an odd sort of pleasure in having little amy order him about for she had lost her shyness now and felt an irrestible desire to trample on him as girls have a delightful way of doing when lords of creation show any signs of subjection 
 where did you learn all this sort of thing he asked with a quizzical look 
 as this sort of thing is rather a vague expression would you kindly explain returned amy knowing perfectly well what he meant but wickedly leaving him to describe what is indescribable 
 general air the style the the know laughed laurie breaking down and helping himself out of his quandary with the new word 
 amy was gratified but of course show it and demurely answered foreign life polishes one in spite of self i study as well as play and as for a little gesture toward her tulle is cheap posies to be had for nothing and i am used to making the most of my poor little things 
 amy rather regretted that last sentence fearing it in good taste but laurie liked her better for it and found himself both admiring and respecting the brave patience that made the most of opportunity and the cheerful spirit that covered poverty with flowers amy did not know why he looked at her so kindly now why he filled up her book with his own name and devoted himself to her for the rest of the evening in the most delightful manner but the impulse that wrought this agreeable change was the result of one of the new impressions which both of them were unconsciously giving and receiving

lionfish nov chapter the beginningcontents prev chapter 
 when he looked back even a month later harry found he had only scattered memories of the next few days it was as though he had been through too much to take in any more the recollections he did have were very painful the worst perhaps was the meeting with the that took place the following morning 
 
 they did not blame him for what had happened on the contrary both thanked him for returning body to them mr diggory sobbed through most of the interview mrs grief seemed to be beyond tears 
 
 he suffered very little then she said when harry had told her how cedric had died and after all amoshe died just when won the tournament he must have been happy 
 
 when they got to their feet she looked down at harry and said you look after yourself now 
 
 harry seized the sack of gold on the bedside table 
 
 you take this he muttered to her it been he got there first you take it 
 
 but she backed away from him 
 
 oh no yours dear i keep it 
 
 
 
 harry returned to gryffindor tower the following evening from what hermione and ron told him dumbledore had spoken to the school that morning at breakfast he had merely requested that they leave harry alone that nobody ask him questions or badger him to tell the story of what had happened in the maze most people he noticed were skirting him in the corridors avoiding his eyes some whispered behind their hands as he passed he guessed that many of them had believed rita article about how disturbed and possibly dangerous he was perhaps they were formulating their own theories about how cedric had died he found he care very much he liked it best when he was with ron and hermione and they were talking about other things or else letting him sit in silence while they played chess he felt as though all three of them had reached an understanding they need to put into words that each was waiting for some sign some word of what was going on outside hogwarts and that it was useless to speculate about what might be coming until they knew anything for certain the only time they touched upon the subject was when ron told harry about a meeting mrs weasley had had with dumbledore before going home 
 
 she went to ask him if you could come straight to us this summer he said but he wants you to go back to the dursleys at least at first 
 
 why said harry 
 
 she said got his reasons said ron shaking his head darkly i suppose got to trust him we 
 
 the only person apart from ron and hermione that harry felt able to talk to was hagrid as there was no longer a defense against the dark arts teacher they had those lessons free they used the one on thursday afternoon to go down and visit hagrid in his cabin it was a bright and sunny day fang bounded out of the open door as they approached barking and wagging his tail madly 
 
 that called hagrid coming to the door harry 
 
 he strode out to meet them pulled harry into a hug ruffled his hair and said good ter see yeh mate good ter see yeh 
 
 they saw two cups and saucers on the wooden table in front of the fireplace when they entered cabin 
 
 bin havin a cuppa with olympe hagrid said jus left 
 
 who said ron curiously 
 
 madame maxime o course said hagrid 
 
 you two made up have you said ron 
 
 dunno what talkin about said hagrid airily fetching more cups from the dresser when he had made tea and offered around a plate of doughy cookies he leaned back in his chair and surveyed harry closely through his eyes 
 
 you all righ he said gruffly 
 
 yeah said harry 
 
 no not said hagrid course not but yeh will be 
 
 harry said nothing

 hagrid raised his bushy eyebrows at the disbelieving expressions on their faces 
 
 no good sittin worryin abou it he said comin will come an meet it when it does dumbledore told me wha you did harry 
 
 chest swelled as he looked at harry 
 
 yeh did as much as yer father done an i can give yeh no higher praise than that 
 
 harry smiled back at him it was the first time smiled in days dumbledore asked you to do hagrid he asked he sent professor mcgonagall to ask you and madame maxime to meet him that night 
 
 got a little job fer me over the summer said hagrid secret though not ter talk abou it no not even ter you lot olympe madame maxime ter you might be comin with me i think she will think i got her persuaded

 hagrid flinched at the sound of the name 
 
 migh be he said evasively like ter come an visit the las skrewt with me i was jokin jokin he added hastily seeing the looks on their faces 
 
 
 
 it was with a heavy heart that harry packed his trunk up in the dormitory on the night before his return to privet drive he was dreading the leaving feast which was usually a cause for celebration when the winner of the championship would be announced he had avoided being in the great hall when it was full ever since he had left the hospital wing preferring to eat when it was nearly empty to avoid the stares of his fellow students 
 
 when he ron and hermione entered the hall they saw at once that the usual decorations were missing the great hall was normally decorated with the winning colors for the leaving feast tonight however there were black drapes on the wall behind the teachers table harry knew instantly that they were there as a mark of respect to cedric 
 
 the real moody was at the staff table now his wooden leg and his magical eye back in place he was extremely twitchy jumping every time someone spoke to him harry blame him fear of attack was bound to have been increased by his imprisonment in his own trunk professor chair was empty harry wondered as he sat down with the other gryffindors where karkaroff was now and whether voldemort had caught up with him 
 
 madame maxime was still there she was sitting next to hagrid they were talking quietly together further along the table sitting next to professor mcgonagall was snape his eyes lingered on harry for a moment as harry looked at him his expression was difficult to read he looked as sour and unpleasant as ever harry continued to watch him long after snape had looked away 
 
 what was it that snape had done on dumbledores orders the night that voldemort had returned and whywhywas dumbledore so convinced that snape was truly on their side he had been their spy dumbledore had said so in the pensieve snape had turned spy against voldemort at great personal risk was that the job he had taken up again had he made contact with the death eaters perhaps pretended that he had never really gone over to dumbledore that he had been like voldemort himself biding his time 
 
 musings were ended by professor dumbledore who stood up at the staff table the great hall which in any case had been less noisy than it usually was at the leaving feast became very quiet 
 
 the end said dumbledore looking around at them all of another year 
 
 he paused and his eyes fell upon the hufflepuff table theirs had been the most subdued table before he had gotten to his feet and theirs were still the saddest and palest faces in the hall 
 
 there is much that i would like to say to you all tonight said dumbledore but i must first acknowledge the loss of a very fine person who should be sitting here he gestured toward the hufflepuffs enjoying our feast with us i would like you all please to stand and raise your glasses to cedric diggory 
 
 they did it all of them the benches scraped as everyone in the hall stood and raised their goblets and echoed in one loud low rumbling voice cedric diggory 
 
 harry caught a glimpse of cho through the crowd there were tears pouring silently down her face he looked down at the table as they all sat down again 
 
 cedric was a person who exemplified many of the qualities that distinguish hufflepuff house dumbledore continued he was a good and loyal friend a hard worker he valued fair play his death has affected you all whether you knew him well or not i think that you have the right therefore to know exactly how it came about 
 
 harry raised his head and stared at dumbledore 
 
 cedric diggory was murdered by lord voldemort 
 
 a panicked whisper swept the great hall people were staring at dumbledore in disbelief in horror he looked perfectly calm as he watched them mutter themselves into silence 
 
 the ministry of magic dumbledore continued does not wish me to tell you this it is possible that some of your parents will be horrified that i have done so either because they will not believe that lord voldemort has returned or because they think i should not tell you so young as you are it is my belief however that the truth is generally preferable to lies and that any attempt to pretend that cedric died as the result of an accident or some sort of blunder of his own is an insult to his memory 
 
 stunned and frightened every face in the hall was turned toward dumbledore nowor almost every face over at the slytherin table harry saw draco malfoy muttering something to crabbe and goyle harry felt a hot sick swoop of anger in his stomach he forced himself to look back at dumbledore 
 
 there is somebody else who must be mentioned in connection with death dumbledore went on i am talking of course about harry potter 
 
 a kind of ripple crossed the great hall as a few heads turned in direction before flicking back to face dumbledore 
 
 harry potter managed to escape lord voldemort said dumbledore he risked his own life to return body to hogwarts he showed in every respect the sort of bravery that few wizards have ever shown in facing lord voldemort and for this i honor him 
 
 dumbledore turned gravely to harry and raised his goblet once more nearly everyone in the great hall followed suit they murmured his name as they had murmured and drank to him but through a gap in the standing figures harry saw that malfoy crabbe goyle and many of the other slytherins had remained defiantly in their seats their goblets untouched dumbledore who after all possessed no magical eye did not see them 
 
 when everyone had once again resumed their seats dumbledore continued the triwizard aim was to further and promote magical understanding in the light of what has happened of lord return such ties are more important than ever before 
 
 dumbledore looked from madame maxime and hagrid to fleur delacour and her fellow beauxbatons students to viktor krum and the durmstrangs at the slytherin table krum harry saw looked wary almost frightened as though he expected dumbledore to say something harsh 
 
 every guest in this hall said dumbledore and his eyes lingered upon the durmstrang students will be welcomed back here at any time should they wish to come i say to you all once again in the light of lord return we are only as strong as we are united as weak as we are divided lord gift for spreading discord and enmity is very great we can fight it only by showing an equally strong bond of friendship and trust differences of habit and language are nothing at all if our aims are identical and our hearts are open 
 
 it is my belief and never have i so hoped that i am mistaken that we are all facing dark and difficult times some of you in this hall have already suffered directly at the hands of lord voldemort many of your families have been torn asunder a week ago a student was taken from our midst 
 
 remember cedric remember if the time should come when you have to make a choice between what is right and what is easy remember what happened to a boy who was good and kind and brave because he strayed across the path of lord voldemort remember cedric diggory 
 
 
 
 trunk was packed hedwig was back in her cage on top of it he ron and hermione were waiting in the crowded entrance hall with the rest of the fourth years for the carriages that would take them back to hogsmeade station it was another beautiful day he supposed that privet drive would be hot and leafy its flower beds a riot of color when he arrived there that evening the thought gave him no pleasure at all 
 
 arry 
 
 he looked around fleur delacour was hurrying up the stone steps into the castle beyond her far across the grounds harry could see hagrid helping madame maxime to back two of the giant horses into their harness the beauxbatons carriage was about to take off 
 
 we will see each uzzer again i ope said fleur as she reached him holding out her hand i am oping to get a job ere to improve my eenglish 
 
 very good already said ron in a strangled sort of voice fleur smiled at him hermione scowled 
 
 arry said fleur turning to go it az been a pleasure meeting you 
 
 spirits help but lift slightly as he watched fleur hurry back across the lawns to madame maxime her silvery hair rippling in the sunlight 
 
 wonder how the durmstrang students are getting back said ron d you reckon they can steer that ship without karkaroff 
 
 karkaroff did not steer said a gruff voice he stayed in his cabin and let us do the vork 
 
 krum had come to say to hermione could i have a vord he asked her 
 
 ohyesall right said hermione looking slightly flustered and following krum through the crowd and out of sight 
 
 better hurry up ron called loudly after her the be here in a minute 
 
 he let harry keep a watch for the carriages however and spent the next few minutes craning his neck over the crowd to try and see what krum and hermione might be up to they returned quite soon ron stared at hermione but her face was quite impassive 
 
 i liked diggory said krum abruptly to harry he vos alvays polite to me alvays even though i vos from durmstrang with karkaroff he added scowling 
 
 have you got a new headmaster yet said harry 
 
 krum shrugged he held out his hand as fleur had done shook hand and then ron looked as though he was suffering some sort of painful internal struggle krum had already started walking away when ron burst out can i have your autograph 
 
 hermione turned away smiling at the horseless carriages that were now trundling toward them up the drive as krum looking surprised but gratified signed a fragment of parchment for ron 
 
 
 
 the weather could not have been more different on the journey back to cross than it had been on their way to hogwarts the previous september there a single cloud in the sky harry ron and hermione had managed to get a compartment to themselves pigwidgeon was once again hidden under dress robes to stop him from hooting continually hedwig was dozing her head under her wing and crookshanks was curled up in a spare seat like a large furry ginger cushion harry ron and hermione talked more fully and freely than they had all week as the train sped them southward harry felt as though speech at the leaving feast had unblocked him somehow it was less painful to discuss what had happened now they broke off their conversation about what action dumbledore might be taking even now to stop voldemort only when the lunch trolley arrived 
 
 when hermione returned from the trolley and put her money back into her schoolbag she dislodged a copy of the daily prophet that she had been carrying in there harry looked at it unsure whether he really wanted to know what it might say but hermione seeing him looking at it said calmly nothing in there you can look for yourself but nothing at all been checking every day just a small piece the day after the third task saying you won the tournament they even mention cedric nothing about any of it if you ask me fudge is forcing them to keep quiet 
 
 never keep rita quiet said harry not on a story like this 
 
 oh rita written anything at all since the third task said hermione in an oddly constrained voice as a matter of fact she added her voice now trembling slightly rita skeeter going to be writing anything at all for a while not unless she wants me to spill the beans on her 
 
 what are you talking about said ron 
 
 i found out how she was listening in on private conversations when she supposed to be coming onto the grounds said hermione in a rush 
 
 harry had the impression that hermione had been dying to tell them this for days but that she had restrained herself in light of everything else that had happened 
 
 how was she doing it said harry at once 
 
 how did you find out said ron staring at her 
 
 well it was you really who gave me the idea harry she said 
 
 did i said harry perplexed how 
 
 bugging said hermione happily 
 
 but you said they work 
 
 oh not electronic bugs said hermione no you seerita skeeter voice trembled with quiet triumph is an unregistered animagus she can turn 
 
 hermione pulled a small sealed glass jar out other bag 
 
 into a beetle 
 
 kidding said ron you not 
 
 oh yes she is said hermione happily brandishing the jar at them 
 
 inside were a few twigs and leaves and one large fat beetle 
 
 never kidding ron whispered lifting the jar to his eyes 
 
 no not said hermione beaming i caught her on the windowsill in the hospital wing look very closely and notice the markings around her antennae are exactly like those foul glasses she wears 
 
 harry looked and saw that she was quite right he also remembered something 
 
 there was a beetle on the statue the night we heard hagrid telling madame maxime about his mum 
 
 exactly said hermione and viktor pulled a beetle out of my hair after had our conversation by the lake and unless very much mistaken rita was perched on the windowsill of the divination class the day your scar hurt been buzzing around for stories all year 
 
 when we saw malfoy under that tree said ron slowly 
 
 he was talking to her in his hand said hermione he knew of course how been getting all those nice little interviews with the slytherins they care that she was doing something illegal as long as they were giving her horrible stuff about us and hagrid 
 
 hermione took the glass jar back from ron and smiled at the beetle which buzzed angrily against the glass 
 
 told her let her out when we get back to london said hermione put an unbreakable charm on the jar you see so she transform and told her to keep her quill to herself for a whole year see if she break the habit of writing horrible lies about people 
 
 smiling serenely hermione placed the beetle back inside her schoolbag 
 
 the door of the compartment slid open 
 
 very clever granger said draco malfoy 
 
 crabbe and goyle were standing behind him all three of them looked more pleased with themselves more arrogant and more menacing than harry had ever seen them 
 
 so said malfoy slowly advancing slightly into the compartment and looking slowly around at them a smirk quivering on his lips you caught some pathetic reporter and favorite boy again big deal 
 
 his smirk widened crabbe and goyle leered 
 
 trying not to think about it are we said malfoy softly looking around at all three of them trying to pretend it happened 
 
 get out said harry 
 
 he had not been this close to malfoy since he had watched him muttering to crabbe and goyle during dumbledores speech about cedric he could feel a kind of ringing in his ears his hand gripped his wand under his robes 
 
 picked the losing side potter i warned you i told you you ought to choose your company more carefully remember when we met on the train first day at hogwarts i told you not to hang around with riffraff like this he jerked his head at ron and hermione too late now potter be the first to go now the dark back mudbloods and first well second diggory was the f 
 
 it was as though someone had exploded a box of fireworks within the compartment blinded by the blaze of the spells that had blasted from every direction deafened by a series of bangs harry blinked and looked down at the floor 
 
 malfoy crabbe and goyle were all lying unconscious in the doorway he ron and hermione were on their feet all three of them having used a different hex nor were they the only ones to have done so 
 
 thought see what those three were up to said fred stepping onto goyle and into the compartment he had his wand out and so did george who was careful to tread on malfoy as he followed fred inside 
 
 interesting effect said george looking down at crabbe who used the furnunculus curse 
 
 me said harry 
 
 odd said george lightly i used looks as though those two be mixed he seems to have sprouted little tentacles all over his face well not leave them here they add much to the decor 
 
 ron harry and george kicked rolled and pushed the unconscious malfoy crabbe and goyle each of whom looked distinctly the worse for the jumble of jinxes with which they had been hit out into the corridor then came back into the compartment and rolled the door shut 
 
 exploding snap anyone said fred pulling out a pack of cards 
 
 they were halfway through their fifth game when harry decided to ask them 
 
 you going to tell us then he said to george who you were blackmailing 
 
 oh said george darkly that 
 
 it matter said fred shaking his head impatiently it anything important not now anyway 
 
 given up said george shrugging 
 
 but harry ron and hermione kept on asking and finally fred said all right all right if you really want to knowit was ludo bagman 
 
 bagman said harry sharply are you saying he was involved in 
 
 nah said george gloomily nothing like that stupid git he have the brains 
 
 well what then said ron 
 
 fred hesitated then said you remember that bet we had with him at the quidditch world cup about how ireland would win but krum would get the snitch 
 
 yeah said harry and ron slowly 
 
 well the git paid us in leprechaun gold caught from the irish mascots 
 
 so 
 
 so said fred impatiently it vanished it by next morning it had gone 
 
 but it been an accident it said hermione 
 
 george laughed very bitterly 
 
 yeah what we thought at first we thought if we just wrote to him and told him made a mistake cough up but nothing doing ignored our letter we kept trying to talk to him about it at hogwarts but he was always making some excuse to get away from us 
 
 in the end he turned pretty nasty said fred told us we were too young to gamble and he giving us anything 
 
 so we asked for our money back said george glowering 
 
 he refuse gasped hermione 
 
 right in one said fred 
 
 but that was all your savings said ron 
 
 tell me about it said george course we found out what was going on in the end lee dad had had a bit of trouble getting money off bagman as well turns out in big trouble with the goblins borrowed loads of gold off them a gang of them cornered him in the woods after the world cup and took all the gold he had and it still enough to cover all his debts they followed him all the way to hogwarts to keep an eye on him lost everything gambling got two galleons to rub together and you know how the idiot tried to pay the goblins back 
 
 how said harry 
 
 he put a bet on you mate said fred put a big bet on you to win the tournament bet against the goblins 
 
 so why he kept trying to help me win said harry well i did win i so he can pay you your gold 
 
 nope said george shaking his head the goblins play as dirty as him they say you drew with diggory and bagman was betting win outright so bagman had to run for it he did run for it right after the third task 
 
 george sighed deeply and started dealing out the cards again 
 
 the rest of the journey passed pleasantly enough harry wished it could have gone on all summer in fact and that he would never arrive at crossbut as he had learned the hard way that year time will not slow down when something unpleasant lies ahead and all too soon the hogwarts express was pulling in at platform nine and the usual confusion and noise filled the corridors as the students began to disembark ron and hermione struggled out past malfoy crabbe and goyle carrying their trunks harry however stayed put 
 
 fred george wait a moment 
 
 the twins turned harry pulled open his trunk and drew out his triwizard winnings 
 
 take it he said and he thrust the sack into hands 
 
 what said fred looking flabbergasted 
 
 take it harry repeated firmly i want it 
 
 mental said george trying to push it back at harry 
 
 no not said harry you take it and get inventing for the joke shop 
 
 he is mental fred said in an almost awed voice 
 
 listen said harry firmly if you take it throwing it down the drain i want it and i need it but i could do with a few laughs we could all do with a few laughs got a feeling going to need them more than usual before long 
 
 harry said george weakly weighing the money bag in his hands got to be a thousand galleons in here 
 
 yeah said harry grinning think how many canary creams that is 
 
 the twins stared at him 
 
 just tell your mum where you got italthough she might not be so keen for you to join the ministry anymore come to think of it 
 
 harry fred began but harry pulled out his wand 
 
 look he said flatly take it or hex you i know some good ones now just do me one favor okay buy ron some different dress robes and say from you 
 
 he left the compartment before they could say another word stepping over malfoy crabbe and goyle who were still lying on the floor covered in hex marks 
 
 uncle vernon was waiting beyond the barrier mrs weasley was close by him she hugged harry very tightly when she saw him and whispered in his ear i think dumbledore will let you come to us later in the summer keep in touch harry 
 
 see you harry said ron clapping him on the back 
 
 bye harry said hermione and she did something she had never done before and kissed him on the cheek 
 
 harry thanks george muttered while fred nodded fervently at his side 
 
 harry winked at them turned to uncle vernon and followed him silently from the station there was no point worrying yet he told himself as he got into the back of the dursleys car 
 
 as hagrid had said what would come would comeand he would have to meet it when it did 
 
 rowling

 the goblet of fire

 when he looked back even a month later harry found he had only scattered memories of the next few days it was as though he had been through too much to take in any more the recollections he did have were very painful the worst perhaps was the meeting with the that took place the following morning 
 
 they did not blame him for what had happened on the contrary both thanked him for returning body to them mr diggory sobbed through most of the interview mrs grief seemed to be beyond tears

 oh no yours dear i keep it 
 
 
 
 harry returned to gryffindor tower the following evening from what hermione and ron told him dumbledore had spoken to the school that morning at breakfast he had merely requested that they leave harry alone that nobody ask him questions or badger him to tell the story of what had happened in the maze most people he noticed were skirting him in the corridors avoiding his eyes some whispered behind their hands as he passed he guessed that many of them had believed rita article about how disturbed and possibly dangerous he was perhaps they were formulating their own theories about how cedric had died he found he care very much he liked it best when he was with ron and hermione and they were talking about other things or else letting him sit in silence while they played chess he felt as though all three of them had reached an understanding they need to put into words that each was waiting for some sign some word of what was going on outside hogwarts and that it was useless to speculate about what might be coming until they knew anything for certain the only time they touched upon the subject was when ron told harry about a meeting mrs weasley had had with dumbledore before going home 
 
 she went to ask him if you could come straight to us this summer he said but he wants you to go back to the dursleys at least at first 
 
 why said harry 
 
 she said got his reasons said ron shaking his head darkly i suppose got to trust him we 
 
 the only person apart from ron and hermione that harry felt able to talk to was hagrid as there was no longer a defense against the dark arts teacher they had those lessons free they used the one on thursday afternoon to go down and visit hagrid in his cabin it was a bright and sunny day fang bounded out of the open door as they approached barking and wagging his tail madly 
 
 that called hagrid coming to the door harry 
 
 he strode out to meet them pulled harry into a hug ruffled his hair and said good ter see yeh mate good ter see yeh 
 
 they saw two cups and saucers on the wooden table in front of the fireplace when they entered cabin 
 
 bin havin a cuppa with olympe hagrid said jus left 
 
 who said ron curiously 
 
 madame maxime o course said hagrid 
 
 you two made up have you said ron 
 
 dunno what talkin about said hagrid airily fetching more cups from the dresser when he had made tea and offered around a plate of doughy cookies he leaned back in his chair and surveyed harry closely through his eyes 
 
 you all righ he said gruffly 
 
 yeah said harry 
 
 no not said hagrid course not but yeh will be 
 
 harry said nothing

 hagrid raised his bushy eyebrows at the disbelieving expressions on their faces 
 
 no good sittin worryin abou it he said comin will come an meet it when it does dumbledore told me wha you did harry 
 
 chest swelled as he looked at harry 
 
 yeh did as much as yer father done an i can give yeh no higher praise than that 
 
 harry smiled back at him it was the first time smiled in days dumbledore asked you to do hagrid he asked he sent professor mcgonagall to ask you and madame maxime to meet him that night

 hagrid flinched at the sound of the name 
 
 migh be he said evasively like ter come an visit the las skrewt with me i was jokin jokin he added hastily seeing the looks on their faces 
 
 
 
 it was with a heavy heart that harry packed his trunk up in the dormitory on the night before his return to privet drive he was dreading the leaving feast which was usually a cause for celebration when the winner of the championship would be announced he had avoided being in the great hall when it was full ever since he had left the hospital wing preferring to eat when it was nearly empty to avoid the stares of his fellow students 
 
 when he ron and hermione entered the hall they saw at once that the usual decorations were missing the great hall was normally decorated with the winning colors for the leaving feast tonight however there were black drapes on the wall behind the teachers table harry knew instantly that they were there as a mark of respect to cedric 
 
 the real moody was at the staff table now his wooden leg and his magical eye back in place he was extremely twitchy jumping every time someone spoke to him harry blame him fear of attack was bound to have been increased by his imprisonment in his own trunk professor chair was empty harry wondered as he sat down with the other gryffindors where karkaroff was now and whether voldemort had caught up with him 
 
 madame maxime was still there she was sitting next to hagrid they were talking quietly together further along the table sitting next to professor mcgonagall was snape his eyes lingered on harry for a moment as harry looked at him his expression was difficult to read he looked as sour and unpleasant as ever harry continued to watch him long after snape had looked away 
 
 what was it that snape had done on dumbledores orders the night that voldemort had returned and whywhywas dumbledore so convinced that snape was truly on their side he had been their spy dumbledore had said so in the pensieve snape had turned spy against voldemort at great personal risk was that the job he had taken up again had he made contact with the death eaters perhaps pretended that he had never really gone over to dumbledore that he had been like voldemort himself biding his time 
 
 musings were ended by professor dumbledore who stood up at the staff table the great hall which in any case had been less noisy than it usually was at the leaving feast became very quiet 
 
 the end said dumbledore looking around at them all of another year 
 
 he paused and his eyes fell upon the hufflepuff table theirs had been the most subdued table before he had gotten to his feet and theirs were still the saddest and palest faces in the hall 
 
 there is much that i would like to say to you all tonight said dumbledore but i must first acknowledge the loss of a very fine person who should be sitting here he gestured toward the hufflepuffs enjoying our feast with us i would like you all please to stand and raise your glasses to cedric diggory 
 
 they did it all of them the benches scraped as everyone in the hall stood and raised their goblets and echoed in one loud low rumbling voice cedric diggory 
 
 harry caught a glimpse of cho through the crowd there were tears pouring silently down her face he looked down at the table as they all sat down again 
 
 cedric was a person who exemplified many of the qualities that distinguish hufflepuff house dumbledore continued he was a good and loyal friend a hard worker he valued fair play his death has affected you all whether you knew him well or not i think that you have the right therefore to know exactly how it came about 
 
 harry raised his head and stared at dumbledore 
 
 cedric diggory was murdered by lord voldemort 
 
 a panicked whisper swept the great hall people were staring at dumbledore in disbelief in horror he looked perfectly calm as he watched them mutter themselves into silence 
 
 the ministry of magic dumbledore continued does not wish me to tell you this it is possible that some of your parents will be horrified that i have done so either because they will not believe that lord voldemort has returned or because they think i should not tell you so young as you are it is my belief however that the truth is generally preferable to lies and that any attempt to pretend that cedric died as the result of an accident or some sort of blunder of his own is an insult to his memory 
 
 stunned and frightened every face in the hall was turned toward dumbledore nowor almost every face over at the slytherin table harry saw draco malfoy muttering something to crabbe and goyle harry felt a hot sick swoop of anger in his stomach he forced himself to look back at dumbledore 
 
 there is somebody else who must be mentioned in connection with death dumbledore went on i am talking of course about harry potter 
 
 a kind of ripple crossed the great hall as a few heads turned in direction before flicking back to face dumbledore 
 
 harry potter managed to escape lord voldemort said dumbledore he risked his own life to return body to hogwarts he showed in every respect the sort of bravery that few wizards have ever shown in facing lord voldemort and for this i honor him 
 
 dumbledore turned gravely to harry and raised his goblet once more nearly everyone in the great hall followed suit they murmured his name as they had murmured and drank to him but through a gap in the standing figures harry saw that malfoy crabbe goyle and many of the other slytherins had remained defiantly in their seats their goblets untouched dumbledore who after all possessed no magical eye did not see them 
 
 when everyone had once again resumed their seats dumbledore continued the triwizard aim was to further and promote magical understanding in the light of what has happened of lord return such ties are more important than ever before 
 
 dumbledore looked from madame maxime and hagrid to fleur delacour and her fellow beauxbatons students to viktor krum and the durmstrangs at the slytherin table krum harry saw looked wary almost frightened as though he expected dumbledore to say something harsh 
 
 every guest in this hall said dumbledore and his eyes lingered upon the durmstrang students will be welcomed back here at any time should they wish to come i say to you all once again in the light of lord return we are only as strong as we are united as weak as we are divided lord gift for spreading discord and enmity is very great we can fight it only by showing an equally strong bond of friendship and trust differences of habit and language are nothing at all if our aims are identical and our hearts are open 
 
 it is my belief and never have i so hoped that i am mistaken that we are all facing dark and difficult times some of you in this hall have already suffered directly at the hands of lord voldemort many of your families have been torn asunder a week ago a student was taken from our midst 
 
 remember cedric remember if the time should come when you have to make a choice between what is right and what is easy remember what happened to a boy who was good and kind and brave because he strayed across the path of lord voldemort remember cedric diggory 
 
 
 
 trunk was packed hedwig was back in her cage on top of it he ron and hermione were waiting in the crowded entrance hall with the rest of the fourth years for the carriages that would take them back to hogsmeade station it was another beautiful day he supposed that privet drive would be hot and leafy its flower beds a riot of color when he arrived there that evening the thought gave him no pleasure at all 
 
 arry 
 
 he looked around fleur delacour was hurrying up the stone steps into the castle beyond her far across the grounds harry could see hagrid helping madame maxime to back two of the giant horses into their harness the beauxbatons carriage was about to take off 
 
 we will see each uzzer again i ope said fleur as she reached him holding out her hand i am oping to get a job ere to improve my eenglish 
 
 very good already said ron in a strangled sort of voice fleur smiled at him hermione scowled 
 
 arry said fleur turning to go it az been a pleasure meeting you 
 
 spirits help but lift slightly as he watched fleur hurry back across the lawns to madame maxime her silvery hair rippling in the sunlight 
 
 wonder how the durmstrang students are getting back said ron d you reckon they can steer that ship without karkaroff 
 
 karkaroff did not steer said a gruff voice he stayed in his cabin and let us do the vork 
 
 krum had come to say to hermione could i have a vord he asked her 
 
 ohyesall right said hermione looking slightly flustered and following krum through the crowd and out of sight 
 
 better hurry up ron called loudly after her the be here in a minute 
 
 he let harry keep a watch for the carriages however and spent the next few minutes craning his neck over the crowd to try and see what krum and hermione might be up to they returned quite soon ron stared at hermione but her face was quite impassive 
 
 i liked diggory said krum abruptly to harry he vos alvays polite to me alvays even though i vos from durmstrang with karkaroff he added scowling 
 
 have you got a new headmaster yet said harry 
 
 krum shrugged he held out his hand as fleur had done shook hand and then ron looked as though he was suffering some sort of painful internal struggle krum had already started walking away when ron burst out can i have your autograph 
 
 hermione turned away smiling at the horseless carriages that were now trundling toward them up the drive as krum looking surprised but gratified signed a fragment of parchment for ron 
 
 
 
 the weather could not have been more different on the journey back to cross than it had been on their way to hogwarts the previous september there a single cloud in the sky harry ron and hermione had managed to get a compartment to themselves pigwidgeon was once again hidden under dress robes to stop him from hooting continually hedwig was dozing her head under her wing and crookshanks was curled up in a spare seat like a large furry ginger cushion harry ron and hermione talked more fully and freely than they had all week as the train sped them southward harry felt as though speech at the leaving feast had unblocked him somehow it was less painful to discuss what had happened now they broke off their conversation about what action dumbledore might be taking even now to stop voldemort only when the lunch trolley arrived 
 
 when hermione returned from the trolley and put her money back into her schoolbag she dislodged a copy of the daily prophet that she had been carrying in there harry looked at it unsure whether he really wanted to know what it might say but hermione seeing him looking at it said calmly nothing in there you can look for yourself but nothing at all been checking every day just a small piece the day after the third task saying you won the tournament they even mention cedric nothing about any of it if you ask me fudge is forcing them to keep quiet 
 
 never keep rita quiet said harry not on a story like this 
 
 oh rita written anything at all since the third task said hermione in an oddly constrained voice as a matter of fact she added her voice now trembling slightly rita skeeter going to be writing anything at all for a while not unless she wants me to spill the beans on her 
 
 what are you talking about said ron 
 
 i found out how she was listening in on private conversations when she supposed to be coming onto the grounds said hermione in a rush 
 
 harry had the impression that hermione had been dying to tell them this for days but that she had restrained herself in light of everything else that had happened 
 
 how was she doing it said harry at once 
 
 how did you find out said ron staring at her 
 
 well it was you really who gave me the idea harry she said 
 
 did i said harry perplexed how 
 
 bugging said hermione happily 
 
 but you said they work 
 
 oh not electronic bugs said hermione no you seerita skeeter voice trembled with quiet triumph is an unregistered animagus she can turn 
 
 hermione pulled a small sealed glass jar out other bag 
 
 into a beetle 
 
 kidding said ron you not 
 
 oh yes she is said hermione happily brandishing the jar at them 
 
 inside were a few twigs and leaves and one large fat beetle 
 
 never kidding ron whispered lifting the jar to his eyes 
 
 no not said hermione beaming i caught her on the windowsill in the hospital wing look very closely and notice the markings around her antennae are exactly like those foul glasses she wears 
 
 harry looked and saw that she was quite right he also remembered something 
 
 there was a beetle on the statue the night we heard hagrid telling madame maxime about his mum 
 
 exactly said hermione and viktor pulled a beetle out of my hair after had our conversation by the lake and unless very much mistaken rita was perched on the windowsill of the divination class the day your scar hurt been buzzing around for stories all year 
 
 when we saw malfoy under that tree said ron slowly 
 
 he was talking to her in his hand said hermione he knew of course how been getting all those nice little interviews with the slytherins they care that she was doing something illegal as long as they were giving her horrible stuff about us and hagrid 
 
 hermione took the glass jar back from ron and smiled at the beetle which buzzed angrily against the glass 
 
 told her let her out when we get back to london said hermione put an unbreakable charm on the jar you see so she transform and told her to keep her quill to herself for a whole year see if she break the habit of writing horrible lies about people 
 
 smiling serenely hermione placed the beetle back inside her schoolbag 
 
 the door of the compartment slid open 
 
 very clever granger said draco malfoy 
 
 crabbe and goyle were standing behind him all three of them looked more pleased with themselves more arrogant and more menacing than harry had ever seen them 
 
 so said malfoy slowly advancing slightly into the compartment and looking slowly around at them a smirk quivering on his lips you caught some pathetic reporter and favorite boy again big deal 
 
 his smirk widened crabbe and goyle leered 
 
 trying not to think about it are we said malfoy softly looking around at all three of them trying to pretend it happened 
 
 get out said harry 
 
 he had not been this close to malfoy since he had watched him muttering to crabbe and goyle during dumbledores speech about cedric he could feel a kind of ringing in his ears his hand gripped his wand under his robes 
 
 picked the losing side potter i warned you i told you you ought to choose your company more carefully remember when we met on the train first day at hogwarts i told you not to hang around with riffraff like this he jerked his head at ron and hermione too late now potter be the first to go now the dark back mudbloods and first well second diggory was the f 
 
 it was as though someone had exploded a box of fireworks within the compartment blinded by the blaze of the spells that had blasted from every direction deafened by a series of bangs harry blinked and looked down at the floor 
 
 malfoy crabbe and goyle were all lying unconscious in the doorway he ron and hermione were on their feet all three of them having used a different hex nor were they the only ones to have done so 
 
 thought see what those three were up to said fred stepping onto goyle and into the compartment he had his wand out and so did george who was careful to tread on malfoy as he followed fred inside 
 
 interesting effect said george looking down at crabbe who used the furnunculus curse 
 
 me said harry 
 
 odd said george lightly i used looks as though those two be mixed he seems to have sprouted little tentacles all over his face well not leave them here they add much to the decor 
 
 ron harry and george kicked rolled and pushed the unconscious malfoy crabbe and goyle each of whom looked distinctly the worse for the jumble of jinxes with which they had been hit out into the corridor then came back into the compartment and rolled the door shut 
 
 exploding snap anyone said fred pulling out a pack of cards 
 
 they were halfway through their fifth game when harry decided to ask them 
 
 you going to tell us then he said to george who you were blackmailing 
 
 oh said george darkly that 
 
 it matter said fred shaking his head impatiently it anything important not now anyway 
 
 given up said george shrugging 
 
 but harry ron and hermione kept on asking and finally fred said all right all right if you really want to knowit was ludo bagman 
 
 bagman said harry sharply are you saying he was involved in 
 
 nah said george gloomily nothing like that stupid git he have the brains 
 
 well what then said ron 
 
 fred hesitated then said you remember that bet we had with him at the quidditch world cup about how ireland would win but krum would get the snitch 
 
 yeah said harry and ron slowly 
 
 well the git paid us in leprechaun gold caught from the irish mascots 
 
 so 
 
 so said fred impatiently it vanished it by next morning it had gone 
 
 but it been an accident it said hermione 
 
 george laughed very bitterly 
 
 yeah what we thought at first we thought if we just wrote to him and told him made a mistake cough up but nothing doing ignored our letter we kept trying to talk to him about it at hogwarts but he was always making some excuse to get away from us 
 
 in the end he turned pretty nasty said fred told us we were too young to gamble and he giving us anything 
 
 so we asked for our money back said george glowering 
 
 he refuse gasped hermione 
 
 right in one said fred 
 
 but that was all your savings said ron 
 
 tell me about it said george course we found out what was going on in the end lee dad had had a bit of trouble getting money off bagman as well turns out in big trouble with the goblins borrowed loads of gold off them a gang of them cornered him in the woods after the world cup and took all the gold he had and it still enough to cover all his debts they followed him all the way to hogwarts to keep an eye on him lost everything gambling got two galleons to rub together and you know how the idiot tried to pay the goblins back 
 
 how said harry 
 
 he put a bet on you mate said fred put a big bet on you to win the tournament bet against the goblins 
 
 so why he kept trying to help me win said harry well i did win i so he can pay you your gold 
 
 nope said george shaking his head the goblins play as dirty as him they say you drew with diggory and bagman was betting win outright so bagman had to run for it he did run for it right after the third task 
 
 george sighed deeply and started dealing out the cards again 
 
 the rest of the journey passed pleasantly enough harry wished it could have gone on all summer in fact and that he would never arrive at crossbut as he had learned the hard way that year time will not slow down when something unpleasant lies ahead and all too soon the hogwarts express was pulling in at platform nine and the usual confusion and noise filled the corridors as the students began to disembark ron and hermione struggled out past malfoy crabbe and goyle carrying their trunks harry however stayed put 
 
 fred george wait a moment 
 
 the twins turned harry pulled open his trunk and drew out his triwizard winnings 
 
 take it he said and he thrust the sack into hands 
 
 what said fred looking flabbergasted 
 
 take it harry repeated firmly i want it 
 
 mental said george trying to push it back at harry 
 
 no not said harry you take it and get inventing for the joke shop 
 
 he is mental fred said in an almost awed voice 
 
 listen said harry firmly if you take it throwing it down the drain i want it and i need it but i could do with a few laughs we could all do with a few laughs got a feeling going to need them more than usual before long 
 
 harry said george weakly weighing the money bag in his hands got to be a thousand galleons in here 
 
 yeah said harry grinning think how many canary creams that is 
 
 the twins stared at him 
 
 just tell your mum where you got italthough she might not be so keen for you to join the ministry anymore come to think of it 
 
 harry fred began but harry pulled out his wand 
 
 look he said flatly take it or hex you i know some good ones now just do me one favor okay buy ron some different dress robes and say from you 
 
 he left the compartment before they could say another word stepping over malfoy crabbe and goyle who were still lying on the floor covered in hex marks 
 
 uncle vernon was waiting beyond the barrier mrs weasley was close by him she hugged harry very tightly when she saw him and whispered in his ear i think dumbledore will let you come to us later in the summer keep in touch harry 
 
 see you harry said ron clapping him on the back 
 
 bye harry said hermione and she did something she had never done before and kissed him on the cheek 
 
 harry thanks george muttered while fred nodded fervently at his side 
 
 harry winked at them turned to uncle vernon and followed him silently from the station there was no point worrying yet he told himself as he got into the back of the dursleys car 
 
 as hagrid had said what would come would comeand he would have to meet it when it did 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the goblet of fire 
 

lionfish nov chapter the lost prophecycontents prev chapter next chapter 
 feet hit solid ground his knees buckled a little and the golden head fell with a resounding clunk to the floor he looked around and saw that he had arrived in office 
 
 everything seemed to have repaired itself during the headmasters absence the delicate silver instruments stood once more on the tables puffing and whirring serenely the portraits of the headmasters and headmistresses were snoozing in their frames heads lolling back in armchairs or against the edge of the picture harry looked through the window there was a cool line of pale green along the horizon dawn was approaching 
 
 the silence and the stillness broken only by the occasional grunt or snuffle of a sleeping portrait was unbearable to him if his surroundings could have reflected the feelings inside him the pictures would have been screaming in pain he walked around the quiet beautiful office breathing quickly trying not to think but he had to think there was no escape 
 
 it was his fault sirius had died it was all his fault if he harry had not been stupid enough to fall for trick if he had not been so convinced that what he had seen in his dream was real if he had only opened his mind to the possibility that voldemort was as hermione had said banking on love of playing the hero 
 
 it was unbearable he would not think about it he could not stand it there was a terrible hollow inside him he did not want to feel or examine a dark hole where sirius had been where sirius had vanished he did not want to have to be alone with that great silent space he could not stand it 
 
 a picture behind him gave a particularly loud grunting snore and a cool voice said ah harry potter 
 
 phineas nigellus gave a long yawn stretching his arms as he surveyed harry out of shrewd narrow eyes 
 
 and what brings you here in the early hours of the morning said phineas eventually this office is supposed to be barred to all but the rightful headmaster or has dumbledore sent you here oh tell me he gave another shuddering yawn another message for my worthless 
 
 harry could not speak phineas nigellus did not know that sirius was dead but harry could not tell him to say it aloud would be to make it final absolute irretrievable 
 
 a few more of the portraits had stirred now terror of being interrogated made harry stride across the room and seize the doorknob 
 
 it would not turn he was shut in 
 
 i hope this means said the corpulent wizard who hung on the wall behind the headmasters desk that dumbledore will soon be back among us 
 
 harry turned the wizard was surveying him with great interest harry nodded he tugged again on the doorknob behind his back but it remained immovable 
 
 oh good said the wizard it has been very dull without him very dull indeed 
 
 he settled himself on the chair on which he had been painted and smiled benignly upon harry 
 
 dumbledore thinks very highly of you as i am sure you know he said comfortably oh yes holds you in great esteem 
 
 the guilt filling the whole of chest like some monstrous weighty parasite now writhed and squirmed harry could not stand this he could not stand being himself any more he had never felt more trapped inside his own head and body never wished so intensely that he could be somebody anybody else 
 
 the empty fireplace burst into emerald green flame making harry leap away from the door staring at the man spinning inside the grate as tall form unfolded itself from the fire the wizards and witches on the surrounding walls jerked awake many of them giving cries of welcome 
 
 thank you said dumbledore softly 
 
 he did not look at harry at first but walked over to the perch beside the door and withdrew from an inside pocket of his robes the tiny ugly featherless fawkes whom he placed gently on the tray of soft ashes beneath the golden post where the fawkes usually stood 
 
 well harry said dumbledore finally turning away from the baby bird you will be pleased to hear that none of your fellow students are going to suffer lasting damage from the events 
 
 harry tried to say good but no sound came out it seemed to him that dumbledore was reminding him of the amount of damage he had caused and although dumbledore was for once looking at him directly and although his expression was kindly rather than accusatory harry could not bear to meet his eyes 
 
 madam pomfrey is patching everybody up said dumbledore nymphadora tonks may need to spend a little time in st mungos but it seems she will make a full recovery 
 
 harry contented himself with nodding at the carpet which was growing lighter as the sky outside grew paler he was sure all the portraits around the room were listening closely to every word dumbledore spoke wondering where dumbledore and harry had been and why there had been injuries 
 
 i know how feeling harry said dumbledore very quietly 
 
 no you said harry and his voice was suddenly loud and strong anger leapt inside him dumbledore knew nothing about his feelings 
 
 you see dumbledore said phineas nigellus slyly never try to understand the students they hate it they would much rather be tragically misunderstood wallow in stew in their own 
 
 enough phineas said dumbledore 
 
 harry turned his back on dumbledore and stared determinedly out of the window he could see the quidditch stadium in the distance sirius had appeared there once disguised as the shaggy black dog so he could watch harry play he had probably come to see whether harry was as good as james had been harry had never asked him 
 
 there is no shame in what you are feeling harry said voice on the contrary the fact that you can feel pain like this is your greatest strength 
 
 harry felt the anger lick his insides blazing in the terrible emptiness filling him with the desire to hurt dumbledore for his calmness and his empty words 
 
 my greatest strength is it said harry his voice shaking as he stared out at the quidditch stadium no longer seeing it you got a clue you know 
 
 what i know asked dumbledore calmly 
 
 it was too much harry turned around shaking with rage 
 
 i want to talk about how i feel all right 
 
 harry suffering like this proves you are still a man this pain is part of being human 
 
 wanttobehuman harry roared and he seized the delicate silver instrument from the table beside him and flung it across the room it shattered into a hundred tiny pieces against the wall several of the pictures let out yells of anger and fright and the portrait of armando dippet said really 
 
 i care harry yelled at them snatching up a lunascope and throwing it into the fireplace had enough seen enough i want out i want it to end i care any more 
 
 he seized the table on which the silver instrument had stood and threw that too it broke apart on the floor and the legs rolled in different directions 
 
 you do care said dumbledore he had not flinched or made a single move to stop harry demolishing his office his expression was calm almost detached you care so much you feel as though you will bleed to death with the pain of it 
 
 harry screamed so loudly that he felt his throat might tear and for a second he wanted to rush at dumbledore and break him too shatter that calm old face shake him hurt him make him feel some tiny part of the horror inside himself 
 
 oh yes you do said dumbledore still more calmly you have now lost your mother your father and the closest thing to a parent you have ever known of course you care 
 
 you know how i feel harry roared youstanding thereyou 
 
 but words were no longer enough smashing things was no more help he wanted to run he wanted to keep running and never look back he wanted to be somewhere he could not see the clear blue eyes staring at him that hatefully calm old face he turned on his heel and ran to the door seized the doorknob again and wrenched at it 
 
 but the door would not open 
 
 harry turned back to dumbledore 
 
 let me out he said he was shaking from head to foot 
 
 no said dumbledore simply 
 
 for a few seconds they stared at each other 
 
 let me out harry said again 
 
 no dumbledore repeated 
 
 if you if you keep me in hereif you let me 
 
 by all means continue destroying my possessions said dumbledore serenely i daresay i have too many 
 
 he walked around his desk and sat down behind it watching harry 
 
 let me out harry said yet again in a voice that was cold and almost as calm as 
 
 not until i have had my say said dumbledore 
 
 do youdo you think i want todo you think i give ai care what got to say harry roared i want to hear anything got to say 
 
 you will said dumbledore steadily because you are not nearly as angry with me as you ought to be if you are to attack me as i know you are close to doing i would like to have thoroughly earned it 
 
 what are you talking 
 
 it is my fault that sirius died said dumbledore clearly or should i say almost entirely my faulti will not be so arrogant as to claim responsibility for the whole sirius was a brave clever and energetic man and such men are not usually content to sit at home in hiding while they believe others to be in danger nevertheless you should never have believed for an instant that there was any necessity for you to go to the department of mysteries tonight if i had been open with you harry as i should have been you would have known a long time ago that voldemort might try and lure you to the department of mysteries and you would never have been tricked into going there tonight and sirius would not have had to come after you that blame lies with me and with me alone 
 
 harry was still standing with his hand on the doorknob but was unaware of it he was gazing at dumbledore hardly breathing listening yet barely understanding what he was hearing 
 
 please sit down said dumbledore it was not an order it was a request 
 
 harry hesitated then walked slowly across the room now littered with silver cogs and fragments of wood and took the seat facing desk 
 
 am i to understand said phineas nigellus slowly from left that my last of the blacksis dead 
 
 yes phineas said dumbledore 
 
 i believe it said phineas brusquely 
 
 harry turned his head in time to see phineas marching out of his portrait and knew that he had gone to visit his other painting in grimmauld place he would walk perhaps from portrait to portrait calling for sirius through the house 
 
 harry i owe you an explanation said dumbledore an explanation of an old mistakes for i see now that what i have done and not done with regard to you bears all the hallmarks of the failings of age youth cannot know how age thinks and feels but old men are guilty if they forget what it was to be young and i seem to have forgotten lately 
 
 the sun was rising properly now there was a rim of dazzling orange visible over the mountains and the sky above it was colourless and bright the light fell upon dumbledore upon the silver of his eyebrows and beard upon the lines gouged deeply into his lace 
 
 i guessed fifteen years ago said dumbledore when i saw the scar on your forehead what it might mean i guessed that it might be the sign of a connection forged between you and voldemort 
 
 told me this before professor said harry bluntly he did not care about being rude he did not care about anything very much any more 
 
 yes said dumbledore apologetically yes but you seeit is necessary to start with your scar for it became apparent shortly after you rejoined the magical world that i was correct and that your scar was giving you warnings when voldemort was close to you or else feeling powerful emotion 
 
 i know said harry wearily 
 
 and this ability of yoursto detect presence even when he is disguised and to know what he is feeling when his emotions are rousedhas become more and more pronounced since voldemort returned to his own body and his full powers 
 
 harry did not bother to nod he knew all of this already 
 
 more recently said dumbledore i became concerned that voldemort might realise that this connection between you exists sure enough there came a time when you entered so far into his mind and thoughts that he sensed your presence i am speaking of course of the night when you witnessed the attack on mr weasley 
 
 yeah snape told me harry muttered 
 
 professor snape harry dumbledore corrected him quietly but did you not wonder why it was not i who explained this to you why i did not teach you occlumency why i had not so much as looked at you for months 
 
 harry looked up he could see now that dumbledore looked sad and tired 
 
 yeah harry mumbled yeah i wondered 
 
 you see dumbledore continued i believed it could not be long before voldemort attempted to force his way into your mind to manipulate and misdirect your thoughts and i was not eager to give him more incentives to do so i was sure that if he realised that our relationship wasor had ever beencloser than that of headmaster and pupil he would seize his chance to use you as a means to spy on me i feared the uses to which he would put you the possibility that he might try and possess you harry i believe i was right to think that voldemort would have made use of you in such a way on those rare occasions when we had close contact i thought i saw a shadow of him stir behind your eyes 
 
 harry remembered the feeling that a dormant snake had risen in him ready to strike in those moments when he and dumbledore had made 
 
 aim in possessing you as he demonstrated tonight would not have been my destruction it would have been yours he hoped when he possessed you briefly a short while ago that i would sacrifice you in the hope of killing him so you see i have been trying in distancing myself from you to protect you harry an old man s mistake 
 
 he sighed deeply harry was letting the words wash over him he would have been so interested to know all this a few months ago but now it was meaningless compared to the gaping chasm inside him that was the loss of sirius none of it mattered 
 
 sirius told me you felt voldemort awake inside you the very night that you had the vision of arthur attack i knew at once that my worst fears were correct voldemort had realised he could use you in an attempt to arm you against assaults on your mind i arranged occlumency lessons with professor snape 
 
 he paused harry watched the sunlight which was sliding slowly across the polished surface of desk illuminate a silver ink pot and a handsome scarlet quill harry could tell that the portraits all around them were awake and listening raptly to explanation he could hear the occasional rustle of robes the slight clearing of a throat phineas nigellus had still not returned 
 
 professor snape discovered dumbledore resumed that you had been dreaming about the door to the department of mysteries for months voldemort of course had been obsessed with the possibility of hearing the prophecy ever since he regained his body and as he dwelled on the door so did you though you did not know what it meant 
 
 and then you saw rookwood who worked in the department of mysteries before his arrest telling voldemort what we had known all alongthat the prophecies held in the ministry of magic are heavily protected only the people to whom they refer can lift them from the shelves without suffering madness in this case either voldemort himself would have to enter the ministry of magic and risk revealing himself at lastor else you would have to take it for him it became a matter of even greater urgency that you should master occlumency 
 
 but i muttered harry he said it aloud to try and ease the dead weight of guilt inside him a confession must surely relieve some of the terrible pressure squeezing his heart i practise i bother i stopped myself having those dreams hermione kept telling me to do it if i had never have been able to show me where to go andsirius 
 
 something was erupting inside head a need to justify himself to explain 
 
 i tried to check really taken sirius i went to office i spoke to kreacher in the fire and he said sirius there he said gone 
 
 kreacher lied said dumbledore calmly you are not his master he could lie to you without even needing to punish himself kreacher intended you to go to the ministry of magic 
 
 hehe sent me on purpose 
 
 oh yes kreacher i am afraid has been serving more than one master for months 
 
 how said harry blankly he been out of grimmauld place for years 
 
 kreacher seized his opportunity shortly before christmas said dumbledore when sirius apparently shouted at him to get out he took sirius at his word and interpreted this as an order to leave the house he went to the only black family member for whom he had any respect left cousin narcissa sister of bellatrix and wife of lucius malfoy 
 
 how do you know all this harry said his heart was beating very fast he felt sick he remembered worrying about odd absence over christmas remembered him turning up again in the attic 
 
 kreacher told me last night said dumbledore you see when you gave professor snape that cryptic warning he realised that you had had a vision of sirius trapped in the bowels of the department of mysteries he like you attempted to contact sirius at once i should explain that members of the order of the phoenix have more reliable methods of communicating than the fire in dolores office professor snape found that sirius was alive and safe in grimmauld place 
 
 when however you did not return from your trip into the forest with dolores umbridge professor snape grew worried that you still believed sirius to be a captive of lord he alerted certain order members at once 
 
 dumbledore heaved a great sigh and continued alastor moody nymphadora tonks kingsley shacklebolt and remus lupin were at headquarters when he made contact all agreed to go to your aid at once professor snape requested that sirius remain behind as he needed somebody to remain at headquarters to tell me what had happened for i was due there at any moment in the meantime he professor snape intended to search the forest for you 
 
 but sirius did not wish to remain behind while the others went to search for you he delegated to kreacher the task of telling me what had happened and so it was that when i arrived in grimmauld place shortly after they had all left for the ministry it was the elf who told melaughing fit to burstwhere sirius had gone 
 
 he was laughing said harry in a hollow voice 
 
 oh yes said dumbledore you see kreacher was not able to betray us totally he is not secret keeper for the order he could not give the our whereabouts or tell them any of the confidential plans that he had been forbidden to reveal he was bound by the enchantments of his kind which is to say that he could not disobey a direct order from his master sirius but he gave narcissa information of the sort that is very valuable to voldemort yet must have seemed much too trivial for sirius to think of banning him from repeating it 
 
 like what said harry 
 
 like the fact that the person sirius cared most about in the world was you said dumbledore quietly like the fact that you were coming to regard sirius as a mixture of father and brother voldemort knew already of course that sirius was in the order and that you knew where he wasbut information made him realise that the one person for whom you would go to any lengths to rescue was sirius black 
 
 lips were cold and numb 
 
 so when i asked kreacher if sirius was there last night 
 
 the undoubtedly on instructionshad told him he must find a way of keeping sirius out of the way once you had seen the vision of sirius being tortured then if you decided to check whether sirius was at home or not kreacher would be able to pretend he was not kreacher injured buckbeak the hippogriff yesterday and at the moment when you made your appearance in the fire sirius was upstairs tending to him 
 
 there seemed to be very little air in lungs his breathing was quick and shallow 
 
 and kreacher told you all this and laughed he croaked 
 
 he did not wish to tell me said dumbledore but i am a sufficiently accomplished legilimens myself to know when i am being lied to and ipersuaded himto tell me the full story before i left for the department of mysteries 
 
 and whispered harry his hands curled in cold fists on his knees and hermione kept telling us to be nice to him 
 
 she was quite right harry said dumbledore i warned sirius when we adopted twelve grimmauld place as our headquarters that kreacher must be treated with kindness and respect i also told him that kreacher could be dangerous to us i do not think sirius took me very seriously or that he ever saw kreacher as a being with feelings as acute as a 
 
 you blame youtalkabout sirius like breath was constricted he could not get the words out properly but the rage that had subsided briefly flared in him again he would not let dumbledore criticise sirius a lyingfoulhe deserved 
 
 kreacher is what he has been made by wizards harry said dumbledore yes he is to be pitied his existence has been as miserable as your friend he was forced to do bidding because sirius was the last of the family to which he was enslaved but he felt no true loyalty to him and whatever faults it must be admitted that sirius did nothing to make lot easier 
 
 talk about sirius like that harry yelled 
 
 he was on his feet again furious ready to fly at dumbledore who had plainly not understood sirius at all how brave he was how much he had suffered 
 
 what about snape harry spat not talking about him are you when i told him voldemort had sirius he just sneered at me as usual 
 
 harry you know professor snape had no choice but to pretend not to take you seriously in front of dolores umbridge said dumbledore steadily but as i have explained he informed the order as soon as possible about what you had said it was he who deduced where you had gone when you did not return from the forest it was he too who gave professor umbridge fake veritaserum when she was attempting to force you to tell her whereabouts 
 
 harry disregarded this he felt a savage pleasure in blaming snape it seemed to be easing his own sense of dreadful guilt and he wanted to hear dumbledore agree with him 
 
 snapesnape g goaded sirius about staying in the househe made out sirius was a coward 
 
 sirius was much too old and clever to have allowed such feeble taunts to hurt him said dumbledore 
 
 snape stopped giving me occlumency lessons harry snarled he threw me out of his office 
 
 i am aware of it said dumbledore heavily i have already said that it was a mistake for me not to teach you myself though i was sure at the time that nothing could have been more dangerous than to open your mind even further to voldemort while in my presence 
 
 snape made it worse my scar always hurt worse after lessons with him harry remembered thoughts on the subject and plunged on how do you know he trying to soften me up for voldemort make it easier for him to get inside my 
 
 i trust severus snape said dumbledore simply but i forgotanother old mistake that some wounds run too deep for the healing i thought professor snape could overcome his feelings about your fatheri was wrong 
 
 but ok is it yelled harry ignoring the scandalised faces and disapproving mutterings of the portraits on the walls ok for snape to hate my dad but not ok for sirius to hate kreacher 
 
 sirius did not hate kreacher said dumbledore he regarded him as a servant unworthy of much interest or notice indifference and neglect often do much more damage than outright dislike the fountain we destroyed tonight told a lie we wizards have mistreated and abused our fellows for too long and we are now reaping our reward 
 
 so sirius deserved what he got did he harry yelled 
 
 i did not say that nor will you ever hear me say it dumbledore replied quietly sirius was not a cruel man he was kind to in general he had no love for kreacher because kreacher was a living reminder of the home sirius had hated 
 
 yeah he did hate it said harry his voice cracking turning his back on dumbledore and walking away the sun was bright inside the room now and the eyes of all the portraits followed him as he walked without realising what he was doing without seeing the office at all you made him stay shut up in that house and he hated it why he wanted to get out last night 
 
 i was trying to keep sirius alive said dumbledore quietly 
 
 people like being locked up harry said furiously rounding on him you did it to me all last summer 
 
 dumbledore closed his eyes and buried his face in his hands harry watched him but this uncharacteristic sign of exhaustion or sadness or whatever it was from dumbledore did not soften him on the contrary he felt even angrier that dumbledore was showing signs of weakness he had no business being weak when harry wanted to rage and storm at him 
 
 dumbledore lowered his hands and surveyed harry through his glasses 
 
 it is time he said for me to tell you what i should have told you five years ago harry please sit down i am going to tell you everything i ask only a little patience you will have your chance to rage at meto do whatever you like when i have finished i will not stop you 
 
 harry glared at him for a moment then flung himself back into the chair opposite dumbledore and waited 
 
 dumbledore stared for a moment at the sunlit grounds outside the window then looked back at harry and said five years ago you arrived at hogwarts harry safe and whole as i had planned and intended wellnot quite whole you had suffered i knew you would when i left you on your aunt and doorstep i knew i was condemning you to ten dark and difficult years 
 
 he paused harry said nothing 
 
 you might ask and with good reasonwhy it had to be so why could some wizarding family not have taken you in many would have done so more than gladly would have been honoured and delighted to raise you as a son 
 
 my answer is that my priority was to keep you alive you were in more danger than perhaps anyone but i realised voldemort had been vanquished hours before but his supportersand many of them are almost as terrible as hewere still at large angry desperate and violent and i had to make my decision too with regard to the years ahead did i believe that voldemort was gone for ever no i knew not whether it would be ten twenty or fifty years before he returned but i was sure he would do so and i was sure too knowing him as i have done that he would not rest until he killed you 
 
 i knew that knowledge of magic is perhaps more extensive than any wizard alive i knew that even my most complex and powerful protective spells and charms were unlikely to be invincible if he ever returned to full power 
 
 but i knew too where voldemort was weak and so i made my decision you would be protected by an ancient magic of which he knows which he despises and which he has always therefore underestimatedto his cost i am speaking of course of the fact that your mother died to save you she gave you a lingering protection he never expected a protection that flows in your veins to this day i put my trust therefore in your blood i delivered you to her sister her only remaining relative 
 
 she love me said harry at once she give a damn 
 
 but she took you dumbledore cut across him she may have taken you grudgingly furiously unwillingly bitterly yet still she took you and in doing so she sealed the charm i placed upon you your sacrifice made the bond of blood the strongest shield i could give you 
 
 i still 
 
 while you can still call home the place where your blood dwells there you cannot be touched or harmed by voldemort he shed her blood but it lives on in you and her sister her blood became your refuge you need return there only once a year but as long as you can still call it home whilst you are there he cannot hurt you your aunt knows this i explained what i had done in the letter i left with you on her doorstep she knows that allowing you houseroom may well have kept you alive for the past fifteen years 
 
 wait said harry wait a moment 
 
 he sat up straighter in his chair staring at dumbledore 
 
 you sent that howler you told her to rememberit was your voice 
 
 i thought said dumbledore inclining his head slightly that she might need reminding of the pact she had sealed by taking you i suspected the dementor attack might have awoken her to the dangers of having you as a surrogate son 
 
 it did said harry quietly wellmy uncle more than her he wanted to chuck me out but after the howler came sheshe said i had to stay 
 
 he stared at the floor for a moment then said but this got to do with 
 
 he could not say name 
 
 five years ago then continued dumbledore as though he had not paused in his story you arrived at hogwarts neither as happy nor as as i would have liked perhaps yet alive and healthy you were not a pampered little prince but as normal a boy as i could have hoped under the circumstances thus far my plan was working well 
 
 and then well you will remember the events of your first year at hogwarts quite as clearly as i do you rose magnificently to the challenge that faced you and soonermuch soonerthan i had anticipated you found yourself face to face with voldemort you survived again you did more you delayed his return to full power and strength you fought a fight i was prouder of you than i can say 
 
 yet there was a flaw in this wonderful plan of mine said dumbledore an obvious flaw that i knew even then might be the undoing of it all and yet knowing how important it was that my plan should succeed i told myself that i would not permit this flaw to ruin it i alone could prevent this so i alone must be strong and here was my first test as you lay in the hospital wing weak from your struggle with voldemort 
 
 i understand what saying said harry 
 
 you remember asking me as you lay in the hospital wing why voldemort had tried to kill you when you were a baby 
 
 harry nodded 
 
 ought i to have told you then 
 
 harry stared into the blue eyes and said nothing but his heart was racing again 
 
 you do not see the flaw in the plan yet no perhaps not well as you know i decided not to answer you eleven i told myself was much too young to know i had never intended to tell you when you were eleven the knowledge would be too much at such a young age 
 
 i should have recognised the danger signs then i should have asked myself why i did not feel more disturbed that you had already asked me the question to which i knew one day i must give a terrible answer i should have recognised that i was too happy to think that i did not have to do it on that particular day you were too young much too young 
 
 and so we entered your second year at hogwarts and once again you met challenges even grown wizards have never faced once again you acquitted yourself beyond my wildest dreams you did not ask me again however why voldemort had left that mark on you we discussed your scar oh yes we came very very close to the subject why did i not tell you everything 
 
 well it seemed to me that twelve was after all hardly better than eleven to receive such information i allowed you to leave my presence bloodstained exhausted but exhilarated and if i felt a twinge of unease that i ought perhaps to have told you then it was swiftly silenced you were still so young you see and i could not find it in myself to spoil that night of triumph 
 
 do you see harry do you see the flaw in my brilliant plan now i had fallen into the trap i had foreseen that i had told myself i could avoid that i must avoid 
 
 i 
 
 i cared about you too much said dumbledore simply i cared more for your happiness than your knowing the truth more for your peace of mind than my plan more for your life than the lives that might be lost if the plan failed in other words i acted exactly as voldemort expects we fools who love to act 
 
 is there a defence i defy anyone who has watched you as i haveand i have watched you more closely than you can have imaginednot to want to save you more pain than you had already suffered what did i care if numbers of nameless and faceless people and creatures were slaughtered in the vague future if in the here and now you were alive and well and happy i never dreamed that i would have such a person on my hands 
 
 we entered your third year i watched from afar as you struggled to repel dementors as you found sirius learned what he was and rescued him was i to tell you then at the moment when you had triumphantly snatched your godfather from the jaws of the ministry but now at the age of thirteen my excuses were running out young you might be but you had proved you were exceptional my conscience was uneasy harry i knew the time must come soon 
 
 but you came out of the maze last year having watched cedric diggory die having escaped death so narrowly yourself and i did not tell you though i knew now voldemort had returned i must do it soon and now tonight i know you have long been ready for the knowledge i have kept from you for so long because you have proved that i should have placed the burden upon you before this my only defence is this i have watched you struggling under more burdens than any student who has ever passed through this school and i could not bring myself to add anotherthe greatest one of all 
 
 harry waited but dumbledore did not speak 
 
 i still understand 
 
 voldemort tried to kill you when you were a child because of a prophecy made shortly before your birth he knew the prophecy had been made though he did not know its full contents he set out to kill you when you were still a baby believing he was fulfilling the terms of the prophecy he discovered to his cost that he was mistaken when the curse intended to kill you backfired and so since his return to his body and particularly since your extraordinary escape from him last year he has been determined to hear that prophecy in its entirety this is the weapon he has been seeking so assiduously since his return the knowledge of how to destroy you 
 
 the sun had risen fully now office was bathed in it the glass case in which the sword of godric gryffindor resided gleamed white and opaque the fragments of the instruments harry had thrown to the floor glistened like raindrops and behind him the baby fawkes made soft chirruping noises in his nest of ashes 
 
 the smashed harry said blankly i was pulling neville up those benches in the the room where the archway was and i ripped his robes and it fell 
 
 the thing that smashed was merely the record of the prophecy kept by the department of mysteries but the prophecy was made to somebody and that person has the means of recalling it perfectly 
 
 who heard it asked harry though he thought he knew the answer already 
 
 i did said dumbledore on a cold wet night sixteen years ago in a room above the bar at the head inn i had gone there to see an applicant for the post of divination teacher though it was against my inclination to allow the subject of divination to continue at all the applicant however was the of a very famous very gifted seer and i thought it common politeness to meet her i was disappointed it seemed to me that she had not a trace of the gift herself i told her courteously i hope that i did not think she would be suitable for the post i turned to leave 
 
 dumbledore got to his feet and walked past harry to the black cabinet that stood beside perch he bent down slid back a catch and took from inside it the shallow stone basin carved with runes around the edges in which harry had seen his father tormenting snape dumbledore walked back to the desk placed the pensieve upon it and raised his wand to his own temple from it he withdrew silvery strands of thought clinging to the wand and deposited them into the basin he sat back down behind his desk and watched his thoughts swirl and drift inside the pensieve for a moment then with a sigh he raised his wand and prodded the silvery substance with its tip 
 
 a figure rose out of it draped in shawls her eyes magnified to enormous size behind her glasses and she revolved slowly her feet in the basin but when sybill trelawney spoke it was not in her usual ethereal mystic voice but in the harsh hoarse tones harry had heard her use once before 
 
 the one with the power to vanquish the dark lord approaches born to those who have thrice defied him born as the seventh month dies and the dark lord will mark him as his equal but he will have power the dark lord knows not and either must die at the hand of the other for neither can live while the other survives the one with the power to vanquish the dark lord will be born as the seventh month dies 
 
 the slowly revolving professor trelawney sank back into the silver mass below and vanished 
 
 the silence within the office was absolute neither dumbledore nor harry nor any of the portraits made a sound even fawkes had fallen silent 
 
 professor dumbledore harry said very quietly for dumbledore still staring at the pensieve seemed completely lost in thought it did that mean what did that mean 
 
 it meant said dumbledore that the person who has the only chance of conquering lord voldemort for good was born at the end of july nearly sixteen years ago this boy would be born to parents who had already defied voldemort three times 
 
 harry felt as though something was closing in on him his breathing seemed difficult again 
 
 it meansme 
 
 dumbledore surveyed him for a moment through his glasses 
 
 the odd thing harry he said softly is that it may not have meant you at all prophecy could have applied to two wizard boys both born at the end of july that year both of whom had parents in the order of the phoenix both sets of parents having narrowly escaped voldemort three times one of course was you the other was neville longbottom 
 
 but then but then why was it my name on the prophecy and not 
 
 the official record was after attack on you as a child said dumbledore it seemed plain to the keeper of the hall of prophecy that voldemort could only have tried to kill you because he knew you to be the one to whom sybill was referring 
 
 thenit might not be me said harry 
 
 i am afraid said dumbledore slowly looking as though every word cost him a great effort that there is no doubt that it is you 
 
 but you said neville was born at the end of july tooand his mum and dad 
 
 you are forgetting the next part of the prophecy the final identifying feature of the boy who could vanquish voldemort voldemort himself would mark him as his so he did harry he chose you not neville he gave you the scar that has proved both blessing and curse 
 
 but he might have chosen wrong said harry he might have marked the wrong person 
 
 he chose the boy he thought most likely to be a danger to him said dumbledore and notice this harry he chose not the which according to his creed is the only kind of wizard worth being or knowing but the like himself he saw himself in you before he had ever seen you and in marking you with that scar he did not kill you as he intended but gave you powers and a future which have fitted you to escape him not once but four times so far something that neither your parents nor parents ever achieved 
 
 why did he do it then said harry who felt numb and cold why did he try and kill me as a baby he should have waited to see whether neville or i looked more dangerous when we were older and tried to kill whoever it was then 
 
 that might indeed have been the more practical course said dumbledore except that information about the prophecy was incomplete the head inn which sybill chose for its cheapness has long attracted shall we say a more interesting clientele than the three broomsticks as you and your friends found out to your cost and i to mine that night it is a place where it is never safe to assume you are not being overheard of course i had not dreamed when i set out to meet sybill trelawney that i would hear anything worth overhearing myourone stroke of good fortune was that the eavesdropper was detected only a short way into the prophecy and thrown from the building 
 
 so he only heard 
 
 he heard only the beginning the part foretelling the birth of a boy in july to parents who had thrice defied voldemort consequently he could not warn his master that to attack you would be to risk transferring power to you and marking you as his equal so voldemort never knew that there might be danger in attacking you that it might be wise to wait to learn more he did not know that you would have power the dark lord knows not 
 
 but i said harry in a strangled voice i any powers he got i fight the way he did tonight i possess people oror kill them 
 
 there is a room in the department of mysteries interrupted dumbledore that is kept locked at all times it contains a force that is at once more wonderful and more terrible than death than human intelligence than the forces of nature it is also perhaps the most mysterious of the many subjects for study that reside there it is the power held within that room that you possess in such quantities and which voldemort has not at all that power took you to save sirius tonight that power also saved you from possession by voldemort because he could not bear to reside in a body so full of the force he detests in the end it mattered not that you could not close your mind it was your heart that saved you 
 
 harry closed his eyes if he had not gone to save sirius sirius would not have died more to stave off the moment when he would have to think of sirius again harry asked without caring much about the answer the end of the prophecy it was something about neither can live 
 
 while the other survives said dumbledore 
 
 so said harry dredging up the words from what felt like a deep well of despair inside him so does that mean that that one of us has got to kill the other one in the end 
 
 yes said dumbledore 
 
 for a long time neither of them spoke somewhere far beyond the office walls harry could hear the sound of voices students heading down to the great hall for an early breakfast perhaps it seemed impossible that there could be people in the world who still desired food who laughed who neither knew nor cared that sirius black was gone for ever sirius seemed a million miles away already even now a part of harry still believed that if he had only pulled back that veil he would have found sirius looking back at him greeting him perhaps with his laugh like a bark 
 
 i feel i owe you another explanation harry said dumbledore hesitantly you may perhaps have wondered why i never chose you as a prefect i must confess that i rather thought you had enough responsibility to be going on with 
 
 harry looked up at him and saw a tear trickling down face into his long silver beard 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the order of the phoenix 
 

lionfish nov chapter the lost prophecycontents prev chapter next chapter 
 feet hit solid ground his knees buckled a little and the golden head fell with a resounding clunk to the floor he looked around and saw that he had arrived in office 
 
 everything seemed to have repaired itself during the headmasters absence the delicate silver instruments stood once more on the tables puffing and whirring serenely the portraits of the headmasters and headmistresses were snoozing in their frames heads lolling back in armchairs or against the edge of the picture harry looked through the window there was a cool line of pale green along the horizon dawn was approaching 
 
 the silence and the stillness broken only by the occasional grunt or snuffle of a sleeping portrait was unbearable to him if his surroundings could have reflected the feelings inside him the pictures would have been screaming in pain he walked around the quiet beautiful office breathing quickly trying not to think but he had to think there was no escape 
 
 it was his fault sirius had died it was all his fault if he harry had not been stupid enough to fall for trick if he had not been so convinced that what he had seen in his dream was real if he had only opened his mind to the possibility that voldemort was as hermione had said banking on love of playing the hero 
 
 it was unbearable he would not think about it he could not stand it there was a terrible hollow inside him he did not want to feel or examine a dark hole where sirius had been where sirius had vanished he did not want to have to be alone with that great silent space he could not stand it 
 
 a picture behind him gave a particularly loud grunting snore and a cool voice said ah harry potter 
 
 phineas nigellus gave a long yawn stretching his arms as he surveyed harry out of shrewd narrow eyes 
 
 and what brings you here in the early hours of the morning said phineas eventually this office is supposed to be barred to all but the rightful headmaster or has dumbledore sent you here oh tell me he gave another shuddering yawn another message for my worthless 
 
 harry could not speak phineas nigellus did not know that sirius was dead but harry could not tell him to say it aloud would be to make it final absolute irretrievable 
 
 a few more of the portraits had stirred now terror of being interrogated made harry stride across the room and seize the doorknob 
 
 it would not turn he was shut in 
 
 i hope this means said the corpulent wizard who hung on the wall behind the headmasters desk that dumbledore will soon be back among us 
 
 harry turned the wizard was surveying him with great interest harry nodded he tugged again on the doorknob behind his back but it remained immovable 
 
 oh good said the wizard it has been very dull without him very dull indeed 
 
 he settled himself on the chair on which he had been painted and smiled benignly upon harry 
 
 dumbledore thinks very highly of you as i am sure you know he said comfortably oh yes holds you in great esteem 
 
 the guilt filling the whole of chest like some monstrous weighty parasite now writhed and squirmed harry could not stand this he could not stand being himself any more he had never felt more trapped inside his own head and body never wished so intensely that he could be somebody anybody else 
 
 the empty fireplace burst into emerald green flame making harry leap away from the door staring at the man spinning inside the grate as tall form unfolded itself from the fire the wizards and witches on the surrounding walls jerked awake many of them giving cries of welcome 
 
 thank you said dumbledore softly 
 
 he did not look at harry at first but walked over to the perch beside the door and withdrew from an inside pocket of his robes the tiny ugly featherless fawkes whom he placed gently on the tray of soft ashes beneath the golden post where the fawkes usually stood 
 
 well harry said dumbledore finally turning away from the baby bird you will be pleased to hear that none of your fellow students are going to suffer lasting damage from the events 
 
 harry tried to say good but no sound came out it seemed to him that dumbledore was reminding him of the amount of damage he had caused and although dumbledore was for once looking at him directly and although his expression was kindly rather than accusatory harry could not bear to meet his eyes 
 
 madam pomfrey is patching everybody up said dumbledore nymphadora tonks may need to spend a little time in st mungos but it seems she will make a full recovery 
 
 harry contented himself with nodding at the carpet which was growing lighter as the sky outside grew paler he was sure all the portraits around the room were listening closely to every word dumbledore spoke wondering where dumbledore and harry had been and why there had been injuries 
 
 i know how feeling harry said dumbledore very quietly 
 
 no you said harry and his voice was suddenly loud and strong anger leapt inside him dumbledore knew nothing about his feelings 
 
 you see dumbledore said phineas nigellus slyly never try to understand the students they hate it they would much rather be tragically misunderstood wallow in stew in their own 
 
 enough phineas said dumbledore 
 
 harry turned his back on dumbledore and stared determinedly out of the window he could see the quidditch stadium in the distance sirius had appeared there once disguised as the shaggy black dog so he could watch harry play he had probably come to see whether harry was as good as james had been harry had never asked him 
 
 there is no shame in what you are feeling harry said voice on the contrary the fact that you can feel pain like this is your greatest strength 
 
 harry felt the anger lick his insides blazing in the terrible emptiness filling him with the desire to hurt dumbledore for his calmness and his empty words 
 
 my greatest strength is it said harry his voice shaking as he stared out at the quidditch stadium no longer seeing it you got a clue you know 
 
 what i know asked dumbledore calmly 
 
 it was too much harry turned around shaking with rage 
 
 i want to talk about how i feel all right 
 
 harry suffering like this proves you are still a man this pain is part of being human 
 
 wanttobehuman harry roared and he seized the delicate silver instrument from the table beside him and flung it across the room it shattered into a hundred tiny pieces against the wall several of the pictures let out yells of anger and fright and the portrait of armando dippet said really 
 
 i care harry yelled at them snatching up a lunascope and throwing it into the fireplace had enough seen enough i want out i want it to end i care any more 
 
 he seized the table on which the silver instrument had stood and threw that too it broke apart on the floor and the legs rolled in different directions 
 
 you do care said dumbledore he had not flinched or made a single move to stop harry demolishing his office his expression was calm almost detached you care so much you feel as though you will bleed to death with the pain of it 
 
 harry screamed so loudly that he felt his throat might tear and for a second he wanted to rush at dumbledore and break him too shatter that calm old face shake him hurt him make him feel some tiny part of the horror inside himself 
 
 oh yes you do said dumbledore still more calmly you have now lost your mother your father and the closest thing to a parent you have ever known of course you care 
 
 you know how i feel harry roared youstanding thereyou 
 
 but words were no longer enough smashing things was no more help he wanted to run he wanted to keep running and never look back he wanted to be somewhere he could not see the clear blue eyes staring at him that hatefully calm old face he turned on his heel and ran to the door seized the doorknob again and wrenched at it 
 
 but the door would not open 
 
 harry turned back to dumbledore 
 
 let me out he said he was shaking from head to foot 
 
 no said dumbledore simply 
 
 for a few seconds they stared at each other 
 
 let me out harry said again 
 
 no dumbledore repeated 
 
 if you if you keep me in hereif you let me 
 
 by all means continue destroying my possessions said dumbledore serenely i daresay i have too many 
 
 he walked around his desk and sat down behind it watching harry 
 
 let me out harry said yet again in a voice that was cold and almost as calm as 
 
 not until i have had my say said dumbledore 
 
 do youdo you think i want todo you think i give ai care what got to say harry roared i want to hear anything got to say 
 
 you will said dumbledore steadily because you are not nearly as angry with me as you ought to be if you are to attack me as i know you are close to doing i would like to have thoroughly earned it 
 
 what are you talking 
 
 it is my fault that sirius died said dumbledore clearly or should i say almost entirely my faulti will not be so arrogant as to claim responsibility for the whole sirius was a brave clever and energetic man and such men are not usually content to sit at home in hiding while they believe others to be in danger nevertheless you should never have believed for an instant that there was any necessity for you to go to the department of mysteries tonight if i had been open with you harry as i should have been you would have known a long time ago that voldemort might try and lure you to the department of mysteries and you would never have been tricked into going there tonight and sirius would not have had to come after you that blame lies with me and with me alone 
 
 harry was still standing with his hand on the doorknob but was unaware of it he was gazing at dumbledore hardly breathing listening yet barely understanding what he was hearing 
 
 please sit down said dumbledore it was not an order it was a request 
 
 harry hesitated then walked slowly across the room now littered with silver cogs and fragments of wood and took the seat facing desk 
 
 am i to understand said phineas nigellus slowly from left that my last of the blacksis dead 
 
 yes phineas said dumbledore 
 
 i believe it said phineas brusquely 
 
 harry turned his head in time to see phineas marching out of his portrait and knew that he had gone to visit his other painting in grimmauld place he would walk perhaps from portrait to portrait calling for sirius through the house 
 
 harry i owe you an explanation said dumbledore an explanation of an old mistakes for i see now that what i have done and not done with regard to you bears all the hallmarks of the failings of age youth cannot know how age thinks and feels but old men are guilty if they forget what it was to be young and i seem to have forgotten lately 
 
 the sun was rising properly now there was a rim of dazzling orange visible over the mountains and the sky above it was colourless and bright the light fell upon dumbledore upon the silver of his eyebrows and beard upon the lines gouged deeply into his lace 
 
 i guessed fifteen years ago said dumbledore when i saw the scar on your forehead what it might mean i guessed that it might be the sign of a connection forged between you and voldemort 
 
 told me this before professor said harry bluntly he did not care about being rude he did not care about anything very much any more 
 
 yes said dumbledore apologetically yes but you seeit is necessary to start with your scar for it became apparent shortly after you rejoined the magical world that i was correct and that your scar was giving you warnings when voldemort was close to you or else feeling powerful emotion 
 
 i know said harry wearily 
 
 and this ability of yoursto detect presence even when he is disguised and to know what he is feeling when his emotions are rousedhas become more and more pronounced since voldemort returned to his own body and his full powers 
 
 harry did not bother to nod he knew all of this already 
 
 more recently said dumbledore i became concerned that voldemort might realise that this connection between you exists sure enough there came a time when you entered so far into his mind and thoughts that he sensed your presence i am speaking of course of the night when you witnessed the attack on mr weasley 
 
 yeah snape told me harry muttered 
 
 professor snape harry dumbledore corrected him quietly but did you not wonder why it was not i who explained this to you why i did not teach you occlumency why i had not so much as looked at you for months 
 
 harry looked up he could see now that dumbledore looked sad and tired 
 
 yeah harry mumbled yeah i wondered 
 
 you see dumbledore continued i believed it could not be long before voldemort attempted to force his way into your mind to manipulate and misdirect your thoughts and i was not eager to give him more incentives to do so i was sure that if he realised that our relationship wasor had ever beencloser than that of headmaster and pupil he would seize his chance to use you as a means to spy on me i feared the uses to which he would put you the possibility that he might try and possess you harry i believe i was right to think that voldemort would have made use of you in such a way on those rare occasions when we had close contact i thought i saw a shadow of him stir behind your eyes 
 
 harry remembered the feeling that a dormant snake had risen in him ready to strike in those moments when he and dumbledore had made 
 
 aim in possessing you as he demonstrated tonight would not have been my destruction it would have been yours he hoped when he possessed you briefly a short while ago that i would sacrifice you in the hope of killing him so you see i have been trying in distancing myself from you to protect you harry an old man s mistake 
 
 he sighed deeply harry was letting the words wash over him he would have been so interested to know all this a few months ago but now it was meaningless compared to the gaping chasm inside him that was the loss of sirius none of it mattered 
 
 sirius told me you felt voldemort awake inside you the very night that you had the vision of arthur attack i knew at once that my worst fears were correct voldemort had realised he could use you in an attempt to arm you against assaults on your mind i arranged occlumency lessons with professor snape 
 
 he paused harry watched the sunlight which was sliding slowly across the polished surface of desk illuminate a silver ink pot and a handsome scarlet quill harry could tell that the portraits all around them were awake and listening raptly to explanation he could hear the occasional rustle of robes the slight clearing of a throat phineas nigellus had still not returned 
 
 professor snape discovered dumbledore resumed that you had been dreaming about the door to the department of mysteries for months voldemort of course had been obsessed with the possibility of hearing the prophecy ever since he regained his body and as he dwelled on the door so did you though you did not know what it meant 
 
 and then you saw rookwood who worked in the department of mysteries before his arrest telling voldemort what we had known all alongthat the prophecies held in the ministry of magic are heavily protected only the people to whom they refer can lift them from the shelves without suffering madness in this case either voldemort himself would have to enter the ministry of magic and risk revealing himself at lastor else you would have to take it for him it became a matter of even greater urgency that you should master occlumency 
 
 but i muttered harry he said it aloud to try and ease the dead weight of guilt inside him a confession must surely relieve some of the terrible pressure squeezing his heart i practise i bother i stopped myself having those dreams hermione kept telling me to do it if i had never have been able to show me where to go andsirius 
 
 something was erupting inside head a need to justify himself to explain 
 
 i tried to check really taken sirius i went to office i spoke to kreacher in the fire and he said sirius there he said gone 
 
 kreacher lied said dumbledore calmly you are not his master he could lie to you without even needing to punish himself kreacher intended you to go to the ministry of magic 
 
 hehe sent me on purpose 
 
 oh yes kreacher i am afraid has been serving more than one master for months 
 
 how said harry blankly he been out of grimmauld place for years 
 
 kreacher seized his opportunity shortly before christmas said dumbledore when sirius apparently shouted at him to get out he took sirius at his word and interpreted this as an order to leave the house he went to the only black family member for whom he had any respect left cousin narcissa sister of bellatrix and wife of lucius malfoy 
 
 how do you know all this harry said his heart was beating very fast he felt sick he remembered worrying about odd absence over christmas remembered him turning up again in the attic 
 
 kreacher told me last night said dumbledore you see when you gave professor snape that cryptic warning he realised that you had had a vision of sirius trapped in the bowels of the department of mysteries he like you attempted to contact sirius at once i should explain that members of the order of the phoenix have more reliable methods of communicating than the fire in dolores office professor snape found that sirius was alive and safe in grimmauld place 
 
 when however you did not return from your trip into the forest with dolores umbridge professor snape grew worried that you still believed sirius to be a captive of lord he alerted certain order members at once 
 
 dumbledore heaved a great sigh and continued alastor moody nymphadora tonks kingsley shacklebolt and remus lupin were at headquarters when he made contact all agreed to go to your aid at once professor snape requested that sirius remain behind as he needed somebody to remain at headquarters to tell me what had happened for i was due there at any moment in the meantime he professor snape intended to search the forest for you 
 
 but sirius did not wish to remain behind while the others went to search for you he delegated to kreacher the task of telling me what had happened and so it was that when i arrived in grimmauld place shortly after they had all left for the ministry it was the elf who told melaughing fit to burstwhere sirius had gone 
 
 he was laughing said harry in a hollow voice 
 
 oh yes said dumbledore you see kreacher was not able to betray us totally he is not secret keeper for the order he could not give the our whereabouts or tell them any of the confidential plans that he had been forbidden to reveal he was bound by the enchantments of his kind which is to say that he could not disobey a direct order from his master sirius but he gave narcissa information of the sort that is very valuable to voldemort yet must have seemed much too trivial for sirius to think of banning him from repeating it 
 
 like what said harry 
 
 like the fact that the person sirius cared most about in the world was you said dumbledore quietly like the fact that you were coming to regard sirius as a mixture of father and brother voldemort knew already of course that sirius was in the order and that you knew where he wasbut information made him realise that the one person for whom you would go to any lengths to rescue was sirius black 
 
 lips were cold and numb 
 
 so when i asked kreacher if sirius was there last night 
 
 the undoubtedly on instructionshad told him he must find a way of keeping sirius out of the way once you had seen the vision of sirius being tortured then if you decided to check whether sirius was at home or not kreacher would be able to pretend he was not kreacher injured buckbeak the hippogriff yesterday and at the moment when you made your appearance in the fire sirius was upstairs tending to him 
 
 there seemed to be very little air in lungs his breathing was quick and shallow 
 
 and kreacher told you all this and laughed he croaked 
 
 he did not wish to tell me said dumbledore but i am a sufficiently accomplished legilimens myself to know when i am being lied to and ipersuaded himto tell me the full story before i left for the department of mysteries 
 
 and whispered harry his hands curled in cold fists on his knees and hermione kept telling us to be nice to him 
 
 she was quite right harry said dumbledore i warned sirius when we adopted twelve grimmauld place as our headquarters that kreacher must be treated with kindness and respect i also told him that kreacher could be dangerous to us i do not think sirius took me very seriously or that he ever saw kreacher as a being with feelings as acute as a 
 
 you blame youtalkabout sirius like breath was constricted he could not get the words out properly but the rage that had subsided briefly flared in him again he would not let dumbledore criticise sirius a lyingfoulhe deserved 
 
 kreacher is what he has been made by wizards harry said dumbledore yes he is to be pitied his existence has been as miserable as your friend he was forced to do bidding because sirius was the last of the family to which he was enslaved but he felt no true loyalty to him and whatever faults it must be admitted that sirius did nothing to make lot easier 
 
 talk about sirius like that harry yelled 
 
 he was on his feet again furious ready to fly at dumbledore who had plainly not understood sirius at all how brave he was how much he had suffered 
 
 what about snape harry spat not talking about him are you when i told him voldemort had sirius he just sneered at me as usual 
 
 harry you know professor snape had no choice but to pretend not to take you seriously in front of dolores umbridge said dumbledore steadily but as i have explained he informed the order as soon as possible about what you had said it was he who deduced where you had gone when you did not return from the forest it was he too who gave professor umbridge fake veritaserum when she was attempting to force you to tell her whereabouts 
 
 harry disregarded this he felt a savage pleasure in blaming snape it seemed to be easing his own sense of dreadful guilt and he wanted to hear dumbledore agree with him 
 
 snapesnape g goaded sirius about staying in the househe made out sirius was a coward 
 
 sirius was much too old and clever to have allowed such feeble taunts to hurt him said dumbledore 
 
 snape stopped giving me occlumency lessons harry snarled he threw me out of his office 
 
 i am aware of it said dumbledore heavily i have already said that it was a mistake for me not to teach you myself though i was sure at the time that nothing could have been more dangerous than to open your mind even further to voldemort while in my presence 
 
 snape made it worse my scar always hurt worse after lessons with him harry remembered thoughts on the subject and plunged on how do you know he trying to soften me up for voldemort make it easier for him to get inside my 
 
 i trust severus snape said dumbledore simply but i forgotanother old mistake that some wounds run too deep for the healing i thought professor snape could overcome his feelings about your fatheri was wrong 
 
 but ok is it yelled harry ignoring the scandalised faces and disapproving mutterings of the portraits on the walls ok for snape to hate my dad but not ok for sirius to hate kreacher 
 
 sirius did not hate kreacher said dumbledore he regarded him as a servant unworthy of much interest or notice indifference and neglect often do much more damage than outright dislike the fountain we destroyed tonight told a lie we wizards have mistreated and abused our fellows for too long and we are now reaping our reward 
 
 so sirius deserved what he got did he harry yelled 
 
 i did not say that nor will you ever hear me say it dumbledore replied quietly sirius was not a cruel man he was kind to in general he had no love for kreacher because kreacher was a living reminder of the home sirius had hated 
 
 yeah he did hate it said harry his voice cracking turning his back on dumbledore and walking away the sun was bright inside the room now and the eyes of all the portraits followed him as he walked without realising what he was doing without seeing the office at all you made him stay shut up in that house and he hated it why he wanted to get out last night 
 
 i was trying to keep sirius alive said dumbledore quietly 
 
 people like being locked up harry said furiously rounding on him you did it to me all last summer 
 
 dumbledore closed his eyes and buried his face in his hands harry watched him but this uncharacteristic sign of exhaustion or sadness or whatever it was from dumbledore did not soften him on the contrary he felt even angrier that dumbledore was showing signs of weakness he had no business being weak when harry wanted to rage and storm at him 
 
 dumbledore lowered his hands and surveyed harry through his glasses 
 
 it is time he said for me to tell you what i should have told you five years ago harry please sit down i am going to tell you everything i ask only a little patience you will have your chance to rage at meto do whatever you like when i have finished i will not stop you 
 
 harry glared at him for a moment then flung himself back into the chair opposite dumbledore and waited 
 
 dumbledore stared for a moment at the sunlit grounds outside the window then looked back at harry and said five years ago you arrived at hogwarts harry safe and whole as i had planned and intended wellnot quite whole you had suffered i knew you would when i left you on your aunt and doorstep i knew i was condemning you to ten dark and difficult years 
 
 he paused harry said nothing 
 
 you might ask and with good reasonwhy it had to be so why could some wizarding family not have taken you in many would have done so more than gladly would have been honoured and delighted to raise you as a son 
 
 my answer is that my priority was to keep you alive you were in more danger than perhaps anyone but i realised voldemort had been vanquished hours before but his supportersand many of them are almost as terrible as hewere still at large angry desperate and violent and i had to make my decision too with regard to the years ahead did i believe that voldemort was gone for ever no i knew not whether it would be ten twenty or fifty years before he returned but i was sure he would do so and i was sure too knowing him as i have done that he would not rest until he killed you 
 
 i knew that knowledge of magic is perhaps more extensive than any wizard alive i knew that even my most complex and powerful protective spells and charms were unlikely to be invincible if he ever returned to full power 
 
 but i knew too where voldemort was weak and so i made my decision you would be protected by an ancient magic of which he knows which he despises and which he has always therefore underestimatedto his cost i am speaking of course of the fact that your mother died to save you she gave you a lingering protection he never expected a protection that flows in your veins to this day i put my trust therefore in your blood i delivered you to her sister her only remaining relative 
 
 she love me said harry at once she give a damn 
 
 but she took you dumbledore cut across him she may have taken you grudgingly furiously unwillingly bitterly yet still she took you and in doing so she sealed the charm i placed upon you your sacrifice made the bond of blood the strongest shield i could give you 
 
 i still 
 
 while you can still call home the place where your blood dwells there you cannot be touched or harmed by voldemort he shed her blood but it lives on in you and her sister her blood became your refuge you need return there only once a year but as long as you can still call it home whilst you are there he cannot hurt you your aunt knows this i explained what i had done in the letter i left with you on her doorstep she knows that allowing you houseroom may well have kept you alive for the past fifteen years 
 
 wait said harry wait a moment 
 
 he sat up straighter in his chair staring at dumbledore 
 
 you sent that howler you told her to rememberit was your voice 
 
 i thought said dumbledore inclining his head slightly that she might need reminding of the pact she had sealed by taking you i suspected the dementor attack might have awoken her to the dangers of having you as a surrogate son 
 
 it did said harry quietly wellmy uncle more than her he wanted to chuck me out but after the howler came sheshe said i had to stay 
 
 he stared at the floor for a moment then said but this got to do with 
 
 he could not say name 
 
 five years ago then continued dumbledore as though he had not paused in his story you arrived at hogwarts neither as happy nor as as i would have liked perhaps yet alive and healthy you were not a pampered little prince but as normal a boy as i could have hoped under the circumstances thus far my plan was working well 
 
 and then well you will remember the events of your first year at hogwarts quite as clearly as i do you rose magnificently to the challenge that faced you and soonermuch soonerthan i had anticipated you found yourself face to face with voldemort you survived again you did more you delayed his return to full power and strength you fought a fight i was prouder of you than i can say 
 
 yet there was a flaw in this wonderful plan of mine said dumbledore an obvious flaw that i knew even then might be the undoing of it all and yet knowing how important it was that my plan should succeed i told myself that i would not permit this flaw to ruin it i alone could prevent this so i alone must be strong and here was my first test as you lay in the hospital wing weak from your struggle with voldemort 
 
 i understand what saying said harry 
 
 you remember asking me as you lay in the hospital wing why voldemort had tried to kill you when you were a baby 
 
 harry nodded 
 
 ought i to have told you then 
 
 harry stared into the blue eyes and said nothing but his heart was racing again 
 
 you do not see the flaw in the plan yet no perhaps not well as you know i decided not to answer you eleven i told myself was much too young to know i had never intended to tell you when you were eleven the knowledge would be too much at such a young age 
 
 i should have recognised the danger signs then i should have asked myself why i did not feel more disturbed that you had already asked me the question to which i knew one day i must give a terrible answer i should have recognised that i was too happy to think that i did not have to do it on that particular day you were too young much too young 
 
 and so we entered your second year at hogwarts and once again you met challenges even grown wizards have never faced once again you acquitted yourself beyond my wildest dreams you did not ask me again however why voldemort had left that mark on you we discussed your scar oh yes we came very very close to the subject why did i not tell you everything 
 
 well it seemed to me that twelve was after all hardly better than eleven to receive such information i allowed you to leave my presence bloodstained exhausted but exhilarated and if i felt a twinge of unease that i ought perhaps to have told you then it was swiftly silenced you were still so young you see and i could not find it in myself to spoil that night of triumph 
 
 do you see harry do you see the flaw in my brilliant plan now i had fallen into the trap i had foreseen that i had told myself i could avoid that i must avoid 
 
 i 
 
 i cared about you too much said dumbledore simply i cared more for your happiness than your knowing the truth more for your peace of mind than my plan more for your life than the lives that might be lost if the plan failed in other words i acted exactly as voldemort expects we fools who love to act 
 
 is there a defence i defy anyone who has watched you as i haveand i have watched you more closely than you can have imaginednot to want to save you more pain than you had already suffered what did i care if numbers of nameless and faceless people and creatures were slaughtered in the vague future if in the here and now you were alive and well and happy i never dreamed that i would have such a person on my hands 
 
 we entered your third year i watched from afar as you struggled to repel dementors as you found sirius learned what he was and rescued him was i to tell you then at the moment when you had triumphantly snatched your godfather from the jaws of the ministry but now at the age of thirteen my excuses were running out young you might be but you had proved you were exceptional my conscience was uneasy harry i knew the time must come soon 
 
 but you came out of the maze last year having watched cedric diggory die having escaped death so narrowly yourself and i did not tell you though i knew now voldemort had returned i must do it soon and now tonight i know you have long been ready for the knowledge i have kept from you for so long because you have proved that i should have placed the burden upon you before this my only defence is this i have watched you struggling under more burdens than any student who has ever passed through this school and i could not bring myself to add anotherthe greatest one of all 
 
 harry waited but dumbledore did not speak 
 
 i still understand 
 
 voldemort tried to kill you when you were a child because of a prophecy made shortly before your birth he knew the prophecy had been made though he did not know its full contents he set out to kill you when you were still a baby believing he was fulfilling the terms of the prophecy he discovered to his cost that he was mistaken when the curse intended to kill you backfired and so since his return to his body and particularly since your extraordinary escape from him last year he has been determined to hear that prophecy in its entirety this is the weapon he has been seeking so assiduously since his return the knowledge of how to destroy you 
 
 the sun had risen fully now office was bathed in it the glass case in which the sword of godric gryffindor resided gleamed white and opaque the fragments of the instruments harry had thrown to the floor glistened like raindrops and behind him the baby fawkes made soft chirruping noises in his nest of ashes 
 
 the smashed harry said blankly i was pulling neville up those benches in the the room where the archway was and i ripped his robes and it fell 
 
 the thing that smashed was merely the record of the prophecy kept by the department of mysteries but the prophecy was made to somebody and that person has the means of recalling it perfectly 
 
 who heard it asked harry though he thought he knew the answer already 
 
 i did said dumbledore on a cold wet night sixteen years ago in a room above the bar at the head inn i had gone there to see an applicant for the post of divination teacher though it was against my inclination to allow the subject of divination to continue at all the applicant however was the of a very famous very gifted seer and i thought it common politeness to meet her i was disappointed it seemed to me that she had not a trace of the gift herself i told her courteously i hope that i did not think she would be suitable for the post i turned to leave 
 
 dumbledore got to his feet and walked past harry to the black cabinet that stood beside perch he bent down slid back a catch and took from inside it the shallow stone basin carved with runes around the edges in which harry had seen his father tormenting snape dumbledore walked back to the desk placed the pensieve upon it and raised his wand to his own temple from it he withdrew silvery strands of thought clinging to the wand and deposited them into the basin he sat back down behind his desk and watched his thoughts swirl and drift inside the pensieve for a moment then with a sigh he raised his wand and prodded the silvery substance with its tip 
 
 a figure rose out of it draped in shawls her eyes magnified to enormous size behind her glasses and she revolved slowly her feet in the basin but when sybill trelawney spoke it was not in her usual ethereal mystic voice but in the harsh hoarse tones harry had heard her use once before 
 
 the one with the power to vanquish the dark lord approaches born to those who have thrice defied him born as the seventh month dies and the dark lord will mark him as his equal but he will have power the dark lord knows not and either must die at the hand of the other for neither can live while the other survives the one with the power to vanquish the dark lord will be born as the seventh month dies 
 
 the slowly revolving professor trelawney sank back into the silver mass below and vanished 
 
 the silence within the office was absolute neither dumbledore nor harry nor any of the portraits made a sound even fawkes had fallen silent 
 
 professor dumbledore harry said very quietly for dumbledore still staring at the pensieve seemed completely lost in thought it did that mean what did that mean 
 
 it meant said dumbledore that the person who has the only chance of conquering lord voldemort for good was born at the end of july nearly sixteen years ago this boy would be born to parents who had already defied voldemort three times 
 
 harry felt as though something was closing in on him his breathing seemed difficult again 
 
 it meansme 
 
 dumbledore surveyed him for a moment through his glasses 
 
 the odd thing harry he said softly is that it may not have meant you at all prophecy could have applied to two wizard boys both born at the end of july that year both of whom had parents in the order of the phoenix both sets of parents having narrowly escaped voldemort three times one of course was you the other was neville longbottom 
 
 but then but then why was it my name on the prophecy and not 
 
 the official record was after attack on you as a child said dumbledore it seemed plain to the keeper of the hall of prophecy that voldemort could only have tried to kill you because he knew you to be the one to whom sybill was referring 
 
 thenit might not be me said harry 
 
 i am afraid said dumbledore slowly looking as though every word cost him a great effort that there is no doubt that it is you 
 
 but you said neville was born at the end of july tooand his mum and dad 
 
 you are forgetting the next part of the prophecy the final identifying feature of the boy who could vanquish voldemort voldemort himself would mark him as his so he did harry he chose you not neville he gave you the scar that has proved both blessing and curse 
 
 but he might have chosen wrong said harry he might have marked the wrong person 
 
 he chose the boy he thought most likely to be a danger to him said dumbledore and notice this harry he chose not the which according to his creed is the only kind of wizard worth being or knowing but the like himself he saw himself in you before he had ever seen you and in marking you with that scar he did not kill you as he intended but gave you powers and a future which have fitted you to escape him not once but four times so far something that neither your parents nor parents ever achieved 
 
 why did he do it then said harry who felt numb and cold why did he try and kill me as a baby he should have waited to see whether neville or i looked more dangerous when we were older and tried to kill whoever it was then 
 
 that might indeed have been the more practical course said dumbledore except that information about the prophecy was incomplete the head inn which sybill chose for its cheapness has long attracted shall we say a more interesting clientele than the three broomsticks as you and your friends found out to your cost and i to mine that night it is a place where it is never safe to assume you are not being overheard of course i had not dreamed when i set out to meet sybill trelawney that i would hear anything worth overhearing myourone stroke of good fortune was that the eavesdropper was detected only a short way into the prophecy and thrown from the building 
 
 so he only heard 
 
 he heard only the beginning the part foretelling the birth of a boy in july to parents who had thrice defied voldemort consequently he could not warn his master that to attack you would be to risk transferring power to you and marking you as his equal so voldemort never knew that there might be danger in attacking you that it might be wise to wait to learn more he did not know that you would have power the dark lord knows not 
 
 but i said harry in a strangled voice i any powers he got i fight the way he did tonight i possess people oror kill them 
 
 there is a room in the department of mysteries interrupted dumbledore that is kept locked at all times it contains a force that is at once more wonderful and more terrible than death than human intelligence than the forces of nature it is also perhaps the most mysterious of the many subjects for study that reside there it is the power held within that room that you possess in such quantities and which voldemort has not at all that power took you to save sirius tonight that power also saved you from possession by voldemort because he could not bear to reside in a body so full of the force he detests in the end it mattered not that you could not close your mind it was your heart that saved you 
 
 harry closed his eyes if he had not gone to save sirius sirius would not have died more to stave off the moment when he would have to think of sirius again harry asked without caring much about the answer the end of the prophecy it was something about neither can live 
 
 while the other survives said dumbledore 
 
 so said harry dredging up the words from what felt like a deep well of despair inside him so does that mean that that one of us has got to kill the other one in the end 
 
 yes said dumbledore 
 
 for a long time neither of them spoke somewhere far beyond the office walls harry could hear the sound of voices students heading down to the great hall for an early breakfast perhaps it seemed impossible that there could be people in the world who still desired food who laughed who neither knew nor cared that sirius black was gone for ever sirius seemed a million miles away already even now a part of harry still believed that if he had only pulled back that veil he would have found sirius looking back at him greeting him perhaps with his laugh like a bark 
 
 i feel i owe you another explanation harry said dumbledore hesitantly you may perhaps have wondered why i never chose you as a prefect i must confess that i rather thought you had enough responsibility to be going on with 
 
 harry looked up at him and saw a tear trickling down face into his long silver beard 
 
 rowling

 fairy tales of hans christian andersen 
 the bottle neck 
 by hans christian andersen 
 
 close to the corner of a street among other abodes of poverty 
 stood an exceedingly tall narrow house which had been so knocked 
 about by time that it seemed out of joint in every direction this 
 house was inhabited by poor people but the deepest poverty was 
 apparent in the garret lodging in the gable in front of the little 
 window an old bent hung in the sunshine which had not even a proper but instead of it the broken neck of a bottle turned upside down and a cork stuck in to make it hold the water with which it was filled an old maid stood at the window she had hung chickweed over the cage and the little linnet which it contained hopped from perch to perch and sang and twittered merrily 
 
 yes all very well for you to sing said the bottle neck 
 that is he did not really speak the words as we do for the neck of a 
 bottle cannot speak but he thought them to himself in his own mind 
 just as people sometimes talk quietly to themselves 
 
 yes you may sing very well you have all your limbs uninjured 
 you should feel what it is like to lose your body and only have a 
 neck and a mouth left with a cork stuck in it as i have you 
 sing then i know after all it is just as well that there 
 are some who can be happy i have no reason to sing nor could i 
 sing now if i were ever so happy but when i was a whole bottle and 
 they rubbed me with a cork i sing then i used to be called 
 a complete lark i remember when i went out to a picnic with the 
 family on the day his daughter was betrothed it seems 
 as if it only happened yesterday i have gone through a great deal 
 in my time when i come to recollect i have been in the fire and in 
 the water i have been deep in the earth and have mounted higher in 
 the air than most other people and now i am swinging here outside 
 a in the air and the sunshine oh indeed it would be 
 worth while to hear my history but i do not speak it aloud for a 
 good reason because i cannot 
 
 then the bottle neck related his history which was really 
 rather remarkable he in fact related it to himself or at least 
 thought it in his own mind the little bird sang his own song merrily 
 in the street below there was driving and running to and fro every 
 one thought of his own affairs or perhaps of nothing at all but 
 the bottle neck thought deeply he thought of the blazing furnace in 
 the factory where he had been blown into life he remembered how 
 hot it felt when he was placed in the heated oven the home from which he sprang and that he had a strong inclination to leap out again 
 directly but after a while it became cooler and he found himself 
 very comfortable he had been placed in a row with a whole regiment 
 of his brothers and sisters all brought out of the same furnace 
 some of them had certainly been blown into champagne bottles and 
 others into beer bottles which made a little difference between them 
 in the world it often happens that a beer bottle may contain the 
 most precious wine and a champagne bottle be filled with blacking 
 but even in decay it may always be seen whether a man has been well 
 born nobility remains noble as a champagne bottle remains the 
 same even with blacking in its interior when the bottles were packed 
 our bottle was packed amongst them it little expected then to 
 finish its career as a bottle neck or to be used as a 
 to a which is after all a place of honor for it is 
 to be of some use in the world the bottle did not behold the light of 
 day again until it was unpacked with the rest in the wine cellar and for the first time rinsed with water which caused some very curious sensations there it lay empty and without a cork and it had a peculiar feeling as if it wanted something it knew not what at last it was filled with rich and costly wine a cork was placed in it and sealed down then it was labelled first quality as if it had carried off the first prize at an examination besides the wine and the bottle were both good and while we are young is the time for poetry there were sounds of song within the bottle of things it could not understand of green sunny mountains where the vines grow and where the merry laugh sing and are merry ah how beautiful is life all these tones of joy and song in the bottle were like the working of a young brain who often knows not the meaning of the tones which are sounding within him 
 one morning the bottle found a purchaser in the apprentice who was told to bring one of the best bottles of wine it was placed in the provision basket with ham and cheese and sausages the sweetest fresh butter and the finest bread were put into the basket by the daughter herself for she packed it she was young and pretty her brown eyes laughed and a smile lingered round her mouth as sweet as that in her eyes she had delicate hands beautifully white and her neck was whiter still it could easily be seen that she was a very lovely girl and as yet she was not engaged the provision basket lay in the lap of the young girl as the family drove out to the forest and the neck of the bottle peeped out from between the folds of the white napkin there was the red wax on the cork and the bottle looked straight at the young face and also at the face of the young sailor who sat near her he was a young friend the son of a portrait painter he had lately passed his examination with honor as mate and the next morning he was to sail in his ship to a distant coast there had been a great deal of talk on this subject while the basket was being packed and during this conversation the eyes and the mouth of the daughter did not wear a very joyful expression the young people wandered away into the green wood and talked together what did they talk about the bottle could not say for he was in the provision basket it remained there a long time but when at last it was brought forth it appeared as if something pleasant had happened for every one was laughing the daughter laughed too but she said very little and her cheeks were like two roses then her father took the bottle and the into his hands what a strange sensation it was to have the cork drawn for the first time the bottle could never after that forget the performance of that moment indeed there was quite a convulsion within him as the cork flew out and a gurgling sound as the wine was poured forth into the glasses 
 long life to the betrothed cried the papa and every glass 
 was emptied to the dregs while the young sailor kissed his 
 beautiful bride 
 
 happiness and blessing to you both said the old 
 and mother and the young man filled the glasses again 
 
 safe return and a wedding this day next year he cried and 
 when the glasses were empty he took the bottle raised it on high and 
 said thou hast been present here on the happiest day of my life 
 thou shalt never be used by others so saying he hurled it high in 
 the air 
 
 the daughter thought she should never see it again 
 but she was mistaken it fell among the rushes on the borders of a 
 little woodland lake the bottle neck remembered well how long it 
 lay there unseen i gave them wine and they gave me muddy water he had said to himself but i suppose it was all well meant he could no longer see the betrothed couple nor the cheerful old people but for a long time he could hear them rejoicing and singing at length 
 there came by two peasant boys who peeped in among the reeds and 
 spied out the bottle then they took it up and carried it home with 
 them so that once more it was provided for at home in their wooden cottage these boys had an elder brother a sailor who was about to start on a long voyage he had been there the day before to say farewell and his mother was now very busy packing up various things for him to take with him on his voyage in the evening his father 
 was going to carry the parcel to the town to see his son once more 
 and take him a farewell greeting from his mother a small bottle had 
 already been filled with herb tea mixed with brandy and wrapped in a 
 parcel but when the boys came in they brought with them a larger 
 and stronger bottle which they had found this bottle would hold so 
 much more than the little one and they all said the brandy would be 
 so good for complaints of the stomach especially as it was mixed with medical herbs the liquid which they now poured into the bottle was not like the red wine with which it had once been filled these were bitter drops but they are of great use the stomach the new large bottle was to go not the little one so the bottle once more started on its travels it was taken on board for peter jensen was one of the crew the very same ship in which the young mate was to sail but the mate did not see the bottle indeed if he had he would not have known it or supposed it was the one out of which they had drunk to the felicity of the betrothed and to the prospect of a marriage on his own happy return certainly the bottle no longer poured forth wine but it contained something quite as good and so it happened that whenever peter jensen brought it out his messmates gave it the name of the apothecary for it contained the best medicine to cure the stomach and he gave it out quite willingly as long as a drop remained those were happy days and the bottle would sing when rubbed with a cork and it was called a great lark peter lark long days and months rolled by during which the bottle stood empty in a corner when a storm arose whether on the passage out or home it could not tell for it had never been ashore it was a terrible storm great waves arose darkly heaving and tossing the vessel to and fro the main mast was split asunder the ship sprang a leak and the pumps became useless while all around was black as night at the last moment when the ship was sinking the young mate wrote on a piece of paper we are going down will be done 
 
 then he wrote the name of his betrothed his own name and that of the ship then he put the leaf in an empty bottle that happened to be at hand corked it down tightly and threw it into the foaming sea he 
 knew not that it was the very same bottle from which the goblet of joy 
 and hope had once been filled for him and now it was tossing on the 
 waves with his last greeting and a message from the dead the ship 
 sank and the crew sank with her but the bottle flew on like a 
 bird for it bore within it a loving letter from a loving heart and 
 as the sun rose and set the bottle felt as at the time of its first 
 existence when in the heated glowing stove it had a longing to fly 
 away it outlived the storms and the calm it struck against no rocks 
 was not devoured by sharks but drifted on for more than a year 
 sometimes towards the north sometimes towards the south just as 
 the current carried it it was in all other ways its own master but 
 even of that one may get tired the written leaf the last farewell of 
 the bridegroom to his bride would only bring sorrow when once it 
 reached her hands but where were those hands so soft and delicate 
 which had once spread the on the fresh grass in the 
 green wood on the day of her betrothal ah yes where was the 
 daughter and where was the land which might lie nearest 
 to her home 
 
 the bottle knew not it travelled onward and onward and at last 
 all this wandering about became wearisome at all events it was not 
 its usual occupation but it had to travel till at length it 
 reached land a foreign country not a word spoken in this country 
 could the bottle understand it was a language it had never before 
 heard and it is a great loss not to be able to understand a language 
 
 the bottle was fished out of the water and examined on all sides 
 the little letter contained within it was discovered taken out and 
 turned and twisted in every direction but the people could not 
 understand what was written upon it they could be quite sure that the bottle had been thrown overboard from a vessel and that something about it was written on this paper but what was written that was the question so the paper was put back into the bottle and then both were put away in a large cupboard of one of the great houses of the town whenever any strangers arrived the paper was taken out and turned over and over so that the address which was only written in pencil became almost illegible and at last no one could distinguish any letters on it at all for a whole year the bottle 
 remained standing in the cupboard and then it was taken up to the 
 loft where it soon became covered with dust and cobwebs ah how 
 often then it thought of those better days of the times when in the 
 fresh green wood it had poured forth rich wine or while rocked 
 by the swelling waves it had carried in its bosom a secret a letter 
 a last parting sigh for full twenty years it stood in the loft and 
 it might have stayed there longer but that the house was going to be 
 rebuilt the bottle was discovered when the roof was taken off they 
 talked about it but the bottle did not understand what they said a 
 language is not to be learnt by living in a loft even for twenty 
 years if i had been down stairs in the room thought the bottle i 
 might have learnt it it was now washed and rinsed which process was really quite necessary and afterwards it looked clean and 
 transparent and felt young again in its old age but the paper 
 which it had carried so faithfully was destroyed in the washing 
 they filled the bottle with seeds though it scarcely knew what had 
 been placed in it then they corked it down tightly and carefully 
 wrapped it up there not even the light of a torch or lantern could 
 reach it much less the brightness of the sun or moon and yet 
 thought the bottle men go on a journey that they may see as much 
 as possible and i can see nothing however it did something quite 
 as important it travelled to the place of its destination and was 
 unpacked 
 
 what trouble they have taken with that bottle over yonder 
 said one and very likely it is broken after all but the bottle 
 was not broken and better still it understood every word that was 
 said this language it had heard at the furnaces and at the wine 
 in the forest and on the ship it was the only good old 
 language it could understand it had returned home and the language 
 was as a welcome greeting for very joy it felt ready to jump out 
 of hands and scarcely noticed that its cork had been 
 drawn and its contents emptied out till it found itself carried to a 
 cellar to be left there and forgotten no place like home 
 even if a cellar it never occurred to him to think that he 
 might lie there for years he felt so comfortable for many long years 
 he remained in the cellar till at last some people came to carry away 
 the bottles and ours amongst the number 
 
 out in the garden there was a great festival brilliant lamps hung 
 in festoons from tree to tree and paper lanterns through which the 
 light shone till they looked like transparent tulips it was a beautiful evening and the weather mild and clear the stars twinkled 
 and the new moon in the form of a crescent was surrounded by the 
 shadowy disc of the whole moon and looked like a gray globe with a 
 golden rim it was a beautiful sight for those who had good eyes 
 
 the illumination extended even to the most retired of the garden 
 walks at least not so retired that any one need lose himself there 
 in the borders were placed bottles each containing a light and among 
 them the bottle with which we are acquainted and whose fate it was 
 one day to be only a bottle neck and to serve as a to 
 a everything here appeared lovely to our bottle for it 
 was again in the green wood amid joy and feasting again it heard 
 music and song and the noise and murmur of a crowd especially in 
 that part of the garden where the lamps blazed and the paper lanterns 
 displayed their brilliant colors it stood in a distant walk certainly but a place pleasant for contemplation and it carried a light and was at once useful and ornamental in such an hour it is easy to forget that one has spent twenty years in a loft and a good thing it is to be able to do so close before the bottle passed a single pair like the bridal pair the mate and the daughter who had so long ago wandered in the wood it seemed to the bottle as if he were living that time over again not only the guests but other people were walking in the garden who were allowed to witness the splendor and the festivities among the latter came an old maid who seemed to be quite alone in the world she was thinking like the bottle of the green wood and of a young betrothed pair who were closely connected with herself she was thinking of that hour the happiest of her life in which she had taken part when she had herself been one of that betrothed pair such hours are never to be forgotten let a maiden be as old as she may but she did not recognize the bottle neither did the bottle notice the old maid and so we often pass each other in the world when we meet as did these two even while together in the same town 
 the bottle was taken from the garden and again sent to a wine 
 merchant where it was once more filled with wine and sold to an 
 aeronaut who was to make an ascent in his balloon on the following 
 sunday a great crowd assembled to witness the sight military music 
 had been engaged and many other preparations made the bottle saw 
 it all from the basket in which he lay close to a live rabbit the 
 rabbit was quite excited because he knew that he was to be taken up 
 and let down again in a parachute the bottle however knew nothing 
 of the up or the down he saw only that the balloon was 
 swelling larger and larger till it could swell no more and began to 
 rise and be restless then the ropes which held it were cut through 
 and the aerial ship rose in the air with the aeronaut and the basket 
 containing the bottle and the rabbit while the music sounded and 
 all the people shouted hurrah 
 
 this is a wonderful journey up into the air thought the bottle 
 
 it is a new way of sailing and here at least there is no fear of 
 striking against anything 
 
 thousands of people gazed at the balloon and the old maid who was 
 in the garden saw it also for she stood at the open window of the 
 garret by which hung the cage containing the linnet who then had 
 no but was obliged to be contented with an old cup in 
 the stood a myrtle in a pot and this had been pushed a 
 little on one side that it might not fall out for the old maid was 
 leaning out of the window that she might see and she did see 
 distinctly the aeronaut in the balloon and how he let down the rabbit 
 in the parachute and then drank to the health of all the spectators 
 in the wine from the bottle after doing this he hurled it high 
 into the air how little she thought that this was the very same 
 bottle which her friend had thrown aloft in her honor on that happy 
 day of rejoicing in the green wood in her youthful days the 
 bottle had no time to think when raised so suddenly and before it 
 was aware it reached the highest point it had ever attained in its 
 life steeples and roofs lay far far beneath it and the people 
 looked as tiny as possible then it began to descend much more rapidly than the rabbit had done made somersaults in the air and felt itself quite young and unfettered although it was half full of wine but 
 this did not last long what a journey it was all the people could 
 see the bottle for the sun shone upon it the balloon was already far 
 away and very soon the bottle was far away also for it fell upon a 
 roof and broke in pieces but the pieces had got such an impetus in 
 them that they could not stop themselves they went jumping and 
 rolling about till at last they fell into the and were 
 broken into still smaller pieces only the neck of the bottle 
 managed to keep whole and it was broken off as clean as if it had 
 been cut with a diamond 
 
 that would make a capital glass said one of the 
 but none of them had either a bird or a cage and it was 
 not to be expected they would provide one just because they had 
 found a bottle neck that could be used as a glass but the old maid 
 who lived in the garret had a bird and it really might be useful to 
 her so the bottle neck was provided with a cork and taken up to her 
 and as it often happens in life the part that had been uppermost was 
 now turned downwards and it was filled with fresh water then they 
 hung it in the cage of the little bird who sang and twittered more 
 merrily than ever 
 
 ah you have good reason to sing said the bottle neck which 
 was looked upon as something very remarkable because it had been in a balloon nothing further was known of its history as it hung there in the it could hear the noise and murmur of the people in 
 the street below as well as the conversation of the old maid in the 
 room within an old friend had just come to visit her and they 
 talked not about the bottle neck but of the myrtle in the window 
 no you must not spend a dollar for your bridal 
 bouquet said the old maid you shall have a beautiful little 
 bunch for a nosegay full of blossoms do you see how splendidly the tree has grown it has been raised from only a little sprig of 
 myrtle that you gave me on the day after my betrothal and from 
 which i was to make my own bridal bouquet when a year had passed 
 but that day never came the eyes were closed which were to have 
 been my light and joy through life in the depths of the sea my 
 beloved sleeps sweetly the myrtle has become an old tree and i am 
 a still older woman before the sprig you gave me faded i took a 
 spray and planted it in the earth and now as you see it has become 
 a large tree and a bunch of the blossoms shall at last appear at a 
 wedding festival in the bouquet of your daughter 
 
 there were tears in the eyes of the old maid as she spoke of 
 the beloved of her youth and of their betrothal in the wood many 
 thoughts came into her mind but the thought never came that quite 
 close to her in that very window was a remembrance of those olden 
 times the neck of the bottle which had as it were shouted for joy 
 when the cork flew out with a bang on the betrothal day but the 
 bottle neck did not recognize the old maid he had not been 
 listening to what she had related perhaps because he was thinking 
 so much about her

 then he wrote the name of his betrothed his own name and that of the ship then he put the leaf in an empty bottle that happened to be at hand corked it down tightly and threw it into the foaming sea he 
 knew not that it was the very same bottle from which the goblet of joy 
 and hope had once been filled for him and now it was tossing on the 
 waves with his last greeting and a message from the dead the ship 
 sank and the crew sank with her but the bottle flew on like a 
 bird for it bore within it a loving letter from a loving heart and 
 as the sun rose and set the bottle felt as at the time of its first 
 existence when in the heated glowing stove it had a longing to fly 
 away it outlived the storms and the calm it struck against no rocks 
 was not devoured by sharks but drifted on for more than a year 
 sometimes towards the north sometimes towards the south just as 
 the current carried it it was in all other ways its own master but 
 even of that one may get tired the written leaf the last farewell of 
 the bridegroom to his bride would only bring sorrow when once it 
 reached her hands but where were those hands so soft and delicate 
 which had once spread the on the fresh grass in the 
 green wood on the day of her betrothal ah yes where was the 
 daughter and where was the land which might lie nearest 
 to her home 
 
 the bottle knew not it travelled onward and onward and at last 
 all this wandering about became wearisome at all events it was not 
 its usual occupation but it had to travel till at length it 
 reached land a foreign country not a word spoken in this country 
 could the bottle understand it was a language it had never before 
 heard and it is a great loss not to be able to understand a language 
 
 the bottle was fished out of the water and examined on all sides 
 the little letter contained within it was discovered taken out and 
 turned and twisted in every direction but the people could not 
 understand what was written upon it they could be quite sure that the bottle had been thrown overboard from a vessel and that something about it was written on this paper but what was written that was the question so the paper was put back into the bottle and then both were put away in a large cupboard of one of the great houses of the town whenever any strangers arrived the paper was taken out and turned over and over so that the address which was only written in pencil became almost illegible and at last no one could distinguish any letters on it at all for a whole year the bottle 
 remained standing in the cupboard and then it was taken up to the 
 loft where it soon became covered with dust and cobwebs ah how 
 often then it thought of those better days of the times when in the 
 fresh green wood it had poured forth rich wine or while rocked 
 by the swelling waves it had carried in its bosom a secret a letter 
 a last parting sigh for full twenty years it stood in the loft and 
 it might have stayed there longer but that the house was going to be 
 rebuilt the bottle was discovered when the roof was taken off they 
 talked about it but the bottle did not understand what they said a 
 language is not to be learnt by living in a loft even for twenty 
 years if i had been down stairs in the room thought the bottle i 
 might have learnt it it was now washed and rinsed which process was really quite necessary and afterwards it looked clean and 
 transparent and felt young again in its old age but the paper 
 which it had carried so faithfully was destroyed in the washing 
 they filled the bottle with seeds though it scarcely knew what had 
 been placed in it then they corked it down tightly and carefully 
 wrapped it up there not even the light of a torch or lantern could 
 reach it much less the brightness of the sun or moon and yet 
 thought the bottle men go on a journey that they may see as much 
 as possible and i can see nothing however it did something quite 
 as important it travelled to the place of its destination and was 
 unpacked 
 
 what trouble they have taken with that bottle over yonder 
 said one and very likely it is broken after all but the bottle 
 was not broken and better still it understood every word that was 
 said this language it had heard at the furnaces and at the wine 
 in the forest and on the ship it was the only good old 
 language it could understand it had returned home and the language 
 was as a welcome greeting for very joy it felt ready to jump out 
 of hands and scarcely noticed that its cork had been 
 drawn and its contents emptied out till it found itself carried to a 
 cellar to be left there and forgotten no place like home 
 even if a cellar it never occurred to him to think that he 
 might lie there for years he felt so comfortable for many long years 
 he remained in the cellar till at last some people came to carry away 
 the bottles and ours amongst the number 
 
 out in the garden there was a great festival brilliant lamps hung 
 in festoons from tree to tree and paper lanterns through which the 
 light shone till they looked like transparent tulips it was a beautiful evening and the weather mild and clear the stars twinkled 
 and the new moon in the form of a crescent was surrounded by the 
 shadowy disc of the whole moon and looked like a gray globe with a 
 golden rim it was a beautiful sight for those who had good eyes 
 
 the illumination extended even to the most retired of the garden 
 walks at least not so retired that any one need lose himself there 
 in the borders were placed bottles each containing a light and among 
 them the bottle with which we are acquainted and whose fate it was 
 one day to be only a bottle neck and to serve as a to 
 a everything here appeared lovely to our bottle for it 
 was again in the green wood amid joy and feasting again it heard 
 music and song and the noise and murmur of a crowd especially in 
 that part of the garden where the lamps blazed and the paper lanterns 
 displayed their brilliant colors it stood in a distant walk certainly but a place pleasant for contemplation and it carried a light and was at once useful and ornamental in such an hour it is easy to forget that one has spent twenty years in a loft and a good thing it is to be able to do so close before the bottle passed a single pair like the bridal pair the mate and the daughter who had so long ago wandered in the wood it seemed to the bottle as if he were living that time over again not only the guests but other people were walking in the garden who were allowed to witness the splendor and the festivities among the latter came an old maid who seemed to be quite alone in the world she was thinking like the bottle of the green wood and of a young betrothed pair who were closely connected with herself she was thinking of that hour the happiest of her life in which she had taken part when she had herself been one of that betrothed pair such hours are never to be forgotten let a maiden be as old as she may but she did not recognize the bottle neither did the bottle notice the old maid and so we often pass each other in the world when we meet as did these two even while together in the same town 
 the bottle was taken from the garden and again sent to a wine 
 merchant where it was once more filled with wine and sold to an 
 aeronaut who was to make an ascent in his balloon on the following 
 sunday a great crowd assembled to witness the sight military music 
 had been engaged and many other preparations made the bottle saw 
 it all from the basket in which he lay close to a live rabbit the 
 rabbit was quite excited because he knew that he was to be taken up 
 and let down again in a parachute the bottle however knew nothing 
 of the up or the down he saw only that the balloon was 
 swelling larger and larger till it could swell no more and began to 
 rise and be restless then the ropes which held it were cut through 
 and the aerial ship rose in the air with the aeronaut and the basket 
 containing the bottle and the rabbit while the music sounded and 
 all the people shouted hurrah 
 
 this is a wonderful journey up into the air thought the bottle 
 
 it is a new way of sailing and here at least there is no fear of 
 striking against anything 
 
 thousands of people gazed at the balloon and the old maid who was 
 in the garden saw it also for she stood at the open window of the 
 garret by which hung the cage containing the linnet who then had 
 no but was obliged to be contented with an old cup in 
 the stood a myrtle in a pot and this had been pushed a 
 little on one side that it might not fall out for the old maid was 
 leaning out of the window that she might see and she did see 
 distinctly the aeronaut in the balloon and how he let down the rabbit 
 in the parachute and then drank to the health of all the spectators 
 in the wine from the bottle after doing this he hurled it high 
 into the air how little she thought that this was the very same 
 bottle which her friend had thrown aloft in her honor on that happy 
 day of rejoicing in the green wood in her youthful days the 
 bottle had no time to think when raised so suddenly and before it 
 was aware it reached the highest point it had ever attained in its 
 life steeples and roofs lay far far beneath it and the people 
 looked as tiny as possible then it began to descend much more rapidly than the rabbit had done made somersaults in the air and felt itself quite young and unfettered although it was half full of wine but 
 this did not last long what a journey it was all the people could 
 see the bottle for the sun shone upon it the balloon was already far 
 away and very soon the bottle was far away also for it fell upon a 
 roof and broke in pieces but the pieces had got such an impetus in 
 them that they could not stop themselves they went jumping and 
 rolling about till at last they fell into the and were 
 broken into still smaller pieces only the neck of the bottle 
 managed to keep whole and it was broken off as clean as if it had 
 been cut with a diamond 
 
 that would make a capital glass said one of the 
 but none of them had either a bird or a cage and it was 
 not to be expected they would provide one just because they had 
 found a bottle neck that could be used as a glass but the old maid 
 who lived in the garret had a bird and it really might be useful to 
 her so the bottle neck was provided with a cork and taken up to her 
 and as it often happens in life the part that had been uppermost was 
 now turned downwards and it was filled with fresh water then they 
 hung it in the cage of the little bird who sang and twittered more 
 merrily than ever 
 
 ah you have good reason to sing said the bottle neck which 
 was looked upon as something very remarkable because it had been in a balloon nothing further was known of its history as it hung there in the it could hear the noise and murmur of the people in 
 the street below as well as the conversation of the old maid in the 
 room within an old friend had just come to visit her and they 
 talked not about the bottle neck but of the myrtle in the window 
 no you must not spend a dollar for your bridal 
 bouquet said the old maid you shall have a beautiful little 
 bunch for a nosegay full of blossoms do you see how splendidly the tree has grown it has been raised from only a little sprig of 
 myrtle that you gave me on the day after my betrothal and from 
 which i was to make my own bridal bouquet when a year had passed 
 but that day never came the eyes were closed which were to have 
 been my light and joy through life in the depths of the sea my 
 beloved sleeps sweetly the myrtle has become an old tree and i am 
 a still older woman before the sprig you gave me faded i took a 
 spray and planted it in the earth and now as you see it has become 
 a large tree and a bunch of the blossoms shall at last appear at a 
 wedding festival in the bouquet of your daughter 
 
 there were tears in the eyes of the old maid as she spoke of 
 the beloved of her youth and of their betrothal in the wood many 
 thoughts came into her mind but the thought never came that quite 
 close to her in that very window was a remembrance of those olden 
 times the neck of the bottle which had as it were shouted for joy 
 when the cork flew out with a bang on the betrothal day but the 
 bottle neck did not recognize the old maid he had not been 
 listening to what she had related perhaps because he was thinking 
 so much about her

 book confide is sometimes to deliver into a power 
 chapter i 
 
 one mother meets another mother 
 there was at montfermeil near paris during the first quarter of this century a sort of which no longer exists this was kept by some people named thenardier husband and wife 
 it was situated in boulanger lane 
 over the door there was a board nailed flat against the wall 
 upon this board was painted something which resembled a man carrying another man on his back the latter wearing the big gilt epaulettes of a general with large silver stars red spots represented blood the rest of the picture consisted of smoke and probably represented a battle below ran this inscription 
 at the sign of sergeant of waterloo au sargent de waterloo 
 nothing is more common than a cart or a truck at the door of a hostelry 
 nevertheless the vehicle or to speak more accurately the fragment of a vehicle which encumbered the street in front of the of the sergeant of waterloo one evening in the spring of would certainly have attracted by its mass the attention of any painter who had passed that way 
 it was the of one of those trucks which are used in wooded tracts of country and which serve to transport thick planks and the trunks of trees 
 this was composed of a massive iron with a pivot into which was fitted a heavy shaft and which was supported by two huge wheels the whole thing was compact overwhelming and misshapen it seemed like the of an enormous cannon 
 the ruts of the road had bestowed on the wheels the fellies the hub the axle and the shaft a layer of mud a hideous yellowish daubing hue tolerably like that with which people are fond of ornamenting cathedrals the wood was disappearing under mud and the iron beneath rust under the hung like drapery a huge chain worthy of some goliath of a convict 
 this chain suggested not the beams which it was its office to transport but the mastodons and mammoths which it might have served to harness it had the air of the galleys but of cyclopean and superhuman galleys and it seemed to have been detached from some monster 
 homer would have bound polyphemus with it and shakespeare caliban 
 why was that of a truck in that place in the street in the first place to encumber the street next in order that it might finish the process of rusting 
 there is a throng of institutions in the old social order which one comes across in this fashion as one walks about outdoors and which have no other reasons for existence than the above 
 the centre of the chain swung very near the ground in the middle and in the loop as in the rope of a swing there were seated and grouped on that particular evening in exquisite interlacement two little girls one about two years and a half old the other eighteen months the younger in the arms of the other 
 a handkerchief cleverly knotted about them prevented their falling out a mother had caught sight of that frightful chain and had said come a plaything for my children 
 the two children who were dressed prettily and with some elegance were radiant with pleasure one would have said that they were two roses amid old iron their eyes were a triumph their fresh cheeks were full of laughter 
 one had chestnut hair the other brown their innocent faces were two delighted surprises a blossoming shrub which grew near wafted to the perfumes which seemed to emanate from them the child of eighteen months displayed her pretty little bare stomach with the chaste indecency of childhood above and around these two delicate heads all made of happiness and steeped in light the gigantic black with rust almost terrible all entangled in curves and wild angles rose in a vault like the entrance of a cavern 
 a few paces apart crouching down upon the threshold of the hostelry the mother not a very prepossessing woman by the way though touching at that moment was swinging the two children by means of a long cord watching them carefully for fear of accidents with that animal and celestial expression which is peculiar to maternity 
 at every backward and forward swing the hideous links emitted a strident sound which resembled a cry of rage the little girls were in ecstasies the setting sun mingled in this joy and nothing could be more charming than this caprice of chance which had made of a chain of titans the swing of cherubim 
 as she rocked her little ones the mother hummed in a discordant voice a romance then celebrated 
 it must be said a warrior 
 her song and the contemplation of her daughters prevented her hearing and seeing what was going on in the street 
 in the meantime some one had approached her as she was beginning the first couplet of the romance and suddenly she heard a voice saying very near her ear 
 you have two beautiful children there madame 
 to the fair and tender imogene 
 replied the mother continuing her romance then she turned her head 
 a woman stood before her a few paces distant 
 this woman also had a child which she carried in her arms 
 she was carrying in addition a large which seemed very heavy 
 this child was one of the most divine creatures that it is possible to behold 
 lt was a girl two or three years of age she could have entered into competition with the two other little ones so far as the coquetry of her dress was concerned she wore a cap of fine linen ribbons on her bodice and valenciennes lace on her cap the folds of her skirt were raised so as to permit a view of her white firm and dimpled leg 
 she was admirably rosy and healthy the little beauty inspired a desire to take a bite from the apples of her cheeks 
 of her eyes nothing could be known except that they must be very large and that they had magnificent lashes she was asleep 
 she slept with that slumber of absolute confidence peculiar to her age 
 the arms of mothers are made of tenderness in them children sleep profoundly 
 as for the mother her appearance was sad and she was dressed like a who is inclined to turn into a peasant again 
 she was young 
 was she handsome 
 perhaps but in that attire it was not apparent 
 her hair a golden lock of which had escaped seemed very thick but was severely concealed beneath an ugly tight close cap tied under the chin 
 a smile displays beautiful teeth when one has them but she did not smile her eyes did not seem to have been dry for a very long time she was pale she had a very weary and rather sickly appearance she gazed upon her daughter asleep in her arms with the air peculiar to a mother who has nursed her own child 
 a large blue handkerchief such as the invalides use was folded into a fichu and concealed her figure clumsily 
 her hands were sunburnt and all dotted with freckles her forefinger was hardened and lacerated with the needle she wore a cloak of coarse brown woollen stuff a linen gown and coarse shoes it was fantine 
 it was fantine but difficult to recognize 
 nevertheless on scrutinizing her attentively it was evident that she still retained her beauty a melancholy fold which resembled the beginning of irony wrinkled her right cheek 
 as for her toilette that aerial toilette of muslin and ribbons which seemed made of mirth of folly and of music full of bells and perfumed with lilacs had vanished like that beautiful and dazzling which is mistaken for diamonds in the sunlight it melts and leaves the branch quite black 
 ten months had elapsed since the pretty farce 
 what had taken place during those ten months 
 it can be divined 
 after abandonment straightened circumstances 
 fantine had immediately lost sight of favourite zephine and dahlia the bond once broken on the side of the men it was loosed between the women they would have been greatly astonished had any one told them a fortnight later that they had been friends there no longer existed any reason for such a thing 
 fantine had remained alone the father of her child such ruptures are irrevocable she found herself absolutely isolated minus the habit of work and plus the taste for pleasure 
 drawn away by her liaison with tholomyes to disdain the pretty trade which she knew she had neglected to keep her market open it was now closed to her 
 she had no resource fantine barely knew how to read and did not know how to write in her childhood she had only been taught to sign her name she had a public indite an epistle to tholomyes then a second then a third 
 tholomyes replied to none of them fantine heard the gossips say as they looked at her child who takes those children seriously 
 one only shrugs shoulders over such children 
 then she thought of tholomyes who had shrugged his shoulders over his child and who did not take that innocent being seriously and her heart grew gloomy toward that man but what was she to do 
 she no longer knew to whom to apply she had committed a fault but the foundation of her nature as will be remembered was modesty and virtue 
 she was vaguely conscious that she was on the verge of falling into distress and of gliding into a worse state 
 courage was necessary she possessed it and held herself firm 
 the idea of returning to her native town of m sur m occurred to her 
 there some one might possibly know her and give her work yes but it would be necessary to conceal her fault 
 in a confused way she perceived the necessity of a separation which would be more painful than the first one her heart contracted but she took her resolution 
 fantine as we shall see had the fierce bravery of life 
 she had already valiantly renounced finery had dressed herself in linen and had put all her silks all her ornaments all her ribbons and all her laces on her daughter the only vanity which was left to her and a holy one it was 
 she sold all that she had which produced for her two hundred francs her little debts paid she had only about eighty francs left 
 at the age of on a beautiful spring morning she quitted paris bearing her child on her back any one who had seen these two pass would have had pity on them this woman had in all the world nothing but her child and the child had in all the world no one but this woman 
 fantine had nursed her child and this had tired her chest and she coughed a little 
 we shall have no further occasion to speak of m felix tholomyes let us confine ourselves to saying that twenty years later under king louis philippe he was a great provincial lawyer wealthy and influential a wise elector and a very severe juryman he was still a man of pleasure 
 towards the middle of the day after having from time to time for the sake of resting herself travelled for three or four sous a league in what was then known as the petites voitures des environs de paris the little suburban coach service fantine found herself at montfermeil in the alley boulanger 
 as she passed the thenardier hostelry the two little girls blissful in the monster swing had dazzled her in a manner and she had halted in front of that vision of joy 
 charms exist 
 these two little girls were a charm to this mother 
 she gazed at them in much emotion 
 the presence of angels is an announcement of paradise 
 she thought that above this inn she beheld the mysterious here of providence 
 these two little creatures were evidently happy 
 she gazed at them she admired them in such emotion that at the moment when their mother was recovering her breath between two couplets of her song she could not refrain from addressing to her the remark which we have just read 
 you have two pretty children madame 
 the most ferocious creatures are disarmed by caresses bestowed on their young 
 the mother raised her head and thanked her and bade the wayfarer sit down on the bench at the door she herself being seated on the threshold 
 the two women began to chat 
 my name is madame thenardier said the mother of the two little girls we keep this inn 
 then her mind still running on her romance she resumed humming between her teeth 
 it must be so i am a knight 
 and i am off to palestine 
 this madame thenardier was a woman thin and angular the type of the wife in all its unpleasantness and what was odd with a languishing air which she owed to her perusal of romances 
 she was a simpering but masculine creature old romances produce that effect when rubbed against the imagination of woman 
 she was still young she was barely thirty if this crouching woman had stood upright her lofty stature and her frame of a perambulating colossus suitable for fairs might have frightened the traveller at the outset troubled her confidence and disturbed what caused what we have to relate to vanish a person who is seated instead of standing hang upon such a thing as that 
 the traveller told her story with slight modifications 
 that she was a that her husband was dead that her work in paris had failed her and that she was on her way to seek it elsewhere in her own native parts that she had left paris that morning on foot that as she was carrying her child and felt fatigued she had got into the villemomble coach when she met it that from villemomble she had come to montfermeil on foot that the little one had walked a little but not much because she was so young and that she had been obliged to take her up and the jewel had fallen asleep 
 at this word she bestowed on her daughter a passionate kiss which woke her 
 the child opened her eyes great blue eyes like her and looked 
 nothing with that serious and sometimes severe air of little children which is a mystery of their luminous innocence in the presence of our twilight of virtue 
 one would say that they feel themselves to be angels and that they know us to be men 
 then the child began to laugh and although the mother held fast to her she slipped to the ground with the unconquerable energy of a little being which wished to run all at once she caught sight of the two others in the swing stopped short and put out her tongue in sign of admiration 
 mother thenardier released her daughters made them descend from the swing and said 
 now amuse yourselves all three of you 
 children become acquainted quickly at that age and at the expiration of a minute the little thenardiers were playing with the at making holes in the ground which was an immense pleasure 
 the was very gay the goodness of the mother is written in the gayety of the child she had seized a scrap of wood which served her for a shovel and energetically dug a cavity big enough for a fly 
 the business becomes a subject for laughter when performed by a child 
 the two women pursued their chat 
 what is your little name 
 cosette 
 for cosette read euphrasie 
 the name was euphrasie but out of euphrasie the mother had made cosette by that sweet and graceful instinct of mothers and of the populace which changes josepha into pepita and francoise into sillette 
 it is a sort of derivative which disarranges and disconcerts the whole science of etymologists 
 we have known a grandmother who succeeded in turning theodore into gnon 
 how old is she 
 she is going on three 
 that is the age of my eldest 
 in the meantime the three little girls were grouped in an attitude of profound anxiety and blissfulness an event had happened a big worm had emerged from the ground and they were afraid and they were in ecstasies over it 
 their radiant brows touched each other one would have said that there were three heads in one aureole 
 how easily children get acquainted at once exclaimed mother thenardier one would swear that they were three sisters 
 this remark was probably the spark which the other mother had been waiting for 
 she seized the hand looked at her fixedly and said 
 will you keep my child for me 
 the thenardier made one of those movements of surprise which signify neither assent nor refusal 
 mother continued 
 you see i cannot take my daughter to the country 
 my work will not permit it 
 with a child one can find no situation people are ridiculous in the country 
 it was the good god who caused me to pass your inn 
 when i caught sight of your little ones so pretty so clean and so happy it overwhelmed me 
 i said here is a good mother 
 that is just the thing that will make three sisters 
 and then it will not be long before i return will you keep my child for me 
 i must see about it replied the thenardier 
 i will give you six francs a month 
 here a voice called from the depths of the 
 not for less than seven francs

 book confide is sometimes to deliver into a power 
 chapter i 
 
 one mother meets another mother 
 there was at montfermeil near paris during the first quarter of this century a sort of which no longer exists this was kept by some people named thenardier husband and wife 
 it was situated in boulanger lane 
 over the door there was a board nailed flat against the wall 
 upon this board was painted something which resembled a man carrying another man on his back the latter wearing the big gilt epaulettes of a general with large silver stars red spots represented blood the rest of the picture consisted of smoke and probably represented a battle below ran this inscription 
 at the sign of sergeant of waterloo au sargent de waterloo 
 nothing is more common than a cart or a truck at the door of a hostelry 
 nevertheless the vehicle or to speak more accurately the fragment of a vehicle which encumbered the street in front of the of the sergeant of waterloo one evening in the spring of would certainly have attracted by its mass the attention of any painter who had passed that way 
 it was the of one of those trucks which are used in wooded tracts of country and which serve to transport thick planks and the trunks of trees 
 this was composed of a massive iron with a pivot into which was fitted a heavy shaft and which was supported by two huge wheels the whole thing was compact overwhelming and misshapen it seemed like the of an enormous cannon 
 the ruts of the road had bestowed on the wheels the fellies the hub the axle and the shaft a layer of mud a hideous yellowish daubing hue tolerably like that with which people are fond of ornamenting cathedrals the wood was disappearing under mud and the iron beneath rust under the hung like drapery a huge chain worthy of some goliath of a convict 
 this chain suggested not the beams which it was its office to transport but the mastodons and mammoths which it might have served to harness it had the air of the galleys but of cyclopean and superhuman galleys and it seemed to have been detached from some monster 
 homer would have bound polyphemus with it and shakespeare caliban 
 why was that of a truck in that place in the street in the first place to encumber the street next in order that it might finish the process of rusting 
 there is a throng of institutions in the old social order which one comes across in this fashion as one walks about outdoors and which have no other reasons for existence than the above 
 the centre of the chain swung very near the ground in the middle and in the loop as in the rope of a swing there were seated and grouped on that particular evening in exquisite interlacement two little girls one about two years and a half old the other eighteen months the younger in the arms of the other 
 a handkerchief cleverly knotted about them prevented their falling out a mother had caught sight of that frightful chain and had said come a plaything for my children 
 the two children who were dressed prettily and with some elegance were radiant with pleasure one would have said that they were two roses amid old iron their eyes were a triumph their fresh cheeks were full of laughter 
 one had chestnut hair the other brown their innocent faces were two delighted surprises a blossoming shrub which grew near wafted to the perfumes which seemed to emanate from them the child of eighteen months displayed her pretty little bare stomach with the chaste indecency of childhood above and around these two delicate heads all made of happiness and steeped in light the gigantic black with rust almost terrible all entangled in curves and wild angles rose in a vault like the entrance of a cavern 
 a few paces apart crouching down upon the threshold of the hostelry the mother not a very prepossessing woman by the way though touching at that moment was swinging the two children by means of a long cord watching them carefully for fear of accidents with that animal and celestial expression which is peculiar to maternity 
 at every backward and forward swing the hideous links emitted a strident sound which resembled a cry of rage the little girls were in ecstasies the setting sun mingled in this joy and nothing could be more charming than this caprice of chance which had made of a chain of titans the swing of cherubim 
 as she rocked her little ones the mother hummed in a discordant voice a romance then celebrated 
 it must be said a warrior 
 her song and the contemplation of her daughters prevented her hearing and seeing what was going on in the street 
 in the meantime some one had approached her as she was beginning the first couplet of the romance and suddenly she heard a voice saying very near her ear 
 you have two beautiful children there madame 
 to the fair and tender imogene 
 replied the mother continuing her romance then she turned her head 
 a woman stood before her a few paces distant 
 this woman also had a child which she carried in her arms 
 she was carrying in addition a large which seemed very heavy 
 this child was one of the most divine creatures that it is possible to behold 
 lt was a girl two or three years of age she could have entered into competition with the two other little ones so far as the coquetry of her dress was concerned she wore a cap of fine linen ribbons on her bodice and valenciennes lace on her cap the folds of her skirt were raised so as to permit a view of her white firm and dimpled leg 
 she was admirably rosy and healthy the little beauty inspired a desire to take a bite from the apples of her cheeks 
 of her eyes nothing could be known except that they must be very large and that they had magnificent lashes she was asleep 
 she slept with that slumber of absolute confidence peculiar to her age 
 the arms of mothers are made of tenderness in them children sleep profoundly 
 as for the mother her appearance was sad and she was dressed like a who is inclined to turn into a peasant again 
 she was young 
 was she handsome 
 perhaps but in that attire it was not apparent 
 her hair a golden lock of which had escaped seemed very thick but was severely concealed beneath an ugly tight close cap tied under the chin 
 a smile displays beautiful teeth when one has them but she did not smile her eyes did not seem to have been dry for a very long time she was pale she had a very weary and rather sickly appearance she gazed upon her daughter asleep in her arms with the air peculiar to a mother who has nursed her own child 
 a large blue handkerchief such as the invalides use was folded into a fichu and concealed her figure clumsily 
 her hands were sunburnt and all dotted with freckles her forefinger was hardened and lacerated with the needle she wore a cloak of coarse brown woollen stuff a linen gown and coarse shoes it was fantine 
 it was fantine but difficult to recognize 
 nevertheless on scrutinizing her attentively it was evident that she still retained her beauty a melancholy fold which resembled the beginning of irony wrinkled her right cheek 
 as for her toilette that aerial toilette of muslin and ribbons which seemed made of mirth of folly and of music full of bells and perfumed with lilacs had vanished like that beautiful and dazzling which is mistaken for diamonds in the sunlight it melts and leaves the branch quite black 
 ten months had elapsed since the pretty farce 
 what had taken place during those ten months 
 it can be divined 
 after abandonment straightened circumstances 
 fantine had immediately lost sight of favourite zephine and dahlia the bond once broken on the side of the men it was loosed between the women they would have been greatly astonished had any one told them a fortnight later that they had been friends there no longer existed any reason for such a thing 
 fantine had remained alone the father of her child such ruptures are irrevocable she found herself absolutely isolated minus the habit of work and plus the taste for pleasure 
 drawn away by her liaison with tholomyes to disdain the pretty trade which she knew she had neglected to keep her market open it was now closed to her 
 she had no resource fantine barely knew how to read and did not know how to write in her childhood she had only been taught to sign her name she had a public indite an epistle to tholomyes then a second then a third 
 tholomyes replied to none of them fantine heard the gossips say as they looked at her child who takes those children seriously 
 one only shrugs shoulders over such children 
 then she thought of tholomyes who had shrugged his shoulders over his child and who did not take that innocent being seriously and her heart grew gloomy toward that man but what was she to do 
 she no longer knew to whom to apply she had committed a fault but the foundation of her nature as will be remembered was modesty and virtue 
 she was vaguely conscious that she was on the verge of falling into distress and of gliding into a worse state 
 courage was necessary she possessed it and held herself firm 
 the idea of returning to her native town of m sur m occurred to her 
 there some one might possibly know her and give her work yes but it would be necessary to conceal her fault 
 in a confused way she perceived the necessity of a separation which would be more painful than the first one her heart contracted but she took her resolution 
 fantine as we shall see had the fierce bravery of life 
 she had already valiantly renounced finery had dressed herself in linen and had put all her silks all her ornaments all her ribbons and all her laces on her daughter the only vanity which was left to her and a holy one it was 
 she sold all that she had which produced for her two hundred francs her little debts paid she had only about eighty francs left 
 at the age of on a beautiful spring morning she quitted paris bearing her child on her back any one who had seen these two pass would have had pity on them this woman had in all the world nothing but her child and the child had in all the world no one but this woman 
 fantine had nursed her child and this had tired her chest and she coughed a little 
 we shall have no further occasion to speak of m felix tholomyes let us confine ourselves to saying that twenty years later under king louis philippe he was a great provincial lawyer wealthy and influential a wise elector and a very severe juryman he was still a man of pleasure 
 towards the middle of the day after having from time to time for the sake of resting herself travelled for three or four sous a league in what was then known as the petites voitures des environs de paris the little suburban coach service fantine found herself at montfermeil in the alley boulanger 
 as she passed the thenardier hostelry the two little girls blissful in the monster swing had dazzled her in a manner and she had halted in front of that vision of joy 
 charms exist 
 these two little girls were a charm to this mother 
 she gazed at them in much emotion 
 the presence of angels is an announcement of paradise 
 she thought that above this inn she beheld the mysterious here of providence 
 these two little creatures were evidently happy 
 she gazed at them she admired them in such emotion that at the moment when their mother was recovering her breath between two couplets of her song she could not refrain from addressing to her the remark which we have just read 
 you have two pretty children madame 
 the most ferocious creatures are disarmed by caresses bestowed on their young 
 the mother raised her head and thanked her and bade the wayfarer sit down on the bench at the door she herself being seated on the threshold 
 the two women began to chat 
 my name is madame thenardier said the mother of the two little girls we keep this inn 
 then her mind still running on her romance she resumed humming between her teeth 
 it must be so i am a knight 
 and i am off to palestine 
 this madame thenardier was a woman thin and angular the type of the wife in all its unpleasantness and what was odd with a languishing air which she owed to her perusal of romances 
 she was a simpering but masculine creature old romances produce that effect when rubbed against the imagination of woman 
 she was still young she was barely thirty if this crouching woman had stood upright her lofty stature and her frame of a perambulating colossus suitable for fairs might have frightened the traveller at the outset troubled her confidence and disturbed what caused what we have to relate to vanish a person who is seated instead of standing hang upon such a thing as that 
 the traveller told her story with slight modifications 
 that she was a that her husband was dead that her work in paris had failed her and that she was on her way to seek it elsewhere in her own native parts that she had left paris that morning on foot that as she was carrying her child and felt fatigued she had got into the villemomble coach when she met it that from villemomble she had come to montfermeil on foot that the little one had walked a little but not much because she was so young and that she had been obliged to take her up and the jewel had fallen asleep 
 at this word she bestowed on her daughter a passionate kiss which woke her 
 the child opened her eyes great blue eyes like her and looked 
 nothing with that serious and sometimes severe air of little children which is a mystery of their luminous innocence in the presence of our twilight of virtue 
 one would say that they feel themselves to be angels and that they know us to be men 
 then the child began to laugh and although the mother held fast to her she slipped to the ground with the unconquerable energy of a little being which wished to run all at once she caught sight of the two others in the swing stopped short and put out her tongue in sign of admiration 
 mother thenardier released her daughters made them descend from the swing and said 
 now amuse yourselves all three of you 
 children become acquainted quickly at that age and at the expiration of a minute the little thenardiers were playing with the at making holes in the ground which was an immense pleasure 
 the was very gay the goodness of the mother is written in the gayety of the child she had seized a scrap of wood which served her for a shovel and energetically dug a cavity big enough for a fly 
 the business becomes a subject for laughter when performed by a child 
 the two women pursued their chat 
 what is your little name 
 cosette 
 for cosette read euphrasie 
 the name was euphrasie but out of euphrasie the mother had made cosette by that sweet and graceful instinct of mothers and of the populace which changes josepha into pepita and francoise into sillette 
 it is a sort of derivative which disarranges and disconcerts the whole science of etymologists 
 we have known a grandmother who succeeded in turning theodore into gnon 
 how old is she 
 she is going on three 
 that is the age of my eldest 
 in the meantime the three little girls were grouped in an attitude of profound anxiety and blissfulness an event had happened a big worm had emerged from the ground and they were afraid and they were in ecstasies over it 
 their radiant brows touched each other one would have said that there were three heads in one aureole 
 how easily children get acquainted at once exclaimed mother thenardier one would swear that they were three sisters 
 this remark was probably the spark which the other mother had been waiting for 
 she seized the hand looked at her fixedly and said 
 will you keep my child for me 
 the thenardier made one of those movements of surprise which signify neither assent nor refusal 
 mother continued 
 you see i cannot take my daughter to the country 
 my work will not permit it 
 with a child one can find no situation people are ridiculous in the country 
 it was the good god who caused me to pass your inn 
 when i caught sight of your little ones so pretty so clean and so happy it overwhelmed me 
 i said here is a good mother 
 that is just the thing that will make three sisters 
 and then it will not be long before i return will you keep my child for me 
 i must see about it replied the thenardier 
 i will give you six francs a month 
 here a voice called from the depths of the 
 not for less than seven francs 
 and six months paid in advance 
 six times seven makes said the thenardier 
 i will give it said the mother 
 and fifteen francs in addition for preliminary expenses added the voice 
 total francs said madame thenardier 
 and she hummed vaguely with these figures 
 it must be said a warrior 
 i will pay it said the mother 
 i have eighty francs 
 i shall have enough left to reach the country by travelling on foot i shall earn money there and as soon as i have a little i will return for my darling 
 the voice resumed 
 the little one has an outfit 
 that is my husband said the thenardier 
 of course she has an outfit the poor understood perfectly that it was your a beautiful outfit too a senseless outfit everything by the dozen and silk gowns like a lady 
 it is here in my 
 you must hand it over struck in the voice again 
 of course i shall give it to you said the mother 
 it would be very queer if i were to leave my daughter quite naked 
 the face appeared 
 good said he 
 the bargain was concluded 
 the mother passed the night at the inn gave up her money and left her child fastened her once more now reduced in volume by the removal of the outfit and light henceforth and set out on the following morning intending to return soon 
 people arrange such departures tranquilly but they are despairs 
 a neighbor of the thenardiers met this mother as she was setting out and came back with the remark 
 i have just seen a woman crying in the street so that it was enough to rend your heart 
 when mother had taken her departure the man said to the woman 
 that will serve to pay my note for one hundred and ten francs which falls due i lacked fifty francs

 return of the jedi 
 ix 
 
 the two space armadas like their counterparts of another time and floating ship to ship trading broadsides with each other in pointblankconfrontation 
 heroic sometimes suicidal maneuvers marked the day a rebel cruiser itsback alive with fires and explosions limped into direct contact with an imperial stardestroyer before exploding the star destroyer with it cargoships loaded with charge were set on collision courses with theircrews abandoning ships to fates that were uncertain at best 
 lando wedge blue leader and green wing went in to take out one of thelarger main communications ship it had already beendisabled by direct cannonade from the rebel cruiser it had subsequently its damages were the rebels had to strike while it was still lickingits wounds 
 squadron went in prevented thedestroyer from using its bigger guns it also made the fighters invisible until theywere directly visualized 
 increase power on the front deflector shields lando radioed his going in 
 right with you answered wedge close up formations team 
 they went into a perpendicular to the long axis of theimperial drops were hard to track fifty feet from the surface theypulled out at ninety degrees and raced along the gunmetal hull taking laserfire fromevery port 
 starting attack run on the main power tree lando advised 
 i copy answered green wing moving into position 
 stay clear of their front batteries warned blue leader 
 a heavy fire zone down there 
 in range 
 hurt bad on the left of the tower wedge noted concentrate on thatside 
 right with you 
 green wing was hit losing power 
 get clear going to blow 
 green wing took it down like riding a rocket into the front explosions rumbled the port bow 
 thanks blue leader said quietly to the conflagration 
 that opens it up for us yelled wedge cur over the power reactors arejust inside that cargo bay 
 follow me lando called pulling the falcon into a sharp bank that caught thehorrified reactor personnel by surprise wedge and blue followed suit they alldid their worst 
 direct hit lando shouted 
 there she goes 
 pull up pull up 
 they pulled up hard and fast as the destroyer was enveloped in a series explosions until it looked finally just like one more small star blueleader was caught by the shock wave and thrown horribly against the side of asmaller imperial ship which also exploded lando and wedge escaped 
 on the rebel command ship bridge smoke and shouts filled the air 
 ackbar reached calrissian on the comlink the jamming has stopped wehave a reading on the shield 
 is it still up lando responded with desperate anticipation in his voice 
 afraid so it looks like general unit make it 
 until destroyed our last ship still hope replied lando fail he still had to pick off that annoying death star 
 on the death star luke was nearly unconscious beneath the continuing assaultof the lightning tormented beyond reason betaken of a weakness thatdrained his very essence he hoped for nothing more than to submit to the nothingnesstoward which he was drifting 
 the emperor smiled down at the enfeebled young jedi as vader struggled to hisfeet beside his master 
 young fool palpatine rasped at luke only now at the end do youunderstand your puerile skills are no match for the power of the dark side youhave paid a price for your lack of vision now young skywalker you will pay theprice in full you will die 
 he laughed maniacally and although it would not have seemed possible to outpouring of bolts from the fingers actually increased in sound screamed through the room the murderous brightness of the flashes wasoverwhelming 
 body slowed wilted finally crumpled under the hideous barrage hestopped moving altogether at last he appeared totally lifeless the emperorhissed maliciously 
 at that instant vader sprang up and grabbed the emperor from behind upper arms to his torso weaker than ever been vader had lain stillthese last few minutes focusing his every fiber of being on this one only action possible his last if he failed ignoring pain ignoring his shameand his weaknesses ignoring the noise in his head he focused solelyand sightlessly on his will to defeat the evil embodied in the emperor 
 palpatine struggled in the grip of unfeeling embrace his hands stillshooting bolts of malign energy out in all directions in his wild flailing thelightning ripped across the room tearing into vader the dark lord fell currents crackling down his helmet over his cape into his heart 
 vader stumbled with his load to the middle of the bridge over the black chasmleading to the power core he held the wailing despot high over his head and with afinal spasm of strength hurled him into the abyss 
 body still spewing bolts of light spun out of control into the back and forth off the sides of the shaft as it fell it disappeared at last butthen a few seconds later a distant explosion could be heard far down at the core arush of air billowed out the shaft into the throne room 
 the wind whipped at lord cape as he staggered and collapsed towardthe hole trying to follow his master to the end luke crawled to his and pulled the dark lord away from the edge of the chasm to safety 
 both of them lay on the floor entwined in each other too weak to move toomoved to speak 
 inside the bunker on endor imperial controllers watched the main the ewok battle just outside though the image was clogged with static thefighting seemed to be winding down about time since initially been toldthat the locals on this moon were harmless nonbelligerents 
 the interference seemed to another antenna damaged in suddenly a walker pilot appeared on the screen waving excitedly 
 over commander the rebel have been routed and are fleeing with into the woods we need reinforcements to continue the pursuit 
 the bunker personnel all cheered the shield was safe 
 open the main door ordered the commander send three squads to help 
 the bunker door opened the imperial troops came rushing out only to findthemselves surrounded by rebels and ewoks looking bloody and mean theimperial troops surrendered without a fight 
 han chewie and five others ran into the bunker with the explosive placed the timed devices at eleven strategic points in and around the powergenerator then ran out again as fast as they could 
 leia still in great pain from her wounds lay in the sheltered comfort of somedistant bushes she was shouting orders to the ewoks to gather their prisoners onthe far side of the clearing away from the bunker when han and chewie tore for cover in the next moment the bunker went 
 it was a spectacular display explosion after explosion sending a wall of firehundreds of feet into the air creating a shock wave that knocked every living creatureoff its feet and charred all the greenery that faced the clearing 
 the bunker was destroyed 
 a captain ran up to admiral ackbar his voice tremulous sir the shieldaround the death star has lost its power 
 ackbar looked at the the electronically generated web was moon and the death star now floated in black empty unprotected space 
 they did it ackbar whispered 
 he rushed over to the comlink and shouted into the multifrequency war fighters commence attack on the death main reactor the deflectorshield is down repeat the deflector shield is down 
 voice was the next one heard i see it on our way redgroup gold group blue squad all fighters follow me my man my turn 
 the falcon plunged to the surface of the death star followed by hordes ofrebel fighters followed by a but disorganized array of imperial three rebel star cruisers headed for the huge imperial super stardestroyer flagship which seemed to be having difficulties with its guidancesystem 
 lando and the first wave of headed for the unfinished portion of thedeath star skimming low over the curving surface of the completed side 
 stay low until we get to the unfinished side wedge told his squad nobodyneeded to be told 
 squadron of enemy fighters coming 
 blue wing called lando take your group and draw the tie fighters away 
 do what i can 
 picking up interferencethe death jamming us i think 
 more fighters coming at ten 
 the superstructure lando called watch for the main reactor shaft 
 he turned hard into the unfinished side and began weaving dramatically amongprotruding girders towers mazelike channels temporary floodlights the antiaircraft defenses nearly as well developed been depending completely on the deflector shield for the major sources of worry for the rebels were the physical jeopardiesof the structure itself and the imperial tie fighters on their tails 
 i see system wedge radioed going in 
 i see it too agreed lando here goes nothing 
 this going to be easy 
 over a tower and under a suddenly they were flying at top speedinside a deep shaft that was barely wide enough for three fighters wing to it was pierced along its entire twisting length by myriad feeding shaftsand tunnels alternate forks and caverns and spiked in addition with analarming number of obstacles within the shaft itself heavy machinery structuralelements power cables floating stairways barrier piled debris 
 a score of rebel fighters made the first into the power shaft followedby twice that number of ties two lost its right away careening into aderrick to avoid the first volley of laser fire 
 the chase was on 
 where are we going gold leader wedge called out gaily a laserbolt hitthe shaft above him showering his window with sparks 
 lock onto the strongest power source lando suggested it should be thegenerator 
 red wing stay could run out of space real fast 
 they quickly strung out into single and double file as it started becomingapparent that the shaft was not only pocked with and protruding also narrowing across its width at every turn 
 tie fighters hit another rebel who exploded in flames then another tiefighter hit a piece of machinery with a similar result 
 got a reading on a major shaft obstruction ahead lando announced 
 just picked it up will you make it 
 going to be a tight squeeze 
 it was a tight squeeze it was a occluding three fourths of the a dip in the shaft at the same level to make up a little room lando had to spinthe falcon through degrees while rising falling and accelerating luckily and quite as bulky still two more of them make iton the downside the smaller ties drew closer 
 suddenly coarse white static blanketed all the 
 my gone yelled wedge 
 cut speed cautioned lando some kind of power discharge causinginterference 
 switch to visual scanning 
 useless at these have to fly nearly blind 
 two blind hit the wall as the shaft narrowed again a third was blownapart by the gaining imperial fighters 
 green leader called lando 
 copy gold leader 
 split off and head back to the just called for a fighter andyou might draw some fire off us 
 green leader and his cohort peeled off out of the power shaft back up to thecruiser battle one tie fighter followed firing continuously 
 voice came in over the comlink the death star is tuning away fromthe like repositioning to destroy the endor moon 
 how long before in position lando asked 
 point oh three 
 not enough time running out of time 
 wedge broke in the transmission well running out of shaft too 
 at that instant the falcon scraped through an even smaller opening this timeinjuring her auxiliary thrusters 
 that was too close muttered calrissian 
 gdzhng dzn nodded the copilot 
 ackbar stared out the observation window he was looking downonto the deck of the super star destroyer only miles away fires burst over theentire stern and the imperial warship was listing badly to starboard 
 knocked out their forward shields ackbar said into the comlink fireat the bridge 
 green group swooped in low from bottomside up from the death star 
 glad to help out called green leader 
 firing proton torpedoes green wing advised 
 the bridge was hit with kaleidoscopic results a rapid chain reaction got setoff from power station to power station along the middle third of the huge a dazzling rainbow of explosions that buckled the ship at right angles andstarted it spinning like a pinwheel toward the death star 
 the first bridge explosion took greed leader with it the subsequentuncontrolled joyride snagged ten more fighters two cruisers and an ordnance the time the whole exothermic conglomerate finally crashed into the side of thedeath star the impact was momentous enough to actually jolt the battle off internal explosions and thunderings all through its network of and halls 
 for the first time the death star rocked the collision with the explodingdestroyer was only the beginning leading to various systems breakdowns which ledto reactor meltdowns which led to personnel panic abandonment of posts furthermalfunctions and general chaos 
 smoke was everywhere substantial rumblings came from all directions at were running and shouting electrical fires steam explosions cabindepressurizations disruption of added to this the continuedbombardments by rebel fear in the heightenedthe sense of hysteria that was already pervasive 
 for the emperor was dead the central powerful evil that had been thecohesive force to the empire was gone and when the dark side was this diffused was simply where it led 
 confusion 
 desperation 
 damp fear 
 in the midst of this uproar luke had made it somehow to the main he was trying to carry the hulking deadweight of his weakeningbody toward an imperial shuttle halfway there his strength finally gave and he collapsed under the strain 
 slowly he rose again like an automaton he hoisted his body over hisshoulder and stumbled toward one of the last remaining shuttles 
 luke rested his father on the ground trying to collect strength one last time asexplosions grew louder all around them sparks hissed in the rafters one of thewalls buckled and smoke poured through a gaping fissure the floor shook 
 vader motioned luke closer to him luke help me take this mask off 
 luke shook his head die 
 the dark voice was weary nothing can stop that now just once letme face you without it let me look on you with my own eyes 
 luke was afraid afraid to see his father as he really was afraid to see whatperson could have become so same person fathered luke and to know the anakin skywalker who lived inside darth vader 
 vader too was let his son see him to remove this armored mask thathad been between them so long the black armored mask that had been his onlymeans of existing for over twenty years it had been his voice and his breath andhis shield against all human contact but now he would remove he would see his son before he died 
 together they lifted the heavy helmet from the maskportion a complicated breathing apparatus had to be disentangled a speakingmodulator and detached from the power unit in back but when themask was finally off and set aside luke gazed on his face 
 it was the sad benign face of an old man bald beardless with a mighty scarrunning from the top of his head to the back of the scalp he had unfocused eyes and his skin was pasty white for it had not seen the sun in two old man smiled weakly tears glazed his eyes now for a moment he lookednot too unlike ben 
 it was a face full of meanings that luke would forever recall regret he sawmost plainly and shame memories could be seen flashing across itmemoriesof rich times and horrors and love too 
 it was a face that touched the world in a lifetime in saw the wizened nostrils twitch as they tested a first tentative smell he saw thehead tilt imperceptibly to the first time without electronic auditoryamplification luke felt a pang of remorse that the only sounds now to be heardwere those of explosions the only smells the pungent sting of electrical fires was a touch palpable unfiltered 
 he saw the old eyes focus on him tears burned cheeks fell on lips his father smiled at the taste 
 it was a face that had not seen itself in twenty years 
 vader saw his son crying and knew it must have been at the horror of the facethey boy beheld 
 it intensified momentarily own sense of his crimes added guilt at the imagined repugnance of his appearance but then this broughthim to mind of the way he used to and grand with a wry tilt to hisbrow that hinted of invincibility and took in all of life with a wink yes that washow looked once 
 and this memory brought a wave of other memories with it memories ofbrotherhood and home his dear wife the freedom of deep space his friendand how that friendship had turned turned he knew got injected nonetheless with some uncaring virulence that these were memories he wanted none of not now memories ofmolten lava crawling up his backno 
 this boy had pulled him from that now with this act this boy wasgood 
 the boy was good and the boy had come from there must have beengood in him too he smiled up again at his son and for the first time loved for the first time in many long years loved himself again as well 
 suddenly he smelled his nostrils sniffed once that was what it was just blooming it must be spring 
 and there was cocked his head strained his ears yes springthunder for a spring rain to make the flowers bloom

 return of the jedi 
 ix 
 
 the two space armadas like their counterparts of another time and floating ship to ship trading broadsides with each other in pointblankconfrontation 
 heroic sometimes suicidal maneuvers marked the day a rebel cruiser itsback alive with fires and explosions limped into direct contact with an imperial stardestroyer before exploding the star destroyer with it cargoships loaded with charge were set on collision courses with theircrews abandoning ships to fates that were uncertain at best 
 lando wedge blue leader and green wing went in to take out one of thelarger main communications ship it had already beendisabled by direct cannonade from the rebel cruiser it had subsequently its damages were the rebels had to strike while it was still lickingits wounds 
 squadron went in prevented thedestroyer from using its bigger guns it also made the fighters invisible until theywere directly visualized 
 increase power on the front deflector shields lando radioed his going in 
 right with you answered wedge close up formations team 
 they went into a perpendicular to the long axis of theimperial drops were hard to track fifty feet from the surface theypulled out at ninety degrees and raced along the gunmetal hull taking laserfire fromevery port 
 starting attack run on the main power tree lando advised 
 i copy answered green wing moving into position 
 stay clear of their front batteries warned blue leader 
 a heavy fire zone down there 
 in range 
 hurt bad on the left of the tower wedge noted concentrate on thatside 
 right with you 
 green wing was hit losing power 
 get clear going to blow 
 green wing took it down like riding a rocket into the front explosions rumbled the port bow 
 thanks blue leader said quietly to the conflagration 
 that opens it up for us yelled wedge cur over the power reactors arejust inside that cargo bay 
 follow me lando called pulling the falcon into a sharp bank that caught thehorrified reactor personnel by surprise wedge and blue followed suit they alldid their worst 
 direct hit lando shouted 
 there she goes 
 pull up pull up 
 they pulled up hard and fast as the destroyer was enveloped in a series explosions until it looked finally just like one more small star blueleader was caught by the shock wave and thrown horribly against the side of asmaller imperial ship which also exploded lando and wedge escaped 
 on the rebel command ship bridge smoke and shouts filled the air 
 ackbar reached calrissian on the comlink the jamming has stopped wehave a reading on the shield 
 is it still up lando responded with desperate anticipation in his voice 
 afraid so it looks like general unit make it 
 until destroyed our last ship still hope replied lando fail he still had to pick off that annoying death star 
 on the death star luke was nearly unconscious beneath the continuing assaultof the lightning tormented beyond reason betaken of a weakness thatdrained his very essence he hoped for nothing more than to submit to the nothingnesstoward which he was drifting 
 the emperor smiled down at the enfeebled young jedi as vader struggled to hisfeet beside his master 
 young fool palpatine rasped at luke only now at the end do youunderstand your puerile skills are no match for the power of the dark side youhave paid a price for your lack of vision now young skywalker you will pay theprice in full you will die 
 he laughed maniacally and although it would not have seemed possible to outpouring of bolts from the fingers actually increased in sound screamed through the room the murderous brightness of the flashes wasoverwhelming 
 body slowed wilted finally crumpled under the hideous barrage hestopped moving altogether at last he appeared totally lifeless the emperorhissed maliciously 
 at that instant vader sprang up and grabbed the emperor from behind upper arms to his torso weaker than ever been vader had lain stillthese last few minutes focusing his every fiber of being on this one only action possible his last if he failed ignoring pain ignoring his shameand his weaknesses ignoring the noise in his head he focused solelyand sightlessly on his will to defeat the evil embodied in the emperor 
 palpatine struggled in the grip of unfeeling embrace his hands stillshooting bolts of malign energy out in all directions in his wild flailing thelightning ripped across the room tearing into vader the dark lord fell currents crackling down his helmet over his cape into his heart 
 vader stumbled with his load to the middle of the bridge over the black chasmleading to the power core he held the wailing despot high over his head and with afinal spasm of strength hurled him into the abyss 
 body still spewing bolts of light spun out of control into the back and forth off the sides of the shaft as it fell it disappeared at last butthen a few seconds later a distant explosion could be heard far down at the core arush of air billowed out the shaft into the throne room 
 the wind whipped at lord cape as he staggered and collapsed towardthe hole trying to follow his master to the end luke crawled to his and pulled the dark lord away from the edge of the chasm to safety 
 both of them lay on the floor entwined in each other too weak to move toomoved to speak 
 inside the bunker on endor imperial controllers watched the main the ewok battle just outside though the image was clogged with static thefighting seemed to be winding down about time since initially been toldthat the locals on this moon were harmless nonbelligerents 
 the interference seemed to another antenna damaged in suddenly a walker pilot appeared on the screen waving excitedly 
 over commander the rebel have been routed and are fleeing with into the woods we need reinforcements to continue the pursuit 
 the bunker personnel all cheered the shield was safe 
 open the main door ordered the commander send three squads to help 
 the bunker door opened the imperial troops came rushing out only to findthemselves surrounded by rebels and ewoks looking bloody and mean theimperial troops surrendered without a fight 
 han chewie and five others ran into the bunker with the explosive placed the timed devices at eleven strategic points in and around the powergenerator then ran out again as fast as they could 
 leia still in great pain from her wounds lay in the sheltered comfort of somedistant bushes she was shouting orders to the ewoks to gather their prisoners onthe far side of the clearing away from the bunker when han and chewie tore for cover in the next moment the bunker went 
 it was a spectacular display explosion after explosion sending a wall of firehundreds of feet into the air creating a shock wave that knocked every living creatureoff its feet and charred all the greenery that faced the clearing 
 the bunker was destroyed 
 a captain ran up to admiral ackbar his voice tremulous sir the shieldaround the death star has lost its power 
 ackbar looked at the the electronically generated web was moon and the death star now floated in black empty unprotected space 
 they did it ackbar whispered 
 he rushed over to the comlink and shouted into the multifrequency war fighters commence attack on the death main reactor the deflectorshield is down repeat the deflector shield is down 
 voice was the next one heard i see it on our way redgroup gold group blue squad all fighters follow me my man my turn 
 the falcon plunged to the surface of the death star followed by hordes ofrebel fighters followed by a but disorganized array of imperial three rebel star cruisers headed for the huge imperial super stardestroyer flagship which seemed to be having difficulties with its guidancesystem 
 lando and the first wave of headed for the unfinished portion of thedeath star skimming low over the curving surface of the completed side 
 stay low until we get to the unfinished side wedge told his squad nobodyneeded to be told 
 squadron of enemy fighters coming 
 blue wing called lando take your group and draw the tie fighters away 
 do what i can 
 picking up interferencethe death jamming us i think 
 more fighters coming at ten 
 the superstructure lando called watch for the main reactor shaft 
 he turned hard into the unfinished side and began weaving dramatically amongprotruding girders towers mazelike channels temporary floodlights the antiaircraft defenses nearly as well developed been depending completely on the deflector shield for the major sources of worry for the rebels were the physical jeopardiesof the structure itself and the imperial tie fighters on their tails 
 i see system wedge radioed going in 
 i see it too agreed lando here goes nothing 
 this going to be easy 
 over a tower and under a suddenly they were flying at top speedinside a deep shaft that was barely wide enough for three fighters wing to it was pierced along its entire twisting length by myriad feeding shaftsand tunnels alternate forks and caverns and spiked in addition with analarming number of obstacles within the shaft itself heavy machinery structuralelements power cables floating stairways barrier piled debris 
 a score of rebel fighters made the first into the power shaft followedby twice that number of ties two lost its right away careening into aderrick to avoid the first volley of laser fire 
 the chase was on 
 where are we going gold leader wedge called out gaily a laserbolt hitthe shaft above him showering his window with sparks 
 lock onto the strongest power source lando suggested it should be thegenerator 
 red wing stay could run out of space real fast 
 they quickly strung out into single and double file as it started becomingapparent that the shaft was not only pocked with and protruding also narrowing across its width at every turn 
 tie fighters hit another rebel who exploded in flames then another tiefighter hit a piece of machinery with a similar result 
 got a reading on a major shaft obstruction ahead lando announced 
 just picked it up will you make it 
 going to be a tight squeeze 
 it was a tight squeeze it was a occluding three fourths of the a dip in the shaft at the same level to make up a little room lando had to spinthe falcon through degrees while rising falling and accelerating luckily and quite as bulky still two more of them make iton the downside the smaller ties drew closer 
 suddenly coarse white static blanketed all the 
 my gone yelled wedge 
 cut speed cautioned lando some kind of power discharge causinginterference 
 switch to visual scanning 
 useless at these have to fly nearly blind 
 two blind hit the wall as the shaft narrowed again a third was blownapart by the gaining imperial fighters 
 green leader called lando 
 copy gold leader 
 split off and head back to the just called for a fighter andyou might draw some fire off us 
 green leader and his cohort peeled off out of the power shaft back up to thecruiser battle one tie fighter followed firing continuously 
 voice came in over the comlink the death star is tuning away fromthe like repositioning to destroy the endor moon 
 how long before in position lando asked 
 point oh three 
 not enough time running out of time 
 wedge broke in the transmission well running out of shaft too 
 at that instant the falcon scraped through an even smaller opening this timeinjuring her auxiliary thrusters 
 that was too close muttered calrissian 
 gdzhng dzn nodded the copilot 
 ackbar stared out the observation window he was looking downonto the deck of the super star destroyer only miles away fires burst over theentire stern and the imperial warship was listing badly to starboard 
 knocked out their forward shields ackbar said into the comlink fireat the bridge 
 green group swooped in low from bottomside up from the death star 
 glad to help out called green leader 
 firing proton torpedoes green wing advised 
 the bridge was hit with kaleidoscopic results a rapid chain reaction got setoff from power station to power station along the middle third of the huge a dazzling rainbow of explosions that buckled the ship at right angles andstarted it spinning like a pinwheel toward the death star 
 the first bridge explosion took greed leader with it the subsequentuncontrolled joyride snagged ten more fighters two cruisers and an ordnance the time the whole exothermic conglomerate finally crashed into the side of thedeath star the impact was momentous enough to actually jolt the battle off internal explosions and thunderings all through its network of and halls 
 for the first time the death star rocked the collision with the explodingdestroyer was only the beginning leading to various systems breakdowns which ledto reactor meltdowns which led to personnel panic abandonment of posts furthermalfunctions and general chaos 
 smoke was everywhere substantial rumblings came from all directions at were running and shouting electrical fires steam explosions cabindepressurizations disruption of added to this the continuedbombardments by rebel fear in the heightenedthe sense of hysteria that was already pervasive 
 for the emperor was dead the central powerful evil that had been thecohesive force to the empire was gone and when the dark side was this diffused was simply where it led 
 confusion 
 desperation 
 damp fear 
 in the midst of this uproar luke had made it somehow to the main he was trying to carry the hulking deadweight of his weakeningbody toward an imperial shuttle halfway there his strength finally gave and he collapsed under the strain 
 slowly he rose again like an automaton he hoisted his body over hisshoulder and stumbled toward one of the last remaining shuttles 
 luke rested his father on the ground trying to collect strength one last time asexplosions grew louder all around them sparks hissed in the rafters one of thewalls buckled and smoke poured through a gaping fissure the floor shook 
 vader motioned luke closer to him luke help me take this mask off 
 luke shook his head die 
 the dark voice was weary nothing can stop that now just once letme face you without it let me look on you with my own eyes 
 luke was afraid afraid to see his father as he really was afraid to see whatperson could have become so same person fathered luke and to know the anakin skywalker who lived inside darth vader 
 vader too was let his son see him to remove this armored mask thathad been between them so long the black armored mask that had been his onlymeans of existing for over twenty years it had been his voice and his breath andhis shield against all human contact but now he would remove he would see his son before he died 
 together they lifted the heavy helmet from the maskportion a complicated breathing apparatus had to be disentangled a speakingmodulator and detached from the power unit in back but when themask was finally off and set aside luke gazed on his face 
 it was the sad benign face of an old man bald beardless with a mighty scarrunning from the top of his head to the back of the scalp he had unfocused eyes and his skin was pasty white for it had not seen the sun in two old man smiled weakly tears glazed his eyes now for a moment he lookednot too unlike ben 
 it was a face full of meanings that luke would forever recall regret he sawmost plainly and shame memories could be seen flashing across itmemoriesof rich times and horrors and love too 
 it was a face that touched the world in a lifetime in saw the wizened nostrils twitch as they tested a first tentative smell he saw thehead tilt imperceptibly to the first time without electronic auditoryamplification luke felt a pang of remorse that the only sounds now to be heardwere those of explosions the only smells the pungent sting of electrical fires was a touch palpable unfiltered 
 he saw the old eyes focus on him tears burned cheeks fell on lips his father smiled at the taste 
 it was a face that had not seen itself in twenty years 
 vader saw his son crying and knew it must have been at the horror of the facethey boy beheld 
 it intensified momentarily own sense of his crimes added guilt at the imagined repugnance of his appearance but then this broughthim to mind of the way he used to and grand with a wry tilt to hisbrow that hinted of invincibility and took in all of life with a wink yes that washow looked once 
 and this memory brought a wave of other memories with it memories ofbrotherhood and home his dear wife the freedom of deep space his friendand how that friendship had turned turned he knew got injected nonetheless with some uncaring virulence that these were memories he wanted none of not now memories ofmolten lava crawling up his backno 
 this boy had pulled him from that now with this act this boy wasgood 
 the boy was good and the boy had come from there must have beengood in him too he smiled up again at his son and for the first time loved for the first time in many long years loved himself again as well 
 suddenly he smelled his nostrils sniffed once that was what it was just blooming it must be spring 
 and there was cocked his head strained his ears yes springthunder for a spring rain to make the flowers bloom 
 yes therehe felt a raindrop on his lips he licked the delicate dropletbutwait it sweetwater it was salty it wasa teardrop 
 he focused on luke once again and saw his son was crying yes that was it hewas tasting his he looked so horrible because he was sohorrible 
 but he wanted to make it all right for luke he wanted luke to know he ugly like this not deep inside not all together with a little he shook his head at luke explaining away the unsightly beast his son beings are we this crude matter 
 luke shook his head tell his father it was all right to dismiss the shame to tell him nothing mattered now and he 
 vader spoke again even inaudible go my son leaveme 
 at that luke found his voice no coming with me not leaveyou here got to save you 
 you already have luke he whispered he wished briefly met yoda tothank the old jedi for the training given lukebut perhaps be with yodasoon now in the ethereal oneness of the force and with

 vader pulled luke very close spoke into his ear luke you were rightandyou were right about metell your sisteryou were right

 a tremendous explosion filled the back of the bay with fire knocking luke flatto the ground slowly he rose again and like an automaton stumbled toward one ofthe last remaining shuttles

 after washing and dressing prince andrew came into the luxurious study and sat down to the dinner prepared for him bilibin settled down comfortably beside the fire 
 after his journey and the campaign during which he had been deprived of all the comforts of cleanliness and all the refinements of life prince andrew felt a pleasant sense of repose among luxurious surroundings such as he had been accustomed to from childhood besides it was pleasant after his reception by the austrians to speak if not in russian for they were speaking french at least with a russian who would he supposed share the general russian antipathy to the austrians which was then particularly strong 
 bilibin was a man of a bachelor and of the same circle as prince andrew they had known each other previously in petersburg but had become more intimate when prince andrew was in vienna with kutuzov just as prince andrew was a young man who gave promise of rising high in the military profession so to an even greater extent bilibin gave promise of rising in his diplomatic career he still a young man but no longer a young diplomat as he had entered the service at the age of sixteen had been in paris and copenhagen and now held a rather important post in vienna both the foreign minister and our ambassador in vienna knew him and valued him he was not one of those many diplomats who are esteemed because they have certain negative qualities avoid doing certain things and speak french he was one of those who liking work knew how to do it and despite his indolence would sometimes spend a whole night at his writing table he worked well whatever the import of his work it was not the question what for but the question how that interested him what the diplomatic matter might be he did not care but it gave him great pleasure to prepare a circular memorandum or report skillfully pointedly and elegantly services were valued not only for what he wrote but also for his skill in dealing and conversing with those in the highest spheres 
 bilibin liked conversation as he liked work only when it could be made elegantly witty in society he always awaited an opportunity to say something striking and took part in a conversation only when that was possible his conversation was always sprinkled with wittily original finished phrases of general interest these sayings were prepared in the inner laboratory of his mind in a portable form as if intentionally so that insignificant society people might carry them from drawing room to drawing room and in fact witticisms were hawked about in the viennese drawing rooms and often had an influence on matters considered important 
 his thin worn sallow face was covered with deep wrinkles which always looked as clean and well washed as the tips of fingers after a russian bath the movement of these wrinkles formed the principal play of expression on his face now his forehead would pucker into deep folds and his eyebrows were lifted then his eyebrows would descend and deep wrinkles would crease his cheeks his small eyes always twinkled and looked out straight 
 well now tell me about your exploits said he 
 bolkonski very modestly without once mentioning himself described the engagement and his reception by the minister of war 
 they received me and my news as one receives a dog in a game of skittles said he in conclusion 
 bilibin smiled and the wrinkles on his face disappeared 
 cependant mon cher he remarked examining his nails from a distance and puckering the skin above his left eye malgre la haute estime que je professe pour the orthodox russian army que votre victoire pas des plus victorieuses 
 but my dear fellow with all my respect for the orthodox russian army i must say that your victory was not particularly victorious 
 he went on talking in this way in french uttering only those words in russian on which he wished to put a contemptuous emphasis 
 come now you with all your forces fall on the unfortunate mortier and his one division and even then mortier slips through your fingers the victory 
 but seriously said prince andrew we can at any rate say without boasting that it was a little better than at ulm 
 why you capture one just one marshal for us 
 because not everything happens as one expects or with the smoothness of a parade we had expected as i told you to get at their rear by seven in the morning but had not reached it by five in the afternoon 
 and why you do it at seven in the morning you ought to have been there at seven in the morning returned bilibin with a smile you ought to have been there at seven in the morning 
 why did you not succeed in impressing on bonaparte by diplomatic methods that he had better leave genoa alone retorted prince andrew in the same tone 
 i know interrupted bilibin thinking very easy to take marshals sitting on a sofa by the fire that is true but still why you capture him so be surprised if not only the minister of war but also his most august majesty the emperor and king francis is not much delighted by your victory even i a poor secretary of the russian embassy do not feel any need in token of my joy to give my franz a thaler or let him go with his liebchen to the prater true we have no prater here 
 he looked straight at prince andrew and suddenly unwrinkled his forehead 
 it is now my turn to ask you why mon cher said bolkonski i confess i do not understand perhaps there are diplomatic subtleties here beyond my feeble intelligence but i make it out mack loses a whole army the archduke ferdinand and the archduke karl give no signs of life and make blunder after blunder kutuzov alone at last gains a real victory destroying the spell of the invincibility of the french and the minister of war does not even care to hear the details 
 just it my dear fellow you see hurrah for the tsar for russia for the orthodox greek faith all that is beautiful but what do we i mean the austrian court care for your victories bring us nice news of a victory by the archduke karl or ferdinand one as good as another as you know and even if it is only over a fire brigade of that will be another story and fire off some cannon but this sort of thing seems done on purpose to vex us the archduke karl does nothing the archduke ferdinand disgraces himself you abandon vienna give up its defense as much as to say heaven is with us but heaven help you and your capital the one general whom we all loved schmidt you expose to a bullet and then you congratulate us on the victory admit that more irritating news than yours could not have been conceived as if it had been done on purpose on purpose besides suppose you did gain a brilliant victory if even the archduke karl gained a victory what effect would that have on the general course of events too late now when vienna is occupied by the french army 
 what occupied vienna occupied 
 not only occupied but bonaparte is at schonbrunn and the count our dear count vrbna goes to him for orders 
 after the fatigues and impressions of the journey his reception and especially after having dined bolkonski felt that he could not take in the full significance of the words he heard 
 count lichtenfels was here this morning bilibin continued and showed me a letter in which the parade of the french in vienna was fully described prince murat et tout le tremblement you see that your victory is not a matter for great rejoicing and that you be received as a savior 
 really i care about that i care at all said prince andrew beginning to understand that his news of the battle before krems was really of small importance in view of such events as the fall of capital how is it vienna was taken what of the bridge and its celebrated bridgehead and prince auersperg we heard reports that prince auersperg was defending vienna he said 
 prince auersperg is on this on our side of the river and is defending us doing it very badly i think but still he is defending us but vienna is on the other side no the bridge has not yet been taken and i hope it will not be for it is mined and orders have been given to blow it up otherwise we should long ago have been in the mountains of bohemia and you and your army would have spent a bad quarter of an hour between two fires 
 but still this does not mean that the campaign is over said prince andrew 
 well i think it is the bigwigs here think so too but they say so it will be as i said at the beginning of the campaign it be your skirmishing at durrenstein or gunpowder at all that will decide the matter but those who devised it said bilibin quoting one of his own mots releasing the wrinkles on his forehead and pausing the only question is what will come of the meeting between the emperor alexander and the king of prussia in berlin if prussia joins the allies hand will be forced and there will be war if not it is merely a question of settling where the preliminaries of the new campo formio are to be drawn up 
 what an extraordinary genius prince andrew suddenly exclaimed clenching his small hand and striking the table with it and what luck the man has 
 buonaparte said bilibin inquiringly puckering up his forehead to indicate that he was about to say something witty buonaparte he repeated accentuating the u i think however now that he lays down laws for austria at schonbrunn il faut lui faire grace de i shall certainly adopt an innovation and call him simply bonaparte 
 we must let him off the u 
 but joking apart said prince andrew do you really think the campaign is over 
 this is what i think austria has been made a fool of and she is not used to it she will retaliate and she has been fooled in the first place because her provinces have been pillaged they say the holy russian army loots terribly her army is destroyed her capital taken and all this for the beaux yeux of his sardinian majesty and therefore this is between ourselves i instinctively feel that we are being deceived my instinct tells me of negotiations with france and projects for peace a secret peace concluded separately 
 fine eyes 
 impossible cried prince andrew that would be too base 
 if we live we shall see replied bilibin his face again becoming smooth as a sign that the conversation was at an end 
 when prince andrew reached the room prepared for him and lay down in a clean shirt on the feather bed with its warmed and fragrant pillows he felt that the battle of which he had brought tidings was far far away from him the alliance with prussia treachery new triumph levee and parade and the audience with the emperor francis occupied his thoughts 
 he closed his eyes and immediately a sound of cannonading of musketry and the rattling of carriage wheels seemed to fill his ears and now again drawn out in a thin line the musketeers were descending the hill the french were firing and he felt his heart palpitating as he rode forward beside schmidt with the bullets merrily whistling all around and he experienced tenfold the joy of living as he had not done since childhood 
 he woke up 
 yes that all happened he said and smiling happily to himself like a child he fell into a deep youthful slumber

 chapter 
 
 
 in france the young girls have a dull time of it till they are married when vive la liberte becomes their motto in america as everyone knows girls early sign the declaration of independence and enjoy their freedom with republican zest but the young matrons usually abdicate with the first heir to the throne and go into a seclusion almost as close as a french nunnery though by no means as quiet whether they like it or not they are virtually put upon the shelf as soon as the wedding excitement is over and most of them might exclaim as did a very pretty woman the other day as handsome as ever but no one takes any notice of me because married 
 not being a belle or even a fashionable lady meg did not experience this affliction till her babies were a year old for in her little world primitive customs prevailed and she found herself more admired and beloved than ever 
 as she was a womanly little woman the maternal instinct was very strong and she was entirely absorbed in her children to the utter exclusion of everything and everybody else day and night she brooded over them with tireless devotion and anxiety leaving john to the tender mercies of the help for an irish lady now presided over the kitchen department being a domestic man john decidedly missed the wifely attentions he had been accustomed to receive but as he adored his babies he cheerfully relinquished his comfort for a time supposing with masculine ignorance that peace would soon be restored but three months passed and there was no return of repose meg looked worn and nervous the babies absorbed every minute of her time the house was neglected and kitty the cook who took life aisy kept him on short commons when he went out in the morning he was bewildered by small commissions for the captive mamma if he came gaily in at night eager to embrace his family he was quenched by a hush they are just asleep after worrying all day if he proposed a little amusement at home no it would disturb the babies if he hinted at a lecture or a concert he was answered with a reproachful look and a decided leave my children for pleasure never his sleep was broken by infant wails and visions of a phantom figure pacing noiselessly to and fro in the watches of the night his meals were interrupted by the frequent flight of the presiding genius who deserted him if a muffled chirp sounded from the nest above and when he read his paper of an evening colic got into the shipping list and fall affected the price of stocks for mrs brooke was only interested in domestic news 
 the poor man was very uncomfortable for the children had bereft him of his wife home was merely a nursery and the perpetual hushing made him feel like a brutal intruder whenever he entered the sacred precincts of babyland he bore it very patiently for six months and when no signs of amendment appeared he did what other paternal exiles to get a little comfort elsewhere scott had married and gone to housekeeping not far off and john fell into the way of running over for an hour or two of an evening when his own parlor was empty and his own wife singing lullabies that seemed to have no end mrs scott was a lively pretty girl with nothing to do but be agreeable and she performed her mission most successfully the parlor was always bright and attractive the chessboard ready the piano in tune plenty of gay gossip and a nice little supper set forth in tempting style 
 john would have preferred his own fireside if it had not been so lonely but as it was he gratefully took the next best thing and enjoyed his society 
 meg rather approved of the new arrangement at first and found it a relief to know that john was having a good time instead of dozing in the parlor or tramping about the house and waking the children but when the teething worry was over and the idols went to sleep at proper hours leaving mamma time to rest she began to miss john and find her workbasket dull company when he was not sitting opposite in his old dressing gown comfortably scorching his slippers on the fender she would not ask him to stay at home but felt injured because he did not know that she wanted him without being told entirely forgetting the many evenings he had waited for her in vain she was nervous and worn out with watching and worry and in that unreasonable frame of mind which the best of mothers occasionally experience when domestic cares oppress them want of exercise robs them of cheerfulness and too much devotion to that idol of american women the teapot makes them feel as if they were all nerve and no muscle 
 yes she would say looking in the glass getting old and ugly john find me interesting any longer so he leaves his faded wife and goes to see his pretty neighbor who has no incumbrances well the babies love me they care if i am thin and pale and time to crimp my hair they are my comfort and some day john will see what gladly sacrificed for them he my precious 
 to which pathetic appeal daisy would answer with a coo or demi with a crow and meg would put by her lamentations for a maternal revel which soothed her solitude for the time being but the pain increased as politics absorbed john who was always running over to discuss interesting points with scott quite unconscious that meg missed him not a word did she say however till her mother found her in tears one day and insisted on knowing what the matter was for drooping spirits had not escaped her observation 
 i tell anyone except you mother but i really do need advice for if john goes on much longer i might as well be widowed replied mrs brooke drying her tears on bib with an injured air 
 goes on how my dear asked her mother anxiously 
 away all day and at night when i want to see him he is continually going over to the scotts it fair that i should have the hardest work and never any amusement men are very selfish even the best of them 
 so are women blame john till you see where you are wrong yourself 
 but it be right for him to neglect me 
 you neglect him 
 why mother i thought take my part 
 so i do as far as sympathizing goes but i think the fault is yours meg 
 i see how 
 let me show you did john ever neglect you as you call it while you made it a point to give him your society of an evening his only leisure time 
 no but i do it now with two babies to tend 
 i think you could dear and i think you ought may i speak quite freely and will you remember that mother who blames as well as mother who sympathizes 
 indeed i will speak to me as if i were little meg again i often feel as if i needed teaching more than ever since these babies look to me for everything 
 meg drew her low chair beside her and with a little interruption in either lap the two women rocked and talked lovingly together feeling that the tie of motherhood made them more one than ever 
 you have only made the mistake that most young wives your duty to your husband in your love for your children a very natural and forgivable mistake meg but one that had better be remedied before you take to different ways for children should draw you nearer than ever not separate you as if they were all yours and john had nothing to do but support them seen it for some weeks but have not spoken feeling sure it would come right in time 
 afraid it if i ask him to stay think jealous and i insult him by such an idea he see that i want him and i know how to tell him without words 
 make it so pleasant he want to go away my dear longing for his little home but it home without you and you are always in the nursery 
 i to be there 
 not all the time too much confinement makes you nervous and then you are unfitted for everything besides you owe something to john as well as to the babies neglect husband for children shut him out of the nursery but teach him how to help in it his place is there as well as yours and the children need him let him feel that he has a part to do and he will do it gladly and faithfully and it will be better for you all 
 you really think so mother 
 i know it meg for tried it and i seldom give advice unless proved its practicability when you and jo were little i went on just as you are feeling as if i do my duty unless i devoted myself wholly to you poor father took to his books after i had refused all offers of help and left me to try my experiment alone i struggled along as well as i could but jo was too much for me i nearly spoiled her by indulgence you were poorly and i worried about you till i fell sick myself then father came to the rescue quietly managed everything and made himself so helpful that i saw my mistake and never have been able to got on without him since that is the secret of our home happiness he does not let business wean him from the little cares and duties that affect us all and i try not to let domestic worries destroy my interest in his pursuits each do our part alone in many things but at home we work together always 
 it is so mother and my great wish is to be to my husband and children what you have been to yours show me how do anything you say 
 you were always my docile daughter well dear if i were you let john have more to do with the management of demi for the boy needs training and none too soon to begin then do what i have often proposed let hannah come and help you she is a capital nurse and you may trust the precious babies to her while you do more housework you need the exercise hannah would enjoy the rest and john would find his wife again go out more keep cheerful as well as busy for you are the of the family and if you get dismal there is no fair weather then try to take an interest in whatever john with him let him read to you exchange ideas and help each other in that way shut yourself up in a bandbox because you are a woman but understand what is going on and educate yourself to take your part in the work for it all affects you and yours 
 john is so sensible afraid he will think stupid if i ask questions about politics and things 
 i believe he would love covers a multitude of sins and of whom could you ask more freely than of him try it and see if he find your society far more agreeable than mrs suppers 
 i will poor john afraid i have neglected him sadly but i thought i was right and he never said anything 
 he tried not to be selfish but he has felt rather forlorn i fancy this is just the time meg when young married people are apt to grow apart and the very time when they ought to be most together for the first tenderness soon wears off unless care is taken to preserve it and no time is so beautiful and precious to parents as the first years of the little lives given to them to train let john be a stranger to the babies for they will do more to keep him safe and happy in this world of trial and temptation than anything else and through them you will learn to know and love one another as you should now dear think over preachment act upon it if it seems good and god bless you all 
 meg did think it over found it good and acted upon it though the first attempt was not made exactly as she planned to have it of course the children tyrannized over her and ruled the house as soon as they found out that kicking and squalling brought them whatever they wanted mamma was an abject slave to their caprices but papa was not so easily subjugated and occasionally afflicted his tender spouse by an attempt at paternal discipline with his obstreperous son for demi inherited a trifle of his firmness of character we call it obstinacy and when he made up his little to have or to do anything all the horses and all the men could not change that pertinacious little mind mamma thought the dear too young to be taught to conquer his prejudices but papa believed that it never was too soon to learn obedience so master demi early discovered that when he undertook to wrastle with parpar he always got the worst of it yet like the englishman baby respected the man who conquered him and loved the father whose grave no no was more impressive than all love pats a few days after the talk with her mother meg resolved to try a social evening with john so she ordered a nice supper set the parlor in order dressed herself prettily and put the children to bed early that nothing should interfere with her experiment but unfortunately most unconquerable prejudice was against going to bed and that night he decided to go on a rampage so poor meg sang and rocked told stories and tried every wile she could devise but all in vain the big eyes shut and long after daisy had gone to byelow like the chubby little bunch of good nature she was naughty demi lay staring at the light with the most discouragingly expression of countenance 
 will demi lie still like a good boy while mamma runs down and gives poor papa his tea asked meg as the hall door softly closed and the step went into the dining room 
 me has tea said demi preparing to join in the revel 
 no but save you some little cakies for breakfast if go like daisy will you lovey 
 iss and demi shut his eyes tight as if to catch sleep and hurry the desired day 
 taking advantage of the propitious moment meg slipped away and ran down to greet her husband with a smiling face and the little blue bow in her hair which was his especial admiration he saw it at once and said with pleased surprise why little mother how gay we are tonight do you expect company 
 only you dear 
 no tired of being dowdy so i dressed up as a change you always make yourself nice for table no matter how tired you are so why i when i have the time 
 i do it out of respect for you my dear said john 
 ditto ditto mr brooke laughed meg looking young and pretty again as she nodded to him over the teapot 
 well altogether delightful and like old times this tastes right i drink your health dear and john sipped his tea with an air of reposeful rapture which was of very short duration however for as he put down his cup the door handle rattled mysteriously and a little voice was heard saying impatiently 
 opy doy tummin 
 that naughty boy i told him to go to sleep alone and here he is downstairs getting his death pattering over that canvas said meg answering the call 
 mornin now announced demi in joyful tone as he entered with his long nightgown gracefully festooned over his arm and every curl bobbing gayly as he pranced about the table eyeing the cakies with loving glances 
 no it morning yet you must go to bed and not trouble poor mamma then you can have the little cake with sugar on it 
 me loves parpar said the artful one preparing to climb the paternal knee and revel in forbidden joys but john shook his head and said to meg 
 if you told him to stay up there and go to sleep alone make him do it or he will never learn to mind you 
 yes of course come demi and meg led her son away feeling a strong desire to spank the little marplot who hopped beside her laboring under the delusion that the bribe was to be administered as soon as they reached the nursery 
 nor was he disappointed for that shortsighted woman actually gave him a lump of sugar tucked him into his bed and forbade any more promenades till morning 
 iss said demi the perjured blissfully sucking his sugar and regarding his first attempt as eminently successful 
 meg returned to her place and supper was progressing pleasantly when the little ghost walked again and exposed the maternal delinquencies by boldly demanding more sudar marmar 
 now this do said john hardening his heart against the engaging little sinner we shall never know any peace till that child learns togo to bed properly you have made a slave of yourself long enough give him one lesson and then there will be an end of it put him in his bed and leave him meg 
 he stay there he never does unless i sit by him 
 manage him demi go upstairs and get into your bed as mamma bids you 
 replied the young rebel helping himself to the coveted cakie and beginning to eat the same with calm audacity 
 you must never say that to papa i shall carry you if you go yourself 
 go way me love parpar and demi retired to his skirts for protection 
 but even that refuge proved unavailing for he was delivered over to the enemy with a be gentle with him john which struck the culprit with dismay for when mamma deserted him then the judgment day was at hand bereft of his cake defrauded of his frolic and borne away by a strong hand to that detested bed poor demi could not restrain his wrath but openly defied papa and kicked and screamed lustily all the way upstairs the minute he was put into bed on one side he rolled out on the other and made for the door only to be ignominiously caught up by the tail of his little toga and put back again which lively performance was kept up till the young strength gave out when he devoted himself to roaring at the top of his voice this vocal exercise usually conquered meg but john sat as unmoved as the post which is popularly believed to be deaf no coaxing no sugar no lullaby no story even the light was put out and only the red glow of the fire enlivened the big dark which demi regarded with curiosity rather than fear this new order of things disgusted him and he howled dismally for marmar as his angry passions subsided and recollections of his tender bondwoman returned to the captive autocrat the plaintive wail which succeeded the passionate roar went to heart and she ran up to say beseechingly 
 let me stay with him be good now john 
 no my dear told him he must go to sleep as you bid him and he must if i stay here all night 
 but cry himself sick pleaded meg reproaching herself for deserting her boy 
 no he so tired he will soon drop off and then the matter is settled for he will understand that he has got to mind interfere manage him 
 my child and i have his spirit broken by harshness 
 my child and i have his temper spoiled by indulgence go down my dear and leave the boy to me 
 when john spoke in that masterful tone meg always obeyed and never regretted her docility 
 please let me kiss him once john 
 certainly demi say good night to mamma and let her go and rest for she is very tired with taking care of you all day 
 meg always insisted upon it that the kiss won the victory for after it was given demi sobbed more quietly and lay quite still at the bottom of the bed whither he had wriggled in his anguish of mind 
 poor little man worn out with sleep and crying cover him up and then go and set heart at rest thought john creeping to the bedside hoping to find his rebellious heir asleep 
 but he for the moment his father peeped at him eyes opened his little chin began to quiver and he put up his arms saying with a penitent hiccough dood now 
 sitting on the stairs outside meg wondered at the long silence which followed the uproar and after imagining all sorts of impossible accidents she slipped into the room to set her fears at rest demi lay fast asleep not in his usual spreadeagle attitude but in a subdued bunch cuddled close in the circle of his arm and holding his finger as if he felt that justice was tempered with mercy and had gone to sleep a sadder and wiser baby so held john had waited with a womanly patience till the little hand relaxed its hold and while waiting had fallen asleep more tired by that tussle with his son than with his whole work 
 as meg stood watching the two faces on the pillow she smiled to herself and then slipped away again saying in a satisfied tone i never need fear that john will be too harsh with my babies he does know how to manage them and will be a great help for demi is getting too much for me 
 when john came down at last expecting to find a pensive or reproachful wife he was agreeably surprised to find meg placidly trimming a bonnet and to be greeted with the request to read something about the election if he was not too tired john saw in a minute that a revolution of some kind was going on but wisely asked no questions knowing that meg was such a transparent little person she keep a secret to save her life and therefore the clue would soon appear he read a long debate with the most amiable readiness and then explained it in his most lucid manner while meg tried to look deeply interested to ask intelligent questions and keep her thoughts from wandering from the state of the nation to the state of her bonnet in her secret soul however she decided that politics were as bad as mathematics and the the mission of politicians seemed to be calling each other names but she kept these feminine ideas to herself and when john paused shook her head and said with what she thought diplomatic ambiguity well i really see what we are coming to 
 john laughed and watched her for a minute as she poised a pretty little preparation of lace and flowers on her hand and regarded it with the genuine interest which his harangue had failed to waken 
 she is trying to like politics for my sake so try and like millinery for hers only fair thought john the just adding aloud very pretty is it what you call a breakfast cap 
 my dear man a bonnet my very best bonnet 
 i beg your pardon it was so small i naturally mistook it for one of the flyaway things you sometimes wear how do you keep it on 
 these bits of lace are fastened under the chin with a rosebud so and meg illustrated by putting on the bonnet and regarding him with an air of calm satisfaction that was irresistible 
 a love of a bonnet but i prefer the face inside for it looks young and happy again and john kissed the smiling face to the great detriment of the rosebud under the chin 
 glad you like it for i want you to take me to one of the new concerts some night i really need some music to put me in tune will you please 
 of course i will with all my heart or anywhere else you like you have been shut up so long it will do you no end of good and i shall enjoy it of all things what put it into your head little mother 
 well i had a talk with marmee the other day and told her how nervous and cross and out of sorts i felt and she said i needed change and less care so hannah is to help me with the children and to see to things about the house more and now and then have a little fun just to keep me from getting to be a fidgety old woman before my time only an experiment john and i want to try it for your sake as much as for mine because neglected you shamefully lately and going to make home what it used to be if i can you object i hope 
 never mind what john said or what a very narrow escape the little bonnet had from utter ruin all that we have any business to know is that john did not appear to object judging from the changes which gradually took place in the house and its inmates it was not all paradise by any means but everyone was better for the division of labor system the children throve under the paternal rule for accurate stedfast john brought order and obedience into babydom while meg recovered her spirits and composed her nerves by plenty of wholesome exercise a little pleasure and much confidential conversation with her sensible husband home grew homelike again and john had no wish to leave it unless he took meg with him the scotts came to the brookes now and everyone found the little house a cheerful place full of happiness content and family love even sallie moffatt liked to go there it is always so quiet and pleasant here it does me good meg she used to say looking about her with wistful eyes as if trying to discover the charm that she might use it in her great house full of splendid lonliness for there were no riotous babies there and ned lived in a world of lis own where there was no place for her 
 this household happiness did not come all at once but john and meg had found the key to it and each year of married life taught them how to use it unlocking the treasuries of real home love and mutual helpfulness which the poorest may possess and the richest cannot buy this is the sort of shelf on which young wives and mothers may consent to be laid safe from the restless fret and fever of the world finding loyal lovers in the little sons and daughters who cling to them undaunted by sorrow poverty or age walking side by side through fair and stormy weather with a faithful friend who is in the true sense of the good old saxon word the and learning as meg learned that a happiest kingdom is home her highest honor the art of ruling it not as a queen but as a wise wife and mother

 chapter 
 
 
 in france the young girls have a dull time of it till they are married when vive la liberte becomes their motto in america as everyone knows girls early sign the declaration of independence and enjoy their freedom with republican zest but the young matrons usually abdicate with the first heir to the throne and go into a seclusion almost as close as a french nunnery though by no means as quiet whether they like it or not they are virtually put upon the shelf as soon as the wedding excitement is over and most of them might exclaim as did a very pretty woman the other day as handsome as ever but no one takes any notice of me because married 
 not being a belle or even a fashionable lady meg did not experience this affliction till her babies were a year old for in her little world primitive customs prevailed and she found herself more admired and beloved than ever 
 as she was a womanly little woman the maternal instinct was very strong and she was entirely absorbed in her children to the utter exclusion of everything and everybody else day and night she brooded over them with tireless devotion and anxiety leaving john to the tender mercies of the help for an irish lady now presided over the kitchen department being a domestic man john decidedly missed the wifely attentions he had been accustomed to receive but as he adored his babies he cheerfully relinquished his comfort for a time supposing with masculine ignorance that peace would soon be restored but three months passed and there was no return of repose meg looked worn and nervous the babies absorbed every minute of her time the house was neglected and kitty the cook who took life aisy kept him on short commons when he went out in the morning he was bewildered by small commissions for the captive mamma if he came gaily in at night eager to embrace his family he was quenched by a hush they are just asleep after worrying all day if he proposed a little amusement at home no it would disturb the babies if he hinted at a lecture or a concert he was answered with a reproachful look and a decided leave my children for pleasure never his sleep was broken by infant wails and visions of a phantom figure pacing noiselessly to and fro in the watches of the night his meals were interrupted by the frequent flight of the presiding genius who deserted him if a muffled chirp sounded from the nest above and when he read his paper of an evening colic got into the shipping list and fall affected the price of stocks for mrs brooke was only interested in domestic news 
 the poor man was very uncomfortable for the children had bereft him of his wife home was merely a nursery and the perpetual hushing made him feel like a brutal intruder whenever he entered the sacred precincts of babyland he bore it very patiently for six months and when no signs of amendment appeared he did what other paternal exiles to get a little comfort elsewhere scott had married and gone to housekeeping not far off and john fell into the way of running over for an hour or two of an evening when his own parlor was empty and his own wife singing lullabies that seemed to have no end mrs scott was a lively pretty girl with nothing to do but be agreeable and she performed her mission most successfully the parlor was always bright and attractive the chessboard ready the piano in tune plenty of gay gossip and a nice little supper set forth in tempting style 
 john would have preferred his own fireside if it had not been so lonely but as it was he gratefully took the next best thing and enjoyed his society 
 meg rather approved of the new arrangement at first and found it a relief to know that john was having a good time instead of dozing in the parlor or tramping about the house and waking the children but when the teething worry was over and the idols went to sleep at proper hours leaving mamma time to rest she began to miss john and find her workbasket dull company when he was not sitting opposite in his old dressing gown comfortably scorching his slippers on the fender she would not ask him to stay at home but felt injured because he did not know that she wanted him without being told entirely forgetting the many evenings he had waited for her in vain she was nervous and worn out with watching and worry and in that unreasonable frame of mind which the best of mothers occasionally experience when domestic cares oppress them want of exercise robs them of cheerfulness and too much devotion to that idol of american women the teapot makes them feel as if they were all nerve and no muscle 
 yes she would say looking in the glass getting old and ugly john find me interesting any longer so he leaves his faded wife and goes to see his pretty neighbor who has no incumbrances well the babies love me they care if i am thin and pale and time to crimp my hair they are my comfort and some day john will see what gladly sacrificed for them he my precious 
 to which pathetic appeal daisy would answer with a coo or demi with a crow and meg would put by her lamentations for a maternal revel which soothed her solitude for the time being but the pain increased as politics absorbed john who was always running over to discuss interesting points with scott quite unconscious that meg missed him not a word did she say however till her mother found her in tears one day and insisted on knowing what the matter was for drooping spirits had not escaped her observation 
 i tell anyone except you mother but i really do need advice for if john goes on much longer i might as well be widowed replied mrs brooke drying her tears on bib with an injured air 
 goes on how my dear asked her mother anxiously 
 away all day and at night when i want to see him he is continually going over to the scotts it fair that i should have the hardest work and never any amusement men are very selfish even the best of them 
 so are women blame john till you see where you are wrong yourself 
 but it be right for him to neglect me 
 you neglect him 
 why mother i thought take my part 
 so i do as far as sympathizing goes but i think the fault is yours meg 
 i see how 
 let me show you did john ever neglect you as you call it while you made it a point to give him your society of an evening his only leisure time 
 no but i do it now with two babies to tend 
 i think you could dear and i think you ought may i speak quite freely and will you remember that mother who blames as well as mother who sympathizes 
 indeed i will speak to me as if i were little meg again i often feel as if i needed teaching more than ever since these babies look to me for everything 
 meg drew her low chair beside her and with a little interruption in either lap the two women rocked and talked lovingly together feeling that the tie of motherhood made them more one than ever 
 you have only made the mistake that most young wives your duty to your husband in your love for your children a very natural and forgivable mistake meg but one that had better be remedied before you take to different ways for children should draw you nearer than ever not separate you as if they were all yours and john had nothing to do but support them seen it for some weeks but have not spoken feeling sure it would come right in time 
 afraid it if i ask him to stay think jealous and i insult him by such an idea he see that i want him and i know how to tell him without words 
 make it so pleasant he want to go away my dear longing for his little home but it home without you and you are always in the nursery 
 i to be there 
 not all the time too much confinement makes you nervous and then you are unfitted for everything besides you owe something to john as well as to the babies neglect husband for children shut him out of the nursery but teach him how to help in it his place is there as well as yours and the children need him let him feel that he has a part to do and he will do it gladly and faithfully and it will be better for you all 
 you really think so mother 
 i know it meg for tried it and i seldom give advice unless proved its practicability when you and jo were little i went on just as you are feeling as if i do my duty unless i devoted myself wholly to you poor father took to his books after i had refused all offers of help and left me to try my experiment alone i struggled along as well as i could but jo was too much for me i nearly spoiled her by indulgence you were poorly and i worried about you till i fell sick myself then father came to the rescue quietly managed everything and made himself so helpful that i saw my mistake and never have been able to got on without him since that is the secret of our home happiness he does not let business wean him from the little cares and duties that affect us all and i try not to let domestic worries destroy my interest in his pursuits each do our part alone in many things but at home we work together always 
 it is so mother and my great wish is to be to my husband and children what you have been to yours show me how do anything you say 
 you were always my docile daughter well dear if i were you let john have more to do with the management of demi for the boy needs training and none too soon to begin then do what i have often proposed let hannah come and help you she is a capital nurse and you may trust the precious babies to her while you do more housework you need the exercise hannah would enjoy the rest and john would find his wife again go out more keep cheerful as well as busy for you are the of the family and if you get dismal there is no fair weather then try to take an interest in whatever john with him let him read to you exchange ideas and help each other in that way shut yourself up in a bandbox because you are a woman but understand what is going on and educate yourself to take your part in the work for it all affects you and yours 
 john is so sensible afraid he will think stupid if i ask questions about politics and things 
 i believe he would love covers a multitude of sins and of whom could you ask more freely than of him try it and see if he find your society far more agreeable than mrs suppers 
 i will poor john afraid i have neglected him sadly but i thought i was right and he never said anything 
 he tried not to be selfish but he has felt rather forlorn i fancy this is just the time meg when young married people are apt to grow apart and the very time when they ought to be most together for the first tenderness soon wears off unless care is taken to preserve it and no time is so beautiful and precious to parents as the first years of the little lives given to them to train let john be a stranger to the babies for they will do more to keep him safe and happy in this world of trial and temptation than anything else and through them you will learn to know and love one another as you should now dear think over preachment act upon it if it seems good and god bless you all 
 meg did think it over found it good and acted upon it though the first attempt was not made exactly as she planned to have it of course the children tyrannized over her and ruled the house as soon as they found out that kicking and squalling brought them whatever they wanted mamma was an abject slave to their caprices but papa was not so easily subjugated and occasionally afflicted his tender spouse by an attempt at paternal discipline with his obstreperous son for demi inherited a trifle of his firmness of character we call it obstinacy and when he made up his little to have or to do anything all the horses and all the men could not change that pertinacious little mind mamma thought the dear too young to be taught to conquer his prejudices but papa believed that it never was too soon to learn obedience so master demi early discovered that when he undertook to wrastle with parpar he always got the worst of it yet like the englishman baby respected the man who conquered him and loved the father whose grave no no was more impressive than all love pats a few days after the talk with her mother meg resolved to try a social evening with john so she ordered a nice supper set the parlor in order dressed herself prettily and put the children to bed early that nothing should interfere with her experiment but unfortunately most unconquerable prejudice was against going to bed and that night he decided to go on a rampage so poor meg sang and rocked told stories and tried every wile she could devise but all in vain the big eyes shut and long after daisy had gone to byelow like the chubby little bunch of good nature she was naughty demi lay staring at the light with the most discouragingly expression of countenance 
 will demi lie still like a good boy while mamma runs down and gives poor papa his tea asked meg as the hall door softly closed and the step went into the dining room 
 me has tea said demi preparing to join in the revel 
 no but save you some little cakies for breakfast if go like daisy will you lovey 
 iss and demi shut his eyes tight as if to catch sleep and hurry the desired day 
 taking advantage of the propitious moment meg slipped away and ran down to greet her husband with a smiling face and the little blue bow in her hair which was his especial admiration he saw it at once and said with pleased surprise why little mother how gay we are tonight do you expect company 
 only you dear 
 no tired of being dowdy so i dressed up as a change you always make yourself nice for table no matter how tired you are so why i when i have the time 
 i do it out of respect for you my dear said john 
 ditto ditto mr brooke laughed meg looking young and pretty again as she nodded to him over the teapot 
 well altogether delightful and like old times this tastes right i drink your health dear and john sipped his tea with an air of reposeful rapture which was of very short duration however for as he put down his cup the door handle rattled mysteriously and a little voice was heard saying impatiently 
 opy doy tummin 
 that naughty boy i told him to go to sleep alone and here he is downstairs getting his death pattering over that canvas said meg answering the call 
 mornin now announced demi in joyful tone as he entered with his long nightgown gracefully festooned over his arm and every curl bobbing gayly as he pranced about the table eyeing the cakies with loving glances 
 no it morning yet you must go to bed and not trouble poor mamma then you can have the little cake with sugar on it 
 me loves parpar said the artful one preparing to climb the paternal knee and revel in forbidden joys but john shook his head and said to meg 
 if you told him to stay up there and go to sleep alone make him do it or he will never learn to mind you 
 yes of course come demi and meg led her son away feeling a strong desire to spank the little marplot who hopped beside her laboring under the delusion that the bribe was to be administered as soon as they reached the nursery 
 nor was he disappointed for that shortsighted woman actually gave him a lump of sugar tucked him into his bed and forbade any more promenades till morning 
 iss said demi the perjured blissfully sucking his sugar and regarding his first attempt as eminently successful 
 meg returned to her place and supper was progressing pleasantly when the little ghost walked again and exposed the maternal delinquencies by boldly demanding more sudar marmar 
 now this do said john hardening his heart against the engaging little sinner we shall never know any peace till that child learns togo to bed properly you have made a slave of yourself long enough give him one lesson and then there will be an end of it put him in his bed and leave him meg 
 he stay there he never does unless i sit by him 
 manage him demi go upstairs and get into your bed as mamma bids you 
 replied the young rebel helping himself to the coveted cakie and beginning to eat the same with calm audacity 
 you must never say that to papa i shall carry you if you go yourself 
 go way me love parpar and demi retired to his skirts for protection 
 but even that refuge proved unavailing for he was delivered over to the enemy with a be gentle with him john which struck the culprit with dismay for when mamma deserted him then the judgment day was at hand bereft of his cake defrauded of his frolic and borne away by a strong hand to that detested bed poor demi could not restrain his wrath but openly defied papa and kicked and screamed lustily all the way upstairs the minute he was put into bed on one side he rolled out on the other and made for the door only to be ignominiously caught up by the tail of his little toga and put back again which lively performance was kept up till the young strength gave out when he devoted himself to roaring at the top of his voice this vocal exercise usually conquered meg but john sat as unmoved as the post which is popularly believed to be deaf no coaxing no sugar no lullaby no story even the light was put out and only the red glow of the fire enlivened the big dark which demi regarded with curiosity rather than fear this new order of things disgusted him and he howled dismally for marmar as his angry passions subsided and recollections of his tender bondwoman returned to the captive autocrat the plaintive wail which succeeded the passionate roar went to heart and she ran up to say beseechingly

 no my dear told him he must go to sleep as you bid him and he must if i stay here all night

lionfish nov chapter the second war beginscontents prev chapter 
 he who must not be named returns 
 in a brief statement on friday night minister for magic cornelius fudge confirmed that has returned to this country and is once more active 
 
 it is with great regret that i must confirm that the wizard styling himself lordwell you know who i meanis alive and among us again said fudge looking tired and flustered as he addressed reporters it is with almost equal regret that we report the mass revolt of the dementors of azkaban who have shown themselves averse to continuing in the employ we believe the dementors are currently taking direction from lord thingy 
 
 we urge the magician population to remain vigilant the ministry is currently publishing guides to elementary home and personal defence which will be delivered free to all wizarding homes within the coming month 
 
 the statement was met with dismay and alarm from the wizarding community which as recently as last wednesday was receiving ministry assurances that there was no truth whatsoever in these persistent rumours that is operating amongst us once more 
 
 details of the events that led to the ministry turnaround are still hazy though it is believed that he who must not be named and a select band of followers known as death eaters gained entry to the ministry of magic itself on thursday evening 
 
 albus dumbledore newly reinstated headmaster of hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry reinstated member of the international confederation of wizards and reinstated chief warlock of the wizengamot has so far been unavailable for comment he has insisted over the past year that is not dead as was widely hoped and believed but is recruiting followers once more for afresh attempt to seize power meanwhile the boy who lived 
 
 there you are harry i knew drag you into it somehow said hermione looking over the top of the paper at him 
 
 they were in the hospital wing harry was sitting on the end of bed and they were both listening to hermione read the front page of the sunday whose ankle had been mended in a trice by madam pomfrey was curled up at the foot of bed neville whose nose had likewise been returned to its normal size and shape was in a chair between the two beds and luna who had dropped in to visit clutching the latest edition of the quibbler was reading the magazine and apparently not taking in a word hermione was saying 
 
 the boy who lived again now though he said ron darkly not such a deluded any more eh 
 
 he helped himself to a handful of chocolate frogs from the immense pile on his bedside cabinet threw a few to harry ginny and neville and ripped off the wrapper of his own with his teeth there were still deep welts on his forearms where the tentacles had wrapped around him according to madam pomfrey thoughts could leave deeper scarring than almost anything else though since she had started applying copious amounts of dr oblivious unction there seemed to have been some improvement 
 
 yes very complimentary about you now harry said hermione scanning down the article a lone voice of truth perceived as unbalanced yet never wavered in his story forced to bear ridicule and slander hmmm she said frowning i notice they mention the fact that it was them doing all the ridiculing and slandering in the prophet 
 
 she winced slightly and put a hand to her ribs the curse dolohov had used on her though less effective than it would have been had he been able to say the incantation aloud had nevertheless caused in madam words quite enough damage to be going on with hermione was having to take ten different types of potion every day was improving greatly and was already bored with the hospital wing 
 
 last attempt to take over pages two to jour what the ministry should have told us page five why nobody listened to albus dumbledore pages six to eight exclusive interview with harry potter page nine well said hermione folding up the newspaper and throwing it aside certainly given them lots to write about and that interview with harry exclusive the one that was in the quibbler months ago 
 
 daddy sold it to them said luna vaguely turning a page of the got a very good price for it too so going to go on an expedition to sweden this summer to see if we can catch a snorkack 
 
 hermione seemed to struggle with herself for a moment then said that sounds lovely 
 
 ginny caught eye and looked away quickly grinning 
 
 so anyway said hermione sitting up a little straighter and wincing again going on in school 
 
 well got rid of fred and swamp said ginny he did it in about three seconds but he left a tiny patch under the window and roped it off 
 
 why said hermione looking startled 
 
 oh he just says it was a really good bit of magic said ginny shrugging 
 
 i think he left it as a monument to fred and george said ron through a mouthful of chocolate they sent me all these you know he told harry pointing at the small mountain of frogs beside him must be doing all right out of that joke shop eh 
 
 hermione looked rather disapproving and asked so has all the trouble stopped now back 
 
 yes said neville settled right back to normal 
 
 i filch is happy is he asked ron propping a chocolate frog card featuring dumbledore against his water jug 
 
 not at all said ginny really really miserable actually she lowered her voice to a whisper he keeps saying umbridge was the best thing that ever happened to hogwarts 
 
 all six of them looked around professor umbridge was lying in a bed opposite them gazing up at the ceiling dumbledore had strode alone into the forest to rescue her from the centaurs how he had done ithow he had emerged from the trees supporting professor umbridge without so much as a scratch on himnobody knew and umbridge was certainly not telling since she had returned to the castle she had not as far as any of them knew uttered a single word nobody really knew what was wrong with her either her usually neat mousy hair was very untidy and there were still bits of twigs and leaves in it but otherwise she seemed to be quite unscathed 
 
 madam pomfrey says just in shock whispered hermione 
 
 sulking more like said ginny 
 
 yeah she shows signs of life if you do this said ron and with his tongue he made soft noises umbridge sat bolt upright looking around wildly 
 
 anything wrong professor called madam pomfrey poking her head around her office door 
 
 no no said umbridge sinking back into her pillows no i must have been dreaming 
 
 hermione and ginny muffled their laughter in the bedclothes 
 
 speaking of centaurs said hermione when she had recovered a little divination teacher now is firenze staying 
 
 got to said harry the other centaurs take him back will they 
 
 it looks like he and trelawney are both going to teach said ginny 
 
 bet dumbledore wishes he got rid of trelawney for good said ron now munching on his fourteenth frog mind you the whole useless if you ask me firenze a lot better 
 
 how can you say that hermione demanded after just found out that there are real prophecies 
 
 heart began to race he had not told ron hermione or anyone else what the prophecy had contained neville had told them it had smashed while harry was pulling him up the steps in the death room and harry had not yet corrected this impression he was not ready to see their expressions when he told them that he must be either murderer or victim there was no other way 
 
 it is a pity it broke said hermione quietly shaking her head 
 
 yeah it is said ron still at least never found out what was in it either where are you going he added looking both surprised and disappointed as harry stood up 
 
 said harry you know he just got back and i promised go down and see him and tell him how you two are 
 
 oh all right then said ron grumpily looking out of the dormitory window at the patch of bright blue sky beyond wish we could come 
 
 say hello to him for us called hermione as harry proceeded down the ward and ask him happening about about his little friend 
 
 harry gave a wave of his hand to show he had heard and understood as he left the dormitory 
 
 the castle seemed very quiet even for a sunday everybody was clearly out in the sunny grounds enjoying the end of their exams and the prospect of a last few days of term unhampered by revision or homework harry walked slowly along the deserted corridor peering out of windows as he went he could see people messing around in the air over the quidditch pitch and a couple of students swimming in the lake accompanied by the giant squid 
 
 he was finding it hard to decide whether he wanted to be with people or not whenever he was in company he wanted to get away and whenever he was alone he wanted company he thought he might really go and visit hagrid though as he had not talked to him properly since returned 
 
 harry had just descended the last marble step into the entrance hall when malfoy crabbe and goyle emerged from a door on the right that harry knew led down to the slytherin common room harry stopped dead so did malfoy and the others the only sounds were the shouts laughter and splashes drifting into the hall from the grounds through the open front doors 
 
 malfoy glanced aroundharry knew he was checking for signs of teachersthen he looked back at harry and said in a low voice dead potter 
 
 harry raised his eyebrows 
 
 funny he said think have stopped walking around 
 
 malfoy looked angrier than harry had ever seen him he felt a kind of detached satisfaction at the sight of his pale pointed face contorted with rage 
 
 going to pay said malfoy in a voice barely louder than a whisper going to make you pay for what done to my father 
 
 well terrified now said harry sarcastically i lord just a act compared to you the matter he added for malfoy crabbe and goyle had all looked stricken at the sound of the name a mate of your dad he not scared of him are you 
 
 you think such a big man potter said malfoy advancing now crabbe and goyle flanking him you wait have you you land my father in prison 
 
 i thought i just had said harry 
 
 the dementors have left azkaban said malfoy quietly dad and the be out in no time 
 
 yeah i expect they will said harry still at least everyone knows what scumbags they are now 
 
 hand flew towards his wand but harry was too quick for him he had drawn his own wand before fingers had even entered the pocket of his robes 
 
 potter 
 
 the voice rang across the entrance hall snape had emerged from the staircase leading down to his office and at the sight of him harry felt a great rush of hatred beyond anything he felt towards malfoy whatever dumbledore said he would never forgive snape never 
 
 what are you doing potter said snape as coldly as ever as he strode over to the four of them 
 
 trying to decide what curse to use on malfoy sir said harry fiercely 
 
 snape stared at him 
 
 put that wand away at once he said curtly ten points from gryff 
 
 snape looked towards the giant on the walls and gave a sneering smile 
 
 ah i see there are no longer any points left in the gryffindor to take away in that case potter we will simply have to 
 
 add some more 
 
 professor mcgonagall had just stumped up the stone steps into the castle she was carrying a tartan carpetbag in one hand and leaning heavily on a walking stick with her other but otherwise looked quite well 
 
 professor mcgonagall said snape striding forwards out of st i see 
 
 yes professor snape said professor mcgonagall shrugging off her travelling cloak quite as good as new you twocrabbegoyle 
 
 she beckoned them forwards imperiously and they came shuffling their large feet and looking awkward 
 
 here said professor mcgonagall thrusting her carpetbag into chest and her cloak into take these up to my office for me 
 
 they turned and stumped away up the marble staircase 
 
 right then said professor mcgonagall looking up at the hourglasses on the wall well i think potter and his friends ought to have fifty points apiece for alerting the world to the return of what say you professor snape 
 
 what snapped snape though harry knew he had heard perfectly well ohwelli suppose 
 
 so fifty each for potter the two weasleys longbottom and miss granger said professor mcgonagall and a shower of rubies fell down into the bottom bulb of gryffindor s as she spoke ohand fifty for miss lovegood i suppose she added and a number of sapphires fell into glass now you wanted to take ten from mr potter i think professor snapeso there we are 
 
 a few rubies retreated into the upper bulb leaving a respectable amount below nevertheless 
 
 well potter malfoy i think you ought to be outside on a glorious day like this professor mcgonagall continued briskly 
 
 harry did not need telling twice he thrust his wand back inside his robes and headed straight for the front doors without another glance at snape and malfoy 
 
 the hot sun hit him with a blast as he walked across the lawns towards cabin students lying around on the grass sunbathing talking reading the sunday prophet and eating sweets looked up at him as he passed some called out to him or else waved clearly eager to show that they like the prophet had decided he was something of a hero harry said nothing to any of them he had no idea how much they knew of what had happened three days ago but he had so far avoided being questioned and preferred to keep it that way 
 
 he thought at first when he knocked on cabin door that he was out but then fang came charging around the corner and almost bowled him over with the enthusiasm of his welcome hagrid it transpired was picking runner beans in his back garden 
 
 all righ harry he said beaming when harry approached the fence come in come in have a cup o dandelion juice 
 
 things hagrid asked him as they settled down at his wooden table with a glass apiece of iced juice yeherfeelin all righ are yeh 
 
 harry knew from the look of concern on face that he was not referring to physical 
 
 fine harry said quickly because he could not bear to discuss the thing that he knew was in mind so you been 
 
 bin hidin out in the mountains said hagrid up in a cave like sirius did when he 
 
 hagrid broke off cleared his throat gruffly looked at harry and took a long draught of juice 
 
 anyway back now he said feebly 
 
 youyou look better said harry who was determined to keep the conversation moving away from sirius 
 
 wha said hagrid raising a massive hand and feeling his face ohoh yeah well loads better behaved now loads seemed right pleased ter see me when i got back ter tell yeh the truth a good lad really ive bin thinkin abou tryin ter find him a lady friend actually 
 
 harry would normally have tried to persuade hagrid out of this idea at once the prospect of a second giant taking up residence in the forest possibly even wilder and more brutal than grawp was positively alarming but somehow harry could not muster the energy necessary to argue the point he was starting to wish he was alone again and with the idea of hastening his departure he took several large gulps of his dandelion juice his glass 
 
 knows bin tellin the truth now harry said hagrid softly and unexpectedly he was watching harry closely gotta be better hasn it 
 
 harry shrugged 
 
 look hagrid leaned towards him across the table i knew sirius longer n yeh did he died in battle an the way wanted ter go 
 
 he want to go at all said harry angrily 
 
 hagrid bowed his great shaggy head 
 
 nah i don reckon he did he said quietly but still harry he was never one ter sit aroun at home an let other people do the fightin he lived with himself if he hadn gone ter help 
 
 harry leapt up 
 
 got to go and visit ron and hermione in the hospital wing he said mechanically 
 
 oh said hagrid looking rather upset oh all righ then harry take care o yerself then an drop back in if got a mo 
 
 yeah right 
 
 harry crossed to the door as fast as he could and pulled it open he was out in the sunshine again before hagrid had finished saying goodbye and walking away across the lawn once again people called out to him as he passed he closed his eyes for a few moments wishing they would all vanish that he could open his eyes and find himself alone in the grounds 
 
 a few days ago before his exams had finished and he had seen the vision voldemort had planted in his mind he would have given almost anything for the wizarding world to know he had been telling the truth for them to believe that voldemort was back and to know that he was neither a liar nor mad now however 
 
 he walked a short way around the lake sat down on its bank sheltered from the gaze of behind a tangle of shrubs and stared out over the gleaming water thinking 
 
 perhaps the reason he wanted to be alone was because he had felt isolated from everybody since his talk with dumbledore an invisible barrier separated him from the rest of the world he washe had always beena marked man it was just that he had never really understood what that meant 
 
 and yet sitting here on the edge of the lake with the terrible weight of grief dragging at him with the loss of sirius so raw and fresh inside he could not muster any great sense of fear it was sunny and the grounds around him were full of laughing people and even though he felt as distant from them as though he belonged to a different race it was still very hard to believe as he sat here that his life must include or end in murder 
 
 he sat there for a long time gazing out at the water trying not to think about his godfather or to remember that it was directly across from here on the opposite bank that sirius had once collapsed trying to fend off a hundred dementors 
 
 the sun had set before he realised he was cold he got up and returned to the castle wiping his face on his sleeve as he went 
 
 ron and hermione left the hospital wing completely cured three days before the end of term hermione kept showing signs of wanting to talk about sirius but ron tended to make hushing noises every time she mentioned his name harry was still not sure whether or not he wanted to talk about his godfather yet his wishes varied with his mood he knew one thing though unhappy as he felt at the moment he would greatly miss hogwarts in a few days time when he was back at number four privet drive even though he now understood exactly why he had to return there every summer he did not feel any better about it indeed he had never dreaded his return more 
 
 professor umbridge left hogwarts the day before the end of term it seemed she had crept out of the hospital wing during dinnertime evidently hoping to depart undetected but unfortunately for her she met peeves on the way who seized his last chance to do as fred had instructed and chased her gleefully from the premises whacking her alternately with a walking stick and a sock full of chalk many students ran out into the entrance hall to watch her running away down the path and the heads of houses tried only to restrain them indeed professor mcgonagall sank back into her chair at the staff table after a few feeble remonstrances and was clearly heard to express a regret that she could not run cheering after umbridge herself because peeves had borrowed her walking stick 
 
 their last evening at school arrived most people had finished packing and were already heading down to the leaving feast but harry had not even started 
 
 just do it tomorrow said ron who was waiting by the door of their dormitory come on starving 
 
 i be long look you go ahead 
 
 but when the dormitory door closed behind ron harry made no effort to speed up his packing the very last thing he wanted to do was to attend the leaving feast he was worried that dumbledore would make some reference to him in his speech he was sure to mention return he had talked to them about it last year after all 
 
 harry pulled some crumpled robes out of the very bottom of his trunk to make way for folded ones and as he did so noticed a badly wrapped package lying in a corner of it he could not think what it was doing there he bent down pulled it out from underneath his trainers and examined it 
 
 he realised what it was within seconds sirius had given it to him just inside the front door of number twelve grimmauld place use it if you need me all right 
 
 harry sank down on to his bed and unwrapped the package out fell a small square mirror it looked old it was certainly dirty harry held it up to his face and saw his own reflection looking back at him 
 
 he turned the mirror over there on the reverse side was a scribbled note from sirius 
 
 this is a mirror got the other one of the pair if you need to speak to me just say my name into it appear in my mirror and be able to talk in yours james and i used to use them when we were in separate detentions 
 
 heart began to race he remembered seeing his dead parents in the mirror of erised four years ago he was going to be able to talk to sirius again right now he knew it 
 
 he looked around to make sure there was nobody else there the dormitory was quite empty he looked back at the mirror raised it in front of his face with trembling hands and said loudly and clearly sirius 
 
 his breath misted the surface of the glass he held the mirror even closer excitement flooding through him but the eyes blinking back at him through the fog were definitely his own 
 
 he wiped the mirror clear again and said so that every syllable rang clearly through the room 
 
 sirius black 
 
 nothing happened the frustrated face looking back out of the mirror was still definitely his own 
 
 sirius have his mirror on him when he went through the archway said a small voice in head why not working 
 
 harry remained quite still for a moment then hurled the mirror back into the trunk where it shattered he had been convinced for a whole shining minute that he was going to see sirius talk to him again 
 
 disappointment was burning in his throat he got up and began throwing his things into the trunk on top of the broken mirror 
 
 but then an idea struck him a better idea than a mirror a much bigger more important idea how had he never thought of it beforewhy had he never asked 
 
 he was sprinting out of the dormitory and down the spiral staircase hitting the walls as he ran and barely noticing he hurtled across the empty common room through the portrait hole and off along the corridor ignoring the fat lady who called after him the feast is about to start you know cutting it very fine 
 
 but harry had no intention of going to the feast 
 
 how could it be that the place was full of ghosts whenever you need one yet now 
 
 he ran down staircases and along corridors and met nobody either alive or dead they were all clearly in the great hall outside his charms classroom he came to a halt panting and thinking disconsolately that he would have to wait until later until after the end of the feast 
 
 but just as he had given up hope he saw ita translucent somebody drifting across the end of the corridor 
 
 heyhey nick nick 
 
 the ghost stuck its head back out of the wall revealing the extravagantly plumed hat and dangerously wobbling head of sir nicholas de 
 
 good evening he said withdrawing the rest of his body from the solid stone and smiling at harry i am not the only one who is late then though he sighed in a rather different sense of course 
 
 nick can i ask you something 
 
 a most peculiar expression stole over nearly headless face as he inserted a finger in the stiff ruff at his neck and tugged it a little straighter apparently to give himself thinking time he desisted only when his partially severed neck seemed about to give way completely 
 
 ernow harry said nick looking discomfited it wait until after the feast 
 
 nonick please said harry i really need to talk to you can we go in here 
 
 harry opened the door of the nearest classroom and nearly headless nick sighed 
 
 oh very well he said looking resigned i pretend i been expecting it 
 
 harry was holding the door open for him but he drifted through the wall instead 
 
 expecting what harry asked as he closed the door 
 
 you to come and find me said nick now gliding over to the window and looking out at the darkening grounds it happens sometimes when somebody has suffered a loss 
 
 well said harry refusing to be deflected you were right come to find you 
 
 nick said nothing 
 
 said harry who was finding this more awkward than he had anticipated just dead but still here you 
 
 nick sighed and continued to gaze out at the grounds 
 
 right it harry urged him you died but talking to you you can walk around hogwarts and everything you 
 
 yes said nearly headless nick quietly i walk and talk yes 
 
 so you came back you said harry urgently people can come back right as ghosts they have to disappear completely well he added impatiently when nick continued to say nothing 
 
 nearly headless nick hesitated then said not everyone can come back as a ghost 
 
 what mean said harry quickly 
 
 only only wizards 
 
 oh said harry and he almost laughed with relief well ok then the person asking about is a wizard so he can come back right 
 
 nick turned away from the window and looked mournfully at harry 
 
 he come back 
 
 who 
 
 sirius black said nick 
 
 but you did said harry angrily you came dead and you disappear 
 
 wizards can leave an imprint of themselves upon the earth to walk palely where their living selves once trod said nick miserably but very few wizards choose that path 
 
 why not said harry anywayit mattersirius care if unusual come back i know he will 
 
 and so strong was his belief harry actually turned his head to check the door sure for a split second that he was going to see sirius and transparent but beaming walking through it towards him 
 
 he will not come back repeated nick he will have gone on 
 
 what mean gone on said harry quickly gone on where listenwhat happens when you die anyway where do you go why everyone come back why this place full of ghosts why 
 
 i cannot answer said nick 
 
 dead you said harry exasperatedly who can answer better than you 
 
 i was afraid of death said nick softly i chose to remain behind i sometimes wonder whether i to have well that is neither here nor there in fact i am neither here nor there he gave a small sad chuckle i know nothing of the secrets of death harry for i chose my feeble imitation of life instead i believe learned wizards study the matter in the department of mysteries 
 
 talk to me about that place said harry fiercely 
 
 i am sorry not to have been more help said nick gently well well do excuse me the feast you know 
 
 and he left the room leaving harry there alone gazing blankly at the wall through which nick had disappeared 
 
 harry felt almost as though he had lost his godfather all over again in losing the hope that he might be able to see or speak to him once more he walked slowly and miserably back up through the empty castle wondering whether he would ever feel cheerful again 
 
 he had turned the corner towards the fat corridor when he saw somebody up ahead fastening a note to a board on the wall a second glance showed him it was luna there were no good hiding places nearby she was bound to have heard his footsteps and in any case harry could hardly muster the energy to avoid anyone at the moment 
 
 hello said luna vaguely glancing around at him as she stepped back from the notice 
 
 how come not at the feast harry asked 
 
 well lost most of my possessions said luna serenely people take them and hide them you know but as the last night i really do need them back so been putting up signs 
 
 she gestured towards the noticeboard upon which sure enough she had pinned a list of all her missing books and clothes with a plea for their return 
 
 an odd feeling rose in harry an emotion quite different from the anger and grief that had filled him since death it was a few moments before he realised that he was feeling sorry for luna 
 
 how come people hide your stuff he asked her frowning 
 
 oh well she shrugged i think they think a bit odd you know some people call me loony lovegood actually 
 
 harry looked at her and the new feeling of pity intensified rather painfully 
 
 no reason for them to take your things he said flatly want help finding them 
 
 oh no she said smiling at him come back they always do in the end it was just that i wanted to pack tonight anyway why you at the feast 
 
 harry shrugged just feel like it 
 
 no said luna observing him with those oddly misty protuberant eyes i suppose you do that man the death eaters killed was your godfather he ginny told me 
 
 harry nodded curtly but found that for some reason he did not mind luna talking about sirius he had just remembered that she too could see thestrals 
 
 have you he began i mean who has anyone you known ever died 
 
 yes said luna simply my mother she was a quite extraordinary witch you know but she did like to experiment and one of her spells went rather badly wrong one day i was nine 
 
 sorry harry mumbled 
 
 yes it was rather horrible said luna conversationally i still feel very sad about it sometimes but still got dad and anyway not as though never see mum again is it 
 
 it said harry uncertainly 
 
 she shook her head in disbelief 
 
 oh come on you heard them just behind the veil you 
 
 you mean 
 
 in that room with the archway they were just lurking out of sight all you heard them 
 
 they looked at each other luna was smiling slightly harry did not know what to say or to think luna believed so many extraordinary things yet he had been sure he had heard voices behind the veil too 
 
 are you sure you want me to help you look for your stuff he said 
 
 oh no said luna no i think just go down and have some pudding and wait for it all to turn up it always does in the end well have a nice holiday harry 
 
 yeah yeah you too 
 
 she walked away from him and as he watched her go he found that the terrible weight in his stomach seemed to have lessened slightly 
 
 the journey home on the hogwarts express next day was eventful in several ways firstly malfoy crabbe and goyle who had clearly been waiting all week for the opportunity to strike without teacher witnesses attempted to ambush harry halfway down the train as he made his way back from the toilet the attack might have succeeded had it not been for the fact that they unwittingly chose to stage the attack right outside a compartment full of da members who saw what was happening through the glass and rose as one to rush to aid by the time ernie macmillan hannah abbott susan bones justin anthony goldstein and terry boot had finished using a wide variety of the hexes and jinxes harry had taught them malfoy crabbe and goyle resembled nothing so much as three gigantic slugs squeezed into hogwarts uniform as harry ernie and justin hoisted them into the luggage rack and left them there to ooze 
 
 i must say looking forward to seeing face when he gets off the train said ernie with some satisfaction as he watched malfoy squirm above him ernie had never quite got over the indignity of malfoy docking points from hufflepuff during his brief spell as a member of the inquisitorial squad 
 
 be really pleased though said ron who had come to investigate the source of the commotion loads now anyway harry the food just stopped if you want anything 
 
 harry thanked the others and accompanied ron back to their compartment where he bought a large pile of cauldron cakes and pumpkin pasties hermione was reading the daily prophet again ginny was doing a quiz in the quibbler and neville was stroking his mimbulus mimbletonia which had grown a great deal over the year and now made odd crooning noises when touched 
 
 harry and ron whiled away most of the journey playing wizard chess while hermione read out snippets from the was now full of articles about how to repel dementors attempts by the ministry to track down death eaters and hysterical letters claiming that the writer had seen lord voldemort walking past their house that very morning 
 
 it really started yet sighed hermione gloomily folding up the newspaper again but it be long now 
 
 hey harry said ron softly nodding towards the glass window on to the corridor 
 
 harry looked around cho was passing accompanied by marietta edgecombe who was wearing a balaclava his and eyes met for a moment cho blushed and kept walking harry looked back down at the chessboard just in time to see one of his pawns chased off its square by knight 
 
 going on with you and her anyway ron asked quietly 
 
 nothing said harry truthfully 
 
 ierheard going out with someone else now said hermione tentatively 
 
 harry was surprised to find that this information did not hurt at all wanting to impress cho seemed to belong to a past that was no longer quite connected with him so much of what he had wanted before death felt that way these days the week that had elapsed since he had last seen sirius seemed to have lasted much much longer it stretched across two universes the one with sirius in it and the one without 
 
 well out of it mate said ron forcefully i mean quite and all that but you want someone a bit more cheerful 
 
 probably cheerful enough with someone else said harry shrugging 
 
 she with now anyway ron asked hermione but it was ginny who answered 
 
 michael corner she said 
 
 michaelbut said ron craning around in his seat to state at her but you were going out with him 
 
 not any more said ginny resolutely he like gryffindor beating ravenclaw at quidditch and got really sulky so i ditched him and he ran off to comfort cho instead she scratched her nose absently with the end of her quill turned the quibbler and began marking her answers ron looked highly delighted 
 
 well i always thought he was a bit of an idiot he said prodding his queen forwards towards quivering castle good for you just choose someonebetternext time 
 
 he cast harry an oddly furtive look as he said it 
 
 well chosen dean thomas would you say better asked ginny vaguely 
 
 what shouted ron upending the chessboard crookshanks went plunging after the pieces and hedwig and pigwidgeon twittered and hooted angrily from overhead 
 
 as the train slowed down in the approach to cross harry thought he had never wanted to leave it less he even wondered fleetingly what would happen if he simply refused to get off but remained stubbornly sitting there until the first of september when it would take him back to hogwarts when it finally puffed to a standstill however he lifted down cage and prepared to drag his trunk from the train as usual 
 
 when the ticket inspector signalled to harry ron and hermione that it was safe to walk through the magical barrier between platforms nine and ten however he found a surprise awaiting him on the other side a group of people standing there to greet him who he had not expected at all 
 
 there was moody looking quite as sinister with his bowler hat pulled low over his magical eye as he would have done without it his gnarled hands clutching a long staff his body wrapped in a voluminous travelling cloak tonks stood just behind him her bright hair gleaming in the sunlight filtering through the dirty glass of the station ceiling wearing heavily patched jeans and a bright purple bearing the legend the weird to tonks was lupin his face pale his hair greying a long and threadbare overcoat covering a shabby jumper and trousers at the front of the group stood mr and mrs weasley dressed in their muggle best and fred and george who were both wearing jackets in some lurid green scaly material 
 
 ron ginny called mrs weasley hurrying forwards and hugging her children tightly oh and harry dearhow are you 
 
 fine lied harry as she pulled him into a tight embrace over her shoulder he saw ron goggling at the twins new clothes 
 
 what are they supposed to be he asked pointing at the jackets 
 
 finest dragonskin little bro said fred giving his zip a little tweak business is booming and we thought treat ourselves 
 
 hello harry said lupin as mrs weasley let go of harry and turned to greet hermione 
 
 hi said harry i expect what are you all doing here 
 
 well said lupin with a slight smile we thought we might have a little chat with your aunt and uncle before letting them take you home 
 
 i dunno if a good idea said harry at once 
 
 oh i think it is growled moody who had limped a little closer be them will it potter 
 
 he pointed with his thumb over his shoulder his magical eye was evidently peering through the back of his head and his bowler hat harry leaned an inch or so to the left to see where was pointing and there sure enough were the three dursleys who looked positively appalled to see reception committee 
 
 ah harry said mr weasley turning from parents who he had just greeted enthusiastically and who were now taking it in turns to hug hermione well shall we do it then 
 
 yeah i reckon so arthur said moody 
 
 he and mr weasley took the lead across the station towards the dursleys who were apparently rooted to the floor hermione disengaged herself gently from her mother to join the group 
 
 good afternoon said mr weasley pleasantly to uncle vernon as he came to a halt right in front of him you might remember me my arthur weasley 
 
 as mr weasley had demolished most of the dursleys living room two years previously harry would have been very surprised if uncle vernon had forgotten him sure enough uncle vernon turned a deeper shade of puce and glared at mr weasley but chose not to say anything partly perhaps because the dursleys were outnumbered two to one aunt petunia looked both frightened and embarrassed she kept glancing around as though terrified somebody she knew would see her in such company dudley meanwhile seemed to be trying to look small and insignificant a feat at which he was failing extravagantly 
 
 we thought just have a few words with you about harry said mr weasley still smiling 
 
 yeah growled moody about how treated when at your place 
 
 uncle moustache seemed to bristle with indignation possibly because the bowler hat gave him the entirely mistaken impression that he was dealing with a kindred spirit he addressed himself to moody 
 
 i am not aware that it is any of your business what goes on in my house 
 
 i expect what not aware of would fill several books dursley growled moody 
 
 anyway not the point interjected tonks whose pink hair seemed to offend aunt petunia more than all the rest put together for she closed her eyes rather than look at her the point is if we find out been horrible to harry 
 
 and make no mistake hear about it added lupin pleasantly 
 
 yes said mr weasley even if you let harry use the 
 
 telephone whispered hermione 
 
 yeah if we get any hint that been mistreated in any way have us to answer to said moody 
 
 uncle vernon swelled ominously his sense of outrage seemed to outweigh even his fear of this bunch of oddballs 
 
 are you threatening me sir he said so loudly that actually turned to stare 
 
 yes i am said who seemed rather pleased that uncle vernon had grasped this fact so quickly 
 
 and do i look like the kind of man who can be intimidated barked uncle vernon 
 
 well said moody pushing back his bowler hat to reveal his sinisterly revolving magical eye uncle vernon leapt backwards in horror and collided painfully with a luggage trolley yes have to say you do dursley 
 
 he turned away from uncle vernon to survey harry 
 
 so potter give us a shout if you need us if we hear from you for three days in a row send someone along 
 
 aunt petunia whimpered piteously it could not have been plainer that she was thinking of what the neighbours would say if they caught sight of these people marching up the garden path 
 
 bye then potter said moody grasping shoulder for a moment with a gnarled hand 
 
 take care harry said lupin quietly keep in touch 
 
 harry have you away from there as soon as we can mrs weasley whispered hugging him again 
 
 see you soon mate said ron anxiously shaking hand 
 
 really soon harry said hermione earnestly we promise 
 
 harry nodded he somehow could not find words to tell them what it meant to him to see them all ranged there on his side instead he smiled raised a hand in farewell turned around and led the way out of the station towards the sunlit street with uncle vernon aunt petunia and dudley hurrying along in his wake 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the order of the phoenix
