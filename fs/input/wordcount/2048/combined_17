 he who must not be named returns 
 in a brief statement on friday night minister for magic cornelius fudge confirmed that has returned to this country and is once more active 
 
 it is with great regret that i must confirm that the wizard styling himself lordwell you know who i meanis alive and among us again said fudge looking tired and flustered as he addressed reporters it is with almost equal regret that we report the mass revolt of the dementors of azkaban who have shown themselves averse to continuing in the employ we believe the dementors are currently taking direction from lord thingy 
 
 we urge the magician population to remain vigilant the ministry is currently publishing guides to elementary home and personal defence which will be delivered free to all wizarding homes within the coming month 
 
 the statement was met with dismay and alarm from the wizarding community which as recently as last wednesday was receiving ministry assurances that there was no truth whatsoever in these persistent rumours that is operating amongst us once more 
 
 details of the events that led to the ministry turnaround are still hazy though it is believed that he who must not be named and a select band of followers known as death eaters gained entry to the ministry of magic itself on thursday evening 
 
 albus dumbledore newly reinstated headmaster of hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry reinstated member of the international confederation of wizards and reinstated chief warlock of the wizengamot has so far been unavailable for comment he has insisted over the past year that is not dead as was widely hoped and believed but is recruiting followers once more for afresh attempt to seize power meanwhile the boy who lived 
 
 there you are harry i knew drag you into it somehow said hermione looking over the top of the paper at him 
 
 they were in the hospital wing harry was sitting on the end of bed and they were both listening to hermione read the front page of the sunday whose ankle had been mended in a trice by madam pomfrey was curled up at the foot of bed neville whose nose had likewise been returned to its normal size and shape was in a chair between the two beds and luna who had dropped in to visit clutching the latest edition of the quibbler was reading the magazine and apparently not taking in a word hermione was saying 
 
 the boy who lived again now though he said ron darkly not such a deluded any more eh 
 
 he helped himself to a handful of chocolate frogs from the immense pile on his bedside cabinet threw a few to harry ginny and neville and ripped off the wrapper of his own with his teeth there were still deep welts on his forearms where the tentacles had wrapped around him according to madam pomfrey thoughts could leave deeper scarring than almost anything else though since she had started applying copious amounts of dr oblivious unction there seemed to have been some improvement 
 
 yes very complimentary about you now harry said hermione scanning down the article a lone voice of truth perceived as unbalanced yet never wavered in his story forced to bear ridicule and slander hmmm she said frowning i notice they mention the fact that it was them doing all the ridiculing and slandering in the prophet 
 
 she winced slightly and put a hand to her ribs the curse dolohov had used on her though less effective than it would have been had he been able to say the incantation aloud had nevertheless caused in madam words quite enough damage to be going on with hermione was having to take ten different types of potion every day was improving greatly and was already bored with the hospital wing 
 
 last attempt to take over pages two to jour what the ministry should have told us page five why nobody listened to albus dumbledore pages six to eight exclusive interview with harry potter page nine well said hermione folding up the newspaper and throwing it aside certainly given them lots to write about and that interview with harry exclusive the one that was in the quibbler months ago 
 
 daddy sold it to them said luna vaguely turning a page of the got a very good price for it too so going to go on an expedition to sweden this summer to see if we can catch a snorkack 
 
 hermione seemed to struggle with herself for a moment then said that sounds lovely 
 
 ginny caught eye and looked away quickly grinning 
 
 so anyway said hermione sitting up a little straighter and wincing again going on in school 
 
 well got rid of fred and swamp said ginny he did it in about three seconds but he left a tiny patch under the window and roped it off 
 
 why said hermione looking startled 
 
 oh he just says it was a really good bit of magic said ginny shrugging 
 
 i think he left it as a monument to fred and george said ron through a mouthful of chocolate they sent me all these you know he told harry pointing at the small mountain of frogs beside him must be doing all right out of that joke shop eh 
 
 hermione looked rather disapproving and asked so has all the trouble stopped now back 
 
 yes said neville settled right back to normal 
 
 i filch is happy is he asked ron propping a chocolate frog card featuring dumbledore against his water jug 
 
 not at all said ginny really really miserable actually she lowered her voice to a whisper he keeps saying umbridge was the best thing that ever happened to hogwarts 
 
 all six of them looked around professor umbridge was lying in a bed opposite them gazing up at the ceiling dumbledore had strode alone into the forest to rescue her from the centaurs how he had done ithow he had emerged from the trees supporting professor umbridge without so much as a scratch on himnobody knew and umbridge was certainly not telling since she had returned to the castle she had not as far as any of them knew uttered a single word nobody really knew what was wrong with her either her usually neat mousy hair was very untidy and there were still bits of twigs and leaves in it but otherwise she seemed to be quite unscathed 
 
 madam pomfrey says just in shock whispered hermione 
 
 sulking more like said ginny 
 
 yeah she shows signs of life if you do this said ron and with his tongue he made soft noises umbridge sat bolt upright looking around wildly 
 
 anything wrong professor called madam pomfrey poking her head around her office door 
 
 no no said umbridge sinking back into her pillows no i must have been dreaming 
 
 hermione and ginny muffled their laughter in the bedclothes 
 
 speaking of centaurs said hermione when she had recovered a little divination teacher now is firenze staying 
 
 got to said harry the other centaurs take him back will they 
 
 it looks like he and trelawney are both going to teach said ginny 
 
 bet dumbledore wishes he got rid of trelawney for good said ron now munching on his fourteenth frog mind you the whole useless if you ask me firenze a lot better 
 
 how can you say that hermione demanded after just found out that there are real prophecies 
 
 heart began to race he had not told ron hermione or anyone else what the prophecy had contained neville had told them it had smashed while harry was pulling him up the steps in the death room and harry had not yet corrected this impression he was not ready to see their expressions when he told them that he must be either murderer or victim there was no other way 
 
 it is a pity it broke said hermione quietly shaking her head 
 
 yeah it is said ron still at least never found out what was in it either where are you going he added looking both surprised and disappointed as harry stood up 
 
 said harry you know he just got back and i promised go down and see him and tell him how you two are 
 
 oh all right then said ron grumpily looking out of the dormitory window at the patch of bright blue sky beyond wish we could come 
 
 say hello to him for us called hermione as harry proceeded down the ward and ask him happening about about his little friend 
 
 harry gave a wave of his hand to show he had heard and understood as he left the dormitory 
 
 the castle seemed very quiet even for a sunday everybody was clearly out in the sunny grounds enjoying the end of their exams and the prospect of a last few days of term unhampered by revision or homework harry walked slowly along the deserted corridor peering out of windows as he went he could see people messing around in the air over the quidditch pitch and a couple of students swimming in the lake accompanied by the giant squid 
 
 he was finding it hard to decide whether he wanted to be with people or not whenever he was in company he wanted to get away and whenever he was alone he wanted company he thought he might really go and visit hagrid though as he had not talked to him properly since returned 
 
 harry had just descended the last marble step into the entrance hall when malfoy crabbe and goyle emerged from a door on the right that harry knew led down to the slytherin common room harry stopped dead so did malfoy and the others the only sounds were the shouts laughter and splashes drifting into the hall from the grounds through the open front doors 
 
 malfoy glanced aroundharry knew he was checking for signs of teachersthen he looked back at harry and said in a low voice dead potter 
 
 harry raised his eyebrows 
 
 funny he said think have stopped walking around 
 
 malfoy looked angrier than harry had ever seen him he felt a kind of detached satisfaction at the sight of his pale pointed face contorted with rage 
 
 going to pay said malfoy in a voice barely louder than a whisper going to make you pay for what done to my father 
 
 well terrified now said harry sarcastically i lord just a act compared to you the matter he added for malfoy crabbe and goyle had all looked stricken at the sound of the name a mate of your dad he not scared of him are you 
 
 you think such a big man potter said malfoy advancing now crabbe and goyle flanking him you wait have you you land my father in prison 
 
 i thought i just had said harry 
 
 the dementors have left azkaban said malfoy quietly dad and the be out in no time 
 
 yeah i expect they will said harry still at least everyone knows what scumbags they are now 
 
 hand flew towards his wand but harry was too quick for him he had drawn his own wand before fingers had even entered the pocket of his robes 
 
 potter 
 
 the voice rang across the entrance hall snape had emerged from the staircase leading down to his office and at the sight of him harry felt a great rush of hatred beyond anything he felt towards malfoy whatever dumbledore said he would never forgive snape never 
 
 what are you doing potter said snape as coldly as ever as he strode over to the four of them 
 
 trying to decide what curse to use on malfoy sir said harry fiercely 
 
 snape stared at him 
 
 put that wand away at once he said curtly ten points from gryff 
 
 snape looked towards the giant on the walls and gave a sneering smile 
 
 ah i see there are no longer any points left in the gryffindor to take away in that case potter we will simply have to 
 
 add some more 
 
 professor mcgonagall had just stumped up the stone steps into the castle she was carrying a tartan carpetbag in one hand and leaning heavily on a walking stick with her other but otherwise looked quite well 
 
 professor mcgonagall said snape striding forwards out of st i see 
 
 yes professor snape said professor mcgonagall shrugging off her travelling cloak quite as good as new you twocrabbegoyle 
 
 she beckoned them forwards imperiously and they came shuffling their large feet and looking awkward 
 
 here said professor mcgonagall thrusting her carpetbag into chest and her cloak into take these up to my office for me 
 
 they turned and stumped away up the marble staircase 
 
 right then said professor mcgonagall looking up at the hourglasses on the wall well i think potter and his friends ought to have fifty points apiece for alerting the world to the return of what say you professor snape 
 
 what snapped snape though harry knew he had heard perfectly well ohwelli suppose 
 
 so fifty each for potter the two weasleys longbottom and miss granger said professor mcgonagall and a shower of rubies fell down into the bottom bulb of gryffindor s as she spoke ohand fifty for miss lovegood i suppose she added and a number of sapphires fell into glass now you wanted to take ten from mr potter i think professor snapeso there we are 
 
 a few rubies retreated into the upper bulb leaving a respectable amount below nevertheless 
 
 well potter malfoy i think you ought to be outside on a glorious day like this professor mcgonagall continued briskly 
 
 harry did not need telling twice he thrust his wand back inside his robes and headed straight for the front doors without another glance at snape and malfoy 
 
 the hot sun hit him with a blast as he walked across the lawns towards cabin students lying around on the grass sunbathing talking reading the sunday prophet and eating sweets looked up at him as he passed some called out to him or else waved clearly eager to show that they like the prophet had decided he was something of a hero harry said nothing to any of them he had no idea how much they knew of what had happened three days ago but he had so far avoided being questioned and preferred to keep it that way 
 
 he thought at first when he knocked on cabin door that he was out but then fang came charging around the corner and almost bowled him over with the enthusiasm of his welcome hagrid it transpired was picking runner beans in his back garden 
 
 all righ harry he said beaming when harry approached the fence come in come in have a cup o dandelion juice 
 
 things hagrid asked him as they settled down at his wooden table with a glass apiece of iced juice yeherfeelin all righ are yeh 
 
 harry knew from the look of concern on face that he was not referring to physical 
 
 fine harry said quickly because he could not bear to discuss the thing that he knew was in mind so you been 
 
 bin hidin out in the mountains said hagrid up in a cave like sirius did when he 
 
 hagrid broke off cleared his throat gruffly looked at harry and took a long draught of juice 
 
 anyway back now he said feebly 
 
 youyou look better said harry who was determined to keep the conversation moving away from sirius 
 
 wha said hagrid raising a massive hand and feeling his face ohoh yeah well loads better behaved now loads seemed right pleased ter see me when i got back ter tell yeh the truth a good lad really ive bin thinkin abou tryin ter find him a lady friend actually 
 
 harry would normally have tried to persuade hagrid out of this idea at once the prospect of a second giant taking up residence in the forest possibly even wilder and more brutal than grawp was positively alarming but somehow harry could not muster the energy necessary to argue the point he was starting to wish he was alone again and with the idea of hastening his departure he took several large gulps of his dandelion juice his glass 
 
 knows bin tellin the truth now harry said hagrid softly and unexpectedly he was watching harry closely gotta be better hasn it 
 
 harry shrugged 
 
 look hagrid leaned towards him across the table i knew sirius longer n yeh did he died in battle an the way wanted ter go 
 
 he want to go at all said harry angrily 
 
 hagrid bowed his great shaggy head 
 
 nah i don reckon he did he said quietly but still harry he was never one ter sit aroun at home an let other people do the fightin he lived with himself if he hadn gone ter help 
 
 harry leapt up 
 
 got to go and visit ron and hermione in the hospital wing he said mechanically 
 
 oh said hagrid looking rather upset oh all righ then harry take care o yerself then an drop back in if got a mo 
 
 yeah right 
 
 harry crossed to the door as fast as he could and pulled it open he was out in the sunshine again before hagrid had finished saying goodbye and walking away across the lawn once again people called out to him as he passed he closed his eyes for a few moments wishing they would all vanish that he could open his eyes and find himself alone in the grounds 
 
 a few days ago before his exams had finished and he had seen the vision voldemort had planted in his mind he would have given almost anything for the wizarding world to know he had been telling the truth for them to believe that voldemort was back and to know that he was neither a liar nor mad now however 
 
 he walked a short way around the lake sat down on its bank sheltered from the gaze of behind a tangle of shrubs and stared out over the gleaming water thinking 
 
 perhaps the reason he wanted to be alone was because he had felt isolated from everybody since his talk with dumbledore an invisible barrier separated him from the rest of the world he washe had always beena marked man it was just that he had never really understood what that meant 
 
 and yet sitting here on the edge of the lake with the terrible weight of grief dragging at him with the loss of sirius so raw and fresh inside he could not muster any great sense of fear it was sunny and the grounds around him were full of laughing people and even though he felt as distant from them as though he belonged to a different race it was still very hard to believe as he sat here that his life must include or end in murder 
 
 he sat there for a long time gazing out at the water trying not to think about his godfather or to remember that it was directly across from here on the opposite bank that sirius had once collapsed trying to fend off a hundred dementors 
 
 the sun had set before he realised he was cold he got up and returned to the castle wiping his face on his sleeve as he went 
 
 ron and hermione left the hospital wing completely cured three days before the end of term hermione kept showing signs of wanting to talk about sirius but ron tended to make hushing noises every time she mentioned his name harry was still not sure whether or not he wanted to talk about his godfather yet his wishes varied with his mood he knew one thing though unhappy as he felt at the moment he would greatly miss hogwarts in a few days time when he was back at number four privet drive even though he now understood exactly why he had to return there every summer he did not feel any better about it indeed he had never dreaded his return more 
 
 professor umbridge left hogwarts the day before the end of term it seemed she had crept out of the hospital wing during dinnertime evidently hoping to depart undetected but unfortunately for her she met peeves on the way who seized his last chance to do as fred had instructed and chased her gleefully from the premises whacking her alternately with a walking stick and a sock full of chalk many students ran out into the entrance hall to watch her running away down the path and the heads of houses tried only to restrain them indeed professor mcgonagall sank back into her chair at the staff table after a few feeble remonstrances and was clearly heard to express a regret that she could not run cheering after umbridge herself because peeves had borrowed her walking stick 
 
 their last evening at school arrived most people had finished packing and were already heading down to the leaving feast but harry had not even started 
 
 just do it tomorrow said ron who was waiting by the door of their dormitory come on starving 
 
 i be long look you go ahead 
 
 but when the dormitory door closed behind ron harry made no effort to speed up his packing the very last thing he wanted to do was to attend the leaving feast he was worried that dumbledore would make some reference to him in his speech he was sure to mention return he had talked to them about it last year after all 
 
 harry pulled some crumpled robes out of the very bottom of his trunk to make way for folded ones and as he did so noticed a badly wrapped package lying in a corner of it he could not think what it was doing there he bent down pulled it out from underneath his trainers and examined it 
 
 he realised what it was within seconds sirius had given it to him just inside the front door of number twelve grimmauld place use it if you need me all right 
 
 harry sank down on to his bed and unwrapped the package out fell a small square mirror it looked old it was certainly dirty harry held it up to his face and saw his own reflection looking back at him 
 
 he turned the mirror over there on the reverse side was a scribbled note from sirius 
 
 this is a mirror got the other one of the pair if you need to speak to me just say my name into it appear in my mirror and be able to talk in yours james and i used to use them when we were in separate detentions 
 
 heart began to race he remembered seeing his dead parents in the mirror of erised four years ago he was going to be able to talk to sirius again right now he knew it 
 
 he looked around to make sure there was nobody else there the dormitory was quite empty he looked back at the mirror raised it in front of his face with trembling hands and said loudly and clearly sirius 
 
 his breath misted the surface of the glass he held the mirror even closer excitement flooding through him but the eyes blinking back at him through the fog were definitely his own 
 
 he wiped the mirror clear again and said so that every syllable rang clearly through the room 
 
 sirius black 
 
 nothing happened the frustrated face looking back out of the mirror was still definitely his own 
 
 sirius have his mirror on him when he went through the archway said a small voice in head why not working 
 
 harry remained quite still for a moment then hurled the mirror back into the trunk where it shattered he had been convinced for a whole shining minute that he was going to see sirius talk to him again 
 
 disappointment was burning in his throat he got up and began throwing his things into the trunk on top of the broken mirror 
 
 but then an idea struck him a better idea than a mirror a much bigger more important idea how had he never thought of it beforewhy had he never asked 
 
 he was sprinting out of the dormitory and down the spiral staircase hitting the walls as he ran and barely noticing he hurtled across the empty common room through the portrait hole and off along the corridor ignoring the fat lady who called after him the feast is about to start you know cutting it very fine 
 
 but harry had no intention of going to the feast 
 
 how could it be that the place was full of ghosts whenever you need one yet now 
 
 he ran down staircases and along corridors and met nobody either alive or dead they were all clearly in the great hall outside his charms classroom he came to a halt panting and thinking disconsolately that he would have to wait until later until after the end of the feast 
 
 but just as he had given up hope he saw ita translucent somebody drifting across the end of the corridor 
 
 heyhey nick nick 
 
 the ghost stuck its head back out of the wall revealing the extravagantly plumed hat and dangerously wobbling head of sir nicholas de 
 
 good evening he said withdrawing the rest of his body from the solid stone and smiling at harry i am not the only one who is late then though he sighed in a rather different sense of course 
 
 nick can i ask you something 
 
 a most peculiar expression stole over nearly headless face as he inserted a finger in the stiff ruff at his neck and tugged it a little straighter apparently to give himself thinking time he desisted only when his partially severed neck seemed about to give way completely 
 
 ernow harry said nick looking discomfited it wait until after the feast 
 
 nonick please said harry i really need to talk to you can we go in here 
 
 harry opened the door of the nearest classroom and nearly headless nick sighed 
 
 oh very well he said looking resigned i pretend i been expecting it 
 
 harry was holding the door open for him but he drifted through the wall instead 
 
 expecting what harry asked as he closed the door 
 
 you to come and find me said nick now gliding over to the window and looking out at the darkening grounds it happens sometimes when somebody has suffered a loss 
 
 well said harry refusing to be deflected you were right come to find you 
 
 nick said nothing 
 
 said harry who was finding this more awkward than he had anticipated just dead but still here you 
 
 nick sighed and continued to gaze out at the grounds 
 
 right it harry urged him you died but talking to you you can walk around hogwarts and everything you 
 
 yes said nearly headless nick quietly i walk and talk yes 
 
 so you came back you said harry urgently people can come back right as ghosts they have to disappear completely well he added impatiently when nick continued to say nothing 
 
 nearly headless nick hesitated then said not everyone can come back as a ghost 
 
 what mean said harry quickly 
 
 only only wizards 
 
 oh said harry and he almost laughed with relief well ok then the person asking about is a wizard so he can come back right 
 
 nick turned away from the window and looked mournfully at harry 
 
 he come back 
 
 who 
 
 sirius black said nick 
 
 but you did said harry angrily you came dead and you disappear 
 
 wizards can leave an imprint of themselves upon the earth to walk palely where their living selves once trod said nick miserably but very few wizards choose that path 
 
 why not said harry anywayit mattersirius care if unusual come back i know he will 
 
 and so strong was his belief harry actually turned his head to check the door sure for a split second that he was going to see sirius and transparent but beaming walking through it towards him 
 
 he will not come back repeated nick he will have gone on 
 
 what mean gone on said harry quickly gone on where listenwhat happens when you die anyway where do you go why everyone come back why this place full of ghosts why 
 
 i cannot answer said nick 
 
 dead you said harry exasperatedly who can answer better than you 
 
 i was afraid of death said nick softly i chose to remain behind i sometimes wonder whether i to have well that is neither here nor there in fact i am neither here nor there he gave a small sad chuckle i know nothing of the secrets of death harry for i chose my feeble imitation of life instead i believe learned wizards study the matter in the department of mysteries 
 
 talk to me about that place said harry fiercely 
 
 i am sorry not to have been more help said nick gently well well do excuse me the feast you know 
 
 and he left the room leaving harry there alone gazing blankly at the wall through which nick had disappeared 
 
 harry felt almost as though he had lost his godfather all over again in losing the hope that he might be able to see or speak to him once more he walked slowly and miserably back up through the empty castle wondering whether he would ever feel cheerful again 
 
 he had turned the corner towards the fat corridor when he saw somebody up ahead fastening a note to a board on the wall a second glance showed him it was luna there were no good hiding places nearby she was bound to have heard his footsteps and in any case harry could hardly muster the energy to avoid anyone at the moment 
 
 hello said luna vaguely glancing around at him as she stepped back from the notice 
 
 how come not at the feast harry asked 
 
 well lost most of my possessions said luna serenely people take them and hide them you know but as the last night i really do need them back so been putting up signs 
 
 she gestured towards the noticeboard upon which sure enough she had pinned a list of all her missing books and clothes with a plea for their return 
 
 an odd feeling rose in harry an emotion quite different from the anger and grief that had filled him since death it was a few moments before he realised that he was feeling sorry for luna 
 
 how come people hide your stuff he asked her frowning 
 
 oh well she shrugged i think they think a bit odd you know some people call me loony lovegood actually 
 
 harry looked at her and the new feeling of pity intensified rather painfully 
 
 no reason for them to take your things he said flatly want help finding them 
 
 oh no she said smiling at him come back they always do in the end it was just that i wanted to pack tonight anyway why you at the feast 
 
 harry shrugged just feel like it 
 
 no said luna observing him with those oddly misty protuberant eyes i suppose you do that man the death eaters killed was your godfather he ginny told me 
 
 harry nodded curtly but found that for some reason he did not mind luna talking about sirius he had just remembered that she too could see thestrals 
 
 have you he began i mean who has anyone you known ever died 
 
 yes said luna simply my mother she was a quite extraordinary witch you know but she did like to experiment and one of her spells went rather badly wrong one day i was nine 
 
 sorry harry mumbled 
 
 yes it was rather horrible said luna conversationally i still feel very sad about it sometimes but still got dad and anyway not as though never see mum again is it 
 
 it said harry uncertainly 
 
 she shook her head in disbelief 
 
 oh come on you heard them just behind the veil you 
 
 you mean 
 
 in that room with the archway they were just lurking out of sight all you heard them 
 
 they looked at each other luna was smiling slightly harry did not know what to say or to think luna believed so many extraordinary things yet he had been sure he had heard voices behind the veil too 
 
 are you sure you want me to help you look for your stuff he said 
 
 oh no said luna no i think just go down and have some pudding and wait for it all to turn up it always does in the end well have a nice holiday harry 
 
 yeah yeah you too 
 
 she walked away from him and as he watched her go he found that the terrible weight in his stomach seemed to have lessened slightly 
 
 the journey home on the hogwarts express next day was eventful in several ways firstly malfoy crabbe and goyle who had clearly been waiting all week for the opportunity to strike without teacher witnesses attempted to ambush harry halfway down the train as he made his way back from the toilet the attack might have succeeded had it not been for the fact that they unwittingly chose to stage the attack right outside a compartment full of da members who saw what was happening through the glass and rose as one to rush to aid by the time ernie macmillan hannah abbott susan bones justin anthony goldstein and terry boot had finished using a wide variety of the hexes and jinxes harry had taught them malfoy crabbe and goyle resembled nothing so much as three gigantic slugs squeezed into hogwarts uniform as harry ernie and justin hoisted them into the luggage rack and left them there to ooze 
 
 i must say looking forward to seeing face when he gets off the train said ernie with some satisfaction as he watched malfoy squirm above him ernie had never quite got over the indignity of malfoy docking points from hufflepuff during his brief spell as a member of the inquisitorial squad 
 
 be really pleased though said ron who had come to investigate the source of the commotion loads now anyway harry the food just stopped if you want anything 
 
 harry thanked the others and accompanied ron back to their compartment where he bought a large pile of cauldron cakes and pumpkin pasties hermione was reading the daily prophet again ginny was doing a quiz in the quibbler and neville was stroking his mimbulus mimbletonia which had grown a great deal over the year and now made odd crooning noises when touched 
 
 harry and ron whiled away most of the journey playing wizard chess while hermione read out snippets from the was now full of articles about how to repel dementors attempts by the ministry to track down death eaters and hysterical letters claiming that the writer had seen lord voldemort walking past their house that very morning 
 
 it really started yet sighed hermione gloomily folding up the newspaper again but it be long now 
 
 hey harry said ron softly nodding towards the glass window on to the corridor 
 
 harry looked around cho was passing accompanied by marietta edgecombe who was wearing a balaclava his and eyes met for a moment cho blushed and kept walking harry looked back down at the chessboard just in time to see one of his pawns chased off its square by knight 
 
 going on with you and her anyway ron asked quietly 
 
 nothing said harry truthfully 
 
 ierheard going out with someone else now said hermione tentatively 
 
 harry was surprised to find that this information did not hurt at all wanting to impress cho seemed to belong to a past that was no longer quite connected with him so much of what he had wanted before death felt that way these days the week that had elapsed since he had last seen sirius seemed to have lasted much much longer it stretched across two universes the one with sirius in it and the one without 
 
 well out of it mate said ron forcefully i mean quite and all that but you want someone a bit more cheerful 
 
 probably cheerful enough with someone else said harry shrugging 
 
 she with now anyway ron asked hermione but it was ginny who answered 
 
 michael corner she said 
 
 michaelbut said ron craning around in his seat to state at her but you were going out with him 
 
 not any more said ginny resolutely he like gryffindor beating ravenclaw at quidditch and got really sulky so i ditched him and he ran off to comfort cho instead she scratched her nose absently with the end of her quill turned the quibbler and began marking her answers ron looked highly delighted 
 
 well i always thought he was a bit of an idiot he said prodding his queen forwards towards quivering castle good for you just choose someonebetternext time 
 
 he cast harry an oddly furtive look as he said it 
 
 well chosen dean thomas would you say better asked ginny vaguely 
 
 what shouted ron upending the chessboard crookshanks went plunging after the pieces and hedwig and pigwidgeon twittered and hooted angrily from overhead 
 
 as the train slowed down in the approach to cross harry thought he had never wanted to leave it less he even wondered fleetingly what would happen if he simply refused to get off but remained stubbornly sitting there until the first of september when it would take him back to hogwarts when it finally puffed to a standstill however he lifted down cage and prepared to drag his trunk from the train as usual 
 
 when the ticket inspector signalled to harry ron and hermione that it was safe to walk through the magical barrier between platforms nine and ten however he found a surprise awaiting him on the other side a group of people standing there to greet him who he had not expected at all 
 
 there was moody looking quite as sinister with his bowler hat pulled low over his magical eye as he would have done without it his gnarled hands clutching a long staff his body wrapped in a voluminous travelling cloak tonks stood just behind him her bright hair gleaming in the sunlight filtering through the dirty glass of the station ceiling wearing heavily patched jeans and a bright purple bearing the legend the weird to tonks was lupin his face pale his hair greying a long and threadbare overcoat covering a shabby jumper and trousers at the front of the group stood mr and mrs weasley dressed in their muggle best and fred and george who were both wearing jackets in some lurid green scaly material 
 
 ron ginny called mrs weasley hurrying forwards and hugging her children tightly oh and harry dearhow are you 
 
 fine lied harry as she pulled him into a tight embrace over her shoulder he saw ron goggling at the twins new clothes 
 
 what are they supposed to be he asked pointing at the jackets 
 
 finest dragonskin little bro said fred giving his zip a little tweak business is booming and we thought treat ourselves 
 
 hello harry said lupin as mrs weasley let go of harry and turned to greet hermione 
 
 hi said harry i expect what are you all doing here 
 
 well said lupin with a slight smile we thought we might have a little chat with your aunt and uncle before letting them take you home 
 
 i dunno if a good idea said harry at once 
 
 oh i think it is growled moody who had limped a little closer be them will it potter 
 
 he pointed with his thumb over his shoulder his magical eye was evidently peering through the back of his head and his bowler hat harry leaned an inch or so to the left to see where was pointing and there sure enough were the three dursleys who looked positively appalled to see reception committee 
 
 ah harry said mr weasley turning from parents who he had just greeted enthusiastically and who were now taking it in turns to hug hermione well shall we do it then 
 
 yeah i reckon so arthur said moody 
 
 he and mr weasley took the lead across the station towards the dursleys who were apparently rooted to the floor hermione disengaged herself gently from her mother to join the group 
 
 good afternoon said mr weasley pleasantly to uncle vernon as he came to a halt right in front of him you might remember me my arthur weasley 
 
 as mr weasley had demolished most of the dursleys living room two years previously harry would have been very surprised if uncle vernon had forgotten him sure enough uncle vernon turned a deeper shade of puce and glared at mr weasley but chose not to say anything partly perhaps because the dursleys were outnumbered two to one aunt petunia looked both frightened and embarrassed she kept glancing around as though terrified somebody she knew would see her in such company dudley meanwhile seemed to be trying to look small and insignificant a feat at which he was failing extravagantly 
 
 we thought just have a few words with you about harry said mr weasley still smiling 
 
 yeah growled moody about how treated when at your place 
 
 uncle moustache seemed to bristle with indignation possibly because the bowler hat gave him the entirely mistaken impression that he was dealing with a kindred spirit he addressed himself to moody 
 
 i am not aware that it is any of your business what goes on in my house 
 
 i expect what not aware of would fill several books dursley growled moody 
 
 anyway not the point interjected tonks whose pink hair seemed to offend aunt petunia more than all the rest put together for she closed her eyes rather than look at her the point is if we find out been horrible to harry 
 
 and make no mistake hear about it added lupin pleasantly 
 
 yes said mr weasley even if you let harry use the 
 
 telephone whispered hermione 
 
 yeah if we get any hint that been mistreated in any way have us to answer to said moody 
 
 uncle vernon swelled ominously his sense of outrage seemed to outweigh even his fear of this bunch of oddballs 
 
 are you threatening me sir he said so loudly that actually turned to stare 
 
 yes i am said who seemed rather pleased that uncle vernon had grasped this fact so quickly 
 
 and do i look like the kind of man who can be intimidated barked uncle vernon 
 
 well said moody pushing back his bowler hat to reveal his sinisterly revolving magical eye uncle vernon leapt backwards in horror and collided painfully with a luggage trolley yes have to say you do dursley 
 
 he turned away from uncle vernon to survey harry 
 
 so potter give us a shout if you need us if we hear from you for three days in a row send someone along 
 
 aunt petunia whimpered piteously it could not have been plainer that she was thinking of what the neighbours would say if they caught sight of these people marching up the garden path 
 
 bye then potter said moody grasping shoulder for a moment with a gnarled hand 
 
 take care harry said lupin quietly keep in touch 
 
 harry have you away from there as soon as we can mrs weasley whispered hugging him again 
 
 see you soon mate said ron anxiously shaking hand 
 
 really soon harry said hermione earnestly we promise 
 
 harry nodded he somehow could not find words to tell them what it meant to him to see them all ranged there on his side instead he smiled raised a hand in farewell turned around and led the way out of the station towards the sunlit street with uncle vernon aunt petunia and dudley hurrying along in his wake

 fairy tales of hans christian andersen 
 the brave tin soldier 
 by hans christian andersen 
 
 there were once tin soldiers who were all 
 brothers for they had been made out of the same old tin spoon they 
 shouldered arms and looked straight before them and wore a splendid uniform red and blue the first thing in the world they ever heard were the words tin soldiers uttered by a little boy who clapped his hands with delight when the lid of the box in which they lay was taken off they were given him for a birthday present and he stood at the table to set them up the soldiers were all exactly alike 
 excepting one who had only one leg he had been left to the last and 
 then there was not enough of the melted tin to finish him so they 
 made him to stand firmly on one leg and this caused him to be very 
 remarkable 
 
 the table on which the tin soldiers stood was covered with 
 other playthings but the most attractive to the eye was a pretty 
 little paper castle through the small windows the rooms could be 
 seen in front of the castle a number of little trees surrounded a 
 piece of which was intended to represent a 
 transparent lake swans made of wax swam on the lake and were 
 reflected in it all this was very pretty but the prettiest of all 
 was a tiny little lady who stood at the open door of the castle she 
 also was made of paper and she wore a dress of clear muslin with 
 a narrow blue ribbon over her shoulders just like a scarf in front of 
 these was fixed a glittering tinsel rose as large as her whole 
 face the little lady was a dancer and she stretched out both her 
 arms and raised one of her legs so high that the tin soldier could 
 not see it at all and he thought that she like himself had only one 
 leg that is the wife for me he thought but she is too grand and 
 lives in a castle while i have only a box to live in 
 of us altogether that is no place for her still i must try and 
 make her acquaintance then he laid himself at full length on the 
 table behind a that stood upon it so that he could peep 
 at the little delicate lady who continued to stand on one leg without 
 losing her balance when evening came the other tin soldiers were all 
 placed in the box and the people of the house went to bed then the 
 playthings began to have their own games together to pay visits to 
 have sham fights and to give balls the tin soldiers rattled in their 
 box they wanted to get out and join the amusements but they could 
 not open the lid the played at and the pencil 
 jumped about the table there was such a noise that the canary woke up and began to talk and in poetry too only the tin soldier and the 
 dancer remained in their places she stood on tiptoe with her legs 
 stretched out as firmly as he did on his one leg he never took his 
 eyes from her for even a moment the clock struck twelve and with 
 a bounce up sprang the lid of the but instead of snuff 
 there jumped up a little black goblin for the was a toy 
 puzzle 
 
 tin soldier said the goblin wish for what does not 
 belong to you 
 
 but the tin soldier pretended not to hear 
 
 very well wait till then said the goblin 
 when the children came in the next morning they placed the tin 
 soldier in the window now whether it was the goblin who did it or 
 the draught is not known but the window flew open and out fell 
 the tin soldier heels over head from the third story into the 
 street beneath it was a terrible fall for he came head downwards 
 his helmet and his bayonet stuck in between the flagstones and his 
 one leg up in the air the servant maid and the little boy went down 
 stairs directly to look for him but he was nowhere to be seen 
 although once they nearly trod upon him if he had called out here i 
 am it would have been all right but he was too proud to cry out for 
 help while he wore a uniform 
 
 presently it began to rain and the drops fell faster and 
 faster till there was a heavy shower when it was over two boys 
 happened to pass by and one of them said look there is a tin 
 soldier he ought to have a boat to sail in 
 
 so they made a boat out of a newspaper and placed the tin soldier 
 in it and sent him sailing down the gutter while the two boys ran by 
 the side of it and clapped their hands good gracious what large 
 waves arose in that gutter and how fast the stream rolled on for the 
 rain had been very heavy the paper boat rocked up and down and 
 turned itself round sometimes so quickly that the tin soldier 
 trembled yet he remained firm his countenance did not change he 
 looked straight before him and shouldered his musket suddenly the 
 boat shot under a bridge which formed a part of a drain and then it 
 was as dark as the tin box 
 
 where am i going now thought he this is the black 
 fault i am sure ah well if the little lady were only here with 
 me in the boat i should not care for any darkness 
 
 suddenly there appeared a great who lived in the drain 
 have you a passport asked the rat give it to me at once but 
 the tin soldier remained silent and held his musket tighter than ever 
 the boat sailed on and the rat followed it how he did gnash his teeth 
 and cry out to the bits of wood and straw stop him stop him he has not paid toll and has not shown his pass but the stream rushed on stronger and stronger the tin soldier could already see daylight 
 shining where the arch ended then he heard a roaring sound quite 
 terrible enough to frighten the bravest man at the end of the 
 tunnel the drain fell into a large canal over a steep place which 
 made it as dangerous for him as a waterfall would be to us he was too close to it to stop so the boat rushed on and the poor tin soldier 
 could only hold himself as stiffly as possible without moving an 
 eyelid to show that he was not afraid the boat whirled round three 
 or four times and then filled with water to the very edge nothing 
 could save it from sinking he now stood up to his neck in water 
 while deeper and deeper sank the boat and the paper became soft and loose with the wet till at last the water closed over the 
 head he thought of the elegant little dancer whom he should never see again and the words of the song sounded in his ears 
 farewell warrior ever brave 
 drifting onward to thy grave 
 then the paper boat fell to pieces and the soldier sank into 
 the water and immediately afterwards was swallowed up by a great fish 
 
 oh how dark it was inside the fish a great deal darker than in the 
 tunnel and narrower too but the tin soldier continued firm and 
 lay at full length shouldering his musket the fish swam to and fro 
 making the most wonderful movements but at last he became quite 
 still after a while a flash of lightning seemed to pass through him 
 and then the daylight approached and a voice cried out i declare 
 here is the tin soldier the fish had been caught taken to the 
 market and sold to the cook who took him into the kitchen and cut him open with a large knife she picked up the soldier and held him by the waist between her finger and thumb and carried him into the room 
 
 they were all anxious to see this wonderful soldier who had 
 travelled about inside a fish but he was not at all proud they 
 placed him on the table and how many curious things do happen in the world there he was in the very same room from the window of which he had fallen there were the same children the same playthings standing on the table and the pretty castle with the elegant little dancer at the door she still balanced herself on one leg and held up the other so she was as firm as himself it touched the tin soldier 
 so much to see her that he almost wept tin tears but he kept them 
 back he only looked at her and they both remained silent presently 
 one of the little boys took up the tin soldier and threw him into the 
 stove he had no reason for doing so therefore it must have been 
 the fault of the black goblin who lived in the the flames 
 lighted up the tin soldier as he stood the heat was very terrible 
 but whether it proceeded from the real fire or from the fire of love 
 he could not tell then he could see that the bright colors were faded 
 from his uniform but whether they had been washed off during his 
 journey or from the effects of his sorrow no one could say he looked at the little lady and she looked at him he felt himself melting 
 away but he still remained firm with his gun on his shoulder 
 suddenly the door of the room flew open and the draught of air 
 caught up the little dancer she fluttered like a sylph right into the 
 stove by the side of the tin soldier and was instantly in flames 
 and was gone the tin soldier melted down into a lump and the next 
 morning when the maid servant took the ashes out of the stove she 
 found him in the shape of a little tin heart but of the little dancer 
 nothing remained but the tinsel rose which was burnt black as a 
 cinder

 book confide is sometimes to deliver into a power 
 chapter ii 
 
 first sketch of two unprepossessing figures 
 the mouse which had been caught was a pitiful specimen but the cat rejoices even over a lean mouse 
 who were these thenardiers 
 let us say a word or two of them now 
 we will complete the sketch later on 
 these beings belonged to that bastard class composed of coarse people who have been successful and of intelligent people who have descended in the scale which is between the class called middle and the class denominated as inferior and which combines some of the defects of the second with nearly all the vices of the first without possessing the generous impulse of the workingman nor the honest order of the bourgeois 
 they were of those dwarfed natures which if a dull fire chances to warm them up easily become monstrous 
 there was in the woman a substratum of the brute and in the man the material for a blackguard both were susceptible in the highest degree of the sort of hideous progress which is accomplished in the direction of evil 
 there exist souls which are continually retreating towards the darkness retrograding in life rather than advancing employing experience to augment their deformity growing incessantly worse and becoming more and more impregnated with an blackness this man and woman possessed such souls 
 thenardier in particular was troublesome for a physiognomist one can only look at some men to distrust them for one feels that they are dark in both directions 
 they are uneasy in the rear and threatening in front 
 there is something of the unknown about them one can no more answer for what they have done than for what they will do 
 the shadow which they bear in their glance denounces them from merely hearing them utter a word or seeing them make a gesture one obtains a glimpse of sombre secrets in their past and of sombre mysteries in their future 
 this thenardier if he himself was to be believed had been a soldier a sergeant he said 
 he had probably been through the campaign of and had even conducted himself with tolerable valor it would seem we shall see later on how much truth there was in this 
 the sign of his hostelry was in allusion to one of his feats of arms he had painted it himself for he knew how to do a little of everything and badly 
 it was at the epoch when the ancient classical romance which after having been clelie was no longer anything but lodoiska still noble but ever more and more vulgar having fallen from mademoiselle de scuderi to madame and from madame de lafayette to madame was setting the loving hearts of the portresses of paris aflame and even ravaging the suburbs to some extent madame thenardier was just intelligent enough to read this sort of books she lived on them 
 in them she drowned what brains she possessed this had given her when very young and even a little later a sort of pensive attitude towards her husband a scamp of a certain depth a ruffian lettered to the extent of the grammar coarse and fine at one and the same time but so far as sentimentalism was concerned given to the perusal of and in what concerns the sex as he said in his downright unmitigated lout 
 his wife was twelve or fifteen years younger than he was 
 later on when her hair arranged in a romantically drooping fashion began to grow gray when the magaera began to be developed from the pamela the female thenardier was nothing but a coarse vicious woman who had dabbled in stupid romances 
 now one cannot read nonsense with impunity the result was that her eldest daughter was named eponine as for the younger the poor little thing came near being called gulnare i know not to what diversion effected by a romance of she owed the fact that she merely bore the name of azelma 
 however we will remark by the way everything was not ridiculous and superficial in that curious epoch to which we are alluding and which may be designated as the anarchy of baptismal names by the side of this romantic element which we have just indicated there is the social symptom 
 it is not rare for the boy nowadays to bear the name of arthur alfred or alphonse and for the there are still any be called thomas pierre or jacques 
 this displacement which places the elegant name on the plebeian and the rustic name on the aristocrat is nothing else than an eddy of equality 
 the irresistible penetration of the new inspiration is there as everywhere else beneath this apparent discord there is a great and a profound thing the french revolution

 thenardier in particular was troublesome for a physiognomist one can only look at some men to distrust them for one feels that they are dark in both directions 
 they are uneasy in the rear and threatening in front 
 there is something of the unknown about them one can no more answer for what they have done than for what they will do 
 the shadow which they bear in their glance denounces them from merely hearing them utter a word or seeing them make a gesture one obtains a glimpse of sombre secrets in their past and of sombre mysteries in their future 
 this thenardier if he himself was to be believed had been a soldier a sergeant he said 
 he had probably been through the campaign of and had even conducted himself with tolerable valor it would seem we shall see later on how much truth there was in this 
 the sign of his hostelry was in allusion to one of his feats of arms he had painted it himself for he knew how to do a little of everything and badly 
 it was at the epoch when the ancient classical romance which after having been clelie was no longer anything but lodoiska still noble but ever more and more vulgar having fallen from mademoiselle de scuderi to madame and from madame de lafayette to madame was setting the loving hearts of the portresses of paris aflame and even ravaging the suburbs to some extent madame thenardier was just intelligent enough to read this sort of books she lived on them 
 in them she drowned what brains she possessed this had given her when very young and even a little later a sort of pensive attitude towards her husband a scamp of a certain depth a ruffian lettered to the extent of the grammar coarse and fine at one and the same time but so far as sentimentalism was concerned given to the perusal of and in what concerns the sex as he said in his downright unmitigated lout 
 his wife was twelve or fifteen years younger than he was 
 later on when her hair arranged in a romantically drooping fashion began to grow gray when the magaera began to be developed from the pamela the female thenardier was nothing but a coarse vicious woman who had dabbled in stupid romances 
 now one cannot read nonsense with impunity the result was that her eldest daughter was named eponine as for the younger the poor little thing came near being called gulnare i know not to what diversion effected by a romance of she owed the fact that she merely bore the name of azelma 
 however we will remark by the way everything was not ridiculous and superficial in that curious epoch to which we are alluding and which may be designated as the anarchy of baptismal names by the side of this romantic element which we have just indicated there is the social symptom 
 it is not rare for the boy nowadays to bear the name of arthur alfred or alphonse and for the there are still any be called thomas pierre or jacques 
 this displacement which places the elegant name on the plebeian and the rustic name on the aristocrat is nothing else than an eddy of equality 
 the irresistible penetration of the new inspiration is there as everywhere else beneath this apparent discord there is a great and a profound thing the french revolution

 next day he woke late recalling his recent impressions the first thought that came into his mind was that today he had to be presented to the emperor francis he remembered the minister of war the polite austrian adjutant bilibin and last conversation having dressed for his attendance at court in full parade uniform which he had not worn for a long time he went into study fresh animated and handsome with his hand bandaged in the study were four gentlemen of the diplomatic corps with prince hippolyte kuragin who was a secretary to the embassy bolkonski was already acquainted bilibin introduced him to the others 
 the gentlemen assembled at were young wealthy gay society men who here as in vienna formed a special set which bilibin their leader called les notres this set consisting almost exclusively of diplomats evidently had its own interests which had nothing to do with war or politics but related to high society to certain women and to the official side of the service these gentlemen received prince andrew as one of themselves an honor they did not extend to many from politeness and to start conversation they asked him a few questions about the army and the battle and then the talk went off into merry jests and gossip 
 ours 
 but the best of it was said one telling of the misfortune of a fellow diplomat that the chancellor told him flatly that his appointment to london was a promotion and that he was so to regard it can you fancy the figure he cut 
 but the worst of it gentlemen i am giving kuragin away to you is that that man suffers and this don juan wicked fellow is taking advantage of it 
 prince hippolyte was lolling in a lounge chair with his legs over its arm he began to laugh 
 tell me about that he said 
 oh you don juan you serpent cried several voices 
 you bolkonski know said bilibin turning to prince andrew that all the atrocities of the french army i nearly said of the russian army are nothing compared to what this man has been doing among the women 
 la femme est la compagne de announced prince hippolyte and began looking through a lorgnette at his elevated legs 
 woman is companion 
 bilibin and the rest of ours burst out laughing in face and prince andrew saw that hippolyte of whom he had to admit he had almost been jealous on his account was the butt of this set 
 oh i must give you a treat bilibin whispered to bolkonski kuragin is exquisite when he discusses politics you should see his gravity 
 he sat down beside hippolyte and wrinkling his forehead began talking to him about politics prince andrew and the others gathered round these two 
 the berlin cabinet cannot express a feeling of alliance began hippolyte gazing round with importance at the others without expressing as in its last note you understand besides unless his majesty the emperor derogates from the principle of our alliance 
 wait i have not finished he said to prince andrew seizing him by the arm i believe that intervention will be stronger than nonintervention and he paused finally one cannot impute the nonreceipt of our dispatch of november that is how it will end and he released arm to indicate that he had now quite finished 
 demosthenes i know thee by the pebble thou secretest in thy golden mouth said bilibin and the mop of hair on his head moved with satisfaction 
 everybody laughed and hippolyte louder than anyone he was evidently distressed and breathed painfully but could not restrain the wild laughter that convulsed his usually impassive features 
 well now gentlemen said bilibin bolkonski is my guest in this house and in brunn itself i want to entertain him as far as i can with all the pleasures of life here if we were in vienna it would be easy but here in this wretched moravian hole it is more difficult and i beg you all to help me attractions must be shown him you can undertake the theater i society and you hippolyte of course the women 
 we must let him see amelie exquisite said one of ours kissing his finger tips 
 in general we must turn this bloodthirsty soldier to more humane interests said bilibin 
 i shall scarcely be able to avail myself of your hospitality gentlemen it is already time for me to go replied prince andrew looking at his watch 
 where to 
 to the emperor 
 oh oh oh well au revoir bolkonski au revoir prince come back early to dinner cried several voices take you in hand 
 when speaking to the emperor try as far as you can to praise the way that provisions are supplied and the routes indicated said bilibin accompanying him to the hall 
 i should like to speak well of them but as far as i the facts i replied bolkonski smiling 
 well talk as much as you can anyway he has a passion for giving audiences but he does not like talking himself and do it as you will see

 chapter 
 
 
 laurie went to nice intending to stay a week and remained a month he was tired of wandering about alone and familiar presence seemed to give a homelike charm to the foreign scenes in which she bore a part he rather missed the petting he used to receive and enjoyed a taste of it again for no attentions however flattering from strangers were half so pleasant as the sisterly adoration of the girls at home amy never would pet him like the others but she was very glad to see him now and quite clung to him feeling that he was the representative of the dear family for whom she longed more than she would confess they naturally took comfort in each society and were much together riding walking dancing or dawdling for at nice no one can be very industrious during the gay season but while apparently amusing themselves in the most careless fashion they were making discoveries and forming opinions about each other amy rose daily in the estimation of her friend but he sank in hers and each felt the truth before a word was spoken amy tried to please and succeeded for she was grateful for the many pleasures he gave her and repaid him with the little services to which womanly women know how to lend an indescribable charm laurie made no effort of any kind but just let himself drift along as comfortably as possible trying to forget and feeling that all women owed him a kind word because one had been cold to him it cost him no effort to be generous and he would have given amy all the trinkets in nice if she would have taken them but at the same time he felt that he could not change the opinion she was forming of him and he rather dreaded the keen blue eyes that seemed to watch him with such surprise 
 all the rest have gone to monaco for the day i preferred to stay at home and write letters they are done now and i am going to valrosa to sketch will you come said amy as she joined laurie one lovely day when he lounged in as usual about noon 
 well yes but it rather warm for such a long walk he answered slowly for the shaded salon looked inviting after the glare without 
 going to have the little carriage and baptiste can drive so have nothing to do but hold your umbrella and keep your gloves nice returned amy with a sarcastic glance at the immaculate kids which were a weak point with laurie 
 then go with pleasure and he put out his hand for her sketchbook but she tucked it under her arm with a sharp 
 trouble yourself no exertion to me but you look equal to it 
 laurie lifted his eyebrows and followed at a leisurely pace as she ran downstairs but when they got into the carriage he took the reins himself and left little baptiste nothing to do but fold his arms and fall asleep on his perch 
 the two never quarreled amy was too and just now laurie was too lazy so in a minute he peeped under her hatbrim with an inquiring air she answered him with a smile and they went on together in the most amicable manner 
 it was a lovely drive along winding roads rich in the picturesque scenes that delight eyes here an ancient monastery whence the solemn chanting of the monks came down to them there a shepherd in wooden shoes pointed hat and rough jacket over one shoulder sat piping on a stone while his goats skipped among the rocks or lay at his feet meek donkeys laden with panniers of freshly cut grass passed by with a pretty girl in a capaline sitting between the green piles or an old woman spinning with a distaff as she went brown children ran out from the quaint stone hovels to offer nosegays or bunches of oranges still on the bough gnarled olive trees covered the hills with their dusky foliage fruit hung golden in the orchard and great scarlet anemones fringed the roadside while beyond green slopes and craggy heights the maritime alps rose sharp and white against the blue italian sky 
 valrosa well deserved its name for in that climate of perpetual summer roses blossomed everywhere they overhung the archway thrust themselves between the bars of the great gate with a sweet welcome to and lined the avenue winding through lemon trees and feathery palms up to the villa on the hill every shadowy nook where seats invited one to stop and rest was a mass of bloom every cool grotto had its marble nymph smiling from a veil of flowers and every fountain reflected crimson white or pale pink roses leaning down to smile at their own beauty roses covered the walls of the house draped the cornices climbed the pillars and ran riot over the balustrade of the wide one looked down on the sunny mediterranean and the city on its shore 
 this is a regular honeymoon paradise it did you ever see such roses asked amy pausing on the terrace to enjoy the view and a luxurious whiff of perfume that came wandering by 
 no nor felt such thorns returned laurie with his thumb in his mouth after a vain attempt to capture a solitary scarlet flower that grew just beyond his reach 
 try lower down and pick those that have no thorns said amy gathering three of the tiny ones that starred the wall behind her she put them in his buttonhole as a peace offering and he stood a minute looking down at them with a curious expression for in the italian part of his nature there was a touch of superstition and he was just then in that state of melancholy when imaginative young men find significance in trifles and food for romance everywhere he had thought of jo in reaching after the thorny red rose for vivid flowers became her and she had often worn ones like that from the greenhouse at home the pale roses amy gave him were the sort that the italians lay in dead hands never in bridal wreaths and for a moment he wondered if the omen was for jo or for himself but the next instant his american common sense got the better of sentimentality and he laughed a heartier laugh than amy had heard since he came 
 good advice better take it and save your fingers she said thinking her speech amused him 
 thank you i will he answered in jest and a few months later he did it in earnest 
 laurie when are you going to your grandfather she asked presently as she settled herself on a rustic seat 
 very soon 
 you have said that a dozen times within the last three weeks 
 i dare say short answers save trouble 
 he expects you and you really ought to go 
 hospitable creature i know it 
 then why you do it 
 natural depravity i suppose 
 natural indolence you mean really dreadful 
 and amy looked severe 
 not so bad as it seems for i should only plague him if i went so i might as well stay and plague you a little longer you can bear it better in fact i think it agrees with you excellently and laurie composed himself for a lounge on the broad ledge of the balustrade 
 amy shook her head and opened her sketchbook with an air of resignation but she had made up her mind to lecture that boy and in a minute she began again 
 what are you doing just now 
 watching lizards 
 no no i mean what do you intend and wish to do 
 smoke a cigarette if allow me 
 how provoking you are i approve of cigars and i will only allow it on condition that you let me put you into my sketch i need a figure 
 with all the pleasure in life how will you have me full length or on my head or my heels i should respectfully suggest a recumbent posture then put yourself in also and call it dolce far niente 
 stay as you are and go to sleep if you like i intend to work hard said amy in her most energetic tone 
 what delightful enthusiasm and he leaned against a tall urn with an ir of entire satisfaction 
 what would jo say if she saw you now asked amy impatiently hoping to stir him up by the mention of her still more energetic name 
 as usual go away teddy busy he laughed as he spoke but the laugh was not natural and a shade passed over his face for the utterance of the familiar name touched the wound that was not healed yet both tone and shadow struck amy for she had seen and heard them before and now she looked up in time to catch a new expression on hard bitter look full of pain dissatisfaction and regret it was gone before she could study it and the listless expression back again she watched him for a moment with artistic pleasure thinking how like an italian he looked as he lay basking in the sun with uncovered head and eyes full of southern dreaminess for he seemed to have forgotten her and fallen into a reverie 
 you look like the effigy of a young knight asleep on his tomb she said carefully tracing the profile defined against the dark stone 
 wish i was 
 a foolish wish unless you have spoiled your life you are so changed i sometimes think there amy stopped with a look more significant than her unfinished speech 
 laurie saw and understood the affectionate anxiety which she hesitated to express and looking straight into her eyes said just as he used to say it to her mother all right 
 that satisfied her and set at rest the doubts that had begun to worry her lately it also touched her and she showed that it did by the cordial tone in which she said 
 glad of that i think been a very bad boy but i fancied you might have wasted money at that wicked lost your heart to some charming frenchwoman with a husband or got into some of the scrapes that young men seem to consider a necessary part of a foreign tour stay out there in the sun come and lie on the grass here and let us be friendly as jo used to say when we got in the sofa corner and told secrets 
 laurie obediently threw himself down on the turf and began to amuse himself by sticking daisies into the ribbons of hat that lay there 
 all ready for the secrets and he glanced up with a decided expression of interest in his eyes 
 none to tell you may begin 
 one to bless myself with i thought perhaps had some news from home 
 you have heard all that has come lately you hear often i fancied jo would send you volumes 
 very busy roving about so impossible to be regular you know when do you begin your great work of art raphaella he asked changing the subject abruptly after another pause in which he had been wondering if amy knew his secret and wanted to talk about it 
 never she answered with a despondent but decided air rome took all the vanity out of me for after seeing the wonders there i felt too insignificant to live and gave up all my foolish hopes in despair 
 why should you with so much energy and talent 
 just why because talent genius and no amount of energy can make it so i want to be great or nothing i be a dauber so i intend to try any more 
 and what are you going to do with yourself now if i may ask 
 polish up my other talents and be an ornament to society if i get the chance 
 it was a characteristic speech and sounded daring but audacity becomes young people and ambition had a good foundation laurie smiled but he liked the spirit with which she took up a new purpose when a one died and spent no time lamenting 
 good and here is where fred vaughn comes in i fancy 
 amy preserved a discreet silence but there was a conscious look in her downcast face that made laurie sit up and say gravely now going to play brother and ask questions may i 
 i promise to answer 
 your face will if your tongue you woman of the world enough yet to hide your feelings my dear i heard rumors about fred and you last year and my private opinion that if he had not been called home so suddenly and detained so long something would have come of it hey 
 not for me to say was grim reply but her lips would smile and there was a traitorous sparkle of the eye which betrayed that she knew her power and enjoyed the knowledge 
 you are not engaged i hope and laurie looked very and grave all of a sudden 
 no 
 but you will be if he comes back and goes properly down on his knees you 
 very likely 
 then you are fond of old fred 
 i could be if i tried 
 but you intend to try till the proper moment bless my soul what unearthly prudence a good fellow amy but not the man i fancied like 
 he is rich a gentleman and has delightful manners began amy trying to be quite cool and dignified but feeling a little ashamed of herself in spite of the sincerity of her intentions 
 i understand queens of society get on without money so you mean to make a good match and start in that way quite right and proper as the world goes but it sounds odd from the lips of one of your girls 
 true nevertheless 
 a short speech but the quiet decision with which it was uttered contrasted curiously with the young speaker laurie felt this instinctively and laid himself down again with a sense of disappointment which he could not explain his look and silence as well as a certain inward ruffled amy and made her resolve to deliver her lecture without delay 
 i wish do me the favor to rouse yourself a little she said sharply 
 do it for me a dear girl 
 i could if i tried and she looked as if she would like doing it in the most summary style 
 try then i give you leave returned laurie who enjoyed having someone to tease after his long abstinence from his favorite pastime 
 be angry in five minutes 
 never angry with you it takes two flints to make a fire you are as cool and soft as snow 
 you know what i can do snow produces a glow and a tingle if applied rightly your indifference is half affectation and a good stirring up would prove it 
 stir away it hurt me and it may amuse you as the big man said when his little wife beat him regard me in the light of a husband or a carpet and beat till you are tired if that sort of exercise agrees with you 
 being decidedly nettled herself and longing to see him shake off the apathy that so altered him amy sharpened both tongue and pencil and began 
 flo and i have got a new name for you lazy laurence how do you like it 
 she thought it would annoy him but he only folded his arms under his head with an imperturbable not bad thank you ladies 
 do you want to know what i honestly think of you 
 pining to be told 
 well i despise you if she had even said i hate you in a petulant or coquettish tone he would have laughed and rather liked it but the grave almost sad accent in her voice made him open his eyes and ask quickly 
 why if you please 
 because with every chance for being good useful and happy you are faulty lazy and miserable 
 strong language mademoiselle 
 if you like it go on 
 pray do quite interesting 
 i thought find it so selfish people always like to talk about themselves 
 am i selfish the question slipped out involuntarily and in a tone of surprise for the one virtue on which he prided himself was generosity 
 yes very selfish continued amy in a calm cool voice twice as effective just then as an angry one show you how for studied you while we were frolicking and not at all satisfied with you here you have been abroad nearly six months and done nothing but waste time and money and disappoint your friends 
 a fellow to have any pleasure after a grind 
 you look as if had much at any rate you are none the better for it as far as i can see i said when we first met that you had improved now i take it all back for i think you half so nice as when i left you at home you have grown abominably lazy you like gossip and waste time on frivolous things you are contented to be petted and admired by silly people instead of being loved and respected by wise ones with money talent position health and beauty ah you like that old vanity but the truth so i help saying it with all these splendid things to use and enjoy you can find nothing to do but dawdle and instead of being the man you ought to be you are only there she stopped with a look that had both pain and pity in it 
 saint laurence on a gridiron added laurie blandly finishing the sentence but the lecture began to take effect for there was a sparkle in his eyes now and a expression replaced the former indifference 
 i supposed take it so you men tell us we are angels and say we can make you what we will but the instant we honestly try to do you good you laugh at us and listen which proves how much your flattery is worth amy spoke bitterly and turned her back on the exasperating martyr at her feet 
 
 in a minute a hand came down over the page so that she could not draw and voice said with a droll imitation of a penitent child i will be good oh i will be good 
 but amy did not laugh for she was in earnest and tapping on the outspread hand with her pencil said soberly you ashamed of a hand like that as soft and white as a and looks as if it never did anything but wear best gloves and pick flowers for ladies you are not a dandy thank heaven so glad to see there are no diamonds or big seal rings on it only the little old one jo gave you so long ago dear soul i wish she was here to help me 
 so do i 
 the hand vanished as suddenly as it came and there was energy enough in the echo of her wish to suit even amy she glanced down at him with a new thought in her mind but he was lying with his hat half over his face as if for shade and his mustache hid his mouth she only saw his chest rise and fall with a long breath that might have been a sigh and the hand that wore the ring nestled down into the grass as if to hide something too precious or too tender to be spoken of all in a minute various hints and trifles assumed shape and significance in mind and told her what her sister never had confided to her she remembered that laurie never spoke voluntarily of jo she recalled the shadow on his face just now the change in his character and the wearing of the little old ring which was no ornament to a handsome hand girls are quick to read such signs and feel their eloquence amy had fancied that perhaps a love trouble was at the bottom of the alteration and now she was sure of it her keen eyes filled and when she spoke again it was in a voice that could be beautifully soft and kind when she chose to make it so 
 i know i have no right to talk so to you laurie and if you the fellow in the world be very angry with me but we are all so fond and proud of you i bear to think they should be disappointed in you at home as i have been though perhaps they would understand the change better than i do 
 i think they would came from under the hat in a grim tone quite as touching as a broken one 
 they ought to have told me and not let me go blundering and scolding when i should have been more kind and patient than ever i never did like that miss randal and now i hate her said artful amy wishing to be sure of her facts this time 
 hang miss randal and laurie knocked the hat off his face with a look that left no doubt of his sentiments toward that young lady 
 i beg pardon i thought and there she paused diplomatically 
 no you you knew perfectly well i never cared for anyone but jo laurie said that in his old impetuous tone and turned his face away as he spoke 
 i did think so but as they never said anything about it and you came away i supposed i was mistaken and jo be kind to you why i was sure she loved you dearly 
 she was kind but not in the right way and lucky for her she love me if the fellow you think me her fault though and you may tell her so 
 the hard bitter look came back again as he said that and it troubled amy for she did not know what balm to apply 
 i was wrong i know very sorry i was so cross but i help wishing bear it better teddy dear 
 her name for me and laurie put up his hand with a quick gesture to stop the words spoken in tone wait till tried it yourself he added in a low voice as he pulled up the grass by the handful 
 take it manfully and be respected if i be loved said amy with the decision of one who knew nothing about it 
 now laurie flattered himself that he had borne it remarkably well making no moan asking no sympathy and taking his trouble away to live it down alone lecture put the matter in a new light and for the first time it did look weak and selfish to lose heart at the first failure and shut himself up in moody indifference he felt as if suddenly shaken out of a pensive dream and found it impossible to go to sleep again presently he sat up and asked slowly do you think jo would despise me as you do 
 yes if she saw you now she hates lazy people why you do something splendid and make her love you 
 i did my best but it was no use 
 graduating well you mean that was no more than you ought to have done for your sake it would have been shameful to fail after spending so much time and money when everyone knew that you could do well 
 i did fail say what you will for jo love me 
 began laurie leaning his head on his hand in a despondent attitude 
 no you and say so in the end for it did you good and proved that you could do something if you tried if only set about another task of some sort soon be your hearty happy self again and forget your trouble 
 impossible 
 try it and see you shrug your shoulders and think much she knows about such things i pretend to be wise but i am observing and i see a great deal more than imagine interested in other experiences and inconsistencies and though i explain i remember and use them for my own benefit love jo all your days if you choose but let it spoil you for wicked to throw away so many good gifts because you have the one you want there i lecture any more for i know wake up and be a man in spite of that hardhearted girl 
 neither spoke for several minutes laurie sat turning the little ring on his finger and amy put the last touches to the hasty sketch she had been working at while she talked presently she put it on his knee merely saying how do you like that 
 he looked and then he smiled as he could not well help doing for it was capitally done the long lazy figure on the grass with listless face eyes and one hand holding a cigar from which came the little wreath of smoke that encircled the head 
 how well you draw he said with a genuine surprise and pleasure at her skill adding with a yes me 
 as you are this is as you were and amy laid another sketch beside the one he held 
 it was not nearly so well done but there was a life and spirit in it which atoned for many faults and it recalled the past so vividly that a sudden change swept over the young face as he looked only a rough sketch of laurie taming a horse hat and coat were off and every line of the active figure resolute face and commanding attitude was full of energy and meaning the handsome brute just subdued stood arching his neck under the tightly drawn rein with one foot impatiently pawing the ground and ears pricked up as if listening for the voice that had mastered him in the ruffled mane the breezy hair and erect attitude there was a suggestion of suddenly arrested motion of strength courage and youthful buoyancy that contrasted sharply with the supine grace of the dolce far niente sketch laurie said nothing but as his eye went from one to the other amy say him flush up and fold his lips together as if he read and accepted the little lesson she had given him that satisfied her and without waiting for him to speak she said in her sprightly way 
 you remember the day you played rarey with puck and we all looked on meg and beth were frightened but jo clapped and pranced and i sat on the fence and drew you i found that sketch in my portfolio the other day touched it up and kept it to show you 
 much obliged improved immensely since then and i congratulate you may i venture to suggest in a honeymoon paradise that five is the dinner hour at your hotel 
 laurie rose as he spoke returned the pictures with a smile and a bow and looked at his watch as if to remind her that even moral lectures should have an end he tried to resume his former easy indifferent air but it was an affectation now for the rousing had been more effacious than he would confess amy felt the shade of coldness in his manner and said to herself 
 now offended him well if it does him good glad if it makes him hate me sorry but true and i take back a word of it 
 they laughed and chatted all the way home and little baptist up behind thought that monsieur and madamoiselle were in charming spirits but both felt ill at ease the friendly frankness was disturbed the sunshine had a shadow over it and despite their apparent gaiety there was a secret discontent in the heart of each 
 shall we see you this evening mon frere asked amy as they parted at her door 
 unfortunately i have an engagement au revoir madamoiselle and laurie bent as if to kiss her hand in the foreign fashion which became him better than many men something in his face made amy say quickly and warmly

 chapter 
 
 
 laurie went to nice intending to stay a week and remained a month he was tired of wandering about alone and familiar presence seemed to give a homelike charm to the foreign scenes in which she bore a part he rather missed the petting he used to receive and enjoyed a taste of it again for no attentions however flattering from strangers were half so pleasant as the sisterly adoration of the girls at home amy never would pet him like the others but she was very glad to see him now and quite clung to him feeling that he was the representative of the dear family for whom she longed more than she would confess they naturally took comfort in each society and were much together riding walking dancing or dawdling for at nice no one can be very industrious during the gay season but while apparently amusing themselves in the most careless fashion they were making discoveries and forming opinions about each other amy rose daily in the estimation of her friend but he sank in hers and each felt the truth before a word was spoken amy tried to please and succeeded for she was grateful for the many pleasures he gave her and repaid him with the little services to which womanly women know how to lend an indescribable charm laurie made no effort of any kind but just let himself drift along as comfortably as possible trying to forget and feeling that all women owed him a kind word because one had been cold to him it cost him no effort to be generous and he would have given amy all the trinkets in nice if she would have taken them but at the same time he felt that he could not change the opinion she was forming of him and he rather dreaded the keen blue eyes that seemed to watch him with such surprise 
 all the rest have gone to monaco for the day i preferred to stay at home and write letters they are done now and i am going to valrosa to sketch will you come said amy as she joined laurie one lovely day when he lounged in as usual about noon 
 well yes but it rather warm for such a long walk he answered slowly for the shaded salon looked inviting after the glare without 
 going to have the little carriage and baptiste can drive so have nothing to do but hold your umbrella and keep your gloves nice returned amy with a sarcastic glance at the immaculate kids which were a weak point with laurie 
 then go with pleasure and he put out his hand for her sketchbook but she tucked it under her arm with a sharp 
 trouble yourself no exertion to me but you look equal to it 
 laurie lifted his eyebrows and followed at a leisurely pace as she ran downstairs but when they got into the carriage he took the reins himself and left little baptiste nothing to do but fold his arms and fall asleep on his perch 
 the two never quarreled amy was too and just now laurie was too lazy so in a minute he peeped under her hatbrim with an inquiring air she answered him with a smile and they went on together in the most amicable manner 
 it was a lovely drive along winding roads rich in the picturesque scenes that delight eyes here an ancient monastery whence the solemn chanting of the monks came down to them there a shepherd in wooden shoes pointed hat and rough jacket over one shoulder sat piping on a stone while his goats skipped among the rocks or lay at his feet meek donkeys laden with panniers of freshly cut grass passed by with a pretty girl in a capaline sitting between the green piles or an old woman spinning with a distaff as she went brown children ran out from the quaint stone hovels to offer nosegays or bunches of oranges still on the bough gnarled olive trees covered the hills with their dusky foliage fruit hung golden in the orchard and great scarlet anemones fringed the roadside while beyond green slopes and craggy heights the maritime alps rose sharp and white against the blue italian sky 
 valrosa well deserved its name for in that climate of perpetual summer roses blossomed everywhere they overhung the archway thrust themselves between the bars of the great gate with a sweet welcome to and lined the avenue winding through lemon trees and feathery palms up to the villa on the hill every shadowy nook where seats invited one to stop and rest was a mass of bloom every cool grotto had its marble nymph smiling from a veil of flowers and every fountain reflected crimson white or pale pink roses leaning down to smile at their own beauty roses covered the walls of the house draped the cornices climbed the pillars and ran riot over the balustrade of the wide one looked down on the sunny mediterranean and the city on its shore 
 this is a regular honeymoon paradise it did you ever see such roses asked amy pausing on the terrace to enjoy the view and a luxurious whiff of perfume that came wandering by 
 no nor felt such thorns returned laurie with his thumb in his mouth after a vain attempt to capture a solitary scarlet flower that grew just beyond his reach 
 try lower down and pick those that have no thorns said amy gathering three of the tiny ones that starred the wall behind her she put them in his buttonhole as a peace offering and he stood a minute looking down at them with a curious expression for in the italian part of his nature there was a touch of superstition and he was just then in that state of melancholy when imaginative young men find significance in trifles and food for romance everywhere he had thought of jo in reaching after the thorny red rose for vivid flowers became her and she had often worn ones like that from the greenhouse at home the pale roses amy gave him were the sort that the italians lay in dead hands never in bridal wreaths and for a moment he wondered if the omen was for jo or for himself but the next instant his american common sense got the better of sentimentality and he laughed a heartier laugh than amy had heard since he came 
 good advice better take it and save your fingers she said thinking her speech amused him 
 thank you i will he answered in jest and a few months later he did it in earnest 
 laurie when are you going to your grandfather she asked presently as she settled herself on a rustic seat 
 very soon 
 you have said that a dozen times within the last three weeks 
 i dare say short answers save trouble 
 he expects you and you really ought to go 
 hospitable creature i know it 
 then why you do it 
 natural depravity i suppose 
 natural indolence you mean really dreadful 
 and amy looked severe 
 not so bad as it seems for i should only plague him if i went so i might as well stay and plague you a little longer you can bear it better in fact i think it agrees with you excellently and laurie composed himself for a lounge on the broad ledge of the balustrade 
 amy shook her head and opened her sketchbook with an air of resignation but she had made up her mind to lecture that boy and in a minute she began again 
 what are you doing just now 
 watching lizards 
 no no i mean what do you intend and wish to do 
 smoke a cigarette if allow me 
 how provoking you are i approve of cigars and i will only allow it on condition that you let me put you into my sketch i need a figure 
 with all the pleasure in life how will you have me full length or on my head or my heels i should respectfully suggest a recumbent posture then put yourself in also and call it dolce far niente 
 stay as you are and go to sleep if you like i intend to work hard said amy in her most energetic tone 
 what delightful enthusiasm and he leaned against a tall urn with an ir of entire satisfaction 
 what would jo say if she saw you now asked amy impatiently hoping to stir him up by the mention of her still more energetic name 
 as usual go away teddy busy he laughed as he spoke but the laugh was not natural and a shade passed over his face for the utterance of the familiar name touched the wound that was not healed yet both tone and shadow struck amy for she had seen and heard them before and now she looked up in time to catch a new expression on hard bitter look full of pain dissatisfaction and regret it was gone before she could study it and the listless expression back again she watched him for a moment with artistic pleasure thinking how like an italian he looked as he lay basking in the sun with uncovered head and eyes full of southern dreaminess for he seemed to have forgotten her and fallen into a reverie 
 you look like the effigy of a young knight asleep on his tomb she said carefully tracing the profile defined against the dark stone 
 wish i was 
 a foolish wish unless you have spoiled your life you are so changed i sometimes think there amy stopped with a look more significant than her unfinished speech 
 laurie saw and understood the affectionate anxiety which she hesitated to express and looking straight into her eyes said just as he used to say it to her mother all right 
 that satisfied her and set at rest the doubts that had begun to worry her lately it also touched her and she showed that it did by the cordial tone in which she said 
 glad of that i think been a very bad boy but i fancied you might have wasted money at that wicked lost your heart to some charming frenchwoman with a husband or got into some of the scrapes that young men seem to consider a necessary part of a foreign tour stay out there in the sun come and lie on the grass here and let us be friendly as jo used to say when we got in the sofa corner and told secrets 
 laurie obediently threw himself down on the turf and began to amuse himself by sticking daisies into the ribbons of hat that lay there 
 all ready for the secrets and he glanced up with a decided expression of interest in his eyes 
 none to tell you may begin 
 one to bless myself with i thought perhaps had some news from home 
 you have heard all that has come lately you hear often i fancied jo would send you volumes 
 very busy roving about so impossible to be regular you know when do you begin your great work of art raphaella he asked changing the subject abruptly after another pause in which he had been wondering if amy knew his secret and wanted to talk about it 
 never she answered with a despondent but decided air rome took all the vanity out of me for after seeing the wonders there i felt too insignificant to live and gave up all my foolish hopes in despair 
 why should you with so much energy and talent 
 just why because talent genius and no amount of energy can make it so i want to be great or nothing i be a dauber so i intend to try any more 
 and what are you going to do with yourself now if i may ask 
 polish up my other talents and be an ornament to society if i get the chance 
 it was a characteristic speech and sounded daring but audacity becomes young people and ambition had a good foundation laurie smiled but he liked the spirit with which she took up a new purpose when a one died and spent no time lamenting 
 good and here is where fred vaughn comes in i fancy 
 amy preserved a discreet silence but there was a conscious look in her downcast face that made laurie sit up and say gravely now going to play brother and ask questions may i 
 i promise to answer 
 your face will if your tongue you woman of the world enough yet to hide your feelings my dear i heard rumors about fred and you last year and my private opinion that if he had not been called home so suddenly and detained so long something would have come of it hey 
 not for me to say was grim reply but her lips would smile and there was a traitorous sparkle of the eye which betrayed that she knew her power and enjoyed the knowledge 
 you are not engaged i hope and laurie looked very and grave all of a sudden 
 no 
 but you will be if he comes back and goes properly down on his knees you 
 very likely 
 then you are fond of old fred 
 i could be if i tried 
 but you intend to try till the proper moment bless my soul what unearthly prudence a good fellow amy but not the man i fancied like 
 he is rich a gentleman and has delightful manners began amy trying to be quite cool and dignified but feeling a little ashamed of herself in spite of the sincerity of her intentions 
 i understand queens of society get on without money so you mean to make a good match and start in that way quite right and proper as the world goes but it sounds odd from the lips of one of your girls 
 true nevertheless 
 a short speech but the quiet decision with which it was uttered contrasted curiously with the young speaker laurie felt this instinctively and laid himself down again with a sense of disappointment which he could not explain his look and silence as well as a certain inward ruffled amy and made her resolve to deliver her lecture without delay 
 i wish do me the favor to rouse yourself a little she said sharply 
 do it for me a dear girl 
 i could if i tried and she looked as if she would like doing it in the most summary style 
 try then i give you leave returned laurie who enjoyed having someone to tease after his long abstinence from his favorite pastime 
 be angry in five minutes 
 never angry with you it takes two flints to make a fire you are as cool and soft as snow 
 you know what i can do snow produces a glow and a tingle if applied rightly your indifference is half affectation and a good stirring up would prove it 
 stir away it hurt me and it may amuse you as the big man said when his little wife beat him regard me in the light of a husband or a carpet and beat till you are tired if that sort of exercise agrees with you 
 being decidedly nettled herself and longing to see him shake off the apathy that so altered him amy sharpened both tongue and pencil and began 
 flo and i have got a new name for you lazy laurence how do you like it 
 she thought it would annoy him but he only folded his arms under his head with an imperturbable not bad thank you ladies 
 do you want to know what i honestly think of you 
 pining to be told 
 well i despise you if she had even said i hate you in a petulant or coquettish tone he would have laughed and rather liked it but the grave almost sad accent in her voice made him open his eyes and ask quickly 
 why if you please 
 because with every chance for being good useful and happy you are faulty lazy and miserable 
 strong language mademoiselle 
 if you like it go on 
 pray do quite interesting 
 i thought find it so selfish people always like to talk about themselves 
 am i selfish the question slipped out involuntarily and in a tone of surprise for the one virtue on which he prided himself was generosity 
 yes very selfish continued amy in a calm cool voice twice as effective just then as an angry one show you how for studied you while we were frolicking and not at all satisfied with you here you have been abroad nearly six months and done nothing but waste time and money and disappoint your friends 
 a fellow to have any pleasure after a grind 
 you look as if had much at any rate you are none the better for it as far as i can see i said when we first met that you had improved now i take it all back for i think you half so nice as when i left you at home you have grown abominably lazy you like gossip and waste time on frivolous things you are contented to be petted and admired by silly people instead of being loved and respected by wise ones with money talent position health and beauty ah you like that old vanity but the truth so i help saying it with all these splendid things to use and enjoy you can find nothing to do but dawdle and instead of being the man you ought to be you are only there she stopped with a look that had both pain and pity in it 
 saint laurence on a gridiron added laurie blandly finishing the sentence but the lecture began to take effect for there was a sparkle in his eyes now and a expression replaced the former indifference 
 i supposed take it so you men tell us we are angels and say we can make you what we will but the instant we honestly try to do you good you laugh at us and listen which proves how much your flattery is worth amy spoke bitterly and turned her back on the exasperating martyr at her feet 
 
 in a minute a hand came down over the page so that she could not draw and voice said with a droll imitation of a penitent child i will be good oh i will be good 
 but amy did not laugh for she was in earnest and tapping on the outspread hand with her pencil said soberly you ashamed of a hand like that as soft and white as a and looks as if it never did anything but wear best gloves and pick flowers for ladies you are not a dandy thank heaven so glad to see there are no diamonds or big seal rings on it only the little old one jo gave you so long ago dear soul i wish she was here to help me 
 so do i 
 the hand vanished as suddenly as it came and there was energy enough in the echo of her wish to suit even amy she glanced down at him with a new thought in her mind but he was lying with his hat half over his face as if for shade and his mustache hid his mouth she only saw his chest rise and fall with a long breath that might have been a sigh and the hand that wore the ring nestled down into the grass as if to hide something too precious or too tender to be spoken of all in a minute various hints and trifles assumed shape and significance in mind and told her what her sister never had confided to her she remembered that laurie never spoke voluntarily of jo she recalled the shadow on his face just now the change in his character and the wearing of the little old ring which was no ornament to a handsome hand girls are quick to read such signs and feel their eloquence amy had fancied that perhaps a love trouble was at the bottom of the alteration and now she was sure of it her keen eyes filled and when she spoke again it was in a voice that could be beautifully soft and kind when she chose to make it so 
 i know i have no right to talk so to you laurie and if you the fellow in the world be very angry with me but we are all so fond and proud of you i bear to think they should be disappointed in you at home as i have been though perhaps they would understand the change better than i do 
 i think they would came from under the hat in a grim tone quite as touching as a broken one 
 they ought to have told me and not let me go blundering and scolding when i should have been more kind and patient than ever i never did like that miss randal and now i hate her said artful amy wishing to be sure of her facts this time 
 hang miss randal and laurie knocked the hat off his face with a look that left no doubt of his sentiments toward that young lady 
 i beg pardon i thought and there she paused diplomatically 
 no you you knew perfectly well i never cared for anyone but jo laurie said that in his old impetuous tone and turned his face away as he spoke 
 i did think so but as they never said anything about it and you came away i supposed i was mistaken and jo be kind to you why i was sure she loved you dearly 
 she was kind but not in the right way and lucky for her she love me if the fellow you think me her fault though and you may tell her so 
 the hard bitter look came back again as he said that and it troubled amy for she did not know what balm to apply 
 i was wrong i know very sorry i was so cross but i help wishing bear it better teddy dear 
 her name for me and laurie put up his hand with a quick gesture to stop the words spoken in tone wait till tried it yourself he added in a low voice as he pulled up the grass by the handful 
 take it manfully and be respected if i be loved said amy with the decision of one who knew nothing about it 
 now laurie flattered himself that he had borne it remarkably well making no moan asking no sympathy and taking his trouble away to live it down alone lecture put the matter in a new light and for the first time it did look weak and selfish to lose heart at the first failure and shut himself up in moody indifference he felt as if suddenly shaken out of a pensive dream and found it impossible to go to sleep again presently he sat up and asked slowly do you think jo would despise me as you do 
 yes if she saw you now she hates lazy people why you do something splendid and make her love you 
 i did my best but it was no use 
 graduating well you mean that was no more than you ought to have done for your sake it would have been shameful to fail after spending so much time and money when everyone knew that you could do well 
 i did fail say what you will for jo love me 
 began laurie leaning his head on his hand in a despondent attitude 
 no you and say so in the end for it did you good and proved that you could do something if you tried if only set about another task of some sort soon be your hearty happy self again and forget your trouble 
 impossible 
 try it and see you shrug your shoulders and think much she knows about such things i pretend to be wise but i am observing and i see a great deal more than imagine interested in other experiences and inconsistencies and though i explain i remember and use them for my own benefit love jo all your days if you choose but let it spoil you for wicked to throw away so many good gifts because you have the one you want there i lecture any more for i know wake up and be a man in spite of that hardhearted girl 
 neither spoke for several minutes laurie sat turning the little ring on his finger and amy put the last touches to the hasty sketch she had been working at while she talked presently she put it on his knee merely saying how do you like that 
 he looked and then he smiled as he could not well help doing for it was capitally done the long lazy figure on the grass with listless face eyes and one hand holding a cigar from which came the little wreath of smoke that encircled the head 
 how well you draw he said with a genuine surprise and pleasure at her skill adding with a yes me 
 as you are this is as you were and amy laid another sketch beside the one he held 
 it was not nearly so well done but there was a life and spirit in it which atoned for many faults and it recalled the past so vividly that a sudden change swept over the young face as he looked only a rough sketch of laurie taming a horse hat and coat were off and every line of the active figure resolute face and commanding attitude was full of energy and meaning the handsome brute just subdued stood arching his neck under the tightly drawn rein with one foot impatiently pawing the ground and ears pricked up as if listening for the voice that had mastered him in the ruffled mane the breezy hair and erect attitude there was a suggestion of suddenly arrested motion of strength courage and youthful buoyancy that contrasted sharply with the supine grace of the dolce far niente sketch laurie said nothing but as his eye went from one to the other amy say him flush up and fold his lips together as if he read and accepted the little lesson she had given him that satisfied her and without waiting for him to speak she said in her sprightly way 
 you remember the day you played rarey with puck and we all looked on meg and beth were frightened but jo clapped and pranced and i sat on the fence and drew you i found that sketch in my portfolio the other day touched it up and kept it to show you 
 much obliged improved immensely since then and i congratulate you may i venture to suggest in a honeymoon paradise that five is the dinner hour at your hotel 
 laurie rose as he spoke returned the pictures with a smile and a bow and looked at his watch as if to remind her that even moral lectures should have an end he tried to resume his former easy indifferent air but it was an affectation now for the rousing had been more effacious than he would confess amy felt the shade of coldness in his manner and said to herself 
 now offended him well if it does him good glad if it makes him hate me sorry but true and i take back a word of it 
 they laughed and chatted all the way home and little baptist up behind thought that monsieur and madamoiselle were in charming spirits but both felt ill at ease the friendly frankness was disturbed the sunshine had a shadow over it and despite their apparent gaiety there was a secret discontent in the heart of each 
 shall we see you this evening mon frere asked amy as they parted at her door 
 unfortunately i have an engagement au revoir madamoiselle and laurie bent as if to kiss her hand in the foreign fashion which became him better than many men something in his face made amy say quickly and warmly 
 no be yourself with me laurie and part in the good old way rather have a hearty english handshake than all the sentimental salutations in france 
 goodbye dear and with these words uttered in the tone she liked laurie left her after a handshake almost painful in its heartiness 
 next morning instead of the usual call amy received a note which made her smile at the beginning and sigh at the end 
 
 
 my dear mentor 
 please make my adieux to your aunt and exult within yourself for lazy laurence has gone to his grandpa like the best of boys a pleasant winter to you and may the gods grant you a blissful honeymoon at valrosa i think fred would be benefited by a rouser tell him so with my congratulations

 good boy glad gone said amy with an approving smile the next minute her face fell as she glanced about the empty room adding with an involuntary sigh yes i am glad but how i shall miss him

lionfish nov chapter the flaw in the plancontents prev chapter next chapter 
 
 he was flying facedown on the ground again the smell of the forest filled his nostrils he could feel the cold hard ground beneath his cheek and the hinge of his glasses which have been knocked sideways by the fall cutting into his temple every inch of him ached and the place where killing curse had hit him felt like the bruise of an punch he did not stir but he remained exactly where he had fallen with his left arm bent out at an awkward angle and his mouth gaping 
 
 he had expected to hear cheer of triumph and jubilation at his death but instead hurried footsteps whispers and solicitous murmurs filled the air 
 
 my lord my lord 
 
 it was bellatrixs voice and she spoke as if to a lover harry did not dare open his eyes but allowed his other senses to explore his predicament he knew that his wand was still stowed beneath his robes because he could feel it pressed between his chest and the ground a slight cushioning effect in the area of his stomach told him that the invisibility cloak was also there stuffed out of sight 
 
 my lord 
 
 that will do said voldemorts voice 
 
 more footsteps several people were backing away from the same spot desperate to see what was happening and why harry opened his eyes by a millimeter 
 
 voldemort seemed to be getting to his feet various death eaters were hurrying away from him returning to the crowd lining the clearing bellatrix alone remained behind kneeling beside voldemort 
 
 harry closed his eyes again and considered what he had seen the death eaters have been buddled around voldemort who seem to have fallen to the ground something had happened when he had hit harry with the killing curse had voldemort too collapsed it seemed like it and both of them had briefly fallen unconscious and both of them had now returned 
 
 my lord let me c 
 
 i do not require assistance said voldemort coldly and though he could not see it harry pictured bellatrix withdrawing a helpful hand the boy is he dead 
 
 there was a complete silence in the clearing nobody approached harry but he felt their concentrated gaze it seemed to press him harder into the ground and he was terrified a finger or an eyelid might twitch 
 
 you said voldemort and there was a bang and a small shriek of pain examine him tell me whether he is dead 
 
 harry did not know who had been sent to verify he could only lie there with his heart thumping traitorously and wait to be examined but at the same time nothing small comfort through it was that voldemort was wary of approaching him that voldemort suspected that all had not gone to plan 
 
 hands softer than he had been expecting touched harrys face and felt his heart he could hear the womans fast breathing her pounding of life against his ribs 
 
 is draco alive is he in the castle 
 
 the whisper was barely audible her lips were an inch from his ear her head bent so low that her long hair shielded his face from the onlookers 
 
 yes he breathed back 
 
 he felt the hand on his chest contract her nails pierced him then it was withdrawn she had sat up 
 
 he is dead narcissa malfoy called to the watchers 
 
 and now they shouted now they yelled in triumph and stamped their feet and through his eyelids harry saw bursts of red and silver light shoot into the air in celebration 
 
 still feigning death on the ground he understood narcissa knew that the only way she would be permitted to enter hogwarts and find her son was as part of the conquering army she no longer cared whether voldemort won 
 
 you see screeched voldemort over the tumult harry potter is dead by my hand and no man alive can threaten me now watch crucio 
 
 harry had been expecting it knew his body would not be allowed to remain unsullied upon the forest floor it must be subjected to humiliation to prove voldemorts victory he was lifted into the air and it took all his determination to remain limp yet the pain he expected did not come he was thrown once twice three times into the air his glasses flew off and he felt his wand slide a little beneath his robes but he kept himself floppy and lifeless and when he fell to ground for the last time the clearing echoed with jeers and shrieks of laughter 
 
 now said voldemort we go to the castle and show them what has become of their hero who shall drag the body no c wait c 
 
 there was a fresh outbreak of laughter and after a few moments harry felt the ground trembling beneath him 
 
 you carry him voldemort said he will be nice and visible in your arms will he not pick up your little friend hagrid and the glasses c put on the glasses c he must be recognizable c 
 
 someone slammed harrys glasses back onto his face with deliberate force but the enormous hands that lifted him into the air were exceedingly gentle harry could feel hagrids arms trembling with the force of his heaving sobs great tears splashed down upon him as hagrid cradled harry in his arms and harry did not dare by movement or word to intimate to hagrid that all was not yet lost 
 
 move said voldemort and hagrid stumbled forward forcing his way through the trees back through the forest 
 
 branches caught at harrys hair and robes but he lay quiescent his mouth lolling open his eyes shut and in the darkness while the death eaters coed all around them and while hagrid sobbed blindly nobody looked to see whether a pulse beat in the exposed neck of harry potter 
 
 the two giants crashed along behind the death eaters harry could hear trees creaking and falling as they passed they made so much din that birds toes shrieking into the sky and even the jeers of the death eaters were drowned the victorious procession marched on toward the open ground and after a while harry could tell by the lightening of the darkness through his closed eyelids that the trees were beginning to thin 
 
 bane 
 
 hagrids unexpected bellow nearly forced harrys eyes open happy now are yeh that yeh didnt fight yeh cowardly bunch o nags are yeh happy harry potters c 
 
 hagrid could not continue but broke down in fresh tears harry wondered how many centaurs were watching their procession pass he dared not open his eyes to look some of the death eaters called insults at the centaurs as they left them behind a little later harry sensed by a freshening of the air that they had reached the edge of the forest 
 
 stop 
 
 harry thought that hagrid must have been forced to obey voldemorts command because he lurched a little and now a chill settled over them where they stood and harry heard the rasping breath of the dementors that patrolled the other trees they would not affect him now 
 
 the fact of his own survival burned inside him a talisman against them as though his fathers stag kept guardian in his heart 
 
 someone passed close by harry and he knew that it was voldemort himself because he spoke a moment later his voice magically magnified so that it swelled through the ground crashing upon harrys eardrums 
 
 harry potter is dead he was killed as he ran away trying to save himself while you lay down your lives for him we bring you his body as proof that your hero is gone 
 
 the battle is won you have lost half of your fighters my death eaters outnumber you and the boy who lived is finished there must be no more war anyone who continues to resist man woman or child will be slaughtered as will every member of their family come out of the castle now kneel before me and you shall be spared your parents and children your brothers and sisters will live and be forgiven and you will join me in the new world we shall build together 
 
 there was silence in the grounds and from the castle voldemort was so close to him that harry did not dare open his eyes again 
 
 come said voldemort and harry heard him move ahead and hagrid was forced to follow now harry opened his eyes a fraction and saw voldemort striding in front them wearing the great snake nagini around his shoulders now free of her enchanted cage but harry had no possibility of extracting the wand concealed under his robes without being noticed by the death eaters who marched on the either side of them through the slowly lightening darkness 
 
 harry sobbed hagrid oh harry harry 
 
 harry shut his eyes tight again he knew that they were approaching the castle and strained his ears to distinguish above the gleeful voices of the death eaters and their tramping footsteps signs of life from those within 
 
 stop 
 
 the death eaters came to a halt harry heard them spreading out in a line facing the open front doors of the school he could see even though his closed lids the reddish glow that meant light streamed upon him from the entrance hall he waited any moment the people for whom he had tried to die would see him lying apparently dead in hagrids arms 
 
 no 
 
 the scream was the more terrible because he had never expected or dreamed that professor mcgonagall could make such a sound he heard another women laughing nearby and knew that bellatrix gloried in mcgonagalls despair he squinted again for a single second and saw the open doorway filling with people as the survivors of the battle came out onto the front steps to face their vanquishers and see the truth of harrys death for themselves he saw voldemort standing a little in front of him stroking naginis head with a single white finger he closed his eyes again 
 
 no 
 
 no 
 
 harry harry 
 
 rons hermiones and ginnys voices were worse than mcgonagalls harry wanted nothing more than to call back yet he made himself lie silent and their cries acted like a trigger the crowd of survivors took up the cause screaming and yelling abuse at the death eathers until silence cried voldemort and there was a bang and a flash of bright light and silence was forced upon them all it is over set him down hagrid at my feet where he belongs 
 
 harry felt himself lowered onto the grass 
 
 you see said voldemort and harry felt him striding backward and forward right beside the place where he lay harry potter is dead do you understand now deluded ones he was nothing ever but a boy who relied on others to sacrifice themselves for him 
 
 he beat you yelled ron and the charm broke and the defenders of hogwarts were shouting and screaming again until a second more powerful bang extinguished their voices once more 
 
 he was killed while trying to sneak out of the castle grounds said voldemort and there was a relish in his voice for the lie killed while trying to save himself c 
 
 but voldemort broke off harry heard a scuffle and a shout then another bang a flash of light and grunt of pain he opened his eyes an infinitesimal amount someone had broken free of the crowd and charged at voldemort harry saw the figure hit the ground disarmed voldemort throwing the challengers wand aside and laughing 
 
 and who is this he said in his soft snakes hiss who has volunteered to demonstrate what happens to those who continue to fight when the battle is lost 
 
 bellatrix gave a delighted laugh 
 
 it is neville longbottom my lord the boy who has been giving the carrows so much trouble the son of the aurors remember 
 
 ah yes i remember said voldemort looking down at neville who was struggling back to his feet unarmed and unprotected standing in the between the survivors and the death eaters but you are a pureblood arent you my brave boy voldemort asked neville who stood facing him his empty hands curled in fists 
 
 so what if i am said neville loudly 
 
 you show spirit and bravery and you come of noble stock you will make a very valuable death eater we need your kind neville longbottom 
 
 ill join you when hell freezes over said neville dumbledores army he shouted and there was an answering cheer from the crowd whom voldemorts silencing charms seemed unable to hold 
 
 very well said voldemort and harry heard more danger in the silkiness of his voice than in the most powerful curse if that is your choice longbottom we revert to the original plan on your head he said quietly be it 
 
 still watching through his lashes harry saw voldemort wave his wand seconds later out of one of the castles shattered windows something that looked like a misshapen bird flew through the half light and landed in voldemorts hand he shook the mildewed object by its pointed end and it dangled empty and ragged the sorting hat 
 
 there will be no more sorting at hogwarts school said voldemort there will be no more houses the emblem shield and colors of my noble ancestor salazar slythering will suffice everyone wont they neville longbottom 
 
 he pointed his wand at neville who grew rigid and still then forced the hat onto nevilles head so that it slipped down below his eyes there were movements from the watching crowd in front of the castle and as one the death eaters raised their wands holding the fighters of hogwarts at bay 
 
 neville here is now going to demonstrate what happens to anyone foolish enough to continue to oppose me said voldemort and with a flick of his wand he caused the sorting hat to burst into flames 
 
 screams split the dawn and neville was a flame rooted to the spot unable to move and harry could not bear it he must act and then many things happened at the same moment 
 
 they heard uproar from the distant boundary of the school as what sounded like hundreds of people came swarming over the walls and pelted toward the castle uttering loud war cries at the same time grawp came lumbering around the side of the castle and yelled hagger his cry was answered by roars from voldemorts giants they ran at grawp like bull elephants making the earth quake then came hooves and the twangs of bows and arrows were suddenly falling amongst the death eaters who broke ranks shouting their surprise harry pulled the invisibility cloak from inside his robes swung it over himself and sprang to his feet as neville moved too 
 
 in one swift fluid motion neville broke free of the curse upon him the flaming hat fell off him and he drew from its depths something silver with a glittering rubied handle the slash of the silver blade could not be heard over the roar of the oncoming crowd or the sounds of the clashing giants or of the stampeding centaurs and yet it seemed to draw every eye with a single stroke neville sliced off the great snakes head which spun high into the air gleaming in the light flooding from the entrance hall and voldemorts mouth was open in a scream of fury that nobody could hear and the snakes body thudded to the ground at his feet c 
 
 hidden beneath the invisibility cloak harry cast a shield charm between neville and voldemort before the latter could raise his stamps of the battling giants hagrids yell came loudest of all 
 
 harry hagrid shouted harry c wheres harry chaos reigned the charging centaurs were scattering the death eaters everyone was feeling the giants stamping feet and nearer and nearer thundered the reinforcements that had come from who knew where harry saw great winged creatures soaring the heads of voldemorts giants thestrals and buckbeak the hippogriff scratching at their eyes while grawp punched and pummeled them and now the wizards defenders of hogwarts and death eaters alike were being forced back into the castle harry was shooting jinxes and curses at any death eater he could see and they crumpled not knowing what or who had hit them and their bodies were trampled by the retreating crowd still hidden beneath the invisibility cloak harry was buffered into the entrance hall he was searching for voldemort and saw him across the room firing spells from his wand as he backed into the great hall still screaming instructions to his followers as he sent curses flying left and right harry cast more shield charms and voldemorts victims seamus finnigan and hannah abbott darted past him into the great hall where they joined the fight already flourishing inside it 
 
 and now there were more even more people storming up the front steps and harry saw charlie weasley overtaking horace slughorn who was still wearing his emerald pajamas they seemed to have returned at the head of what looked like the families and friends of every hogwarts student who had remained to fight along with the shopkeeps and homeowners of hogsmeade the centaurs bane ronan and magorian burst into the hall with a great clatter of hooves as behind harry the door that led to the kitchens was blasted off its hinges 
 
 the of hogwarts swarmed into the entrance hall screaming and waving carving knives and cleaver and at their head the locker of regulus black bouncing on his chest was kreacher his bullfrogs voice audible even above this din fight fight fight for my master defender of fight the dark lord in the name of brave regulus fight 
 
 they were hacking and stabbing at the ankles and shim of death eaters their tiny faces alive with malice and everywhere harry looked death eaters were folding under sheer weight of numbers overcome by spells dragging arrows from wounds stabbed in the leg by elves or else simply attempting to escape but swallowed by the oncoming horde 
 
 but it was not over yet harry sped between duelers past a struggling prisoners and into he great hall 
 
 voldemort was in the center of the battle and he was striking and smiting al within reach harry could not get a clear shot but fought his way nearer still invisible and the great hall became more and more crowded as everyone who could walk forced their way inside 
 
 harry saw yaxley slammed to the floor by george and lee jordan saw dolohov fall with a scream at flitwicks hands saw walden macnair thrown across the room by hagrid hit the stone wall opposite and slide unconscious to the ground he saw ron and neville bringing down fenrir greyback aberforth stunning rookwood arthur and percy flooting thicknesse and lucius and narcissa malfoy running through the crowd not even attempting to fight screaming for their son 
 
 voldemort was now dueling mcgonagall slughorn kingsley all at once and there was a cold hatred in his face as they wove and ducked around him unable to finish him bellatrix was still fighting too fifty yards away from voldemort and like her master she dueled three at once hermione ginny and luna all battling their hardest but bellatrix was equal to them and harrys attention was diverted as a killing curse shot so close to ginny that she missed death by an inch 
 
 he changed course running at bellatrix rather than voldemort but before he had gone a few steps he was knocked sideways 
 
 not my daughter you bitch 
 
 mrs weasley threw off her cloak as she ran freeing her arms bellatrix spun on the spot roaring with laughter at the sight of the new challenger 
 
 out of my way shouted mrs weasley to the three girls and with a simple swipe of her wand she began to duel harry watched with terror and elation as molly weasleys wand slashed and twisted and bellatrix lestranges smile faltered and became a snarl jets of light flew from both wands the floor around the witches feet became hot and cracked both woman were fighting to kill 
 
 no mrs weasley cried as a few students ran forward trying to come to her aid get back get back she is mine 
 
 hundreds of people now lined the walls watching the two fights voldemort and his three opponents bellatrix and molly and harry stood invisible torn between both wanting to attack and yet to protect unable to be sure that he would not hit the innocent 
 
 what will happen to your children when ive killed you taunted bellatrix as mad as her master capering as mollys curses danced around her when mummys gone the same way as freddie 
 
 you c will c never c touch c our c children c again screamed mrs weasley 
 
 bellatrix laughed the same exhilarated laugh her cousin sirius had given as he toppled backward through the veil and suddenly harry knew what was going to happen before it did 
 
 mollys curse soared beneath bellatrixs constricted arm and hit her squarely in the chest directly over her heart 
 
 bellatrixs gloating smile froze her eyes seemed to bulge for the tiniest space of time she knew what had happened and then she toppled and the watching crowd roared and voldemord screamed 
 
 harry felt as though he turned into slow motion he saw mcgonagall kingsley and slughorn blasted backward flailing and writhing through the air as voldemorts fury at the fall of his last best lieutenant exploded with the force of a bomb voldemort raised his wand and directed it at molly weasley 
 
 protego roared harry and the shield charm expanded in the middle of the hall and voldemort stared around for the source as harry pulled off the invisibility cloak at last 
 
 the yell of shock the cheers the screams on every side of harry 
 
 hes alive were stifled at once the crowd was afraid and silence fell abruptly and completely as voldemort and harry looked at each other and began at the same moment to circle each other 
 
 i dont want anyone else to help harry said loudly and in the total silence his voice carried like a trumpet call its got to be like this its got to be me 
 
 voldemort hissed 
 
 potter doesnt mean that he said his red eyes wide this isnt how he works is it who are you going to use as a shield today potter 
 
 nobody said harry simply there are no more horcruxes its just you and me neither can live while the other survives and one of us is about to leave for good 
 
 one of us jeered voldemort and his whole body was taut and his red eyes stared a snake that was about to strike you think it will be you do you the boy who has survived by accident and because dumbledore was pulling the strings 
 
 accident was it when my mother died to save me asked harry they were still moving sideways both of them in that perfect circle maintaining the same distance from each other and for harry no face existed but voldemorts accident when i decided to fight in that graveyard accident that i didnt defend myself tonight and still survived and returned to fight again 
 
 accidents screamed voldemort but still he did not strike and the watching crowd was frozen as if petrified and of the hundreds in the hall nobody seemed to breathe but they two accident and chance and the fact that you crouched and sniveled behind the skirts of greater men and women and permitted me to kill them for you 
 
 you wont be killing anyone else tonight said harry as they circled and stared into each others eyes green into red you wont be able to kill any of them ever again dont you get it i was ready to die to stop you from hurting these people c 
 
 but you did not 
 
 c i meant to and thats what did it ive done what my mother did theyre protected from you havent you noticed how none of the spells you put on them are binding you cant torture them you cant touch them you dont learn from your mistakes riddle do you 
 
 you dare c 
 
 yes i dare said harry i know things you dont know tom riddle i know lots of important things that you dont want to hear some before you make another big mistake 
 
 voldemort did not speak but prowled in a circle and harry knew that he kept him temporarily mesmerized at bay held back by the faintest possibility that harry might indeed know a final secret 
 
 is it love again said voldemort his snakes face jeering dumbledore favorite solution love which he claimed conquered death though love did not stop him falling from the tower and breaking like and old waxwork love which did not prevent me stamping out your muddblood mother like a cockroach potter c and nobody seems to love you enough to run forward this time and take my curse so what will stop you dying now when i strike 
 
 just one thing said harry and still they circled each other wrapped in each other held apart by nothing but the last secret 
 
 if it is not love that will save you this time said voldemort you must believe that you have magic that i do not or else a weapon more powerful than mine 
 
 i believe both said harry and he saw shock flit across the snakelike face though it was instantly dispelled voldemort began to laugh and the sound was more frightening than his screams humorless and insane it echoed around the silent hall 
 
 you think you know more magic than i do he said than i than lord voldemort who has performed magic that dumbledore himself never dreamed of 
 
 oh he dreamed of it said harry but he knew more than you knew enough not to do what youve done 
 
 you mean he was weak screamed voldemort too weak to dare too weak to take what might have been his what will be mine 
 
 no he was cleverer than you said harry a better wizard a better man 
 
 i brought about the death of albus dumbledore 
 
 you thought you did said harry but you were wrong 
 
 for the first time the watching crowd stirred as the hundreds of people around the walls drew breath as one 
 
 dumbledore is dead voldemort hurled the words at harry as in the marble tomb in the grounds of this castle i have seen it potter and he will not return 
 
 yes dumbledore is dead said harry calmly but you didnt have him killed he chose his own manner of dying chose it months before he died arranged the whole thing with the man you thought was your servant 
 
 what childish dream is this said voldemort but still he did not strike and his red eyes did not waver from harrys 
 
 severus snape wasnt yours said harry snape was dumbledores dumbledores from the moment you starting hunting down my mother and you never realized it because of the thing you cant understand you never saw snape cast a patronus did you riddle 
 
 voldemort did not answer they continued to circle each other like wolves about to tear each other apart 
 
 snapes patronus was a doe said harry the same as my mothers because he loved her for nearly all of his life from the time when they were children you should have realized he said as he saw voldemorts nostrils flare he asked you to spare her life didnt he 
 
 he desired her that was all sneered voldemort but when she had gone he agreed that there were other women and of purer blood worthier of him c 
 
 of course he told you that said harry but he was dumbledores spy from the moment you threatened her and hes been working against you ever since dumbledore was already dying when snape finished him 
 
 it matters not shrieked voldemort who had followed every word with rapt attention but now let out a cackle of mad laughter it matters not whether snape was mine or dumbledores or what petty obstacles they tried to put in my path i crushed them as i crushed your mother snapes supposed great love oh but it all makes sense potter and in ways that you do not understand 
 
 dumbledore was trying to keep the elder wand from me he intended that snape should be the true master of the wand but i got there ahead of you little boy c i reached the wand before you could get your hands on it i understood the truth before you caught up i killed severus snape three hours ago and the elder wand the deathstick the wand of destiny is truly mine dumbledores last plan went wrong harry potter 
 
 yeah it did said harry youre right but before you try to kill me id advise you think what youve done think and try for some remorse riddle 
 
 what is this 
 
 of all the things that harry had said to him beyond any revelation or taunt nothing had socked voldemort like this harry saw is pupils contract to thin slits saw the skin around his eyes whiten 
 
 its your one last chance said harry its all youve got left ive seen what youll be otherwise be a man try 
 
 try for some remorse 
 
 you dare c said voldemort again 
 
 yes i dare said harry because dumbledores last plan hasnt backfired on me at all its backfired on you riddle 
 
 voldemorts hand was trembling on the elder wand and harry gripped dracos very tightly the moment he knew was seconds away 
 
 that wand still isnt working properly for you because you murdered the wrong person severus snape was never the true master of the elder wand he never defeated dumbledore 
 
 he killed c 
 
 arent you listening snape never beat dumbledore dumbledores death was planned between them dumbledore intended to die undefeated the wands last true master if all had gone as planned the wands power would have died with him because it had never been won from him 
 
 but then potter dumbledore as good as gave me the wand voldemorts voice shook with malicious pleasure i stole the wand from its last masters tomb i removed it against the last masters wishes its power is mine 
 
 you still dont get it riddle do you possessing the wand isnt enough holding it using it doesnt make it really yours didnt you listen to ollivander the wand chooses the wizard the elder wand recognized a new master before dumbledore died someone who never even laid a hand on it the new master removed the wand from dumbledore against his will never realizing exactly what he had done or that the worlds most dangerous wand had given him its allegiance 
 
 voldemorts chest rose and fell rapidly and harry could feel the curse coming feel it building inside the wand pointed at his face 
 
 the true master of the elder wand was draco malfoy 
 
 blank shock showed in voldemorts face for a moment but then it was gone 
 
 but what does it matter he said softly even if you are right potter it makes no difference to you and me you no longer have the phoenix wand we duel on skill alone and after i have killed you i can attend to draco malfoy 
 
 but youre too late said harry youve missed your chance i got there first i overpowered draco weeks ago i took his wand from him 
 
 harry twitched the hawthorn wand and he felt the eyes of everyone in the hall upon it 
 
 so it all comes down to this doesnt it whispered harry does the wand in your hand know its last master was disarmed because if it does i am the true master of the elder wand 
 
 a burst suddenly across the enchanted sky above them as an edge of dazzling sun appeared over the sill of the nearest window the light hit both of their faces at the same time so that voldemorts was suddenly a flaming blur harry heard the high voice shriek as he too yelled his best hope to the heavens pointing dracos wand 
 
 avada kedavra 
 
 expelliarmus 
 
 the bang was like a cannon blast and the golden flames that erupted between them at the dead center of the circle they had been treading marked the point where the spells collided harry saw voldemorts green jet meet his own spell saw the elder wand fly high dark against the sunrise spinning across the enchanted ceiling like the head of nagini spinning through the air toward the master it would not kill who had come to take full possession of it at last and harry with the unerring skill of the seeker caught the wand in his free hand as voldemort fell backward arms splayed the slit pupils of the scarlet eyes rolling upward tom riddle hit the floor with a mundane finality his body feeble and shrunken the white hands empty the snakelike face vacant and unknowing voldemort was dead killed by his own rebounding curse and harry stood with two wands in his hand staring down at his enemys shell 
 
 one shivering second of silence the shock of the moment suspended and then the tumult broke around harry as the screams and the cheers and the roars of the watchers rent the air the fierce new sun dazzled the windows as they thundered toward him and the first to reach him were ron and hermione and it was their arms that were wrapped around him their incomprehensible shouts that deafened him then ginny neville and luna were there and then all the weasleys and hagrid and kingsley and mcgonagall and flitwick and sprout and harry could not hear a word that anyone was shouting not tell whose hands were seizing him pulling him trying to hug some part of him hundreds of them pressing in all of them determined to touch the boy who lived the reason it was over at last c the sun rose steadily over hogwarts and the great hall blazed with life and light harry was an indispensable part of the mingled outpourings of jubilation and mourning of grief and celebration they wanted him there with them their leader and symbol their savior and their guide and that he had not slept that he craved the company of only a few of them seemed to occur to no one he must speak to the bereaved clasp their hands witness their tears receive their thanks hear the news now creeping in from every quarter as the morning drew on that the imperiused up and down the country had come back to themselves that death eaters were fleeing or else being captured that the innocent of azkaban were being released at that very moment and that kingsley shacklebolt had been named temporary minister of magic 
 
 they moved voldemorts body and laid it in a chamber off the hall away form the bodies of fred tonks lupin colin creevey and fifty others who had died fighting him mcgonagall had replaced the house tables but nobody was sitting according to house anymore all were jumbled together teachers and pupils ghosts and parents centaurs and and firenze lay recovering in the corner and grawp peered in through a smashed window and people were throwing food into his laughing mouth after a while exhausted and drained harry found himself sitting on a bench beside luna 
 
 id want some peace and quiet if it were me she said 
 
 id love some he replied 
 
 ill distract them all she said use your cloak 
 
 and before he could say a word she had cried oooh look a blibbering humdinger and pointed out the window everyone who heard looked around and harry slid the cloak up over himself and got to his feet 
 
 now he could move through the hall without interference he spotted ginny two tables away she was sitting with her head on her mothers shoulder there would be time to talk later hours and days and maybe years in which to talk he saw neville the sword of gryffindor lying beside his plate as he ate surrounded by a knot of fervent admirers along the aisle between the tables he walked and he spotted the three malfoys huddled together as though unsure whether or not they were supposed to be there but nobody was paying them any attention everywhere he looked he saw families reunited and finally he saw the two whose company he craved most 
 
 its me he muttered crouching down between them will you come with me 
 
 they stood up at once and together he ron and hermione left the great hall great chunks were missing from the marble staircase part of the balustrade gone and rubble and bloodstains occurred ever few steps as their climbed 
 
 somewhere in the distance they could hear peeves zooming through the corridors singing a victory song of his own composition 
 
 
 
 
 we did it we bashed them wee potters the one 
 
 and voldys gone moldy so now lets have fun 
 
 
 
 
 really gives a feeling for the scope and tragedy of the thing doesnt it said ron pushing open a door to let harry and hermione through 
 
 happiness would come harry though but at the moment it was muffled by exhaustion and the pain of losing fred and lupin and tonks pierced him like a physical wound every few steps most of all he felt the most stupendous relief and a longing to sleep but first he owed an explanation to ron and hermione who had stuck with him for so long and who deserved the truth 
 
 painstakingly he recounted what he had seem in the pensieve and what had happened in the forest and they had not even begun to express all their shock and amazement when at last they arrived at the place to which they had been walking though none of them had mentioned their destination 
 
 since he had last seen it the gargoyle guarding the entrance to the headmasters study had been knocked aside it stood lopsided looking a little and harry wondered whether it would be able to distinguish passwords anymore 
 
 can we go up he asked the gargoyle 
 
 feel free groaned the statue 
 
 they clambered over him and onto the spiral stone staircase that moved slowly upward like an escalator harry pushed open the door at the top 
 
 he had one brief glimpse of the stone pensieve on the desk where he had left it and then an earsplitting noise made him cry out thinking of curses and returning death eaters and the rebirth of voldemort c 
 
 but it was applause all around the walls the headmasters and headmistresses of hogwarts were giving him a standing ovation they waved their hats and in some cases their wigs they reached through their frames to grip each others hands they danced up and down on their chairs in which they have been painted dilys derwent sobbed unashamedly dexter fortescue was waving his and phineas niggelus called in his high reedy voice and let it be noted that slytherin house played its part let our contribution not be forgotten 
 
 but harry had eyes only for the man who stood in the largest portrait directly behind the headmasters chair tears were sliding down from behind the spectacles into the long silver beard and the pride and the gratitude emanating from him filled harry with the same balm as phoenix song 
 
 at last harry held up his hands and the portraits fell respectfully silent beaming and mopping their eyes and waiting eagerly for him to speak he directed his words at dumbledore however and chose them with enormous care exhausted and though he was he must make one last effort seeking one last piece of advice 
 
 the thing that was hidden in the snitch he began i dropped it in the forest i dont know exactly where but im not going to go looking for it again do you agree 
 
 my dear boy i do said dumbledore while his fellow pictures looked confused and curious a wise and courageous decision but no less than i would have expected of you does anyone know else know where it fell 
 
 no one said harry and dumbledore nodded his satisfaction 
 
 im going to keep ignotuss present though said harry and dumbledore beamed 
 
 but of course harry it is yours forever until you pass it on 
 
 and then theres this 
 
 harry held up the elder wand and ron and hermione looked at it with a reverence that even in his befuddled and state harry did not like to see 
 
 i dont want it said harry 
 
 what said ron loudly are you mental 
 
 i know its powerful said harry wearily but i was happier with mine so 
 
 he rummaged in the pouch hung around his neck and pulled out the two halves of holly still just connected by the finest threat of phoenix feather hermione had said that they could not be repaired that the damage was too severe all he knew was that if this did not work nothing would 
 
 he laid the broken wand upon the headmasters desk touched it with the very tip of the elder wand and said reparo 
 
 as his wand resealed red sparks flew out of its end harry knew that he had succeeded he picked up the holly and phoenix wand and felt a sudden warmth in his fingers as though wand and hand were rejoicing at their reunion 
 
 im putting the elder wand he told dumbledore who was watching him with enormous affection and admiration back where it came from it can stay there if i die a natural death like ignotus its power will be broken wont it the previous master will never have been defeated thatll be the end of it 
 
 dumbledore nodded they smiled at each other 
 
 are you sure said ron there was the faintest trace of longing in his voice as he looked at the elder wand 
 
 i think harrys right said hermione quietly 
 
 that wands more trouble than its worth said harry and quite honestly he turned away from the painted portraits thinking now only of the bed lying waiting for him in gryffindor tower and wondering whether kreacher might bring him a sandwich there ive had enough trouble for a lifetime 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the deathly hallows 
 

lionfish nov chapter the flaw in the plancontents prev chapter next chapter 
 
 he was flying facedown on the ground again the smell of the forest filled his nostrils he could feel the cold hard ground beneath his cheek and the hinge of his glasses which have been knocked sideways by the fall cutting into his temple every inch of him ached and the place where killing curse had hit him felt like the bruise of an punch he did not stir but he remained exactly where he had fallen with his left arm bent out at an awkward angle and his mouth gaping 
 
 he had expected to hear cheer of triumph and jubilation at his death but instead hurried footsteps whispers and solicitous murmurs filled the air 
 
 my lord my lord 
 
 it was bellatrixs voice and she spoke as if to a lover harry did not dare open his eyes but allowed his other senses to explore his predicament he knew that his wand was still stowed beneath his robes because he could feel it pressed between his chest and the ground a slight cushioning effect in the area of his stomach told him that the invisibility cloak was also there stuffed out of sight 
 
 my lord 
 
 that will do said voldemorts voice 
 
 more footsteps several people were backing away from the same spot desperate to see what was happening and why harry opened his eyes by a millimeter 
 
 voldemort seemed to be getting to his feet various death eaters were hurrying away from him returning to the crowd lining the clearing bellatrix alone remained behind kneeling beside voldemort 
 
 harry closed his eyes again and considered what he had seen the death eaters have been buddled around voldemort who seem to have fallen to the ground something had happened when he had hit harry with the killing curse had voldemort too collapsed it seemed like it and both of them had briefly fallen unconscious and both of them had now returned 
 
 my lord let me c 
 
 i do not require assistance said voldemort coldly and though he could not see it harry pictured bellatrix withdrawing a helpful hand the boy is he dead 
 
 there was a complete silence in the clearing nobody approached harry but he felt their concentrated gaze it seemed to press him harder into the ground and he was terrified a finger or an eyelid might twitch 
 
 you said voldemort and there was a bang and a small shriek of pain examine him tell me whether he is dead 
 
 harry did not know who had been sent to verify he could only lie there with his heart thumping traitorously and wait to be examined but at the same time nothing small comfort through it was that voldemort was wary of approaching him that voldemort suspected that all had not gone to plan 
 
 hands softer than he had been expecting touched harrys face and felt his heart he could hear the womans fast breathing her pounding of life against his ribs 
 
 is draco alive is he in the castle 
 
 the whisper was barely audible her lips were an inch from his ear her head bent so low that her long hair shielded his face from the onlookers 
 
 yes he breathed back 
 
 he felt the hand on his chest contract her nails pierced him then it was withdrawn she had sat up 
 
 he is dead narcissa malfoy called to the watchers 
 
 and now they shouted now they yelled in triumph and stamped their feet and through his eyelids harry saw bursts of red and silver light shoot into the air in celebration 
 
 still feigning death on the ground he understood narcissa knew that the only way she would be permitted to enter hogwarts and find her son was as part of the conquering army she no longer cared whether voldemort won 
 
 you see screeched voldemort over the tumult harry potter is dead by my hand and no man alive can threaten me now watch crucio 
 
 harry had been expecting it knew his body would not be allowed to remain unsullied upon the forest floor it must be subjected to humiliation to prove voldemorts victory he was lifted into the air and it took all his determination to remain limp yet the pain he expected did not come he was thrown once twice three times into the air his glasses flew off and he felt his wand slide a little beneath his robes but he kept himself floppy and lifeless and when he fell to ground for the last time the clearing echoed with jeers and shrieks of laughter 
 
 now said voldemort we go to the castle and show them what has become of their hero who shall drag the body no c wait c 
 
 there was a fresh outbreak of laughter and after a few moments harry felt the ground trembling beneath him 
 
 you carry him voldemort said he will be nice and visible in your arms will he not pick up your little friend hagrid and the glasses c put on the glasses c he must be recognizable c 
 
 someone slammed harrys glasses back onto his face with deliberate force but the enormous hands that lifted him into the air were exceedingly gentle harry could feel hagrids arms trembling with the force of his heaving sobs great tears splashed down upon him as hagrid cradled harry in his arms and harry did not dare by movement or word to intimate to hagrid that all was not yet lost 
 
 move said voldemort and hagrid stumbled forward forcing his way through the trees back through the forest 
 
 branches caught at harrys hair and robes but he lay quiescent his mouth lolling open his eyes shut and in the darkness while the death eaters coed all around them and while hagrid sobbed blindly nobody looked to see whether a pulse beat in the exposed neck of harry potter 
 
 the two giants crashed along behind the death eaters harry could hear trees creaking and falling as they passed they made so much din that birds toes shrieking into the sky and even the jeers of the death eaters were drowned the victorious procession marched on toward the open ground and after a while harry could tell by the lightening of the darkness through his closed eyelids that the trees were beginning to thin 
 
 bane 
 
 hagrids unexpected bellow nearly forced harrys eyes open happy now are yeh that yeh didnt fight yeh cowardly bunch o nags are yeh happy harry potters c 
 
 hagrid could not continue but broke down in fresh tears harry wondered how many centaurs were watching their procession pass he dared not open his eyes to look some of the death eaters called insults at the centaurs as they left them behind a little later harry sensed by a freshening of the air that they had reached the edge of the forest 
 
 stop 
 
 harry thought that hagrid must have been forced to obey voldemorts command because he lurched a little and now a chill settled over them where they stood and harry heard the rasping breath of the dementors that patrolled the other trees they would not affect him now 
 
 the fact of his own survival burned inside him a talisman against them as though his fathers stag kept guardian in his heart 
 
 someone passed close by harry and he knew that it was voldemort himself because he spoke a moment later his voice magically magnified so that it swelled through the ground crashing upon harrys eardrums 
 
 harry potter is dead he was killed as he ran away trying to save himself while you lay down your lives for him we bring you his body as proof that your hero is gone 
 
 the battle is won you have lost half of your fighters my death eaters outnumber you and the boy who lived is finished there must be no more war anyone who continues to resist man woman or child will be slaughtered as will every member of their family come out of the castle now kneel before me and you shall be spared your parents and children your brothers and sisters will live and be forgiven and you will join me in the new world we shall build together 
 
 there was silence in the grounds and from the castle voldemort was so close to him that harry did not dare open his eyes again 
 
 come said voldemort and harry heard him move ahead and hagrid was forced to follow now harry opened his eyes a fraction and saw voldemort striding in front them wearing the great snake nagini around his shoulders now free of her enchanted cage but harry had no possibility of extracting the wand concealed under his robes without being noticed by the death eaters who marched on the either side of them through the slowly lightening darkness 
 
 harry sobbed hagrid oh harry harry 
 
 harry shut his eyes tight again he knew that they were approaching the castle and strained his ears to distinguish above the gleeful voices of the death eaters and their tramping footsteps signs of life from those within 
 
 stop 
 
 the death eaters came to a halt harry heard them spreading out in a line facing the open front doors of the school he could see even though his closed lids the reddish glow that meant light streamed upon him from the entrance hall he waited any moment the people for whom he had tried to die would see him lying apparently dead in hagrids arms 
 
 no 
 
 the scream was the more terrible because he had never expected or dreamed that professor mcgonagall could make such a sound he heard another women laughing nearby and knew that bellatrix gloried in mcgonagalls despair he squinted again for a single second and saw the open doorway filling with people as the survivors of the battle came out onto the front steps to face their vanquishers and see the truth of harrys death for themselves he saw voldemort standing a little in front of him stroking naginis head with a single white finger he closed his eyes again 
 
 no 
 
 no 
 
 harry harry 
 
 rons hermiones and ginnys voices were worse than mcgonagalls harry wanted nothing more than to call back yet he made himself lie silent and their cries acted like a trigger the crowd of survivors took up the cause screaming and yelling abuse at the death eathers until silence cried voldemort and there was a bang and a flash of bright light and silence was forced upon them all it is over set him down hagrid at my feet where he belongs 
 
 harry felt himself lowered onto the grass 
 
 you see said voldemort and harry felt him striding backward and forward right beside the place where he lay harry potter is dead do you understand now deluded ones he was nothing ever but a boy who relied on others to sacrifice themselves for him 
 
 he beat you yelled ron and the charm broke and the defenders of hogwarts were shouting and screaming again until a second more powerful bang extinguished their voices once more 
 
 he was killed while trying to sneak out of the castle grounds said voldemort and there was a relish in his voice for the lie killed while trying to save himself c 
 
 but voldemort broke off harry heard a scuffle and a shout then another bang a flash of light and grunt of pain he opened his eyes an infinitesimal amount someone had broken free of the crowd and charged at voldemort harry saw the figure hit the ground disarmed voldemort throwing the challengers wand aside and laughing 
 
 and who is this he said in his soft snakes hiss who has volunteered to demonstrate what happens to those who continue to fight when the battle is lost 
 
 bellatrix gave a delighted laugh 
 
 it is neville longbottom my lord the boy who has been giving the carrows so much trouble the son of the aurors remember 
 
 ah yes i remember said voldemort looking down at neville who was struggling back to his feet unarmed and unprotected standing in the between the survivors and the death eaters but you are a pureblood arent you my brave boy voldemort asked neville who stood facing him his empty hands curled in fists 
 
 so what if i am said neville loudly 
 
 you show spirit and bravery and you come of noble stock you will make a very valuable death eater we need your kind neville longbottom 
 
 ill join you when hell freezes over said neville dumbledores army he shouted and there was an answering cheer from the crowd whom voldemorts silencing charms seemed unable to hold 
 
 very well said voldemort and harry heard more danger in the silkiness of his voice than in the most powerful curse if that is your choice longbottom we revert to the original plan on your head he said quietly be it 
 
 still watching through his lashes harry saw voldemort wave his wand seconds later out of one of the castles shattered windows something that looked like a misshapen bird flew through the half light and landed in voldemorts hand he shook the mildewed object by its pointed end and it dangled empty and ragged the sorting hat 
 
 there will be no more sorting at hogwarts school said voldemort there will be no more houses the emblem shield and colors of my noble ancestor salazar slythering will suffice everyone wont they neville longbottom 
 
 he pointed his wand at neville who grew rigid and still then forced the hat onto nevilles head so that it slipped down below his eyes there were movements from the watching crowd in front of the castle and as one the death eaters raised their wands holding the fighters of hogwarts at bay 
 
 neville here is now going to demonstrate what happens to anyone foolish enough to continue to oppose me said voldemort and with a flick of his wand he caused the sorting hat to burst into flames 
 
 screams split the dawn and neville was a flame rooted to the spot unable to move and harry could not bear it he must act and then many things happened at the same moment 
 
 they heard uproar from the distant boundary of the school as what sounded like hundreds of people came swarming over the walls and pelted toward the castle uttering loud war cries at the same time grawp came lumbering around the side of the castle and yelled hagger his cry was answered by roars from voldemorts giants they ran at grawp like bull elephants making the earth quake then came hooves and the twangs of bows and arrows were suddenly falling amongst the death eaters who broke ranks shouting their surprise harry pulled the invisibility cloak from inside his robes swung it over himself and sprang to his feet as neville moved too 
 
 in one swift fluid motion neville broke free of the curse upon him the flaming hat fell off him and he drew from its depths something silver with a glittering rubied handle the slash of the silver blade could not be heard over the roar of the oncoming crowd or the sounds of the clashing giants or of the stampeding centaurs and yet it seemed to draw every eye with a single stroke neville sliced off the great snakes head which spun high into the air gleaming in the light flooding from the entrance hall and voldemorts mouth was open in a scream of fury that nobody could hear and the snakes body thudded to the ground at his feet c 
 
 hidden beneath the invisibility cloak harry cast a shield charm between neville and voldemort before the latter could raise his stamps of the battling giants hagrids yell came loudest of all 
 
 harry hagrid shouted harry c wheres harry chaos reigned the charging centaurs were scattering the death eaters everyone was feeling the giants stamping feet and nearer and nearer thundered the reinforcements that had come from who knew where harry saw great winged creatures soaring the heads of voldemorts giants thestrals and buckbeak the hippogriff scratching at their eyes while grawp punched and pummeled them and now the wizards defenders of hogwarts and death eaters alike were being forced back into the castle harry was shooting jinxes and curses at any death eater he could see and they crumpled not knowing what or who had hit them and their bodies were trampled by the retreating crowd still hidden beneath the invisibility cloak harry was buffered into the entrance hall he was searching for voldemort and saw him across the room firing spells from his wand as he backed into the great hall still screaming instructions to his followers as he sent curses flying left and right harry cast more shield charms and voldemorts victims seamus finnigan and hannah abbott darted past him into the great hall where they joined the fight already flourishing inside it 
 
 and now there were more even more people storming up the front steps and harry saw charlie weasley overtaking horace slughorn who was still wearing his emerald pajamas they seemed to have returned at the head of what looked like the families and friends of every hogwarts student who had remained to fight along with the shopkeeps and homeowners of hogsmeade the centaurs bane ronan and magorian burst into the hall with a great clatter of hooves as behind harry the door that led to the kitchens was blasted off its hinges 
 
 the of hogwarts swarmed into the entrance hall screaming and waving carving knives and cleaver and at their head the locker of regulus black bouncing on his chest was kreacher his bullfrogs voice audible even above this din fight fight fight for my master defender of fight the dark lord in the name of brave regulus fight 
 
 they were hacking and stabbing at the ankles and shim of death eaters their tiny faces alive with malice and everywhere harry looked death eaters were folding under sheer weight of numbers overcome by spells dragging arrows from wounds stabbed in the leg by elves or else simply attempting to escape but swallowed by the oncoming horde 
 
 but it was not over yet harry sped between duelers past a struggling prisoners and into he great hall 
 
 voldemort was in the center of the battle and he was striking and smiting al within reach harry could not get a clear shot but fought his way nearer still invisible and the great hall became more and more crowded as everyone who could walk forced their way inside 
 
 harry saw yaxley slammed to the floor by george and lee jordan saw dolohov fall with a scream at flitwicks hands saw walden macnair thrown across the room by hagrid hit the stone wall opposite and slide unconscious to the ground he saw ron and neville bringing down fenrir greyback aberforth stunning rookwood arthur and percy flooting thicknesse and lucius and narcissa malfoy running through the crowd not even attempting to fight screaming for their son 
 
 voldemort was now dueling mcgonagall slughorn kingsley all at once and there was a cold hatred in his face as they wove and ducked around him unable to finish him bellatrix was still fighting too fifty yards away from voldemort and like her master she dueled three at once hermione ginny and luna all battling their hardest but bellatrix was equal to them and harrys attention was diverted as a killing curse shot so close to ginny that she missed death by an inch 
 
 he changed course running at bellatrix rather than voldemort but before he had gone a few steps he was knocked sideways 
 
 not my daughter you bitch 
 
 mrs weasley threw off her cloak as she ran freeing her arms bellatrix spun on the spot roaring with laughter at the sight of the new challenger 
 
 out of my way shouted mrs weasley to the three girls and with a simple swipe of her wand she began to duel harry watched with terror and elation as molly weasleys wand slashed and twisted and bellatrix lestranges smile faltered and became a snarl jets of light flew from both wands the floor around the witches feet became hot and cracked both woman were fighting to kill 
 
 no mrs weasley cried as a few students ran forward trying to come to her aid get back get back she is mine 
 
 hundreds of people now lined the walls watching the two fights voldemort and his three opponents bellatrix and molly and harry stood invisible torn between both wanting to attack and yet to protect unable to be sure that he would not hit the innocent 
 
 what will happen to your children when ive killed you taunted bellatrix as mad as her master capering as mollys curses danced around her when mummys gone the same way as freddie 
 
 you c will c never c touch c our c children c again screamed mrs weasley 
 
 bellatrix laughed the same exhilarated laugh her cousin sirius had given as he toppled backward through the veil and suddenly harry knew what was going to happen before it did 
 
 mollys curse soared beneath bellatrixs constricted arm and hit her squarely in the chest directly over her heart 
 
 bellatrixs gloating smile froze her eyes seemed to bulge for the tiniest space of time she knew what had happened and then she toppled and the watching crowd roared and voldemord screamed 
 
 harry felt as though he turned into slow motion he saw mcgonagall kingsley and slughorn blasted backward flailing and writhing through the air as voldemorts fury at the fall of his last best lieutenant exploded with the force of a bomb voldemort raised his wand and directed it at molly weasley 
 
 protego roared harry and the shield charm expanded in the middle of the hall and voldemort stared around for the source as harry pulled off the invisibility cloak at last 
 
 the yell of shock the cheers the screams on every side of harry 
 
 hes alive were stifled at once the crowd was afraid and silence fell abruptly and completely as voldemort and harry looked at each other and began at the same moment to circle each other 
 
 i dont want anyone else to help harry said loudly and in the total silence his voice carried like a trumpet call its got to be like this its got to be me 
 
 voldemort hissed 
 
 potter doesnt mean that he said his red eyes wide this isnt how he works is it who are you going to use as a shield today potter 
 
 nobody said harry simply there are no more horcruxes its just you and me neither can live while the other survives and one of us is about to leave for good 
 
 one of us jeered voldemort and his whole body was taut and his red eyes stared a snake that was about to strike you think it will be you do you the boy who has survived by accident and because dumbledore was pulling the strings 
 
 accident was it when my mother died to save me asked harry they were still moving sideways both of them in that perfect circle maintaining the same distance from each other and for harry no face existed but voldemorts accident when i decided to fight in that graveyard accident that i didnt defend myself tonight and still survived and returned to fight again 
 
 accidents screamed voldemort but still he did not strike and the watching crowd was frozen as if petrified and of the hundreds in the hall nobody seemed to breathe but they two accident and chance and the fact that you crouched and sniveled behind the skirts of greater men and women and permitted me to kill them for you 
 
 you wont be killing anyone else tonight said harry as they circled and stared into each others eyes green into red you wont be able to kill any of them ever again dont you get it i was ready to die to stop you from hurting these people c 
 
 but you did not 
 
 c i meant to and thats what did it ive done what my mother did theyre protected from you havent you noticed how none of the spells you put on them are binding you cant torture them you cant touch them you dont learn from your mistakes riddle do you 
 
 you dare c 
 
 yes i dare said harry i know things you dont know tom riddle i know lots of important things that you dont want to hear some before you make another big mistake 
 
 voldemort did not speak but prowled in a circle and harry knew that he kept him temporarily mesmerized at bay held back by the faintest possibility that harry might indeed know a final secret 
 
 is it love again said voldemort his snakes face jeering dumbledore favorite solution love which he claimed conquered death though love did not stop him falling from the tower and breaking like and old waxwork love which did not prevent me stamping out your muddblood mother like a cockroach potter c and nobody seems to love you enough to run forward this time and take my curse so what will stop you dying now when i strike 
 
 just one thing said harry and still they circled each other wrapped in each other held apart by nothing but the last secret 
 
 if it is not love that will save you this time said voldemort you must believe that you have magic that i do not or else a weapon more powerful than mine 
 
 i believe both said harry and he saw shock flit across the snakelike face though it was instantly dispelled voldemort began to laugh and the sound was more frightening than his screams humorless and insane it echoed around the silent hall 
 
 you think you know more magic than i do he said than i than lord voldemort who has performed magic that dumbledore himself never dreamed of 
 
 oh he dreamed of it said harry but he knew more than you knew enough not to do what youve done 
 
 you mean he was weak screamed voldemort too weak to dare too weak to take what might have been his what will be mine 
 
 no he was cleverer than you said harry a better wizard a better man 
 
 i brought about the death of albus dumbledore 
 
 you thought you did said harry but you were wrong 
 
 for the first time the watching crowd stirred as the hundreds of people around the walls drew breath as one 
 
 dumbledore is dead voldemort hurled the words at harry as in the marble tomb in the grounds of this castle i have seen it potter and he will not return 
 
 yes dumbledore is dead said harry calmly but you didnt have him killed he chose his own manner of dying chose it months before he died arranged the whole thing with the man you thought was your servant 
 
 what childish dream is this said voldemort but still he did not strike and his red eyes did not waver from harrys 
 
 severus snape wasnt yours said harry snape was dumbledores dumbledores from the moment you starting hunting down my mother and you never realized it because of the thing you cant understand you never saw snape cast a patronus did you riddle 
 
 voldemort did not answer they continued to circle each other like wolves about to tear each other apart 
 
 snapes patronus was a doe said harry the same as my mothers because he loved her for nearly all of his life from the time when they were children you should have realized he said as he saw voldemorts nostrils flare he asked you to spare her life didnt he 
 
 he desired her that was all sneered voldemort but when she had gone he agreed that there were other women and of purer blood worthier of him c 
 
 of course he told you that said harry but he was dumbledores spy from the moment you threatened her and hes been working against you ever since dumbledore was already dying when snape finished him 
 
 it matters not shrieked voldemort who had followed every word with rapt attention but now let out a cackle of mad laughter it matters not whether snape was mine or dumbledores or what petty obstacles they tried to put in my path i crushed them as i crushed your mother snapes supposed great love oh but it all makes sense potter and in ways that you do not understand 
 
 dumbledore was trying to keep the elder wand from me he intended that snape should be the true master of the wand but i got there ahead of you little boy c i reached the wand before you could get your hands on it i understood the truth before you caught up i killed severus snape three hours ago and the elder wand the deathstick the wand of destiny is truly mine dumbledores last plan went wrong harry potter 
 
 yeah it did said harry youre right but before you try to kill me id advise you think what youve done think and try for some remorse riddle 
 
 what is this 
 
 of all the things that harry had said to him beyond any revelation or taunt nothing had socked voldemort like this harry saw is pupils contract to thin slits saw the skin around his eyes whiten 
 
 its your one last chance said harry its all youve got left ive seen what youll be otherwise be a man try 
 
 try for some remorse 
 
 you dare c said voldemort again 
 
 yes i dare said harry because dumbledores last plan hasnt backfired on me at all its backfired on you riddle 
 
 voldemorts hand was trembling on the elder wand and harry gripped dracos very tightly the moment he knew was seconds away 
 
 that wand still isnt working properly for you because you murdered the wrong person severus snape was never the true master of the elder wand he never defeated dumbledore 
 
 he killed c 
 
 arent you listening snape never beat dumbledore dumbledores death was planned between them dumbledore intended to die undefeated the wands last true master if all had gone as planned the wands power would have died with him because it had never been won from him 
 
 but then potter dumbledore as good as gave me the wand voldemorts voice shook with malicious pleasure i stole the wand from its last masters tomb i removed it against the last masters wishes its power is mine 
 
 you still dont get it riddle do you possessing the wand isnt enough holding it using it doesnt make it really yours didnt you listen to ollivander the wand chooses the wizard the elder wand recognized a new master before dumbledore died someone who never even laid a hand on it the new master removed the wand from dumbledore against his will never realizing exactly what he had done or that the worlds most dangerous wand had given him its allegiance 
 
 voldemorts chest rose and fell rapidly and harry could feel the curse coming feel it building inside the wand pointed at his face 
 
 the true master of the elder wand was draco malfoy 
 
 blank shock showed in voldemorts face for a moment but then it was gone 
 
 but what does it matter he said softly even if you are right potter it makes no difference to you and me you no longer have the phoenix wand we duel on skill alone and after i have killed you i can attend to draco malfoy 
 
 but youre too late said harry youve missed your chance i got there first i overpowered draco weeks ago i took his wand from him 
 
 harry twitched the hawthorn wand and he felt the eyes of everyone in the hall upon it 
 
 so it all comes down to this doesnt it whispered harry does the wand in your hand know its last master was disarmed because if it does i am the true master of the elder wand 
 
 a burst suddenly across the enchanted sky above them as an edge of dazzling sun appeared over the sill of the nearest window the light hit both of their faces at the same time so that voldemorts was suddenly a flaming blur harry heard the high voice shriek as he too yelled his best hope to the heavens pointing dracos wand 
 
 avada kedavra 
 
 expelliarmus 
 
 the bang was like a cannon blast and the golden flames that erupted between them at the dead center of the circle they had been treading marked the point where the spells collided harry saw voldemorts green jet meet his own spell saw the elder wand fly high dark against the sunrise spinning across the enchanted ceiling like the head of nagini spinning through the air toward the master it would not kill who had come to take full possession of it at last and harry with the unerring skill of the seeker caught the wand in his free hand as voldemort fell backward arms splayed the slit pupils of the scarlet eyes rolling upward tom riddle hit the floor with a mundane finality his body feeble and shrunken the white hands empty the snakelike face vacant and unknowing voldemort was dead killed by his own rebounding curse and harry stood with two wands in his hand staring down at his enemys shell 
 
 one shivering second of silence the shock of the moment suspended and then the tumult broke around harry as the screams and the cheers and the roars of the watchers rent the air the fierce new sun dazzled the windows as they thundered toward him and the first to reach him were ron and hermione and it was their arms that were wrapped around him their incomprehensible shouts that deafened him then ginny neville and luna were there and then all the weasleys and hagrid and kingsley and mcgonagall and flitwick and sprout and harry could not hear a word that anyone was shouting not tell whose hands were seizing him pulling him trying to hug some part of him hundreds of them pressing in all of them determined to touch the boy who lived the reason it was over at last c the sun rose steadily over hogwarts and the great hall blazed with life and light harry was an indispensable part of the mingled outpourings of jubilation and mourning of grief and celebration they wanted him there with them their leader and symbol their savior and their guide and that he had not slept that he craved the company of only a few of them seemed to occur to no one he must speak to the bereaved clasp their hands witness their tears receive their thanks hear the news now creeping in from every quarter as the morning drew on that the imperiused up and down the country had come back to themselves that death eaters were fleeing or else being captured that the innocent of azkaban were being released at that very moment and that kingsley shacklebolt had been named temporary minister of magic 
 
 they moved voldemorts body and laid it in a chamber off the hall away form the bodies of fred tonks lupin colin creevey and fifty others who had died fighting him mcgonagall had replaced the house tables but nobody was sitting according to house anymore all were jumbled together teachers and pupils ghosts and parents centaurs and and firenze lay recovering in the corner and grawp peered in through a smashed window and people were throwing food into his laughing mouth after a while exhausted and drained harry found himself sitting on a bench beside luna 
 
 id want some peace and quiet if it were me she said 
 
 id love some he replied 
 
 ill distract them all she said use your cloak 
 
 and before he could say a word she had cried oooh look a blibbering humdinger and pointed out the window everyone who heard looked around and harry slid the cloak up over himself and got to his feet 
 
 now he could move through the hall without interference he spotted ginny two tables away she was sitting with her head on her mothers shoulder there would be time to talk later hours and days and maybe years in which to talk he saw neville the sword of gryffindor lying beside his plate as he ate surrounded by a knot of fervent admirers along the aisle between the tables he walked and he spotted the three malfoys huddled together as though unsure whether or not they were supposed to be there but nobody was paying them any attention everywhere he looked he saw families reunited and finally he saw the two whose company he craved most 
 
 its me he muttered crouching down between them will you come with me 
 
 they stood up at once and together he ron and hermione left the great hall great chunks were missing from the marble staircase part of the balustrade gone and rubble and bloodstains occurred ever few steps as their climbed 
 
 somewhere in the distance they could hear peeves zooming through the corridors singing a victory song of his own composition 
 
 
 
 
 we did it we bashed them wee potters the one 
 
 and voldys gone moldy so now lets have fun 
 
 
 
 
 really gives a feeling for the scope and tragedy of the thing doesnt it said ron pushing open a door to let harry and hermione through 
 
 happiness would come harry though but at the moment it was muffled by exhaustion and the pain of losing fred and lupin and tonks pierced him like a physical wound every few steps most of all he felt the most stupendous relief and a longing to sleep but first he owed an explanation to ron and hermione who had stuck with him for so long and who deserved the truth 
 
 painstakingly he recounted what he had seem in the pensieve and what had happened in the forest and they had not even begun to express all their shock and amazement when at last they arrived at the place to which they had been walking though none of them had mentioned their destination 
 
 since he had last seen it the gargoyle guarding the entrance to the headmasters study had been knocked aside it stood lopsided looking a little and harry wondered whether it would be able to distinguish passwords anymore 
 
 can we go up he asked the gargoyle 
 
 feel free groaned the statue 
 
 they clambered over him and onto the spiral stone staircase that moved slowly upward like an escalator harry pushed open the door at the top 
 
 he had one brief glimpse of the stone pensieve on the desk where he had left it and then an earsplitting noise made him cry out thinking of curses and returning death eaters and the rebirth of voldemort c 
 
 but it was applause all around the walls the headmasters and headmistresses of hogwarts were giving him a standing ovation they waved their hats and in some cases their wigs they reached through their frames to grip each others hands they danced up and down on their chairs in which they have been painted dilys derwent sobbed unashamedly dexter fortescue was waving his and phineas niggelus called in his high reedy voice and let it be noted that slytherin house played its part let our contribution not be forgotten 
 
 but harry had eyes only for the man who stood in the largest portrait directly behind the headmasters chair tears were sliding down from behind the spectacles into the long silver beard and the pride and the gratitude emanating from him filled harry with the same balm as phoenix song 
 
 at last harry held up his hands and the portraits fell respectfully silent beaming and mopping their eyes and waiting eagerly for him to speak he directed his words at dumbledore however and chose them with enormous care exhausted and though he was he must make one last effort seeking one last piece of advice 
 
 the thing that was hidden in the snitch he began i dropped it in the forest i dont know exactly where but im not going to go looking for it again do you agree 
 
 my dear boy i do said dumbledore while his fellow pictures looked confused and curious a wise and courageous decision but no less than i would have expected of you does anyone know else know where it fell 
 
 no one said harry and dumbledore nodded his satisfaction 
 
 im going to keep ignotuss present though said harry and dumbledore beamed 
 
 but of course harry it is yours forever until you pass it on 
 
 and then theres this 
 
 harry held up the elder wand and ron and hermione looked at it with a reverence that even in his befuddled and state harry did not like to see 
 
 i dont want it said harry 
 
 what said ron loudly are you mental 
 
 i know its powerful said harry wearily but i was happier with mine so 
 
 he rummaged in the pouch hung around his neck and pulled out the two halves of holly still just connected by the finest threat of phoenix feather hermione had said that they could not be repaired that the damage was too severe all he knew was that if this did not work nothing would 
 
 he laid the broken wand upon the headmasters desk touched it with the very tip of the elder wand and said reparo 
 
 as his wand resealed red sparks flew out of its end harry knew that he had succeeded he picked up the holly and phoenix wand and felt a sudden warmth in his fingers as though wand and hand were rejoicing at their reunion 
 
 im putting the elder wand he told dumbledore who was watching him with enormous affection and admiration back where it came from it can stay there if i die a natural death like ignotus its power will be broken wont it the previous master will never have been defeated thatll be the end of it 
 
 dumbledore nodded they smiled at each other 
 
 are you sure said ron there was the faintest trace of longing in his voice as he looked at the elder wand 
 
 i think harrys right said hermione quietly 
 
 that wands more trouble than its worth said harry and quite honestly he turned away from the painted portraits thinking now only of the bed lying waiting for him in gryffindor tower and wondering whether kreacher might bring him a sandwich there ive had enough trouble for a lifetime

 fairy tales of hans christian andersen 
 the buckwheat 
 by hans christian andersen 
 
 very often after a violent a field of buckwheat 
 appears blackened and singed as if a flame of fire had passed over 
 it the country people say that this appearance is caused by 
 lightning but i will tell you what the sparrow says and the 
 sparrow heard it from an old which grew near a field of 
 buckwheat and is there still it is a large venerable tree though 
 a little crippled by age the trunk has been split and out of the 
 crevice grass and brambles grow the tree bends slightly and the branches hang quite down to the ground just like green hair 
 corn grows in the surrounding fields not only rye and barley but 
 oats that when ripe look like a number of little golden 
 sitting on a bough the corn has a smiling look and the 
 heaviest and richest ears bend their heads low as if in pious 
 humility once there was also a field of buckwheat and this field was 
 exactly opposite to old the buckwheat did not bend like 
 the other grain but erected its head proudly and stiffly on the stem 
 i am as valuable as any other corn said he and i am much 
 handsomer my flowers are as beautiful as the bloom of the apple 
 blossom and it is a pleasure to look at us do you know of anything 
 prettier than we are you old 
 
 and the nodded his head as if he would say indeed i 
 do 
 
 but the buckwheat spread itself out with pride and said 
 stupid tree he is so old that grass grows out of his body 
 there arose a very terrible storm all the folded 
 their leaves together or bowed their little heads while the storm 
 passed over them but the buckwheat stood erect in its pride bend 
 your head as we do said the flowers 
 
 i have no occasion to do so replied the buckwheat 
 
 bend your head as we do cried the ears of corn the angel of 
 the storm is coming his wings spread from the sky above to the 
 earth beneath he will strike you down before you can cry for mercy 
 
 but i will not bend my head said the buckwheat 
 
 close your flowers and bend your leaves said the old 
 do not look at the lightning when the cloud bursts even 
 men cannot do that in a flash of lightning heaven opens and we can 
 look in but the sight will strike even human beings blind what 
 then must happen to us who only grow out of the earth and are so 
 inferior to them if we venture to do so 
 
 inferior indeed said the buckwheat now i intend to have a 
 peep into heaven proudly and boldly he looked up while the 
 lightning flashed across the sky as if the whole world were in flames 
 
 when the dreadful storm had passed the flowers and the corn 
 raised their drooping heads in the pure still air refreshed by the 
 rain but the buckwheat lay like a weed in the field burnt to 
 blackness by the lightning the branches of the old 
 rustled in the wind and large fell from his green leaves 
 as if the old willow were weeping then the sparrows asked why he was weeping when all around him seemed so cheerful see they said how the sun shines and the clouds float in the blue sky do you not smell the sweet perfume from flower and bush wherefore do you weep old then the willow told them of the haughty pride of the buckwheat and of the punishment which followed in consequence 
 
 this is the story told me by the sparrows one evening when i 
 begged them to relate some tale to me

 lightning but i will tell you what the sparrow says and the 
 sparrow heard it from an old which grew near a field of 
 buckwheat and is there still it is a large venerable tree though 
 a little crippled by age the trunk has been split and out of the 
 crevice grass and brambles grow the tree bends slightly and the branches hang quite down to the ground just like green hair 
 corn grows in the surrounding fields not only rye and barley but 
 oats that when ripe look like a number of little golden 
 sitting on a bough the corn has a smiling look and the 
 heaviest and richest ears bend their heads low as if in pious 
 humility once there was also a field of buckwheat and this field was 
 exactly opposite to old the buckwheat did not bend like 
 the other grain but erected its head proudly and stiffly on the stem 
 i am as valuable as any other corn said he and i am much 
 handsomer my flowers are as beautiful as the bloom of the apple 
 blossom and it is a pleasure to look at us do you know of anything 
 prettier than we are you old 
 
 and the nodded his head as if he would say indeed i 
 do 
 
 but the buckwheat spread itself out with pride and said 
 stupid tree he is so old that grass grows out of his body 
 there arose a very terrible storm all the folded 
 their leaves together or bowed their little heads while the storm 
 passed over them but the buckwheat stood erect in its pride bend 
 your head as we do said the flowers 
 
 i have no occasion to do so replied the buckwheat 
 
 bend your head as we do cried the ears of corn the angel of 
 the storm is coming his wings spread from the sky above to the 
 earth beneath he will strike you down before you can cry for mercy 
 
 but i will not bend my head said the buckwheat 
 
 close your flowers and bend your leaves said the old 
 do not look at the lightning when the cloud bursts even 
 men cannot do that in a flash of lightning heaven opens and we can 
 look in but the sight will strike even human beings blind what 
 then must happen to us who only grow out of the earth and are so 
 inferior to them if we venture to do so 
 
 inferior indeed said the buckwheat now i intend to have a 
 peep into heaven proudly and boldly he looked up while the 
 lightning flashed across the sky as if the whole world were in flames 
 
 when the dreadful storm had passed the flowers and the corn 
 raised their drooping heads in the pure still air refreshed by the 
 rain but the buckwheat lay like a weed in the field burnt to 
 blackness by the lightning the branches of the old 
 rustled in the wind and large fell from his green leaves 
 as if the old willow were weeping then the sparrows asked why he was weeping when all around him seemed so cheerful see they said how the sun shines and the clouds float in the blue sky do you not smell the sweet perfume from flower and bush wherefore do you weep old then the willow told them of the haughty pride of the buckwheat and of the punishment which followed in consequence 
 
 this is the story told me by the sparrows one evening when i 
 begged them to relate some tale to me

the ballot or the bullet 
 malcolm x 
 delivered april in cleveland oh 
 mr moderator brother lomax brothers and sisters friends and enemies i just believe everyone in here is a friend and i want to leave anybody out the question tonight as i understand it is the negro revolt and where do we go from here or what next in my little humble way of understanding it it points toward either the ballot or the bullet 
 before we try and explain what is meant by the ballot or the bullet i would like to clarify something concerning myself still a muslim my religion is still islam my personal belief just as adam clayton powell is a christian minister who heads the abyssinian baptist church in new york but at the same time takes part in the political struggles to try and bring about rights to the black people in this country and dr martin luther king is a christian minister down in atlanta georgia who heads another organization fighting for the civil rights of black people in this country and reverend galamison i guess heard of him is another christian minister in new york who has been deeply involved in the school boycotts to eliminate segregated education well i myself am a minister not a christian minister but a muslim minister and i believe in action on all fronts by whatever means necessary 
 although still a muslim not here tonight to discuss my religion not here to try and change your religion not here to argue or discuss anything that we differ about because time for us to submerge our differences and realize that it is best for us to first see that we have the same problem a common problem a problem that will make you catch hell whether a baptist or a methodist or a muslim or a nationalist whether educated or illiterate whether you live on the boulevard or in the alley going to catch hell just like i am all in the same boat and we all are going to catch the same hell from the same man he just happens to be a white man all of us have suffered here in this country political oppression at the hands of the white man economic exploitation at the hands of the white man and social degradation at the hands of the white man 
 now in speaking like this it mean that but it does mean and if the white man want us to be let him stop oppressing and exploiting and degrading us whether we are christians or muslims or nationalists or agnostics or atheists we must first learn to forget our differences if we have differences let us differ in the closet when we come out in front let us not have anything to argue about until we get finished arguing with the man if the late president kennedy could get together with khrushchev and exchange some wheat we certainly have more in common with each other than kennedy and khrushchev had with each other 
 if we do something real soon i think have to agree that going to be forced either to use the ballot or the bullet one or the other in it that time is running out time has run out 
 threatens to be the most explosive year america has ever witnessed the most explosive year why also a political year the year when all of the white politicians will be back in the negro community jiving you and me for some votes the year when all of the white political crooks will be right back in your and my community with their false promises building up our hopes for a letdown with their trickery and their treachery with their false promises which they intend to keep as they nourish these dissatisfactions it can only lead to one thing an explosion and now we have the type of black man on the scene in america today sorry brother lomax who just intend to turn the other cheek any longer 
 let anybody tell you anything about the odds are against you if they draft you they send you to korea and make you face million chinese if you can be brave over there you can be brave right here these odds as great as those odds and if you fight here you will at least know what fighting for 
 not a politician not even a student of politics in fact not a student of much of anything not a democrat not a republican and i even consider myself an american if you and i were americans be no problem those honkies that just got off the boat already americans polacks are already americans the italian refugees are already americans everything that came out of europe every thing is already an american and as long as you and i have been over here we americans yet 
 well i am one who believe in deluding myself not going to sit at your table and watch you eat with nothing on my plate and call myself a diner sitting at the table make you a diner unless you eat some of on that plate being here in america make you an american being born here in america make you an american why if birth made you american you need any legislation you need any amendments to the constitution you be faced with filibustering in washington right now they have to pass legislation to make a polack an american 
 no not an american one of the million black people who are the victims of americanism one of the million black people who are the victims of democracy nothing but disguised hypocrisy so not standing here speaking to you as an american or a patriot or a or a no not i speaking as a victim of this american system and i see america through the eyes of the victim i see any american dream i see an american nightmare 
 these million victims are waking up their eyes are coming open beginning to see what they used to only look at becoming politically mature they are realizing that there are new political trends from coast to coast as they see these new political trends possible for them to see that every time an election the races are so close that they have to have a recount they had to recount in massachusetts to see who was going to be governor it was so close it was the same way in rhode island in minnesota and in many other parts of the country and the same with kennedy and nixon when they ran for president it was so close they had to count all over again well what does this mean it means that when white people are evenly divided and black people have a bloc of votes of their own it is left up to them to determine going to sit in the white house and going to be in the dog house 
 lt was the black vote that put the present administration in washington your vote your dumb vote your ignorant vote your wasted vote put in an administration in washington that has seen fit to pass every kind of legislation imaginable saving you until last then filibustering on top of that and your and my leaders have the audacity to run around clapping their hands and talk about how much progress making and what a good president we have if he good in texas he sure be good in washington because texas is a lynch state it is in the same breath as mississippi no different only they lynch you in texas with a texas accent and lynch you in mississippi with a mississippi accent and these negro leaders have the audacity to go and have some coffee in the white house with a texan a southern cracker all he is and then come out and tell you and me that going to be better for us because since from the south he knows how to deal with the southerners what kind of logic is that let eastland be president from the south too he should be better able to deal with them than johnson 
 in this present administration they have in the house of representatives democrats to only republicans they control of the house vote why they pass something that will help you and me in the senate there are senators who are of the democratic party only of them are republicans why the democrats have got the government sewed up and the one who sewed it up for them and what have they given you for it four years in office and just now getting around to some legislation just now after everything else is gone out of the way going to sit down now and play with you all summer long the same old giant con game that they call filibuster all those are in cahoots together you ever think not in cahoots together for the man that is heading the filibuster is a man from georgia named richard russell when johnson became president the first man he asked for when he got back to washington was dicky how tight they are his boy his pal his buddy but playing that old con game one of them makes believe for you and got it fixed where the other one is so tight against you he never has to keep his promise 
 so time in to wake up and when you see them coming up with that kind of conspiracy let them know your eyes are open and let them know you something else wide open too got to be the ballot or the bullet the ballot or the bullet if afraid to use an expression like that you should get on out of the country you should get back in the cotton patch you should get back in the alley they get all the negro vote and after they get it the negro gets nothing in return all they did when they got to washington was give a few big negroes big jobs those big negroes need big jobs they already had jobs camouflage trickery treachery not trying to knock out the democrats for the republicans get to them in a minute but it is true you put the democrats first and the democrats put you last 
 look at it the way it is what alibis do they use since they control congress and the senate what alibi do they use when you and i ask well when are you going to keep your promise they blame the dixiecrats what is a dixiecrat a democrat a dixiecrat is nothing but a democrat in disguise the titular head of the democrats is also the head of the dixiecrats because the dixiecrats are a part of the democratic party the democrats have never kicked the dixiecrats out of the party the dixiecrats bolted themselves once but the democrats put them out imagine these lowdown southern segregationists put the northern democrats down but the northern democrats have never put the dixiecrats down no look at that thing the way it is they have got a con game going on a political con game and you and i are in the middle time for you and me to wake up and start looking at it like it is and trying to understand it like it is and then we can deal with it like it is 
 the dixiecrats in washington control the key committees that run the government the only reason the dixiecrats control these committees is because they have seniority the only reason they have seniority is because they come from states where negroes vote this is not even a government based on democracy lt is not a government that is made up of representatives of the people half of the people in the south even vote eastland is not even supposed to be in washington half of the senators and congressmen who occupy these key positions in washington are there illegally are there unconstitutionally 
 i was in washington a week ago thursday when they were debating whether or not they should let the bill come onto the floor and in the back of the room where the senate meets a huge map of the united states and on that map it shows the location of negroes throughout the country and it shows that the southern section of the country the states that are most heavily concentrated with negroes are the ones that have senators and congressmen standing up filibustering and doing all other kinds of trickery to keep the negro from being able to vote this is pitiful but not pitiful for us any longer actually pitiful for the white man because soon now as the negro awakens a little more and sees the vise that in sees the bag that in sees the real game that in then the going to develop a new tactic 
 these senators and congressmen actually violate the constitutional amendments that guarantee the people of that particular state or county the right to vote and the constitution itself has within it the machinery to expel any representative from a state where the voting rights of the people are violated you even need new legislation any person in congress right now who is there from a state or a district where the voting rights of the people are violated that particular person should be expelled from congress and when you expel him removed one of the obstacles in the path of any real meaningful legislation in this country in fact when you expel them you need new legislation because they will be replaced by black representatives from counties and districts where the black man is in the majority not in the minority 
 if the black man in these southern states had his full voting rights the key dixiecrats in washington d c which means the key democrats in washington would lose their seats the democratic party itself would lose its power it would cease to be powerful as a party when you see the amount of power that would be lost by the democratic party if it were to lose the dixiecrat wing or branch or element you can see where against the interests of the democrats to give voting rights to negroes in states where the democrats have been in complete power and authority ever since the civil war you just belong to that party without analyzing it 
 i say again not not not just questioning their sincerity and some of the strategy that been using on our people by promising them promises that they intend to keep when you keep the democrats in power keeping the dixiecrats in power i doubt that my good brother lomax will deny that a vote for a democrat is a vote for a dixiecrat why in time now for you and me to become more politically mature and realize what the ballot is for what supposed to get when we cast a ballot and that if we cast a ballot going to end up in a situation where going to have to cast a bullet either a ballot or a bullet 
 in the north they do it a different way they have a system known as gerrymandering whatever that means it means when negroes become too heavily concentrated in a certain area and begin to gain too much political power the white man comes along and changes the district lines you may say why do you keep saying white man because the white man who does it i ever seen any negro changing any lines they let him get near the line the white man who does this and usually the white man who grins at you the most and pats you on the back and is supposed to be your friend he may be friendly but not your friend 
 so what trying to impress upon you in essence is this you and i in america are faced not with a segregationist conspiracy faced with a government conspiracy everyone filibustering is a senator the government everyone finagling in washington is a congressman the government you have anybody putting blocks in your path but people who are a part of the government the same government that you go abroad to fight for and die for is the government that is in a conspiracy to deprive you of your voting rights deprive you of your economic opportunities deprive you of decent housing deprive you of decent education you need to go to the employer alone it is the government itself the government of america that is responsible for the oppression and exploitation and degradation of black people in this country and you should drop it in their lap this government has failed the negro this democracy has failed the negro and all these white liberals have definitely failed the negro 
 so where do we go from here first we need some friends we need some new allies the entire struggle needs a new interpretation a broader interpretation we need to look at this thing from another angle from the inside as well as from the outside to those of us whose philosophy is black nationalism the only way you can get involved in the struggle is give it a new interpretation that old interpretation excluded us it kept us out so giving a new interpretation to the struggle an interpretation that will enable us to come into it take part in it and these who have been dillydallying and pussy footing and compromising we intend to let them pussyfoot and dillydally and compromise any longer 
 how can you thank a man for giving you already yours how then can you thank him for giving you only part of already yours you even made progress if being given to you you should have had already not progress and i love my brother lomax the way he pointed out right back where we were in not even as far up as we were in behind where we were in more segregation now than there was in more racial animosity more racial hatred more racial violence today in than there was in where is the progress 
 and now facing a situation where the young coming up they want to hear that turn stuff no in jacksonville those were teenagers they were throwing molotov cocktails negroes have never done that before but it shows you a new deal coming in new thinking coming in new strategy coming in be molotov cocktails this month hand grenades next month and something else next month be ballots or be bullets be liberty or it will be death the only difference about this kind of death be reciprocal you know what is meant by reciprocal one of brother words i stole it from him i usually deal with those big words because i usually deal with big people i deal with small people i find you can get a whole lot of small people and whip hell out of a whole lot of big people they got anything to lose and got every thing to gain and let you know in a minute it takes two to tango when i go you go 
 the black nationalists those whose philosophy is black nationalism in bringing about this new interpretation of the entire meaning of civil rights look upon it as meaning as brother lomax has pointed out equality of opportunity well justified in seeking civil rights if it means equality of opportunity because all doing there is trying to collect for our investment our mothers and fathers invested sweat and blood three hundred and ten years we worked in this country without a dime in return i mean without a dime in return you let the white man walk around here talking about how rich this country is but you never stop to think how it got rich so quick it got rich because you made it rich 
 you take the people who are in this audience right now poor all poor as individuals our weekly salary individually amounts to hardly anything but if you take the salary of everyone in here collectively fill up a whole lot of baskets a lot of wealth if you can collect the wages of just these people right here for a year be rich richer than rich when you look at it like that think how rich uncle sam had to become not with this handful but millions of black people your and my mother and father who work an shift but worked from see in the morning until see at night and worked for nothing making the white man rich making uncle sam rich this is our investment this is our contribution our blood 
 not only did we give of our free labor we gave of our blood every time he had a call to arms we were the first ones in uniform we died on every battlefield the white man had we have made a greater sacrifice than anybody standing up in america today we have made a greater contribution and have collected less civil rights for those of us whose philosophy is black nationalism means give it to us now wait for next year give it to us yesterday and not fast enough 
 i might stop right here to point out one thing whenever going after something that belongs to you anyone depriving you of the right to have it is a criminal understand that whenever you are going after something that is yours you are within your legal rights to lay claim to it and anyone who puts forth any effort to deprive you of that which is yours is breaking the law is a criminal and this was pointed out by the supreme court decision it outlawed segregation 
 which means segregation is against the law which means a segregationist is breaking the law a segregationist is a criminal you label him as anything other than that and when you demonstrate against segregation the law is on your side the supreme court is on your side 
 now who is it that opposes you in carrying out the law the police department itself with police dogs and clubs whenever you demonstrate against segregation whether it is segregated education segregated housing or anything else the law is on your side and anyone who stands in the way is not the law any longer they are breaking the law they are not representatives of the law any time you demonstrate against segregation and a man has the audacity to put a police dog on you kill that dog kill him telling you kill that dog i say it if they put me in jail tomorrow kill that dog then put a stop to it now if these white people in here want to see that kind of action get down and tell the mayor to tell the police department to pull the dogs in all you have to do if you do it someone else will 
 if you take this kind of stand your little children will grow up and look at you and think shame if you take an uncompromising stand i mean go out and get violent but at the same time you should never be nonviolent unless you run into some nonviolence nonviolent with those who are nonviolent with me but when you drop that violence on me then made me go insane and not responsible for what i do and the way every negro should get any time you know within the law within your legal rights within your moral rights in accord with justice then die for what you believe in but die alone let your dying be reciprocal this is what is meant by equality good for the goose is good for the gander 
 when we begin to get in this area we need new friends we need new allies we need to expand the struggle to a higher level to the level of human rights whenever you are in a struggle whether you know it or not you are confining yourself to the jurisdiction of uncle sam no one from the outside world can speak out in your behalf as long as your struggle is a struggle civil rights comes within the domestic affairs of this country all of our african brothers and our asian brothers and our brothers cannot open their mouths and interfere in the domestic affairs of the united states and as long as civil rights this comes under the jurisdiction of uncle sam 
 but the united nations has known as the charter of human rights it has a committee that deals in human rights you may wonder why all of the atrocities that have been committed in africa and in hungary and in asia and in latin america are brought before the un and the negro problem is never brought before the un this is part of the conspiracy this old tricky blue eyed liberal who is supposed to be your and my friend supposed to be in our corner supposed to be subsidizing our struggle and supposed to be acting in the capacity of an adviser never tells you anything about human rights they keep you wrapped up in civil rights and you spend so much time barking up the tree you even know a tree on the same floor 
 when you expand the struggle to the level of human rights you can then take the case of the black man in this country before the nations in the un you can take it before the general assembly you can take uncle sam before a world court but the only level you can do it on is the level of human rights civil rights keeps you under his restrictions under his jurisdiction civil rights keeps you in his pocket civil rights means asking uncle sam to treat you right human rights are something you were born with human rights are your rights human rights are the rights that are recognized by all nations of this earth and any time any one violates your human rights you can take them to the world court 
 uncle hands are dripping with blood dripping with the blood of the black man in this country the hypocrite he has the audacity yes he has imagine him posing as the leader of the free world the free world and you over here singing we shall overcome expand the struggle to the level of human rights take it into the united nations where our african brothers can throw their weight on our side where our asian brothers can throw their weight on our side where our brothers can throw their weight on our side and where million chinamen are sitting there waiting to throw their weight on our side 
 let the world know how bloody his hands are let the world know the hypocrisy practiced over here let it be the ballot or the bullet let him know that it must be the ballot or the bullet 
 when you take your case to washington taking it to the criminal responsible like running from the wolf to the fox all in cahoots together they all work political chicanery and make you look like a chump before the eyes of the world here you are walking around in america getting ready to be drafted and sent abroad like a tin soldier and when you get over there people ask you what are you fighting for and you have to stick your tongue in your cheek no take uncle sam to court take him before the world 
 by ballot i only mean freedom you know i disagree with lomax on this issue that the ballot is more important than the dollar can i prove it yes look in the un there are poor nations in the un yet those poor nations can get together with their voting power and keep the rich nations from making a move they have one nation one vote everyone has an equal vote and when those brothers from asia and africa and the darker parts of this earth get together their voting power is sufficient to hold sam in check or russia in check or some other section of the earth in check so the ballot is most important 
 right now in this country if you and i million what we are africans who are in america nothing but africans nothing but africans in fact get farther calling yourself african instead of negro africans catch hell the only one catching hell they have to pass bills for africans an african can go anywhere he wants right now all got to do is tie your head up right go anywhere you want just stop being a negro change your name to hoogagagooba show you how silly the white man is dealing with a silly man a friend of mine very dark put a turban on his head and went into a restaurant in atlanta before they called themselves desegregated he went into a white restaurant he sat down they served him and he said what would happen if a negro came in here and there sitting black as night but because he had his head wrapped up the waitress looked back at him and says why there no nigger dare come in here 
 so dealing with a man whose bias and prejudice are making him lose his mind his intelligence every day frightened he looks around and sees taking place on this earth and he sees that the pendulum of time is swinging in your direction the dark people are waking up losing their fear of the white man no place where fighting right now is he winning everywhere fighting fighting someone your and my complexion and beating him he win any more won his last battle he failed to win the korean war he win it he had to sign a truce a loss 
 any time uncle sam with all his machinery for warfare is held to a draw by some rice eaters lost the battle he had to sign a truce not supposed to sign a truce supposed to be bad but not bad any more bad as long as she can use her hydrogen bomb but she use hers for fear russia might use hers russia use hers for fear that sam might use his so both of them are they use the weapon because weapon nullifies the so the only place where action can take place is on the ground and the white man win another war fighting on the ground those days are over the black man knows it the brown man knows it the red man knows it and the yellow man knows it so they engage him in guerrilla warfare not his style got to have heart to be a guerrilla warrior and he got any heart telling you now 
 i just want to give you a little briefing on guerrilla warfare because before you know it before you know it it takes heart to be a guerrilla warrior because on your own in conventional warfare you have tanks and a whole lot of other people with you to back you up planes over your head and all that kind of stuff but a guerrilla is on his own all you have is a rifle some sneakers and a bowl of rice and all you need and a lot of heart the japanese on some of those islands in the pacific when the american soldiers landed one japanese sometimes could hold the whole army off just wait until the sun went down and when the sun went down they were all equal he would take his little blade and slip from bush to bush and from american to american the white soldiers cope with that whenever you see a white soldier that fought in the pacific he has the shakes he has a nervous condition because they scared him to death 
 the same thing happened to the french up in french indochina people who just a few years previously were rice farmers got together and ran the french army out of indochina you need it modern warfare today work this is the day of the guerrilla they did the same thing in algeria algerians who were nothing but bedouins took a rine and sneaked off to the hills and de gaulle and all of his highfalutin war machinery defeat those guerrillas nowhere on this earth does the white man win in a guerrilla warfare not his speed just as guerrilla warfare is prevailing in asia and in parts of africa and in parts of latin america got to be mighty naive or got to play the black man cheap if you think some day going to wake up and find that got to be the ballot or the bullet 
 l would like to say in closing a few things concerning the muslim mosque inc which we established recently in new york city true muslims and our religion is islam but we mix our religion with our politics and our economics and our social and civil activities not any more we keep our religion in our mosque after our religious services are over then as muslims we become involved in political action economic action and social and civic action we become involved with anybody any where any time and in any manner designed to eliminate the evils the political economic and social evils that are afflicting the people of our community 
 the political philosophy of black nationalism means that the black man should control the politics and the politicians in his own community no more the black man in the black community has to be into the science of politics so he will know what politics is supposed to bring him in return be throwing out any ballots a ballot is like a bullet you throw your ballots until you see a target and if that target is not within your reach keep your ballot in your pocket 
 the political philosophy of black nationalism is being taught in the christian church being taught in the naacp being taught in core meetings being taught in sncc student nonviolent coordinating committee meetings being taught in muslim meetings being taught where nothing but atheists and agnostics come together being taught everywhere black people are fed up with the dillydallying pussyfooting compromising approach that been using toward getting our freedom we want freedom now but not going to get it saying we shall overcome got to fight until we overcome 
 the economic philosophy of black nationalism is pure and simple it only means that we should control the economy of our community why should white people be running all the stores in our community why should white people be running the banks of our community why should the economy of our community be in the hands of the white man why if a black man move his store into a white community you tell me why a white man should move his store into a black community the philosophy of black nationalism involves a program in the black community in regards to economics our people have to be made to see that any time you take your dollar out of your community and spend it in a community where you live the community where you live will get poorer and poorer and the community where you spend your money will get richer and richer 
 then you wonder why where you live is always a ghetto or a slum area and where you and i are concerned not only do we lose it when we spend it out of the community but the white man has got all our stores in the community tied up so that though we spend it in the community at sundown the man who runs the store takes it over across town somewhere got us in a vise 
 so the economic philosophy of black nationalism means in every church in every civic organization in every fraternal order time now for our people to be come conscious of the importance of controlling the economy of our community if we own the stores if we operate the businesses if we try and establish some industry in our own community then developing to the position where we are creating employment for our own kind once you gain control of the economy of your own community then you have to picket and boycott and beg some cracker downtown for a job in his business 
 the social philosophy of black nationalism only means that we have to get together and remove the evils the vices alcoholism drug addiction and other evils that are destroying the moral fiber of our community we our selves have to lift the level of our community the standard of our community to a higher level make our own society beautiful so that we will be satisfied in our own social circles and be running around here trying to knock our way into a social circle where not wanted so i say in spreading a gospel such as black nationalism it is not designed to make the black man the white man you know him already but to make the black man himself change the white mind you change his mind and that whole thing about appealing to the moral conscience of america conscience is bankrupt she lost all conscience a long time ago uncle sam has no conscience 
 they know what morals are they try and eliminate an evil because evil or because illegal or because immoral they eliminate it only when it threatens their existence so wasting your time appealing to the moral conscience of a bankrupt man like uncle sam if he had a conscience straighten this thing out with no more pressure being put upon him so it is not necessary to change the white mind we have to change our own mind you change his mind about us got to change our own minds about each other we have to see each other with new eyes we have to see each other as brothers and sisters we have to come together with warmth so we can develop unity and harmony necessary to get this problem solved ourselves how can we do this how can we avoid jealousy how can we avoid the suspicion and the divisions that exist in the community tell you how 
 i have watched how billy graham comes into a city spreading what he calls the gospel of christ which is only white nationalism what he is billy graham is a white nationalist a black nationalist but since the natural tendency for leaders to be jealous and look upon a powerful figure like graham with suspicion and envy how is it possible for him to come into a city and get all the cooperation of the church leaders think because church leaders that they have weaknesses that make them envious and jealous no got it not an accident that when they want to choose a cardinal as pope i over there in rome they get in a closet so you hear them cussing and fighting and carrying on 
 billy graham comes in preaching the gospel of christ he evangelizes the gospel he stirs everybody up but he never tries to start a church if he came in trying to start a church all the churches would be against him so he just comes in talking about christ and tells everybody who gets christ to go to any church where christ is and in this way the church cooperates with him so going to take a page from his book 
 our gospel is black nationalism not trying to threaten the existence of any organization but spreading the gospel of black nationalism anywhere a church that is also preaching and practicing the gospel of black nationalism join that church if the naacp is preaching and practicing the gospel of black nationalism join the naacp if core is spreading and practicing the gospel of black nationalism join core join any organization that has a gospel for the uplift of the black man and when you get into it and see them pussyfooting or compromising pull out of it because not black nationalism find another one 
 and in this manner the organizations will increase in number and in quantity and in quality and by august it is then our intention to have a black nationalist convention which will consist of delegates from all over the country who are interested in the political economic and social philosophy of black nationalism after these delegates convene we will hold a seminar we will hold discussions we will listen to everyone we want to hear new ideas and new solutions and new answers and at that time if we see fit then to form a black nationalist party form a black nationalist party if necessary to form a black nationalist army form a black nationalist army be the ballot or the bullet be liberty or be death 
 time for you and me to stop sitting in this country letting some cracker senators northern crackers and southern crackers sit there in washington and come to a conclusion in their mind that you and i are supposed to have civil rights no white man going to tell me anything about my rights brothers and sisters always remember if it take senators and congressmen and presidential proclamations to give freedom to the white man it is not necessary for legislation or proclamation or supreme court decisions to give freedom to the black man you let that white man know if this is a country of freedom let it be a country of freedom and if not a country of freedom change it 
 we will work with anybody anywhere at any time who is genuinely interested in tackling the problem nonviolently as long as the enemy is nonviolent but violent when the enemy gets violent work with you on the drive work with you on rent strikes work with you on school boycotts i believe in any kind of integration not even worried about it because i know not going to get it anyway not going to get it because afraid to die got to be ready to die if you try and force yourself on the white man because get just as violent as those crackers in mississippi right here in cleveland but we will still work with you on the school boycotts be cause against a segregated school system a segregated school system produces children who when they graduate graduate with crippled minds but this does not mean that a school is segregated because all black a segregated school means a school that is controlled by people who have no real interest in it whatsoever 
 let me explain what i mean a segregated district or community is a community in which people live but outsiders control the politics and the economy of that community they never refer to the white section as a segregated community the section a segregated community why the white man controls his own school his own bank his own economy his own politics his own everything his own community but he also controls yours when under someone control segregated always give you the lowest or the worst that there is to offer but it mean segregated just because you have your own got to control your own just like the white man has control of his you need to control yours 
 you know the best way to get rid of segregation the white man is more afraid of separation than he is of integration segregation means that he puts you away from him but not far enough for you to be out of his jurisdiction separation means gone and the white man will integrate faster than let you separate so we will work with you against the segregated school system because criminal because it is absolutely destructive in every way imaginable to the minds of the children who have to be exposed to that type of crippling education 
 last but not least i must say this concerning the great controversy over rifles and shotguns the only thing that ever said is that in areas where the government has proven itself either unwilling or unable to defend the lives and the property of negroes time for negroes to defend themselves article number two of the constitutional amendments provides you and me the right to own a rifle or a shotgun it is constitutionally legal to own a shotgun or a rifle this mean going to get a rifle and form battalions and go out looking for white folks although be within your rights i mean be justified but that would be illegal and we do anything illegal if the white man want the black man buying rifles and shotguns then let the government do its job 
 all and let the white man come to you and ask you what you think about what malcolm says why you old uncle tom he would never ask you if he thought you were going to say amen no he is making a tom out of you so this mean forming rifle clubs and going out looking for people but it is time in if you are a man to let that man know 
 if not going to do his job in running the government and providing you and me with the protection that our taxes are supposed to be for since he spends all those billions for his defense budget he certainly begrudge you and me spending or for a or i hope you understand go out shooting people but any time brothers and sisters and especially the men in this audience some of you wearing congressional medals of honor with shoulders this wide chests this big muscles that big any time you and i sit around and read where they bomb a church and murder in cold blood not some grownups but four little girls while they were praying to the same god the white man taught them to pray to and you and i see the government go down and find who did it 
 why this man he can find eichmann hiding down in argentina somewhere let two or three american soldiers who are minding somebody business way over in south vietnam get killed and send battleships sticking his nose in their business he wanted to send troops down to cuba and make them have what he calls free elections this old cracker who have free elections in his own country 
 no if you never see me another time in your life if i die in the morning die saying one thing the ballot or the bullet the ballot or the bullet 
 if a negro in has to sit around and wait for some cracker senator to filibuster when it comes to the rights of black people why you and i should hang our heads in shame you talk about a march on washington in you seen anything some more going down in 
 and this time not going like they went last year not going singing we shall overcome not going with white friends not going with placards already painted for them not going with tickets going with one way tickets and if they want that army going down there tell them to bring the filibuster to a halt 
 the black nationalists going to wait lyndon b johnson is the head of the democratic party if for civil rights let him go into the senate next week and declare himself let him go in there right now and declare himself let him go in there and denounce the southern branch of his party let him go in there right now and take a moral stand right now not later tell him wait until election time if he waits too long brothers and sisters he will be responsible for letting a condition develop in this country which will create a climate that will bring seeds up out of the ground with vegetation on the end of them looking like something these people never dreamed of in the ballot or the bullet 
 thank you 

the ballot or the bullet 
 malcolm x 
 delivered april in cleveland oh 
 mr moderator brother lomax brothers and sisters friends and enemies i just believe everyone in here is a friend and i want to leave anybody out the question tonight as i understand it is the negro revolt and where do we go from here or what next in my little humble way of understanding it it points toward either the ballot or the bullet 
 before we try and explain what is meant by the ballot or the bullet i would like to clarify something concerning myself still a muslim my religion is still islam my personal belief just as adam clayton powell is a christian minister who heads the abyssinian baptist church in new york but at the same time takes part in the political struggles to try and bring about rights to the black people in this country and dr martin luther king is a christian minister down in atlanta georgia who heads another organization fighting for the civil rights of black people in this country and reverend galamison i guess heard of him is another christian minister in new york who has been deeply involved in the school boycotts to eliminate segregated education well i myself am a minister not a christian minister but a muslim minister and i believe in action on all fronts by whatever means necessary 
 although still a muslim not here tonight to discuss my religion not here to try and change your religion not here to argue or discuss anything that we differ about because time for us to submerge our differences and realize that it is best for us to first see that we have the same problem a common problem a problem that will make you catch hell whether a baptist or a methodist or a muslim or a nationalist whether educated or illiterate whether you live on the boulevard or in the alley going to catch hell just like i am all in the same boat and we all are going to catch the same hell from the same man he just happens to be a white man all of us have suffered here in this country political oppression at the hands of the white man economic exploitation at the hands of the white man and social degradation at the hands of the white man 
 now in speaking like this it mean that but it does mean and if the white man want us to be let him stop oppressing and exploiting and degrading us whether we are christians or muslims or nationalists or agnostics or atheists we must first learn to forget our differences if we have differences let us differ in the closet when we come out in front let us not have anything to argue about until we get finished arguing with the man if the late president kennedy could get together with khrushchev and exchange some wheat we certainly have more in common with each other than kennedy and khrushchev had with each other 
 if we do something real soon i think have to agree that going to be forced either to use the ballot or the bullet one or the other in it that time is running out time has run out 
 threatens to be the most explosive year america has ever witnessed the most explosive year why also a political year the year when all of the white politicians will be back in the negro community jiving you and me for some votes the year when all of the white political crooks will be right back in your and my community with their false promises building up our hopes for a letdown with their trickery and their treachery with their false promises which they intend to keep as they nourish these dissatisfactions it can only lead to one thing an explosion and now we have the type of black man on the scene in america today sorry brother lomax who just intend to turn the other cheek any longer 
 let anybody tell you anything about the odds are against you if they draft you they send you to korea and make you face million chinese if you can be brave over there you can be brave right here these odds as great as those odds and if you fight here you will at least know what fighting for 
 not a politician not even a student of politics in fact not a student of much of anything not a democrat not a republican and i even consider myself an american if you and i were americans be no problem those honkies that just got off the boat already americans polacks are already americans the italian refugees are already americans everything that came out of europe every thing is already an american and as long as you and i have been over here we americans yet 
 well i am one who believe in deluding myself not going to sit at your table and watch you eat with nothing on my plate and call myself a diner sitting at the table make you a diner unless you eat some of on that plate being here in america make you an american being born here in america make you an american why if birth made you american you need any legislation you need any amendments to the constitution you be faced with filibustering in washington right now they have to pass legislation to make a polack an american 
 no not an american one of the million black people who are the victims of americanism one of the million black people who are the victims of democracy nothing but disguised hypocrisy so not standing here speaking to you as an american or a patriot or a or a no not i speaking as a victim of this american system and i see america through the eyes of the victim i see any american dream i see an american nightmare 
 these million victims are waking up their eyes are coming open beginning to see what they used to only look at becoming politically mature they are realizing that there are new political trends from coast to coast as they see these new political trends possible for them to see that every time an election the races are so close that they have to have a recount they had to recount in massachusetts to see who was going to be governor it was so close it was the same way in rhode island in minnesota and in many other parts of the country and the same with kennedy and nixon when they ran for president it was so close they had to count all over again well what does this mean it means that when white people are evenly divided and black people have a bloc of votes of their own it is left up to them to determine going to sit in the white house and going to be in the dog house 
 lt was the black vote that put the present administration in washington your vote your dumb vote your ignorant vote your wasted vote put in an administration in washington that has seen fit to pass every kind of legislation imaginable saving you until last then filibustering on top of that and your and my leaders have the audacity to run around clapping their hands and talk about how much progress making and what a good president we have if he good in texas he sure be good in washington because texas is a lynch state it is in the same breath as mississippi no different only they lynch you in texas with a texas accent and lynch you in mississippi with a mississippi accent and these negro leaders have the audacity to go and have some coffee in the white house with a texan a southern cracker all he is and then come out and tell you and me that going to be better for us because since from the south he knows how to deal with the southerners what kind of logic is that let eastland be president from the south too he should be better able to deal with them than johnson 
 in this present administration they have in the house of representatives democrats to only republicans they control of the house vote why they pass something that will help you and me in the senate there are senators who are of the democratic party only of them are republicans why the democrats have got the government sewed up and the one who sewed it up for them and what have they given you for it four years in office and just now getting around to some legislation just now after everything else is gone out of the way going to sit down now and play with you all summer long the same old giant con game that they call filibuster all those are in cahoots together you ever think not in cahoots together for the man that is heading the filibuster is a man from georgia named richard russell when johnson became president the first man he asked for when he got back to washington was dicky how tight they are his boy his pal his buddy but playing that old con game one of them makes believe for you and got it fixed where the other one is so tight against you he never has to keep his promise 
 so time in to wake up and when you see them coming up with that kind of conspiracy let them know your eyes are open and let them know you something else wide open too got to be the ballot or the bullet the ballot or the bullet if afraid to use an expression like that you should get on out of the country you should get back in the cotton patch you should get back in the alley they get all the negro vote and after they get it the negro gets nothing in return all they did when they got to washington was give a few big negroes big jobs those big negroes need big jobs they already had jobs camouflage trickery treachery not trying to knock out the democrats for the republicans get to them in a minute but it is true you put the democrats first and the democrats put you last 
 look at it the way it is what alibis do they use since they control congress and the senate what alibi do they use when you and i ask well when are you going to keep your promise they blame the dixiecrats what is a dixiecrat a democrat a dixiecrat is nothing but a democrat in disguise the titular head of the democrats is also the head of the dixiecrats because the dixiecrats are a part of the democratic party the democrats have never kicked the dixiecrats out of the party the dixiecrats bolted themselves once but the democrats put them out imagine these lowdown southern segregationists put the northern democrats down but the northern democrats have never put the dixiecrats down no look at that thing the way it is they have got a con game going on a political con game and you and i are in the middle time for you and me to wake up and start looking at it like it is and trying to understand it like it is and then we can deal with it like it is 
 the dixiecrats in washington control the key committees that run the government the only reason the dixiecrats control these committees is because they have seniority the only reason they have seniority is because they come from states where negroes vote this is not even a government based on democracy lt is not a government that is made up of representatives of the people half of the people in the south even vote eastland is not even supposed to be in washington half of the senators and congressmen who occupy these key positions in washington are there illegally are there unconstitutionally 
 i was in washington a week ago thursday when they were debating whether or not they should let the bill come onto the floor and in the back of the room where the senate meets a huge map of the united states and on that map it shows the location of negroes throughout the country and it shows that the southern section of the country the states that are most heavily concentrated with negroes are the ones that have senators and congressmen standing up filibustering and doing all other kinds of trickery to keep the negro from being able to vote this is pitiful but not pitiful for us any longer actually pitiful for the white man because soon now as the negro awakens a little more and sees the vise that in sees the bag that in sees the real game that in then the going to develop a new tactic 
 these senators and congressmen actually violate the constitutional amendments that guarantee the people of that particular state or county the right to vote and the constitution itself has within it the machinery to expel any representative from a state where the voting rights of the people are violated you even need new legislation any person in congress right now who is there from a state or a district where the voting rights of the people are violated that particular person should be expelled from congress and when you expel him removed one of the obstacles in the path of any real meaningful legislation in this country in fact when you expel them you need new legislation because they will be replaced by black representatives from counties and districts where the black man is in the majority not in the minority 
 if the black man in these southern states had his full voting rights the key dixiecrats in washington d c which means the key democrats in washington would lose their seats the democratic party itself would lose its power it would cease to be powerful as a party when you see the amount of power that would be lost by the democratic party if it were to lose the dixiecrat wing or branch or element you can see where against the interests of the democrats to give voting rights to negroes in states where the democrats have been in complete power and authority ever since the civil war you just belong to that party without analyzing it 
 i say again not not not just questioning their sincerity and some of the strategy that been using on our people by promising them promises that they intend to keep when you keep the democrats in power keeping the dixiecrats in power i doubt that my good brother lomax will deny that a vote for a democrat is a vote for a dixiecrat why in time now for you and me to become more politically mature and realize what the ballot is for what supposed to get when we cast a ballot and that if we cast a ballot going to end up in a situation where going to have to cast a bullet either a ballot or a bullet 
 in the north they do it a different way they have a system known as gerrymandering whatever that means it means when negroes become too heavily concentrated in a certain area and begin to gain too much political power the white man comes along and changes the district lines you may say why do you keep saying white man because the white man who does it i ever seen any negro changing any lines they let him get near the line the white man who does this and usually the white man who grins at you the most and pats you on the back and is supposed to be your friend he may be friendly but not your friend 
 so what trying to impress upon you in essence is this you and i in america are faced not with a segregationist conspiracy faced with a government conspiracy everyone filibustering is a senator the government everyone finagling in washington is a congressman the government you have anybody putting blocks in your path but people who are a part of the government the same government that you go abroad to fight for and die for is the government that is in a conspiracy to deprive you of your voting rights deprive you of your economic opportunities deprive you of decent housing deprive you of decent education you need to go to the employer alone it is the government itself the government of america that is responsible for the oppression and exploitation and degradation of black people in this country and you should drop it in their lap this government has failed the negro this democracy has failed the negro and all these white liberals have definitely failed the negro 
 so where do we go from here first we need some friends we need some new allies the entire struggle needs a new interpretation a broader interpretation we need to look at this thing from another angle from the inside as well as from the outside to those of us whose philosophy is black nationalism the only way you can get involved in the struggle is give it a new interpretation that old interpretation excluded us it kept us out so giving a new interpretation to the struggle an interpretation that will enable us to come into it take part in it and these who have been dillydallying and pussy footing and compromising we intend to let them pussyfoot and dillydally and compromise any longer 
 how can you thank a man for giving you already yours how then can you thank him for giving you only part of already yours you even made progress if being given to you you should have had already not progress and i love my brother lomax the way he pointed out right back where we were in not even as far up as we were in behind where we were in more segregation now than there was in more racial animosity more racial hatred more racial violence today in than there was in where is the progress 
 and now facing a situation where the young coming up they want to hear that turn stuff no in jacksonville those were teenagers they were throwing molotov cocktails negroes have never done that before but it shows you a new deal coming in new thinking coming in new strategy coming in be molotov cocktails this month hand grenades next month and something else next month be ballots or be bullets be liberty or it will be death the only difference about this kind of death be reciprocal you know what is meant by reciprocal one of brother words i stole it from him i usually deal with those big words because i usually deal with big people i deal with small people i find you can get a whole lot of small people and whip hell out of a whole lot of big people they got anything to lose and got every thing to gain and let you know in a minute it takes two to tango when i go you go 
 the black nationalists those whose philosophy is black nationalism in bringing about this new interpretation of the entire meaning of civil rights look upon it as meaning as brother lomax has pointed out equality of opportunity well justified in seeking civil rights if it means equality of opportunity because all doing there is trying to collect for our investment our mothers and fathers invested sweat and blood three hundred and ten years we worked in this country without a dime in return i mean without a dime in return you let the white man walk around here talking about how rich this country is but you never stop to think how it got rich so quick it got rich because you made it rich 
 you take the people who are in this audience right now poor all poor as individuals our weekly salary individually amounts to hardly anything but if you take the salary of everyone in here collectively fill up a whole lot of baskets a lot of wealth if you can collect the wages of just these people right here for a year be rich richer than rich when you look at it like that think how rich uncle sam had to become not with this handful but millions of black people your and my mother and father who work an shift but worked from see in the morning until see at night and worked for nothing making the white man rich making uncle sam rich this is our investment this is our contribution our blood 
 not only did we give of our free labor we gave of our blood every time he had a call to arms we were the first ones in uniform we died on every battlefield the white man had we have made a greater sacrifice than anybody standing up in america today we have made a greater contribution and have collected less civil rights for those of us whose philosophy is black nationalism means give it to us now wait for next year give it to us yesterday and not fast enough 
 i might stop right here to point out one thing whenever going after something that belongs to you anyone depriving you of the right to have it is a criminal understand that whenever you are going after something that is yours you are within your legal rights to lay claim to it and anyone who puts forth any effort to deprive you of that which is yours is breaking the law is a criminal and this was pointed out by the supreme court decision it outlawed segregation 
 which means segregation is against the law which means a segregationist is breaking the law a segregationist is a criminal you label him as anything other than that and when you demonstrate against segregation the law is on your side the supreme court is on your side 
 now who is it that opposes you in carrying out the law the police department itself with police dogs and clubs whenever you demonstrate against segregation whether it is segregated education segregated housing or anything else the law is on your side and anyone who stands in the way is not the law any longer they are breaking the law they are not representatives of the law any time you demonstrate against segregation and a man has the audacity to put a police dog on you kill that dog kill him telling you kill that dog i say it if they put me in jail tomorrow kill that dog then put a stop to it now if these white people in here want to see that kind of action get down and tell the mayor to tell the police department to pull the dogs in all you have to do if you do it someone else will 
 if you take this kind of stand your little children will grow up and look at you and think shame if you take an uncompromising stand i mean go out and get violent but at the same time you should never be nonviolent unless you run into some nonviolence nonviolent with those who are nonviolent with me but when you drop that violence on me then made me go insane and not responsible for what i do and the way every negro should get any time you know within the law within your legal rights within your moral rights in accord with justice then die for what you believe in but die alone let your dying be reciprocal this is what is meant by equality good for the goose is good for the gander 
 when we begin to get in this area we need new friends we need new allies we need to expand the struggle to a higher level to the level of human rights whenever you are in a struggle whether you know it or not you are confining yourself to the jurisdiction of uncle sam no one from the outside world can speak out in your behalf as long as your struggle is a struggle civil rights comes within the domestic affairs of this country all of our african brothers and our asian brothers and our brothers cannot open their mouths and interfere in the domestic affairs of the united states and as long as civil rights this comes under the jurisdiction of uncle sam 
 but the united nations has known as the charter of human rights it has a committee that deals in human rights you may wonder why all of the atrocities that have been committed in africa and in hungary and in asia and in latin america are brought before the un and the negro problem is never brought before the un this is part of the conspiracy this old tricky blue eyed liberal who is supposed to be your and my friend supposed to be in our corner supposed to be subsidizing our struggle and supposed to be acting in the capacity of an adviser never tells you anything about human rights they keep you wrapped up in civil rights and you spend so much time barking up the tree you even know a tree on the same floor 
 when you expand the struggle to the level of human rights you can then take the case of the black man in this country before the nations in the un you can take it before the general assembly you can take uncle sam before a world court but the only level you can do it on is the level of human rights civil rights keeps you under his restrictions under his jurisdiction civil rights keeps you in his pocket civil rights means asking uncle sam to treat you right human rights are something you were born with human rights are your rights human rights are the rights that are recognized by all nations of this earth and any time any one violates your human rights you can take them to the world court 
 uncle hands are dripping with blood dripping with the blood of the black man in this country the hypocrite he has the audacity yes he has imagine him posing as the leader of the free world the free world and you over here singing we shall overcome expand the struggle to the level of human rights take it into the united nations where our african brothers can throw their weight on our side where our asian brothers can throw their weight on our side where our brothers can throw their weight on our side and where million chinamen are sitting there waiting to throw their weight on our side 
 let the world know how bloody his hands are let the world know the hypocrisy practiced over here let it be the ballot or the bullet let him know that it must be the ballot or the bullet 
 when you take your case to washington taking it to the criminal responsible like running from the wolf to the fox all in cahoots together they all work political chicanery and make you look like a chump before the eyes of the world here you are walking around in america getting ready to be drafted and sent abroad like a tin soldier and when you get over there people ask you what are you fighting for and you have to stick your tongue in your cheek no take uncle sam to court take him before the world 
 by ballot i only mean freedom you know i disagree with lomax on this issue that the ballot is more important than the dollar can i prove it yes look in the un there are poor nations in the un yet those poor nations can get together with their voting power and keep the rich nations from making a move they have one nation one vote everyone has an equal vote and when those brothers from asia and africa and the darker parts of this earth get together their voting power is sufficient to hold sam in check or russia in check or some other section of the earth in check so the ballot is most important 
 right now in this country if you and i million what we are africans who are in america nothing but africans nothing but africans in fact get farther calling yourself african instead of negro africans catch hell the only one catching hell they have to pass bills for africans an african can go anywhere he wants right now all got to do is tie your head up right go anywhere you want just stop being a negro change your name to hoogagagooba show you how silly the white man is dealing with a silly man a friend of mine very dark put a turban on his head and went into a restaurant in atlanta before they called themselves desegregated he went into a white restaurant he sat down they served him and he said what would happen if a negro came in here and there sitting black as night but because he had his head wrapped up the waitress looked back at him and says why there no nigger dare come in here 
 so dealing with a man whose bias and prejudice are making him lose his mind his intelligence every day frightened he looks around and sees taking place on this earth and he sees that the pendulum of time is swinging in your direction the dark people are waking up losing their fear of the white man no place where fighting right now is he winning everywhere fighting fighting someone your and my complexion and beating him he win any more won his last battle he failed to win the korean war he win it he had to sign a truce a loss 
 any time uncle sam with all his machinery for warfare is held to a draw by some rice eaters lost the battle he had to sign a truce not supposed to sign a truce supposed to be bad but not bad any more bad as long as she can use her hydrogen bomb but she use hers for fear russia might use hers russia use hers for fear that sam might use his so both of them are they use the weapon because weapon nullifies the so the only place where action can take place is on the ground and the white man win another war fighting on the ground those days are over the black man knows it the brown man knows it the red man knows it and the yellow man knows it so they engage him in guerrilla warfare not his style got to have heart to be a guerrilla warrior and he got any heart telling you now 
 i just want to give you a little briefing on guerrilla warfare because before you know it before you know it it takes heart to be a guerrilla warrior because on your own in conventional warfare you have tanks and a whole lot of other people with you to back you up planes over your head and all that kind of stuff but a guerrilla is on his own all you have is a rifle some sneakers and a bowl of rice and all you need and a lot of heart the japanese on some of those islands in the pacific when the american soldiers landed one japanese sometimes could hold the whole army off just wait until the sun went down and when the sun went down they were all equal he would take his little blade and slip from bush to bush and from american to american the white soldiers cope with that whenever you see a white soldier that fought in the pacific he has the shakes he has a nervous condition because they scared him to death 
 the same thing happened to the french up in french indochina people who just a few years previously were rice farmers got together and ran the french army out of indochina you need it modern warfare today work this is the day of the guerrilla they did the same thing in algeria algerians who were nothing but bedouins took a rine and sneaked off to the hills and de gaulle and all of his highfalutin war machinery defeat those guerrillas nowhere on this earth does the white man win in a guerrilla warfare not his speed just as guerrilla warfare is prevailing in asia and in parts of africa and in parts of latin america got to be mighty naive or got to play the black man cheap if you think some day going to wake up and find that got to be the ballot or the bullet 
 l would like to say in closing a few things concerning the muslim mosque inc which we established recently in new york city true muslims and our religion is islam but we mix our religion with our politics and our economics and our social and civil activities not any more we keep our religion in our mosque after our religious services are over then as muslims we become involved in political action economic action and social and civic action we become involved with anybody any where any time and in any manner designed to eliminate the evils the political economic and social evils that are afflicting the people of our community 
 the political philosophy of black nationalism means that the black man should control the politics and the politicians in his own community no more the black man in the black community has to be into the science of politics so he will know what politics is supposed to bring him in return be throwing out any ballots a ballot is like a bullet you throw your ballots until you see a target and if that target is not within your reach keep your ballot in your pocket 
 the political philosophy of black nationalism is being taught in the christian church being taught in the naacp being taught in core meetings being taught in sncc student nonviolent coordinating committee meetings being taught in muslim meetings being taught where nothing but atheists and agnostics come together being taught everywhere black people are fed up with the dillydallying pussyfooting compromising approach that been using toward getting our freedom we want freedom now but not going to get it saying we shall overcome got to fight until we overcome 
 the economic philosophy of black nationalism is pure and simple it only means that we should control the economy of our community why should white people be running all the stores in our community why should white people be running the banks of our community why should the economy of our community be in the hands of the white man why if a black man move his store into a white community you tell me why a white man should move his store into a black community the philosophy of black nationalism involves a program in the black community in regards to economics our people have to be made to see that any time you take your dollar out of your community and spend it in a community where you live the community where you live will get poorer and poorer and the community where you spend your money will get richer and richer 
 then you wonder why where you live is always a ghetto or a slum area and where you and i are concerned not only do we lose it when we spend it out of the community but the white man has got all our stores in the community tied up so that though we spend it in the community at sundown the man who runs the store takes it over across town somewhere got us in a vise 
 so the economic philosophy of black nationalism means in every church in every civic organization in every fraternal order time now for our people to be come conscious of the importance of controlling the economy of our community if we own the stores if we operate the businesses if we try and establish some industry in our own community then developing to the position where we are creating employment for our own kind once you gain control of the economy of your own community then you have to picket and boycott and beg some cracker downtown for a job in his business 
 the social philosophy of black nationalism only means that we have to get together and remove the evils the vices alcoholism drug addiction and other evils that are destroying the moral fiber of our community we our selves have to lift the level of our community the standard of our community to a higher level make our own society beautiful so that we will be satisfied in our own social circles and be running around here trying to knock our way into a social circle where not wanted so i say in spreading a gospel such as black nationalism it is not designed to make the black man the white man you know him already but to make the black man himself change the white mind you change his mind and that whole thing about appealing to the moral conscience of america conscience is bankrupt she lost all conscience a long time ago uncle sam has no conscience 
 they know what morals are they try and eliminate an evil because evil or because illegal or because immoral they eliminate it only when it threatens their existence so wasting your time appealing to the moral conscience of a bankrupt man like uncle sam if he had a conscience straighten this thing out with no more pressure being put upon him so it is not necessary to change the white mind we have to change our own mind you change his mind about us got to change our own minds about each other we have to see each other with new eyes we have to see each other as brothers and sisters we have to come together with warmth so we can develop unity and harmony necessary to get this problem solved ourselves how can we do this how can we avoid jealousy how can we avoid the suspicion and the divisions that exist in the community tell you how 
 i have watched how billy graham comes into a city spreading what he calls the gospel of christ which is only white nationalism what he is billy graham is a white nationalist a black nationalist but since the natural tendency for leaders to be jealous and look upon a powerful figure like graham with suspicion and envy how is it possible for him to come into a city and get all the cooperation of the church leaders think because church leaders that they have weaknesses that make them envious and jealous no got it not an accident that when they want to choose a cardinal as pope i over there in rome they get in a closet so you hear them cussing and fighting and carrying on 
 billy graham comes in preaching the gospel of christ he evangelizes the gospel he stirs everybody up but he never tries to start a church if he came in trying to start a church all the churches would be against him so he just comes in talking about christ and tells everybody who gets christ to go to any church where christ is and in this way the church cooperates with him so going to take a page from his book 
 our gospel is black nationalism not trying to threaten the existence of any organization but spreading the gospel of black nationalism anywhere a church that is also preaching and practicing the gospel of black nationalism join that church if the naacp is preaching and practicing the gospel of black nationalism join the naacp if core is spreading and practicing the gospel of black nationalism join core join any organization that has a gospel for the uplift of the black man and when you get into it and see them pussyfooting or compromising pull out of it because not black nationalism find another one 
 and in this manner the organizations will increase in number and in quantity and in quality and by august it is then our intention to have a black nationalist convention which will consist of delegates from all over the country who are interested in the political economic and social philosophy of black nationalism after these delegates convene we will hold a seminar we will hold discussions we will listen to everyone we want to hear new ideas and new solutions and new answers and at that time if we see fit then to form a black nationalist party form a black nationalist party if necessary to form a black nationalist army form a black nationalist army be the ballot or the bullet be liberty or be death 
 time for you and me to stop sitting in this country letting some cracker senators northern crackers and southern crackers sit there in washington and come to a conclusion in their mind that you and i are supposed to have civil rights no white man going to tell me anything about my rights brothers and sisters always remember if it take senators and congressmen and presidential proclamations to give freedom to the white man it is not necessary for legislation or proclamation or supreme court decisions to give freedom to the black man you let that white man know if this is a country of freedom let it be a country of freedom and if not a country of freedom change it 
 we will work with anybody anywhere at any time who is genuinely interested in tackling the problem nonviolently as long as the enemy is nonviolent but violent when the enemy gets violent work with you on the drive work with you on rent strikes work with you on school boycotts i believe in any kind of integration not even worried about it because i know not going to get it anyway not going to get it because afraid to die got to be ready to die if you try and force yourself on the white man because get just as violent as those crackers in mississippi right here in cleveland but we will still work with you on the school boycotts be cause against a segregated school system a segregated school system produces children who when they graduate graduate with crippled minds but this does not mean that a school is segregated because all black a segregated school means a school that is controlled by people who have no real interest in it whatsoever 
 let me explain what i mean a segregated district or community is a community in which people live but outsiders control the politics and the economy of that community they never refer to the white section as a segregated community the section a segregated community why the white man controls his own school his own bank his own economy his own politics his own everything his own community but he also controls yours when under someone control segregated always give you the lowest or the worst that there is to offer but it mean segregated just because you have your own got to control your own just like the white man has control of his you need to control yours 
 you know the best way to get rid of segregation the white man is more afraid of separation than he is of integration segregation means that he puts you away from him but not far enough for you to be out of his jurisdiction separation means gone and the white man will integrate faster than let you separate so we will work with you against the segregated school system because criminal because it is absolutely destructive in every way imaginable to the minds of the children who have to be exposed to that type of crippling education 
 last but not least i must say this concerning the great controversy over rifles and shotguns the only thing that ever said is that in areas where the government has proven itself either unwilling or unable to defend the lives and the property of negroes time for negroes to defend themselves article number two of the constitutional amendments provides you and me the right to own a rifle or a shotgun it is constitutionally legal to own a shotgun or a rifle this mean going to get a rifle and form battalions and go out looking for white folks although be within your rights i mean be justified but that would be illegal and we do anything illegal if the white man want the black man buying rifles and shotguns then let the government do its job 
 all and let the white man come to you and ask you what you think about what malcolm says why you old uncle tom he would never ask you if he thought you were going to say amen no he is making a tom out of you so this mean forming rifle clubs and going out looking for people but it is time in if you are a man to let that man know 
 if not going to do his job in running the government and providing you and me with the protection that our taxes are supposed to be for since he spends all those billions for his defense budget he certainly begrudge you and me spending or for a or i hope you understand go out shooting people but any time brothers and sisters and especially the men in this audience some of you wearing congressional medals of honor with shoulders this wide chests this big muscles that big any time you and i sit around and read where they bomb a church and murder in cold blood not some grownups but four little girls while they were praying to the same god the white man taught them to pray to and you and i see the government go down and find who did it 
 why this man he can find eichmann hiding down in argentina somewhere let two or three american soldiers who are minding somebody business way over in south vietnam get killed and send battleships sticking his nose in their business he wanted to send troops down to cuba and make them have what he calls free elections this old cracker who have free elections in his own country 
 no if you never see me another time in your life if i die in the morning die saying one thing the ballot or the bullet the ballot or the bullet 
 if a negro in has to sit around and wait for some cracker senator to filibuster when it comes to the rights of black people why you and i should hang our heads in shame you talk about a march on washington in you seen anything some more going down in 
 and this time not going like they went last year not going singing we shall overcome not going with white friends not going with placards already painted for them not going with tickets going with one way tickets and if they want that army going down there tell them to bring the filibuster to a halt 
 the black nationalists going to wait lyndon b johnson is the head of the democratic party if for civil rights let him go into the senate next week and declare himself let him go in there right now and declare himself let him go in there and denounce the southern branch of his party let him go in there right now and take a moral stand right now not later tell him wait until election time if he waits too long brothers and sisters he will be responsible for letting a condition develop in this country which will create a climate that will bring seeds up out of the ground with vegetation on the end of them looking like something these people never dreamed of in the ballot or the bullet 
 thank you

 the karenins husband and wife continued living in the same house met every day but were complete strangers to one another alexei alexandrovich made it a rule to see his wife every day so that the servants might have no grounds for suppositions but avoided dining at home vronsky was never at alexei house but anna saw him away from home and her husband was aware of it 
 the position was one of torture for all three and not one of them would have been equal to enduring this position for a single day had it not been for the expectation that it would change that it was merely a temporary painful difficulty which would pass over alexei alexandrovich hoped that this passion would pass as everything does pass that everyone would forget about it and his name would remain unsullied anna on whom the position depended and for whom it was more poignant than for any other endured it because she not merely hoped but firmly believed that it would all very soon be settled and come right she had not the least idea what would settle the situation but she firmly believed that something would now very soon turn up vronsky unaccountably followed her lead hoping too that something independent of him would be sure to clear up all difficulties

 in reality of all the russian entertainments the prince liked best french actresses a ballet dancer and champagne vronsky was used to princes but either because he had himself changed of late or that he was in too close proximity to the prince that week seemed fearfully wearisome to him the whole of that week he experienced unceasingly a sensation such as a man might have who has been put in charge of a dangerous madman who is afraid of the madman and at the same time from being with him fears for his own reason vronsky was continually conscious of the necessity of never for a second relaxing the tone of stern official respectfulness so that he might not himself be insulted the manner of treating the very people who to surprise were ready to descend to any depths to provide him with russian amusements was contemptuous his criticisms of russian women whom he wished to study more than once made vronsky crimson with indignation the chief reason why the prince was so particularly disagreeable to vronsky was that he could not help seeing himself in him and what he saw in this mirror did not gratify his he was a very stupid and a very and a very healthy and a very man and nothing else he was a gentleman it was true and vronsky could not deny it he was equable and not cringing with his superiors was free and ingratiating in his behavior with his equals and was contemptuously indulgent with his inferiors vronsky was himself the same and regarded it as a great merit to be so but to this prince he was an inferior and his contemptuous and indulgent attitude to him revolted him

 when he got home vronsky found there a note from anna she wrote i am ill and unhappy i cannot come out yet cannot go on longer without seeing you come in this evening alexei alexandrovich goes to the council at seven and will be there till ten after a reflection on the strangeness of her bidding him come straight to her in spite of her insisting on her not receiving him he decided to go 
 vronsky had that winter got his promotion was now a colonel had left the regiment and was living alone after having some lunch he lay down on the sofa immediately and in five minutes memories of the hideous scenes he had witnessed during the last few days were jumbled and joined to a mental image of anna and of the peasant one of the encompassing people who had played an important part in the bear hunt and vronsky fell asleep he waked up in the dark trembling with horror and made haste to light a candle what was it what what was the dreadful thing i dreamed yes yes the peasant bear hunter i think a little dirty man with a disheveled beard was stooping down doing something and all of a sudden he began saying some strange words in french yes there was nothing else in the dream he said to himself but why was it so awful he vividly recalled the peasant again and those incomprehensible french words the peasant had uttered and a chill of horror ran down his spine 
 what nonsense thought vronsky and glanced at his watch 
 it was eight already he rang up his servant dressed in haste and went out on the steps completely forgetting the dream and only worried at being late as he drove up to the karenins entrance he looked at his watch and saw it was ten minutes to nine a high narrow carriage with a pair of grays was standing at the entrance he recognized carriage she is coming to me thought vronsky and better she should i like going into that house but no matter i hide myself he thought and with that manner peculiar to him from childhood as of a man who has nothing to be ashamed of vronsky got out of his sleigh and went to the door the door opened and the hall porter with a rug on his arm called the carriage vronsky though he did not usually notice details noticed at this moment the amazed expression with which the porter glanced at him in the very doorway vronsky almost ran up against alexei alexandrovich the gas jet threw its full light on the bloodless sunken face under the black hat and on the white cravat brilliant against the beaver of the coat fixed dull eyes were fastened upon face vronsky bowed and alexei alexandrovich chewing his lips lifted his hand to his hat and went on vronsky saw him get into the carriage without looking back receive the rug and the opera glasses through the window and disappear vronsky went into the hall his brows were scowling and his eyes gleamed with a proud and angry light in them 
 what a situation he thought if he would fight would stand up for his honor i could act could express my feelings but this weakness or baseness he puts me in the position of playing false which i never meant and never mean to do 
 ideas had changed since the day of his conversation with anna in the vrede garden unconsciously yielding to the weakness of anna who had surrendered herself up to him utterly and simply looked to him to decide her fate ready to submit to anything he had long ceased to think that their liaison might end as he had thought then his ambitious plans had retreated into the background again and feeling that he had got out of that circle of activity in which everything was definite he had given himself up entirely to his passion and that passion was binding him more and more closely to her 
 he was still in the hall when he caught the sound of her retreating footsteps he realized she had been expecting him had listened for him and was now going back to the drawing room 
 no she cried on seeing him and at the first sound of her voice the tears came into her eyes no if things are to go on like this the end will come much much too soon 
 what is it dear one 
 what been waiting in agony for an hour two hours no i i quarrel with you of course you come no i 
 she laid her two hands on his shoulders and looked a long while at him with a profound passionate and at the same time searching look she was studying his face to make up for the time she had not seen him she was every time she saw him making the picture of him in her imagination incomparably superior impossible in reality fit with him as he really was

 you met him she asked when they had sat down at the table in the lamplight punished you see for being late 
 yes but how was it he to be at the council 
 he had been and come back and was going out somewhere again but that matter talk about it where have you been with the prince still 
 she knew every detail of his existence he was going to say that he had been up all night and had dropped asleep but looking at her thrilled and rapturous face he was ashamed and he said he had had to report on the departure 
 but over now he is gone 
 thank god over you believe how insufferable been for me 
 why so it the life all of you all young men always lead she said knitting her brows and taking up the crochet work that was lying on the table she began drawing the hook out of it without looking at vronsky 
 i gave that life up long ago said he wondering at the change in her face and trying to divine its meaning and i confess he said with a smile showing his thick white teeth this week been as it were looking at myself in a glass seeing that life and i like it 
 she held the work in her hands but did not crochet and looked at him with strange shining and hostile eyes 
 this morning liza came to see me not afraid to call on me in spite of the countess lidia ivanovna she put in and she told me about your athenian evening how loathsome 
 i was just going to say 
 she interrupted him 
 it was that thrse you used to know 
 i was just saying 
 how disgusting you are you men how is it you understand that a woman can never forget that she said getting more and more angry and so letting him see the cause of her irritation especially a woman who cannot know your life what do i know what have i ever known she said only what you tell me and how do i know whether you tell me the truth 
 anna you hurt me you trust me i told you that i a thought i lay bare to you 
 yes yes she said evidently trying to suppress her jealous thoughts but if only you knew how wretched i am i believe you i believe you what were you saying 
 but he could not at once recall what he had been going to say these fits of jealousy which of late had been more and more frequent with her horrified him and however much he tried to disguise the fact made him feel cold to her although he knew the cause of her jealousy was her love for him how often he had told himself that her love was happiness and now she loved him as a woman can love when love has outweighed for her all the good things of life and he was much further from happiness than when he had followed her from moscow then he had thought himself unhappy but happiness was before him now he felt that the best happiness was already left behind she was utterly unlike what she had been when he first saw her both morally and physically she had changed for the worse she had broadened out all over and in her face at the time when she was speaking of the actress there was an evil expression of hatred that distorted it he looked at her as a man looks at a faded flower he has gathered with difficulty recognizing in it the beauty for which he picked and ruined it and in spite of this he felt that then when his love was stronger he could if he had greatly wished it have torn that love out of his heart but now when as at this moment it seemed to him he felt no love for her he knew that his bond with her could not be broken 
 well well what was it you were going to say about the prince i have driven away the fiend i have she added the fiend was the name they had given her jealousy what did you begin to tell me about the prince why did you find it so tiresome 
 oh it was intolerable he said trying to pick up the thread of his interrupted thought he does not improve on closer acquaintance if you want him defined here he is a prime animal such as takes medals at the cattle shows and nothing more he said with a tone of vexation that interested her 
 no how so she replied seen a great deal anyway cultured 
 an utterly different culture their culture cultivated one sees simply to be able to despise culture as they despise everything but animal pleasures 
 but you all care for these animal pleasures she said and again he noticed a dark look in her eyes that avoided him 
 how is it defending him he said smiling 
 not defending him nothing to me but i imagine if you had not cared for those pleasures yourself you might have got out of them but it affords you satisfaction to gaze at thrse in the attire of eve 
 again again the devil vronsky said taking the hand she had laid on the table and kissing it 
 yes but i help it you know what i have suffered waiting for you i believe not jealous not jealous i believe you when here near me but when away somewhere leading your life alone so incomprehensible to me 
 she turned away from him pulled the hook at last out of the crochet work and rapidly with the help of her forefinger began working loop after loop of the wool that was dazzlingly white in the lamplight while the slender wrist moved swiftly nervously in its embroidered cuff 
 how was it then where did you meet alexei alexandrovich her voice sounded in an unnatural and jarring tone 
 we ran against each other in the doorway 
 and he bowed to you like this 
 she drew a long face and her eyes quickly transformed her expression folded her hands and vronsky suddenly saw in her beautiful face the very expression with which alexei alexandrovich had bowed to him he smiled while she laughed gaily with that sweet deep laugh which was one of her greatest charms 
 i understand him in the least said vronsky if after your avowal to him at your summer villa he had broken with you if he had challenged me but this i understand how can he put up with such a position he feels it evident 
 he she said sneeringly perfectly satisfied 
 what are we all miserable for when everything might be so well 
 except for him i know him the falsity in which utterly steeped could one with any feeling live as he is living with me he understands nothing and feels nothing could a man of any feeling live in the same house with his unfaithful wife could he talk to her call her my dear 
 and again she could not help mimicking him anna ma chre anna dear 
 not a man not a human being a mannikin no one knows him but i know him oh if been in his place long ago have killed have torn to pieces a wife like me i have said anna ma chre not a man a ministerial machine he understand that your wife that outside that superfluous talk of him 
 unfair very unfair dearest said vronsky trying to soothe her but never mind talk of him tell me what been doing what is the matter why are you unwell and what did the doctor say 
 she looked at him with mocking amusement evidently she had hit on other absurd and grotesque aspects in her husband and was awaiting the moment to give expression to them 
 but he went on 
 i imagine that not illness but your condition when will it be 
 the ironical light died away in her eyes but a different smile a consciousness of something he did not know what and of quiet melancholy came over her face 
 soon soon you say that our position is miserable that we must put an end to it if you knew how terrible it is to me what i would give to be able to love you freely and unafraid i should not torture myself and torture you with my jealousy and it will come soon but not as we expect 
 and at the thought of how it would come she seemed so pitiable to herself that tears came into her eyes and she could not go on she laid on his sleeve her hand shining with its whiteness and its rings in the lamplight 
 it come as we suppose i mean to say this to you but made me soon soon all will be over and we shall all all be at peace and suffer no more 
 i understand he said understanding her 
 you asked when soon and i live through it interrupt me and she made haste to speak i know it i know for certain i shall die and very glad i shall die and release myself and you 
 tears dropped from her eyes he bent down over her hand and began kissing it trying to hide his emotion which he knew had no sort of grounds though he could not control it 
 yes better so she said tightly gripping his hand the only way the only way left us 
 he had recovered himself and lifted his head 
 how absurd what absurd nonsense you are talking 
 no the truth 
 what the truth 
 that i shall die i have had a dream 
 a dream repeated vronsky and instantly he recalled the peasant of his dream 
 yes a dream she said a long while since i dreamed it i dreamed that i ran into my bedroom that i had to get something there to find out something you know how it is in dreams she said her eyes wide with horror and in the bedroom in the corner stood something 
 oh what nonsense how can you believe 
 but she would not let him interrupt her what she was saying was too important to her 
 and the something turned round and i saw it was a peasant with a disheveled beard a little man and dreadful i wanted to run away but he bent down over a sack and was fumbling there with his hands 
 she showed how he had moved his hands there was terror in her face and vronsky remembering his dream felt the same terror filling his soul 
 he was fumbling and kept talking quickly quickly in french and you know he burred il faut le battre le fer le broyer le ptrir and in my horror i tried to wake up and woke up but woke up in the dream and i began asking myself what it meant and kornei said to me in childbirth die die and i woke up 
 what nonsense what nonsense said vronsky but he felt himself that there was no conviction in his voice 
 but talk of it ring the bell have tea and stay a little now not long i shall 
 but all at once she stopped the expression of her face instantaneously changed horror and excitement were suddenly replaced by a look of soft solemn blissful attention he could not comprehend the meaning of the change she was listening to the stirring of the new life within her

 oh it was intolerable he said trying to pick up the thread of his interrupted thought he does not improve on closer acquaintance if you want him defined here he is a prime animal such as takes medals at the cattle shows and nothing more he said with a tone of vexation that interested her 
 no how so she replied seen a great deal anyway cultured 
 an utterly different culture their culture cultivated one sees simply to be able to despise culture as they despise everything but animal pleasures 
 but you all care for these animal pleasures she said and again he noticed a dark look in her eyes that avoided him 
 how is it defending him he said smiling 
 not defending him nothing to me but i imagine if you had not cared for those pleasures yourself you might have got out of them but it affords you satisfaction to gaze at thrse in the attire of eve 
 again again the devil vronsky said taking the hand she had laid on the table and kissing it 
 yes but i help it you know what i have suffered waiting for you i believe not jealous not jealous i believe you when here near me but when away somewhere leading your life alone so incomprehensible to me 
 she turned away from him pulled the hook at last out of the crochet work and rapidly with the help of her forefinger began working loop after loop of the wool that was dazzlingly white in the lamplight while the slender wrist moved swiftly nervously in its embroidered cuff 
 how was it then where did you meet alexei alexandrovich her voice sounded in an unnatural and jarring tone 
 we ran against each other in the doorway 
 and he bowed to you like this 
 she drew a long face and her eyes quickly transformed her expression folded her hands and vronsky suddenly saw in her beautiful face the very expression with which alexei alexandrovich had bowed to him he smiled while she laughed gaily with that sweet deep laugh which was one of her greatest charms 
 i understand him in the least said vronsky if after your avowal to him at your summer villa he had broken with you if he had challenged me but this i understand how can he put up with such a position he feels it evident 
 he she said sneeringly perfectly satisfied 
 what are we all miserable for when everything might be so well 
 except for him i know him the falsity in which utterly steeped could one with any feeling live as he is living with me he understands nothing and feels nothing could a man of any feeling live in the same house with his unfaithful wife could he talk to her call her my dear 
 and again she could not help mimicking him anna ma chre anna dear 
 not a man not a human being a mannikin no one knows him but i know him oh if been in his place long ago have killed have torn to pieces a wife like me i have said anna ma chre not a man a ministerial machine he understand that your wife that outside that superfluous talk of him 
 unfair very unfair dearest said vronsky trying to soothe her but never mind talk of him tell me what been doing what is the matter why are you unwell and what did the doctor say 
 she looked at him with mocking amusement evidently she had hit on other absurd and grotesque aspects in her husband and was awaiting the moment to give expression to them 
 but he went on 
 i imagine that not illness but your condition when will it be 
 the ironical light died away in her eyes but a different smile a consciousness of something he did not know what and of quiet melancholy came over her face 
 soon soon you say that our position is miserable that we must put an end to it if you knew how terrible it is to me what i would give to be able to love you freely and unafraid i should not torture myself and torture you with my jealousy and it will come soon but not as we expect 
 and at the thought of how it would come she seemed so pitiable to herself that tears came into her eyes and she could not go on she laid on his sleeve her hand shining with its whiteness and its rings in the lamplight 
 it come as we suppose i mean to say this to you but made me soon soon all will be over and we shall all all be at peace and suffer no more 
 i understand he said understanding her 
 you asked when soon and i live through it interrupt me and she made haste to speak i know it i know for certain i shall die and very glad i shall die and release myself and you 
 tears dropped from her eyes he bent down over her hand and began kissing it trying to hide his emotion which he knew had no sort of grounds though he could not control it 
 yes better so she said tightly gripping his hand the only way the only way left us 
 he had recovered himself and lifted his head 
 how absurd what absurd nonsense you are talking 
 no the truth 
 what the truth 
 that i shall die i have had a dream 
 a dream repeated vronsky and instantly he recalled the peasant of his dream 
 yes a dream she said a long while since i dreamed it i dreamed that i ran into my bedroom that i had to get something there to find out something you know how it is in dreams she said her eyes wide with horror and in the bedroom in the corner stood something 
 oh what nonsense how can you believe 
 but she would not let him interrupt her what she was saying was too important to her 
 and the something turned round and i saw it was a peasant with a disheveled beard a little man and dreadful i wanted to run away but he bent down over a sack and was fumbling there with his hands 
 she showed how he had moved his hands there was terror in her face and vronsky remembering his dream felt the same terror filling his soul 
 he was fumbling and kept talking quickly quickly in french and you know he burred il faut le battre le fer le broyer le ptrir and in my horror i tried to wake up and woke up but woke up in the dream and i began asking myself what it meant and kornei said to me in childbirth die die and i woke up 
 what nonsense what nonsense said vronsky but he felt himself that there was no conviction in his voice 
 but talk of it ring the bell have tea and stay a little now not long i shall 
 but all at once she stopped the expression of her face instantaneously changed horror and excitement were suddenly replaced by a look of soft solemn blissful attention he could not comprehend the meaning of the change she was listening to the stirring of the new life within her

 you met him she asked when they had sat down at the table in the lamplight punished you see for being late 
 yes but how was it he to be at the council 
 he had been and come back and was going out somewhere again but that matter talk about it where have you been with the prince still 
 she knew every detail of his existence he was going to say that he had been up all night and had dropped asleep but looking at her thrilled and rapturous face he was ashamed and he said he had had to report on the departure 
 but over now he is gone 
 thank god over you believe how insufferable been for me 
 why so it the life all of you all young men always lead she said knitting her brows and taking up the crochet work that was lying on the table she began drawing the hook out of it without looking at vronsky 
 i gave that life up long ago said he wondering at the change in her face and trying to divine its meaning and i confess he said with a smile showing his thick white teeth this week been as it were looking at myself in a glass seeing that life and i like it 
 she held the work in her hands but did not crochet and looked at him with strange shining and hostile eyes 
 this morning liza came to see me not afraid to call on me in spite of the countess lidia ivanovna she put in and she told me about your athenian evening how loathsome 
 i was just going to say 
 she interrupted him 
 it was that thrse you used to know 
 i was just saying 
 how disgusting you are you men how is it you understand that a woman can never forget that she said getting more and more angry and so letting him see the cause of her irritation especially a woman who cannot know your life what do i know what have i ever known she said only what you tell me and how do i know whether you tell me the truth 
 anna you hurt me you trust me i told you that i a thought i lay bare to you 
 yes yes she said evidently trying to suppress her jealous thoughts but if only you knew how wretched i am i believe you i believe you what were you saying 
 but he could not at once recall what he had been going to say these fits of jealousy which of late had been more and more frequent with her horrified him and however much he tried to disguise the fact made him feel cold to her although he knew the cause of her jealousy was her love for him how often he had told himself that her love was happiness and now she loved him as a woman can love when love has outweighed for her all the good things of life and he was much further from happiness than when he had followed her from moscow then he had thought himself unhappy but happiness was before him now he felt that the best happiness was already left behind she was utterly unlike what she had been when he first saw her both morally and physically she had changed for the worse she had broadened out all over and in her face at the time when she was speaking of the actress there was an evil expression of hatred that distorted it he looked at her as a man looks at a faded flower he has gathered with difficulty recognizing in it the beauty for which he picked and ruined it and in spite of this he felt that then when his love was stronger he could if he had greatly wished it have torn that love out of his heart but now when as at this moment it seemed to him he felt no love for her he knew that his bond with her could not be broken

 alexei alexandrovich after meeting vronsky on his own steps drove as he had intended to the italian opera he sat through two acts there and saw everyone he wanted to see on returning home he carefully scrutinized the hatstand and noticing that there was not a military overcoat there he went as usual to his own room but contrary to his usual habit he did not go to bed he walked up and down his study till three in the morning the feeling of furious anger with his wife who would not observe the proprieties and keep to the one stipulation he had laid on her not to receive her lover in her own house gave him no peace she had not complied with his request and he was bound to punish her and carry out his threat obtain a divorce and take away his son he knew all the difficulties connected with this course but he had said he would do it and now he must carry out his threat countess lidia ivanovna had hinted that this was the best way out of his position and of late the obtaining of divorces had been brought to such a pitch of perfection that alexei alexandrovich saw a possibility of overcoming the formal difficulties misfortunes never come singly and the affairs of the reorganization of the native tribes and of the irrigation of the lands of the zaraisky province had brought such official worries upon alexei alexandrovich that he had been of late in a continual state of extreme irritability 
 he did not sleep the whole night and his fury growing in a sort of vast arithmetical progression reached its highest limits in the morning he dressed in haste and as though carrying his cup full of wrath and fearing to spill any over fearing to lose with his wrath the energy necessary for the interview with his wife he went into her room directly he heard she was up 
 anna who had thought she knew her husband so well was amazed at his appearance when he went in to her his brow was lowering and his eyes stared darkly before him avoiding her eyes his mouth was tightly and contemptuously shut in his walk in his gestures in the sound of his voice there was a determination and firmness such as his wife had never seen in him he went into her room and without greeting her walked straight up to her writing table and taking her keys opened a drawer 
 what do you want she cried 
 your letters he said 
 not here she said shutting the drawer but from that action he saw he had guessed right and roughly pushing away her hand he quickly snatched a portfolio in which he knew she used to put her most important papers she tried to pull the portfolio away but he pushed her back 
 sit down i have to speak to you he said putting the portfolio under his arm and squeezing it so tightly with his elbow that his shoulder stood up 
 amazed and intimidated she gazed at him in silence 
 i told you that i would not allow you to receive your lover in this house 
 i had to see him to 
 she stopped not finding a reason 
 i do not enter into the details of why a woman wants to see her lover 
 i meant i only she said flushing hotly this coarseness of his angered her and gave her courage surely you must feel how easy it is for you to insult me she said 
 an honest man and an honest woman may be insulted but to tell a thief a thief is simply la constatation fait 
 this cruelty is something new i did not know in you 
 you call it cruelty for a husband to give his wife liberty giving her the honorable protection of his name simply on the condition of observing the proprieties is that cruelty 
 worse that cruel base if you want to know anna cried in a rush of hatred and getting up she was about to leave the room 
 no he shrieked in his shrill voice which pitched a note even higher than usual and his big hands clutching her by the arm so violently that red marks were left from the bracelet he was squeezing he forcibly made her sit down in her place base if you care to use that word what is base is to forsake husband and child for a lover while you eat your bread 
 she bowed her head she did not say what she had said the evening before to her lover that he was her husband and her husband was superfluous she did not even think of that she felt all the justice of his words and only said softly 
 you cannot describe my position as worse than i feel it to be myself but what are you saying all this for 
 what am i saying it for what for he went on as angrily so that you may know that since you have not carried out my wishes in regard to observing outward decorum i will take measures to put an end to this state of things 
 soon very soon it will end anyway she said and again at the thought of death near at hand and now desired tears came into her eyes 
 it will end sooner than you and your lover have planned if you must have the satisfaction of animal passion 
 alexei alexandrovich i say not generous but not like a gentleman to strike anyone down 
 yes you only think of yourself but the sufferings of a man who was your husband have no interest for you you care that his whole life is ruined that he is seff seff 
 alexei alexandrovich was speaking so quickly that he began to stammer and was utterly unable to articulate the word suffering in the end he pronounced it saffering she wanted to laugh and was immediately ashamed that anything could amuse her at such a moment and for the first time for an instant she felt for him put herself in his place and was sorry for him but what could she say or do her head sank and she sat silent he too was silent for some time and then began speaking in a frigid less shrill voice emphasizing random words that had no special significance 
 i came to tell you he said 
 she glanced at him no it was my fancy she thought recalling the expression of his face when he stumbled over the word suffering no can a man with those dull eyes with that complacency feel anything 
 i cannot change anything she whispered 
 i have come to tell you that i am going tomorrow to moscow and shall not return again to this house and you will receive notice of what i decide through the lawyer into whose hands i shall entrust the task of getting a divorce my son is going to my said alexei alexandrovich with an effort recalling what he had meant to say about his son 
 you take seriozha to hurt me she said looking at him from under her brows you do not love him leave me seriozha 
 yes i have lost even my affection for my son because he is associated with the repulsion i feel for you but still i shall take him 
 and he was going away but now she detained him 
 alexei alexandrovich leave me seriozha she whispered once more i have nothing else to say leave seriozha till my i shall soon be confined leave him

 alexei alexandrovich was speaking so quickly that he began to stammer and was utterly unable to articulate the word suffering in the end he pronounced it saffering she wanted to laugh and was immediately ashamed that anything could amuse her at such a moment and for the first time for an instant she felt for him put herself in his place and was sorry for him but what could she say or do her head sank and she sat silent he too was silent for some time and then began speaking in a frigid less shrill voice emphasizing random words that had no special significance

 alexei alexandrovich after meeting vronsky on his own steps drove as he had intended to the italian opera he sat through two acts there and saw everyone he wanted to see on returning home he carefully scrutinized the hatstand and noticing that there was not a military overcoat there he went as usual to his own room but contrary to his usual habit he did not go to bed he walked up and down his study till three in the morning the feeling of furious anger with his wife who would not observe the proprieties and keep to the one stipulation he had laid on her not to receive her lover in her own house gave him no peace she had not complied with his request and he was bound to punish her and carry out his threat obtain a divorce and take away his son he knew all the difficulties connected with this course but he had said he would do it and now he must carry out his threat countess lidia ivanovna had hinted that this was the best way out of his position and of late the obtaining of divorces had been brought to such a pitch of perfection that alexei alexandrovich saw a possibility of overcoming the formal difficulties misfortunes never come singly and the affairs of the reorganization of the native tribes and of the irrigation of the lands of the zaraisky province had brought such official worries upon alexei alexandrovich that he had been of late in a continual state of extreme irritability 
 he did not sleep the whole night and his fury growing in a sort of vast arithmetical progression reached its highest limits in the morning he dressed in haste and as though carrying his cup full of wrath and fearing to spill any over fearing to lose with his wrath the energy necessary for the interview with his wife he went into her room directly he heard she was up 
 anna who had thought she knew her husband so well was amazed at his appearance when he went in to her his brow was lowering and his eyes stared darkly before him avoiding her eyes his mouth was tightly and contemptuously shut in his walk in his gestures in the sound of his voice there was a determination and firmness such as his wife had never seen in him he went into her room and without greeting her walked straight up to her writing table and taking her keys opened a drawer 
 what do you want she cried 
 your letters he said 
 not here she said shutting the drawer but from that action he saw he had guessed right and roughly pushing away her hand he quickly snatched a portfolio in which he knew she used to put her most important papers she tried to pull the portfolio away but he pushed her back 
 sit down i have to speak to you he said putting the portfolio under his arm and squeezing it so tightly with his elbow that his shoulder stood up 
 amazed and intimidated she gazed at him in silence 
 i told you that i would not allow you to receive your lover in this house 
 i had to see him to 
 she stopped not finding a reason 
 i do not enter into the details of why a woman wants to see her lover 
 i meant i only she said flushing hotly this coarseness of his angered her and gave her courage surely you must feel how easy it is for you to insult me she said 
 an honest man and an honest woman may be insulted but to tell a thief a thief is simply la constatation fait 
 this cruelty is something new i did not know in you 
 you call it cruelty for a husband to give his wife liberty giving her the honorable protection of his name simply on the condition of observing the proprieties is that cruelty 
 worse that cruel base if you want to know anna cried in a rush of hatred and getting up she was about to leave the room 
 no he shrieked in his shrill voice which pitched a note even higher than usual and his big hands clutching her by the arm so violently that red marks were left from the bracelet he was squeezing he forcibly made her sit down in her place base if you care to use that word what is base is to forsake husband and child for a lover while you eat your bread 
 she bowed her head she did not say what she had said the evening before to her lover that he was her husband and her husband was superfluous she did not even think of that she felt all the justice of his words and only said softly 
 you cannot describe my position as worse than i feel it to be myself but what are you saying all this for 
 what am i saying it for what for he went on as angrily so that you may know that since you have not carried out my wishes in regard to observing outward decorum i will take measures to put an end to this state of things 
 soon very soon it will end anyway she said and again at the thought of death near at hand and now desired tears came into her eyes 
 it will end sooner than you and your lover have planned if you must have the satisfaction of animal passion 
 alexei alexandrovich i say not generous but not like a gentleman to strike anyone down 
 yes you only think of yourself but the sufferings of a man who was your husband have no interest for you you care that his whole life is ruined that he is seff seff 
 alexei alexandrovich was speaking so quickly that he began to stammer and was utterly unable to articulate the word suffering in the end he pronounced it saffering she wanted to laugh and was immediately ashamed that anything could amuse her at such a moment and for the first time for an instant she felt for him put herself in his place and was sorry for him but what could she say or do her head sank and she sat silent he too was silent for some time and then began speaking in a frigid less shrill voice emphasizing random words that had no special significance

 the waiting room of the celebrated peterburg lawyer was full when alexei alexandrovich entered it three ladies an old lady a young lady and a wife and three gentlemen one a german banker with a ring on his finger the second a merchant with a beard and the third a government clerk in official uniform with a cross on his neck had obviously been waiting a long while already two clerks were writing at tables with scratching pens the appurtenances of the writing tables about which alexei alexandrovich was himself very fastidious were exceptionally good he could not help observing this one of the clerks without getting up turned fretfully to alexei alexandrovich his eyes 
 what is it you wish 
 my business has to do with the lawyer 
 he is engaged the clerk responded severely and he pointed with his pen at the persons waiting and went on writing 
 he spare time to see me said alexei alexandrovich 
 he has no time free he is always busy kindly wait your turn 
 then i must trouble you to give him my card alexei alexandrovich said with dignity seeing the impossibility of preserving his incognito 
 the clerk took the card and obviously not approving of what he read on it went to the door 
 alexei alexandrovich was in principle in favor of the publicity of legal proceedings though for some higher official considerations he disliked the application of the principle in russia and disapproved of it as far as he could disapprove of anything instituted by authority of the emperor his whole life had been spent in administrative work and consequently when he did not approve of anything his disapproval was softened by the recognition of the inevitability of mistakes and the possibility of reform in every department in the new public law courts he disliked the restrictions laid on the lawyers conducting cases but till then he had had nothing to do with the law courts and so had disapproved of their publicity simply in theory now his disapprobation was strengthened by the unpleasant impression made on him in the waiting room 
 he will be out right away said the clerk and two minutes later there did actually appear in the doorway the large figure of an old student of jurisprudence who had been consulting with the lawyer and the lawyer himself 
 the lawyer was a little squat bald man with a dark reddish beard long eyebrows and beetling brow he was attired as though for a wedding from his cravat to his double watch chain and shoes his face was clever and rustic but his dress was dandified and in bad taste 
 pray walk in said the lawyer addressing alexei alexandrovich and gloomily ushering karenin in before him he closed the door you sit down he indicated an armchair at a writing table covered with papers he sat down himself and rubbing his little hands with short fingers covered with white hairs he bent his head on one side but as soon as he was settled in this position a moth flew over the table the lawyer with a swiftness that could never have been expected of him opened his hands caught the moth and resumed his former attitude 
 before beginning to speak of my business said alexei alexandrovich following the movements with wondering eyes i ought to observe that the matter about which i have to speak to you is to be a secret 
 the drooping reddish mustaches were stirred by a scarcely perceptible smile 
 i should not be a lawyer if i could not keep the secrets confided to me but if you would like proof 
 alexei alexandrovich glanced at his face and saw that the shrewd gray eyes were laughing and seemed to know all about it already 
 you know my name alexei alexandrovich resumed 
 i know you and the good again he caught a moth work you are doing like every russian said the lawyer bowing 
 alexei alexandrovich sighed plucking up his courage but having once made up his mind he went on in his shrill voice without timidity or hesitation accentuating a word here and there 
 i have the misfortune alexei alexandrovich began to be a deceived husband and i desire to break off all relations with my wife by legal means that is to be divorced but do this so that my son may not remain with his mother 
 the gray eyes tried not to laugh but they were dancing with irrepressible glee and alexei alexandrovich saw that it was not simply the delight of a man who has just got a profitable job there was triumph and joy there was a gleam like the malignant gleam he had seen in his eyes 
 you desire my assistance in securing a divorce 
 yes precisely but i ought to warn you that i may be wasting your time and attention i have come simply to consult you as a preliminary step i want a divorce but the form which it may take is of great consequence to me it is very possible that if that form does not correspond with my requirements i may give up a legal action 
 oh always the case said the lawyer and always for you to decide 
 he let his eyes rest on alexei feet feeling that he might offend his client by the sight of his irrepressible amusement he looked at a moth that flew before his nose and moved his hand but did not catch it from regard for alexei situation 
 though in their general features our laws on this subject are known to me pursued alexei alexandrovich i should be glad to have an idea of the forms in which such things are done in practice 
 you would be glad the lawyer without lifting his eyes responded adopting with a certain satisfaction the tone of his remarks for me to lay before you all the methods by which you could secure what you desire 
 and on receiving an assenting nod from alexei alexandrovich he went on stealing a glance now and then at alexei face which was growing red in patches 
 divorce by our laws he said with a slight shade of disapprobation of our laws is possible as you are aware in the following cases to wait he called to a clerk who put his head in at the door but he got up all the same said a few words to him and sat down again in the following cases physical defect in the married parties desertion without communication for five years he said crooking a short finger covered with hair adultery this word he pronounced with obvious satisfaction subdivided as follows he continued to crook his fat fingers though the cases and their subdivisions could obviously not be classified together physical defect of the husband or of the wife adultery of the husband or of the wife as by now all his fingers were used up he straightened them and went on this is the theoretical view but i imagine you have done me the honor to apply to me in order to learn its application in practice and therefore guided by precedents i must inform you that in practice cases of divorce may all be reduced to the following no physical defect i may assume nor desertion 
 alexei alexandrovich bowed his head in assent 
 they may be reduced to the following adultery of one of the married parties and the detection in the fact of the guilty party by mutual agreement and failing such agreement accidental detection it must be admitted that the latter case is rarely met with in practice said the lawyer and stealing a glance at alexei alexandrovich he paused as a man selling pistols after enlarging on the advantages of each weapon might await his choice but alexei alexandrovich said nothing and therefore the lawyer went on the most usual and simple the sensible course i consider is adultery by mutual consent i should not permit myself to express it so speaking with a man of no education he said but i imagine that to you this is comprehensible 
 alexei alexandrovich was however so perturbed that he did not immediately comprehend all the reasonableness of adultery by mutual consent and his eyes expressed this uncertainty but the lawyer promptly came to his assistance 
 people cannot go on living together here you have a fact and if both are agreed about it the details and formalities become a matter of no importance and at the same time this is the simplest and most certain method 
 alexei alexandrovich understood fully now but he had religious scruples which hindered the execution of such a plan 
 that is out of the question in the present case he said only one alternative is possible involuntary detection supported by letters which i have 
 at the mention of letters the lawyer pursed up his lips and gave utterance to a thin little compassionate and contemptuous sound 
 kindly consider he began cases of that kind are as you are aware under ecclesiastical jurisdiction the reverend fathers are fond of going into the minutest details in cases of that kind he said with a smile which betrayed his sympathy with the taste of the reverend fathers letters may of course be a partial confirmation but detection in the act there must be of the most direct kind that is by eyewitnesses in fact if you do me the honor to trust me with your confidence you will do well to leave me the choice of the measures to be employed if one wants the result one must allow the means 
 if it is so alexei alexandrovich began suddenly turning white but at that moment the lawyer rose and again went to the door to speak to the intruding clerk 
 tell her we haggle over fees he said and returned to alexei alexandrovich 
 on his way back he caught unobserved another moth nice state my rep curtains will be in by the summer he thought frowning 
 and so you were saying he said 
 i will communicate my decision to you by letter said alexei alexandrovich getting up and he clutched at the table after standing a moment in silence he said from your words i may consequently conclude that a divorce may be obtained i would ask you to let me know what your terms are 
 it may be obtained if you give me complete liberty of action said the lawyer without answering his question when can i count on receiving word from you he asked moving toward the door his eyes and his shoes shining 
 in a time you will be kind enough to communicate to me your answer as to whether you will undertake to conduct the case and on what terms 
 very good sir 
 the lawyer bowed respectfully let his client out of the door and left alone gave himself up to his sense of amusement he felt so mirthful that contrary to his rule he made a reduction in his terms to the haggling lady and gave up catching moths finally deciding that next winter he must have the furniture covered with velvet like

 kindly consider he began cases of that kind are as you are aware under ecclesiastical jurisdiction the reverend fathers are fond of going into the minutest details in cases of that kind he said with a smile which betrayed his sympathy with the taste of the reverend fathers letters may of course be a partial confirmation but detection in the act there must be of the most direct kind that is by eyewitnesses in fact if you do me the honor to trust me with your confidence you will do well to leave me the choice of the measures to be employed if one wants the result one must allow the means 
 if it is so alexei alexandrovich began suddenly turning white but at that moment the lawyer rose and again went to the door to speak to the intruding clerk

 on his way back he caught unobserved another moth nice state my rep curtains will be in by the summer he thought frowning 
 and so you were saying he said 
 i will communicate my decision to you by letter said alexei alexandrovich getting up and he clutched at the table after standing a moment in silence he said from your words i may consequently conclude that a divorce may be obtained i would ask you to let me know what your terms are 
 it may be obtained if you give me complete liberty of action said the lawyer without answering his question when can i count on receiving word from you he asked moving toward the door his eyes and his shoes shining 
 in a time you will be kind enough to communicate to me your answer as to whether you will undertake to conduct the case and on what terms 
 very good sir 
 the lawyer bowed respectfully let his client out of the door and left alone gave himself up to his sense of amusement he felt so mirthful that contrary to his rule he made a reduction in his terms to the haggling lady and gave up catching moths finally deciding that next winter he must have the furniture covered with velvet like

 the waiting room of the celebrated peterburg lawyer was full when alexei alexandrovich entered it three ladies an old lady a young lady and a wife and three gentlemen one a german banker with a ring on his finger the second a merchant with a beard and the third a government clerk in official uniform with a cross on his neck had obviously been waiting a long while already two clerks were writing at tables with scratching pens the appurtenances of the writing tables about which alexei alexandrovich was himself very fastidious were exceptionally good he could not help observing this one of the clerks without getting up turned fretfully to alexei alexandrovich his eyes 
 what is it you wish 
 my business has to do with the lawyer 
 he is engaged the clerk responded severely and he pointed with his pen at the persons waiting and went on writing 
 he spare time to see me said alexei alexandrovich 
 he has no time free he is always busy kindly wait your turn 
 then i must trouble you to give him my card alexei alexandrovich said with dignity seeing the impossibility of preserving his incognito 
 the clerk took the card and obviously not approving of what he read on it went to the door 
 alexei alexandrovich was in principle in favor of the publicity of legal proceedings though for some higher official considerations he disliked the application of the principle in russia and disapproved of it as far as he could disapprove of anything instituted by authority of the emperor his whole life had been spent in administrative work and consequently when he did not approve of anything his disapproval was softened by the recognition of the inevitability of mistakes and the possibility of reform in every department in the new public law courts he disliked the restrictions laid on the lawyers conducting cases but till then he had had nothing to do with the law courts and so had disapproved of their publicity simply in theory now his disapprobation was strengthened by the unpleasant impression made on him in the waiting room 
 he will be out right away said the clerk and two minutes later there did actually appear in the doorway the large figure of an old student of jurisprudence who had been consulting with the lawyer and the lawyer himself 
 the lawyer was a little squat bald man with a dark reddish beard long eyebrows and beetling brow he was attired as though for a wedding from his cravat to his double watch chain and shoes his face was clever and rustic but his dress was dandified and in bad taste 
 pray walk in said the lawyer addressing alexei alexandrovich and gloomily ushering karenin in before him he closed the door you sit down he indicated an armchair at a writing table covered with papers he sat down himself and rubbing his little hands with short fingers covered with white hairs he bent his head on one side but as soon as he was settled in this position a moth flew over the table the lawyer with a swiftness that could never have been expected of him opened his hands caught the moth and resumed his former attitude 
 before beginning to speak of my business said alexei alexandrovich following the movements with wondering eyes i ought to observe that the matter about which i have to speak to you is to be a secret 
 the drooping reddish mustaches were stirred by a scarcely perceptible smile 
 i should not be a lawyer if i could not keep the secrets confided to me but if you would like proof 
 alexei alexandrovich glanced at his face and saw that the shrewd gray eyes were laughing and seemed to know all about it already 
 you know my name alexei alexandrovich resumed 
 i know you and the good again he caught a moth work you are doing like every russian said the lawyer bowing 
 alexei alexandrovich sighed plucking up his courage but having once made up his mind he went on in his shrill voice without timidity or hesitation accentuating a word here and there 
 i have the misfortune alexei alexandrovich began to be a deceived husband and i desire to break off all relations with my wife by legal means that is to be divorced but do this so that my son may not remain with his mother 
 the gray eyes tried not to laugh but they were dancing with irrepressible glee and alexei alexandrovich saw that it was not simply the delight of a man who has just got a profitable job there was triumph and joy there was a gleam like the malignant gleam he had seen in his eyes 
 you desire my assistance in securing a divorce 
 yes precisely but i ought to warn you that i may be wasting your time and attention i have come simply to consult you as a preliminary step i want a divorce but the form which it may take is of great consequence to me it is very possible that if that form does not correspond with my requirements i may give up a legal action 
 oh always the case said the lawyer and always for you to decide 
 he let his eyes rest on alexei feet feeling that he might offend his client by the sight of his irrepressible amusement he looked at a moth that flew before his nose and moved his hand but did not catch it from regard for alexei situation 
 though in their general features our laws on this subject are known to me pursued alexei alexandrovich i should be glad to have an idea of the forms in which such things are done in practice 
 you would be glad the lawyer without lifting his eyes responded adopting with a certain satisfaction the tone of his remarks for me to lay before you all the methods by which you could secure what you desire 
 and on receiving an assenting nod from alexei alexandrovich he went on stealing a glance now and then at alexei face which was growing red in patches 
 divorce by our laws he said with a slight shade of disapprobation of our laws is possible as you are aware in the following cases to wait he called to a clerk who put his head in at the door but he got up all the same said a few words to him and sat down again in the following cases physical defect in the married parties desertion without communication for five years he said crooking a short finger covered with hair adultery this word he pronounced with obvious satisfaction subdivided as follows he continued to crook his fat fingers though the cases and their subdivisions could obviously not be classified together physical defect of the husband or of the wife adultery of the husband or of the wife as by now all his fingers were used up he straightened them and went on this is the theoretical view but i imagine you have done me the honor to apply to me in order to learn its application in practice and therefore guided by precedents i must inform you that in practice cases of divorce may all be reduced to the following no physical defect i may assume nor desertion 
 alexei alexandrovich bowed his head in assent 
 they may be reduced to the following adultery of one of the married parties and the detection in the fact of the guilty party by mutual agreement and failing such agreement accidental detection it must be admitted that the latter case is rarely met with in practice said the lawyer and stealing a glance at alexei alexandrovich he paused as a man selling pistols after enlarging on the advantages of each weapon might await his choice but alexei alexandrovich said nothing and therefore the lawyer went on the most usual and simple the sensible course i consider is adultery by mutual consent i should not permit myself to express it so speaking with a man of no education he said but i imagine that to you this is comprehensible 
 alexei alexandrovich was however so perturbed that he did not immediately comprehend all the reasonableness of adultery by mutual consent and his eyes expressed this uncertainty but the lawyer promptly came to his assistance 
 people cannot go on living together here you have a fact and if both are agreed about it the details and formalities become a matter of no importance and at the same time this is the simplest and most certain method 
 alexei alexandrovich understood fully now but he had religious scruples which hindered the execution of such a plan 
 that is out of the question in the present case he said only one alternative is possible involuntary detection supported by letters which i have 
 at the mention of letters the lawyer pursed up his lips and gave utterance to a thin little compassionate and contemptuous sound 
 kindly consider he began cases of that kind are as you are aware under ecclesiastical jurisdiction the reverend fathers are fond of going into the minutest details in cases of that kind he said with a smile which betrayed his sympathy with the taste of the reverend fathers letters may of course be a partial confirmation but detection in the act there must be of the most direct kind that is by eyewitnesses in fact if you do me the honor to trust me with your confidence you will do well to leave me the choice of the measures to be employed if one wants the result one must allow the means 
 if it is so alexei alexandrovich began suddenly turning white but at that moment the lawyer rose and again went to the door to speak to the intruding clerk 
 tell her we haggle over fees he said and returned to alexei alexandrovich 
 on his way back he caught unobserved another moth nice state my rep curtains will be in by the summer he thought frowning 
 and so you were saying he said 
 i will communicate my decision to you by letter said alexei alexandrovich getting up and he clutched at the table after standing a moment in silence he said from your words i may consequently conclude that a divorce may be obtained i would ask you to let me know what your terms are

 alexei alexandrovich had gained a brilliant victory at the sitting of the commission of the th of august but in the sequel this victory cut the ground from under his feet the new commission for the inquiry into the condition of the native tribes on every aspect had been formed and despatched to its destination with an unusual speed and energy inspired by alexei alexandrovich within three months a report was presented the condition of the native tribes was investigated in its political administrative economic ethnographic material and religious aspects to all these questions there were answers admirably stated and answers admitting no shade of doubt since they were not a product of human thought always liable to error but were all the product of official activity the answers were all based on official data furnished by governors and bishops and founded on the reports of district magistrates and ecclesiastical superintendents founded in their turn on the reports of local authorities and parish priests and so all of these answers were unhesitating and certain all such questions as for instance the cause of crop failures why certain tribes adhered to their ancient beliefs and so on questions which but for the convenient intervention of the official machine are not and cannot be solved for ages received full unhesitating solution and this solution was in favor of alexei contention but stremov who had felt stung to the quick at the last sitting had on the reception of the report resorted to tactics which alexei alexandrovich had not anticipated stremov carrying with him several other members went over to alexei side and not contenting himself with warmly defending the measure proposed by karenin proposed other measures still more extreme in the same direction these measures still stronger than alexei fundamental idea were passed by the commission and then the aim of tactics became apparent carried to an extreme the measures seemed at once to be so absurd that the highest authorities and public opinion and intellectual ladies and the newspapers all at the same time fell foul of them expressing their indignation both with the measures and their nominal father alexei alexandrovich stremov drew back affecting to have blindly followed karenin and to be astounded and distressed at what had been done this meant the defeat of alexei alexandrovich but in spite of failing health in spite of his domestic griefs he did not give in there was a split in the commission some members with stremov at their head justified their mistake on the ground that they had put faith in the commission of revision instituted by alexei alexandrovich and maintained that the report of the commission was rubbish and simply so much wastepaper alexei alexandrovich with a following of those who saw the danger of so revolutionary an attitude to official documents persisted in upholding the statements obtained by the revising commission in consequence of this in the higher spheres and even in society all was chaos and although everyone was interested no one could tell whether the native tribes really were becoming impoverished and ruined or whether they were in a flourishing condition the position of alexei alexandrovich owing to this and partly owing to the contempt lavished on him for his infidelity became very precarious and in this position he took an important resolution to the astonishment of the commission he announced that he should ask permission to go himself to investigate the question on the spot and having obtained permission alexei alexandrovich prepared to set off to these remote provinces 
 alexei departure created a great stir the more so as just before he started he officially returned the posting fares allowed him for twelve horses to drive to his destination 
 i think it very noble betsy said about this to the princess miaghkaia why take money for posting horses when everyone knows that there are railways everywhere now 
 but princess miaghkaia did not agree and the princess opinion annoyed her indeed 
 all very well for you to talk said she when you have i know how many millions but i am very glad when my husband goes on a revising tour in the summer very good for him and pleasant traveling about and a settled arrangement for me to keep a carriage and hired coach on the money 
 on his way to the remote provinces alexei alexandrovich stopped for three days at moscow 
 the day after his arrival he went to call on the governor general at the crossroads by gazetny lane where there are always crowds of carriages and hired sleighs alexei alexandrovich suddenly heard his name called out in such a loud and cheerful voice that he could not help looking round at the corner of the pavement in a short stylish overcoat and a fashionable hat jauntily askew with a smile that showed a gleam of white teeth and red lips stood stepan arkadyevich radiant young and beaming he called him vigorously and urgently and insisted on his stopping he had one arm on the window of a carriage that was stopping at the corner and out of the window were thrust the heads of a lady in a velvet hat and two children stepan arkadyevich was smiling and beckoning to his the lady smiled a kindly smile too and she too waved her hand to alexei alexandrovich it was dolly with her children 
 alexei alexandrovich did not want to see anyone in moscow and least of all his brother he raised his hat and would have driven on but stepan arkadyevich told his coachman to stop and ran across the snow to him 
 well what a shame not to have let us know been here long i was at yesterday and saw karenin on the visitors list but it never entered my head that it was you said stepan arkadyevich sticking his head in at the window of the carriage or i should have looked you up i am glad to see you he said knocking one foot against the other to shake the snow off what a shame you did not let us know he repeated 
 i had no time i am very busy alexei alexandrovich responded dryly 
 come to my wife she does so want to see you 
 alexei alexandrovich unfolded the rug in which his frozen feet were wrapped and getting out of his carriage made his way over the snow to darya alexandrovna 
 why alexei alexandrovich what are you cutting us like this for said dolly smiling 
 i was very busy delighted to see you he said in a tone clearly indicating that he was annoyed by it how are you

 alexei alexandrovich had gained a brilliant victory at the sitting of the commission of the th of august but in the sequel this victory cut the ground from under his feet the new commission for the inquiry into the condition of the native tribes on every aspect had been formed and despatched to its destination with an unusual speed and energy inspired by alexei alexandrovich within three months a report was presented the condition of the native tribes was investigated in its political administrative economic ethnographic material and religious aspects to all these questions there were answers admirably stated and answers admitting no shade of doubt since they were not a product of human thought always liable to error but were all the product of official activity the answers were all based on official data furnished by governors and bishops and founded on the reports of district magistrates and ecclesiastical superintendents founded in their turn on the reports of local authorities and parish priests and so all of these answers were unhesitating and certain all such questions as for instance the cause of crop failures why certain tribes adhered to their ancient beliefs and so on questions which but for the convenient intervention of the official machine are not and cannot be solved for ages received full unhesitating solution and this solution was in favor of alexei contention but stremov who had felt stung to the quick at the last sitting had on the reception of the report resorted to tactics which alexei alexandrovich had not anticipated stremov carrying with him several other members went over to alexei side and not contenting himself with warmly defending the measure proposed by karenin proposed other measures still more extreme in the same direction these measures still stronger than alexei fundamental idea were passed by the commission and then the aim of tactics became apparent carried to an extreme the measures seemed at once to be so absurd that the highest authorities and public opinion and intellectual ladies and the newspapers all at the same time fell foul of them expressing their indignation both with the measures and their nominal father alexei alexandrovich stremov drew back affecting to have blindly followed karenin and to be astounded and distressed at what had been done this meant the defeat of alexei alexandrovich but in spite of failing health in spite of his domestic griefs he did not give in there was a split in the commission some members with stremov at their head justified their mistake on the ground that they had put faith in the commission of revision instituted by alexei alexandrovich and maintained that the report of the commission was rubbish and simply so much wastepaper alexei alexandrovich with a following of those who saw the danger of so revolutionary an attitude to official documents persisted in upholding the statements obtained by the revising commission in consequence of this in the higher spheres and even in society all was chaos and although everyone was interested no one could tell whether the native tribes really were becoming impoverished and ruined or whether they were in a flourishing condition the position of alexei alexandrovich owing to this and partly owing to the contempt lavished on him for his infidelity became very precarious and in this position he took an important resolution to the astonishment of the commission he announced that he should ask permission to go himself to investigate the question on the spot and having obtained permission alexei alexandrovich prepared to set off to these remote provinces 
 alexei departure created a great stir the more so as just before he started he officially returned the posting fares allowed him for twelve horses to drive to his destination 
 i think it very noble betsy said about this to the princess miaghkaia why take money for posting horses when everyone knows that there are railways everywhere now 
 but princess miaghkaia did not agree and the princess opinion annoyed her indeed 
 all very well for you to talk said she when you have i know how many millions but i am very glad when my husband goes on a revising tour in the summer very good for him and pleasant traveling about and a settled arrangement for me to keep a carriage and hired coach on the money 
 on his way to the remote provinces alexei alexandrovich stopped for three days at moscow 
 the day after his arrival he went to call on the governor general at the crossroads by gazetny lane where there are always crowds of carriages and hired sleighs alexei alexandrovich suddenly heard his name called out in such a loud and cheerful voice that he could not help looking round at the corner of the pavement in a short stylish overcoat and a fashionable hat jauntily askew with a smile that showed a gleam of white teeth and red lips stood stepan arkadyevich radiant young and beaming he called him vigorously and urgently and insisted on his stopping he had one arm on the window of a carriage that was stopping at the corner and out of the window were thrust the heads of a lady in a velvet hat and two children stepan arkadyevich was smiling and beckoning to his the lady smiled a kindly smile too and she too waved her hand to alexei alexandrovich it was dolly with her children 
 alexei alexandrovich did not want to see anyone in moscow and least of all his brother he raised his hat and would have driven on but stepan arkadyevich told his coachman to stop and ran across the snow to him 
 well what a shame not to have let us know been here long i was at yesterday and saw karenin on the visitors list but it never entered my head that it was you said stepan arkadyevich sticking his head in at the window of the carriage or i should have looked you up i am glad to see you he said knocking one foot against the other to shake the snow off what a shame you did not let us know he repeated 
 i had no time i am very busy alexei alexandrovich responded dryly 
 come to my wife she does so want to see you 
 alexei alexandrovich unfolded the rug in which his frozen feet were wrapped and getting out of his carriage made his way over the snow to darya alexandrovna 
 why alexei alexandrovich what are you cutting us like this for said dolly smiling 
 i was very busy delighted to see you he said in a tone clearly indicating that he was annoyed by it how are you 
 tell me how is my darling anna 
 alexei alexandrovich mumbled something and would have gone on but stepan arkadyevich stopped him 
 i tell you what do tomorrow dolly ask him to dinner ask koznishev and pestsov so as to entertain him with our moscow intellectuals 
 yes please do come said dolly we will expect you at five or six if you like how is my darling anna how long 
 she is quite well alexei alexandrovich mumbled frowning delighted and he moved away toward his carriage 
 you will come dolly called after him 
 alexei alexandrovich said something which dolly could not catch in the noise of the moving carriages 
 i shall come round tomorrow stepan arkadyevich shouted to him 
 alexei alexandrovich got into his carriage and buried himself in it so as neither to see nor to be seen 
 queer fish said stepan arkadyevich to his wife and glancing at his watch he made a motion of his hand before his face indicating a caress to his wife and children and walked jauntily along the pavement 
 stiva stiva dolly called reddening 
 he turned round 
 i must get coats you know for grisha and tania give me the money 
 never mind you tell them pay the bill and he vanished nodding genially to an acquaintance who drove by

 the next day was sunday stepan arkadyevich went to the grand theater to a rehearsal of the ballet and gave masha chibisova a pretty dancing girl who had been engaged through his protection the coral necklace he had promised her the evening before and behind the scenes in the dim daylight of the theater managed to kiss her pretty little face radiant over the present besides the gift of the necklace he wanted to arrange a meeting with her after the ballet after explaining that he could not come at the beginning of the ballet he promised he would come for the last act and take her to supper from the theater stepan arkadyevich drove to okhotny riad selected himself the fish and asparagus for dinner and by twelve was at where he had to see three people luckily all staying at the same hotel levin who had recently come back from abroad and was staying there the new head of his board who had just been promoted to that position and had come on a tour of revision to moscow and his karenin whom he must see so as to be sure of bringing him to dinner 
 stepan arkadyevich liked dining but still better he liked to give a dinner small but very choice both as regards the food and drink and as regards the selection of guests he particularly liked the program of that dinner there would be fresh perch asparagus and la pice de rsistance but quite plain roast beef and wines to suit so much for the eating and drinking kitty and levin would be of the party and so that this might not be obtrusively evident there would be a girl cousin too and young shcherbatsky and la piece de resistance among the guests sergei koznishev and alexei alexandrovich sergei ivanovich was a moscow man and a philosopher alexei alexandrovich a peterburg man and a practical politician he was asking too the eccentric enthusiast pestsov a liberal a great talker a musician a historian and the most delightfully youthful person of fifty who would be a sauce or garnish for koznishev and karenin he would provoke them and set them off against one another 
 the second installment for the forest had been received from the merchant and was not yet exhausted dolly had been very amiable and of late and the idea of the dinner pleased stepan arkadyevich from every point of view he was in the most lighthearted mood there were two circumstances a little unpleasant but these two circumstances were drowned in the sea of gaiety which flooded the soul of stepan arkadyevich these two circumstances were first that on meeting alexei alexandrovich the day before in the street stiva had noticed that the latter was cold and reserved with him and putting together the expression of alexei face and the fact that he had not come to see them or let them know of his arrival with the rumors he had heard about anna and vronsky stepan arkadyevich guessed that something was wrong between the husband and wife 
 that was one disagreeable thing the other slightly disagreeable fact was that the new head of his board like all new heads already had the reputation of a terrible person who got up at six in the morning worked like a horse and insisted on his subordinates working in the same way moreover this new head had the further reputation of being a bear in his manners and was according to all reports a man of a class in all respects the opposite of that to which his predecessor had belonged and to which stepan arkadyevich had hitherto belonged himself on the previous day stepan arkadyevich had appeared at the office in a uniform and the new chief had been very affable and had talked to him as to an acquaintance consequently stepan arkadyevich deemed it his duty to call upon him in his nonofficial dress the thought that the new chief might not give him a warm reception was the other unpleasant thing but stepan arkadyevich instinctively felt that everything would come round all right all human all men like us poor sinners why be nasty and quarrelsome he thought as he went into the hotel 
 good day vassilii he said walking into the corridor with his hat cocked on one side and addressing a footman he knew why let your whiskers grow levin number seven eh take me up please and find out whether count anychkin this was the new head is receiving 
 yes sir vassilii responded smiling not been to see us for a long while 
 i was here yesterday but at the other entrance is this number seven 
 levin was standing with a peasant from tver in the middle of the room measuring a fresh bearskin when stepan arkadyevich came in 
 what you killed him cried stepan arkadyevich well done a how are you arkhip 
 he shook hands with the peasant and sat down on a chair without taking off his coat and hat 
 come take off your coat and stay a little said levin taking his hat 
 no i time only looked in for just a second answered stepan arkadyevich he threw open his fur coat but afterward did take it off and sat on for a whole hour talking to levin about hunting and the most intimate subjects come tell me please what you did abroad where have you been said stepan arkadyevich when the peasant had gone 
 oh i stayed in germany in prussia in france and in england not in the capitals but in the manufacturing towns and saw a great deal that was new to me and glad i went 
 yes i knew your idea of the solution of the labor question 
 not a bit in russia there can be no labor question in russia the question is that of the relation of the working people to the land though the question exists there too but there a matter of repairing been ruined while with us 
 stepan arkadyevich listened attentively to levin 
 yes yes he said very possible right but glad in good spirits and are hunting bears and working and interested shcherbatsky told me another story he met you that you were in such a depressed state talking of nothing but death 
 well what of it not given up thinking of death said levin true that high time i was dead and that all this is nonsense the truth telling you i do value my idea and my work awfully but really do consider this all this world of ours is nothing but a speck of mildew which has grown up on a tiny planet and yet we think that something great is possible to us ideas work grains of sand all they are 
 but all as old as the hills my boy 
 it is old but do you know when you grasp this fully then somehow everything becomes of no consequence when you understand that you will die tomorrow if not today and nothing will be left then everything is so unimportant and i consider my idea very important but it turns out really to be just as unimportant even if it were carried out as outwitting that so one goes on living amusing oneself with hunting with work anything so as not to think of death 
 stepan arkadyevich smiled a subtle and affectionate smile as he listened to levin 
 well of course here come round to my point do you remember you attacked me for seeking enjoyment in life 
 be o moralist severe 
 no all the same fine in life is levin hesitated oh i know all i know is that we shall soon be dead 
 why so soon 
 and i know less charm in life when one thinks of death but more peace 
 on the contrary the finish is always the best but i must be going said stepan arkadyevich getting up for the tenth time 
 oh no stay a bit said levin detaining him now when shall we see each other again going tomorrow 
 a fine fellow why just what i came for you simply must come to dinner with us today your coming and karenin my 
 you mean to say here said levin and he wanted to inquire about kitty he had heard at the beginning of the winter that she was at peterburg with her sister the wife of the diplomat and he did not know whether she had come back or not but he changed his mind and did not ask whether coming or not i care he said to himself 
 so come 
 of course 
 at five then and wear a frock coat 
 and stepan arkadyevich got up and went down below to the new head of his department instinct had not misled stepan arkadyevich the terrible new head turned out to be an extremely amenable person and stepan arkadyevich lunched with him and stayed on so that it was past three before he got to alexei alexandrovich

 oh i stayed in germany in prussia in france and in england not in the capitals but in the manufacturing towns and saw a great deal that was new to me and glad i went 
 yes i knew your idea of the solution of the labor question 
 not a bit in russia there can be no labor question in russia the question is that of the relation of the working people to the land though the question exists there too but there a matter of repairing been ruined while with us 
 stepan arkadyevich listened attentively to levin 
 yes yes he said very possible right but glad in good spirits and are hunting bears and working and interested shcherbatsky told me another story he met you that you were in such a depressed state talking of nothing but death 
 well what of it not given up thinking of death said levin true that high time i was dead and that all this is nonsense the truth telling you i do value my idea and my work awfully but really do consider this all this world of ours is nothing but a speck of mildew which has grown up on a tiny planet and yet we think that something great is possible to us ideas work grains of sand all they are 
 but all as old as the hills my boy 
 it is old but do you know when you grasp this fully then somehow everything becomes of no consequence when you understand that you will die tomorrow if not today and nothing will be left then everything is so unimportant and i consider my idea very important but it turns out really to be just as unimportant even if it were carried out as outwitting that so one goes on living amusing oneself with hunting with work anything so as not to think of death 
 stepan arkadyevich smiled a subtle and affectionate smile as he listened to levin 
 well of course here come round to my point do you remember you attacked me for seeking enjoyment in life 
 be o moralist severe 
 no all the same fine in life is levin hesitated oh i know all i know is that we shall soon be dead 
 why so soon 
 and i know less charm in life when one thinks of death but more peace 
 on the contrary the finish is always the best but i must be going said stepan arkadyevich getting up for the tenth time 
 oh no stay a bit said levin detaining him now when shall we see each other again going tomorrow 
 a fine fellow why just what i came for you simply must come to dinner with us today your coming and karenin my 
 you mean to say here said levin and he wanted to inquire about kitty he had heard at the beginning of the winter that she was at peterburg with her sister the wife of the diplomat and he did not know whether she had come back or not but he changed his mind and did not ask whether coming or not i care he said to himself 
 so come 
 of course 
 at five then and wear a frock coat 
 and stepan arkadyevich got up and went down below to the new head of his department instinct had not misled stepan arkadyevich the terrible new head turned out to be an extremely amenable person and stepan arkadyevich lunched with him and stayed on so that it was past three before he got to alexei alexandrovich

 alexei alexandrovich on coming back from church service had spent the whole morning indoors he had two pieces of business before him that morning first to receive and send on a deputation from the native tribes which was on its way to peterburg and which was now at moscow secondly to write the promised letter to the lawyer the deputation though it had been summoned at alexei instigation was not without its discomforting and even dangerous aspect and he was glad he had found it in moscow the members of this deputation had not the slightest conception of their duty and the part they were to play they naively believed that it was their business to lay before the commission their needs and the actual condition of things and to ask assistance of the government and utterly failed to grasp that some of their statements and requests supported the contention of the side and so spoiled the whole business alexei alexandrovich was busily engaged with them for a long while drew up a program for them from which they were not to depart and on dismissing them wrote a letter to peterburg for the guidance of the deputation he had his chief support in this affair in the countess lidia ivanovna she was a specialist in the matter of deputations and no one knew better than she how to puff and put them in the way they should go having completed this task alexei alexandrovich wrote the letter to the lawyer without the slightest hesitation he gave him permission to act as he might judge best in the letter he enclosed three of notes to anna which were in the portfolio he had taken away 
 since alexei alexandrovich had left home with the intention of not returning to his family again and since he had been at the and had spoken though only to one man of his intention since moreover he had translated the matter from the world of real life to the world of ink and paper he had grown more and more used to his own intention and by now distinctly perceived the feasibility of its execution 
 he was sealing the envelope to the lawyer when he heard the loud tones of stepan voice stepan arkadyevich was disputing with alexei servant and insisting on being announced 
 no matter thought alexei alexandrovich so much the better i will inform him at once of my position in regard to his sister and explain why it is i dine with him 
 come in he said aloud collecting his papers and putting them under the blotting pad 
 there you see talking nonsense and he is at home responded stepan voice addressing the servant who had refused to let him in and taking off his coat as he went oblonsky walked into the room well awfully glad found you so i hope stepan arkadyevich began cheerfully 
 i cannot come alexei alexandrovich said coldly standing and not asking his visitor to sit down 
 alexei alexandrovich had thought to pass at once into those frigid relations in which he ought to stand with the brother of a wife against whom he was beginning a suit for divorce but he had not taken into account the ocean of kindliness brimming over in the heart of stepan arkadyevich 
 stepan arkadyevich opened wide his clear shining eyes 
 why you what do you mean he asked in perplexity speaking in french oh but a promise and all counting on you 
 i want to tell you that i dine at your house because the terms of relationship which have existed between us must cease 
 how how do you mean for what reason said stepan arkadyevich with a smile 
 because i am beginning an action for divorce against your sister my wife i ought to have 
 but before alexei alexandrovich had time to finish his sentence stepan arkadyevich was behaving not at all as he had expected stepan arkadyevich groaned and sank into an armchair 
 no alexei alexandrovich what are you saying cried oblonsky and his suffering was apparent in his face 
 it is so 
 excuse me i i believe it 
 alexei alexandrovich sat down feeling that his words had not had the effect he anticipated and that it would be unavoidable for him to explain his position and that whatever explanations he might make his relations with his would remain unchanged 
 yes i am brought to the painful necessity of seeking a divorce he said 
 i will say one thing alexei alexandrovich i know you for an excellent upright man i know anna excuse me i change my opinion of her for a good an excellent woman and so you must excuse me if i cannot believe it there is some misunderstanding said he 
 oh if it were merely a misunderstanding 
 pardon i understand interposed stepan arkadyevich but of course one thing you must not act in haste you must not you must not act in haste 
 i am not acting in haste alexei alexandrovich said coldly but one cannot ask advice of anyone in such a matter i have quite made up my mind 
 this is awful said stepan arkadyevich i would do one thing alexei alexandrovich i beseech you do it he said no action has yet been taken if i understand rightly before you take advice see my wife talk to her she loves anna like a sister she loves you and a wonderful woman for sake talk to her do me that favor i beseech you 
 alexei alexandrovich pondered and stepan arkadyevich looked at him sympathetically without interrupting his silence 
 you will go to see her 
 i know that was just why i have not been to see you i imagine our relations must change 
 why so i see that allow me to believe that apart from our connection you have for me at least in part the same friendly feeling i have always had for you and sincere esteem said stepan arkadyevich pressing his hand even if your worst suppositions were correct i and never would take on myself to judge either side and i see no reason why our relations should be affected but now do this come and see my wife 
 well we look at the matter differently said alexei alexandrovich coldly however we discuss it 
 no why you come today to dine anyway my expecting you please do come and above all talk it over with her a wonderful woman for sake on my knees i implore you 
 if you so much wish it i will come said alexei alexandrovich sighing 
 and anxious to change the conversation he inquired about what interested them both the new head of stepan board a man not yet old who had suddenly been promoted to so high a position 
 alexei alexandrovich had previously felt no liking for count anychkin and had always differed from him in his opinions but now from a feeling readily comprehensible to officials that hatred felt by one who has suffered a defeat in the service for one who has received a promotion he could not endure him 
 well have you seen him said alexei alexandrovich with a malignant smile 
 of course he was at our sitting yesterday he seems to know his work capitally and to be very energetic 
 yes but what is his energy directed to said alexei alexandrovich is he aiming at doing anything or simply doing again been done the great misfortune of our government this paper administration of which a worthy representative 
 really i know what fault one could find with him his policy i know but one thing is certain a very fine fellow answered stepan arkadyevich just been seeing him and really a fine fellow we lunched together and i taught him how to make you know that drink wine and oranges so cooling and a wonder he know it he liked it awfully no really a fine fellow 
 stepan arkadyevich glanced at his watch 
 why good heavens four already and still to go to so please come round to dinner you imagine how you will grieve my wife and me if you 
 the way in which alexei alexandrovich saw his out was very different from the manner in which he had met him 
 promised and come he answered wearily 
 believe me i appreciate it and i hope you regret it answered stepan arkadyevich smiling 
 and putting on his coat as he went he patted the footman on the head with his coat sleeve chuckled and went out 
 at five and wear your frock coat please he shouted once more returning at the door

 it was past five and several guests had already arrived before the host himself got home he went in together with sergei ivanovich koznishev and with pestsov both of whom had reached the street door at the same moment these were the two leading representatives of the moscow intellectuals as oblonsky had called them both were men respected for their character and their intelligence they respected each other but were in complete and hopeless disagreement upon almost every subject not because they belonged to opposite parties but precisely because they were of the same party their enemies refused to see any distinction between their views but in that party each had his own special shade of opinion and since no difference is less easily overcome than the difference of opinion about semiabstract questions they never agreed on any opinion and indeed had long been accustomed to jeer without anger at each incorrigible aberrations 
 they were just going in at the door talking of the weather when stepan arkadyevich overtook them in the drawing room there were already sitting prince alexander dmitrievich shcherbatsky young shcherbatsky turovtsin kitty and karenin 
 stepan arkadyevich saw immediately that things were not going well in the drawing room without him darya alexandrovna in her best gray silk gown obviously worried about the children who were to have their dinner by themselves in the nursery and by her absence was not equal to the task of making the party mix without him all were sitting like so many priests daughters on a visit so the old prince expressed it obviously wondering why they were there and pumping up remarks simply to avoid being silent turovtsin goodhearted man felt unmistakably like a fish out of water and the smile with which his thick lips greeted stepan arkadyevich said as plainly as words well old boy you have popped me down in a learned set a drinking party and the chateau des fleurs would be more in my line the old prince sat in silence his bright little eyes watching karenin with a sidelong look and stepan arkadyevich saw that he had already formed a sharp remark to sum up that politician of whom guests had been invited to partake as though he were a sturgeon kitty was looking at the door calling up all her energies to keep her from blushing at the entrance of konstantin levin young shcherbatsky who had not been introduced to karenin was trying to look as though he were not in the least embarrassed by it karenin himself had followed the peterburg etiquette for a dinner with ladies present and was wearing evening dress and a white tie stepan arkadyevich saw by his face that he had come simply to keep his promise and was performing a disagreeable duty in being present at this gathering he was indeed the person chiefly responsible for the chill benumbing all the guests before stepan arkadyevich came in 
 on entering the drawing room stepan arkadyevich apologized explaining that he had been detained by that prince who was always the scapegoat for all his absences and unpunctualities and in one moment he had made all the guests acquainted with each other and bringing together alexei alexandrovich and sergei koznishev had started them on a discussion of the russification of poland into which they immediately plunged with pestsov slapping turovtsin on the shoulder he whispered something comic in his ear and set him down by his wife and the old prince then he told kitty she was looking very pretty that evening and presented shcherbatsky to karenin in a moment he had so kneaded together the social dough that the drawing room became very lively and there was a merry buzz of voices konstantin levin was the only person who had not arrived but this was so much the better as going into the dining room stepan arkadyevich found to his horror that the port and sherry had been procured from depre and not from leve and directing that the coachman should be sent off as speedily as possible to he started back to the drawing room 
 in the dining room he was met by konstantin levin 
 not late 
 you can never help being late said stepan arkadyevich taking his arm 
 have you a lot of people here asked levin unable to help blushing as he knocked the snow off his cap with his glove 
 all our own set here come along introduce you to karenin 
 stepan arkadyevich for all his liberal views was well aware that to meet karenin was sure to be felt a flattering distinction and so treated his best friends to this honor but at that instant konstantin levin was not in a condition to feel all the gratification of making such an acquaintance he had not seen kitty since that memorable evening when he met vronsky not counting that is the moment when he had had a glimpse of her on the highroad he had known at the bottom of his heart that he would see her here today but to keep his thoughts free he had tried to persuade himself that he did not know it now when he heard that she was here he was suddenly conscious of such delight and at the same time of such dread that his breath failed him and he could not utter what he wanted to say 
 what is she like what is she like as she used to be or as she was in the carriage what if darya alexandrovna told the truth why it be the truth he thought 
 oh please introduce me to karenin he brought out with an effort and with a desperately determined step he walked into the drawing room and beheld her 
 she was not the same as she used to be nor was she as she had been in the carriage she was quite different 
 she was scared shy shamefaced and because of all this still more charming she saw him the very instant he walked into the room she had been expecting him she was delighted and so confused at her own delight that there was a moment the moment when he went up to her sister and glanced again at her when she and he and dolly who saw it all thought she would break down and begin to cry she crimsoned turned white crimsoned again and grew faint waiting with quivering lips for him to come to her he went up to her bowed and held out his hand without speaking except for the slight quiver of her lips and the moisture in her eyes making them brighter her smile was almost calm as she said 
 how long it is since seen each other and with desperate determination with her cold hand squeezed his 
 not seen me but seen you said levin with a radiant smile of happiness i saw you when you were driving from the railway station to ergushovo 
 when she asked wondering 
 you were driving to ergushovo said levin feeling as if he would sob with the rapture that was flooding his heart and how dared i associate a thought of anything not innocent with this touching creature and yes i do believe what darya alexandrovna told me is true he thought 
 stepan arkadyevich took him by the arm and led him away to karenin 
 let me introduce you he mentioned their names 
 very glad to meet you again said alexei alexandrovich coldly shaking hands with levin 
 you are acquainted stepan arkadyevich asked in surprise 
 we spent three hours together in the train said levin smiling but got out just as in a masquerade quite mystified at least i was 
 oh so it come along please said stepan arkadyevich pointing in the direction of the dining room 
 the men went into the dining room and went up to the table for hors laid with six sorts of vodka and as many kinds of cheese some with little silver spades and some without caviar herrings preserves of various kinds and plates with slices of french bread 
 the men stood round the spirits and salt delicacies and the discussion of the russification of poland between koznishev karenin and pestsov died down in anticipation of dinner 
 sergei ivanovich was unequaled in his skill in winding up the most heated and serious argument by some unexpected pinch of attic salt that changed the disposition of his opponent he did this now 
 alexei alexandrovich had been maintaining that the russification of poland could only be accomplished as a result of greater principles which ought to be introduced by the russian government 
 pestsov insisted that one country can absorb another only when it is the more densely populated 
 koznishev admitted both points but with limitations as they were going out of the drawing room to conclude the argument koznishev said smiling 
 so then for the russification of our foreign populations there is but one method to bring up as many children as one can my brother and i are terribly at fault i see you married men especially you stepan arkadyevich are the real patriots what number have you reached he said smiling genially at their host and holding out a tiny wineglass to him 
 everyone laughed and stepan arkadyevich with particular good humor 
 oh yes the best method he said munching cheese and filling the wineglass with a special sort of vodka the conversation dropped at the jest 
 this cheese is not bad shall i give you some said the master of the house why have you been going in for gymnastics again he asked levin pinching his muscle with his left hand levin smiled bent his arm and under stepan fingers the muscles swelled up like a sound cheese hard as a knob of iron through the fine cloth of the coat 
 what biceps a perfect samson 
 i imagine great strength is needed for hunting bears observed alexei alexandrovich who had the mistiest notions about the chase he cut off and spread with cheese a wafer of bread fine as a spiderweb 
 levin smiled 
 not at all quite the contrary a child can kill a bear he said with a slight bow moving aside for the ladies who were approaching the hors table 
 you have killed a bear been told said kitty trying assiduously to catch with her fork a perverse mushroom that would slip away and shaking the lace over her white arm are there bears on your place she added turning her charming little head to him and smiling 
 there was apparently nothing extraordinary in what she said but what unutterable meaning there was for him in every sound in every turn of her lips her eyes her hand as she said it there was entreaty for forgiveness and trust in him and tenderness soft timid tenderness and promise and hope and love for him which he could not but believe in and which suffocated him with happiness 
 no been hunting in the tver province it was coming back from there that i met your in the train or your he said with a smile it was an amusing meeting 
 and he began telling with droll good humor how after not sleeping all night he had wearing a coat got into alexei compartment 
 the conductor forgetting the proverb would have chucked me out on account of my attire but thereupon i began expressing my feelings in elevated language and you too he said addressing karenin and forgetting his name at first would have ejected me on the ground of my coat but afterward you took my part for which i am extremely grateful 
 the rights of passengers generally to choose their seats are too said alexei alexandrovich rubbing the tips of his fingers on his handkerchief 
 i saw you were in uncertainty about me said levin smiling but i made haste to plunge into intellectual conversation to smooth over the defects of my attire 
 sergei ivanovich while he kept a conversation with their hostess had one ear for his brother and he glanced askance at him what is the matter with him today why such a conquering hero he thought he did not know that levin was feeling as though he had grown wings levin knew she was listening to his words and that she was glad to listen to him and this was the only thing that interested him not in that room only but in the whole world there existed for him only himself with enormously increased importance and dignity in his own eyes and she he felt himself on a pinnacle that made him giddy and far away down below were all those kind excellent karenins oblonskys and all the world 
 quite without attracting notice without glancing at them as though there were no other places left stepan arkadyevich put levin and kitty side by side 
 oh you may as well sit there he said to levin 
 the dinner was as choice as the china of which stepan arkadyevich was a connoisseur the soupe was a splendid success the tiny patties eaten with it melted in the mouth and were irreproachable the two footmen and matvei in white cravats did their duty with the dishes and wines unobtrusively quietly and dexterously on the material side the dinner was a success it was no less so on the immaterial the conversation at times general and at times between individuals never paused and toward the end the company was so lively that the men rose from the table without stopping speaking and even alexei alexandrovich became lively

 it was past five and several guests had already arrived before the host himself got home he went in together with sergei ivanovich koznishev and with pestsov both of whom had reached the street door at the same moment these were the two leading representatives of the moscow intellectuals as oblonsky had called them both were men respected for their character and their intelligence they respected each other but were in complete and hopeless disagreement upon almost every subject not because they belonged to opposite parties but precisely because they were of the same party their enemies refused to see any distinction between their views but in that party each had his own special shade of opinion and since no difference is less easily overcome than the difference of opinion about semiabstract questions they never agreed on any opinion and indeed had long been accustomed to jeer without anger at each incorrigible aberrations 
 they were just going in at the door talking of the weather when stepan arkadyevich overtook them in the drawing room there were already sitting prince alexander dmitrievich shcherbatsky young shcherbatsky turovtsin kitty and karenin 
 stepan arkadyevich saw immediately that things were not going well in the drawing room without him darya alexandrovna in her best gray silk gown obviously worried about the children who were to have their dinner by themselves in the nursery and by her absence was not equal to the task of making the party mix without him all were sitting like so many priests daughters on a visit so the old prince expressed it obviously wondering why they were there and pumping up remarks simply to avoid being silent turovtsin goodhearted man felt unmistakably like a fish out of water and the smile with which his thick lips greeted stepan arkadyevich said as plainly as words well old boy you have popped me down in a learned set a drinking party and the chateau des fleurs would be more in my line the old prince sat in silence his bright little eyes watching karenin with a sidelong look and stepan arkadyevich saw that he had already formed a sharp remark to sum up that politician of whom guests had been invited to partake as though he were a sturgeon kitty was looking at the door calling up all her energies to keep her from blushing at the entrance of konstantin levin young shcherbatsky who had not been introduced to karenin was trying to look as though he were not in the least embarrassed by it karenin himself had followed the peterburg etiquette for a dinner with ladies present and was wearing evening dress and a white tie stepan arkadyevich saw by his face that he had come simply to keep his promise and was performing a disagreeable duty in being present at this gathering he was indeed the person chiefly responsible for the chill benumbing all the guests before stepan arkadyevich came in 
 on entering the drawing room stepan arkadyevich apologized explaining that he had been detained by that prince who was always the scapegoat for all his absences and unpunctualities and in one moment he had made all the guests acquainted with each other and bringing together alexei alexandrovich and sergei koznishev had started them on a discussion of the russification of poland into which they immediately plunged with pestsov slapping turovtsin on the shoulder he whispered something comic in his ear and set him down by his wife and the old prince then he told kitty she was looking very pretty that evening and presented shcherbatsky to karenin in a moment he had so kneaded together the social dough that the drawing room became very lively and there was a merry buzz of voices konstantin levin was the only person who had not arrived but this was so much the better as going into the dining room stepan arkadyevich found to his horror that the port and sherry had been procured from depre and not from leve and directing that the coachman should be sent off as speedily as possible to he started back to the drawing room 
 in the dining room he was met by konstantin levin 
 not late 
 you can never help being late said stepan arkadyevich taking his arm 
 have you a lot of people here asked levin unable to help blushing as he knocked the snow off his cap with his glove 
 all our own set here come along introduce you to karenin 
 stepan arkadyevich for all his liberal views was well aware that to meet karenin was sure to be felt a flattering distinction and so treated his best friends to this honor but at that instant konstantin levin was not in a condition to feel all the gratification of making such an acquaintance he had not seen kitty since that memorable evening when he met vronsky not counting that is the moment when he had had a glimpse of her on the highroad he had known at the bottom of his heart that he would see her here today but to keep his thoughts free he had tried to persuade himself that he did not know it now when he heard that she was here he was suddenly conscious of such delight and at the same time of such dread that his breath failed him and he could not utter what he wanted to say 
 what is she like what is she like as she used to be or as she was in the carriage what if darya alexandrovna told the truth why it be the truth he thought 
 oh please introduce me to karenin he brought out with an effort and with a desperately determined step he walked into the drawing room and beheld her 
 she was not the same as she used to be nor was she as she had been in the carriage she was quite different 
 she was scared shy shamefaced and because of all this still more charming she saw him the very instant he walked into the room she had been expecting him she was delighted and so confused at her own delight that there was a moment the moment when he went up to her sister and glanced again at her when she and he and dolly who saw it all thought she would break down and begin to cry she crimsoned turned white crimsoned again and grew faint waiting with quivering lips for him to come to her he went up to her bowed and held out his hand without speaking except for the slight quiver of her lips and the moisture in her eyes making them brighter her smile was almost calm as she said 
 how long it is since seen each other and with desperate determination with her cold hand squeezed his 
 not seen me but seen you said levin with a radiant smile of happiness i saw you when you were driving from the railway station to ergushovo 
 when she asked wondering 
 you were driving to ergushovo said levin feeling as if he would sob with the rapture that was flooding his heart and how dared i associate a thought of anything not innocent with this touching creature and yes i do believe what darya alexandrovna told me is true he thought 
 stepan arkadyevich took him by the arm and led him away to karenin 
 let me introduce you he mentioned their names 
 very glad to meet you again said alexei alexandrovich coldly shaking hands with levin 
 you are acquainted stepan arkadyevich asked in surprise 
 we spent three hours together in the train said levin smiling but got out just as in a masquerade quite mystified at least i was 
 oh so it come along please said stepan arkadyevich pointing in the direction of the dining room 
 the men went into the dining room and went up to the table for hors laid with six sorts of vodka and as many kinds of cheese some with little silver spades and some without caviar herrings preserves of various kinds and plates with slices of french bread 
 the men stood round the spirits and salt delicacies and the discussion of the russification of poland between koznishev karenin and pestsov died down in anticipation of dinner 
 sergei ivanovich was unequaled in his skill in winding up the most heated and serious argument by some unexpected pinch of attic salt that changed the disposition of his opponent he did this now 
 alexei alexandrovich had been maintaining that the russification of poland could only be accomplished as a result of greater principles which ought to be introduced by the russian government 
 pestsov insisted that one country can absorb another only when it is the more densely populated 
 koznishev admitted both points but with limitations as they were going out of the drawing room to conclude the argument koznishev said smiling 
 so then for the russification of our foreign populations there is but one method to bring up as many children as one can my brother and i are terribly at fault i see you married men especially you stepan arkadyevich are the real patriots what number have you reached he said smiling genially at their host and holding out a tiny wineglass to him 
 everyone laughed and stepan arkadyevich with particular good humor 
 oh yes the best method he said munching cheese and filling the wineglass with a special sort of vodka the conversation dropped at the jest 
 this cheese is not bad shall i give you some said the master of the house why have you been going in for gymnastics again he asked levin pinching his muscle with his left hand levin smiled bent his arm and under stepan fingers the muscles swelled up like a sound cheese hard as a knob of iron through the fine cloth of the coat 
 what biceps a perfect samson 
 i imagine great strength is needed for hunting bears observed alexei alexandrovich who had the mistiest notions about the chase he cut off and spread with cheese a wafer of bread fine as a spiderweb 
 levin smiled 
 not at all quite the contrary a child can kill a bear he said with a slight bow moving aside for the ladies who were approaching the hors table 
 you have killed a bear been told said kitty trying assiduously to catch with her fork a perverse mushroom that would slip away and shaking the lace over her white arm are there bears on your place she added turning her charming little head to him and smiling 
 there was apparently nothing extraordinary in what she said but what unutterable meaning there was for him in every sound in every turn of her lips her eyes her hand as she said it there was entreaty for forgiveness and trust in him and tenderness soft timid tenderness and promise and hope and love for him which he could not but believe in and which suffocated him with happiness 
 no been hunting in the tver province it was coming back from there that i met your in the train or your he said with a smile it was an amusing meeting 
 and he began telling with droll good humor how after not sleeping all night he had wearing a coat got into alexei compartment 
 the conductor forgetting the proverb would have chucked me out on account of my attire but thereupon i began expressing my feelings in elevated language and you too he said addressing karenin and forgetting his name at first would have ejected me on the ground of my coat but afterward you took my part for which i am extremely grateful 
 the rights of passengers generally to choose their seats are too said alexei alexandrovich rubbing the tips of his fingers on his handkerchief 
 i saw you were in uncertainty about me said levin smiling but i made haste to plunge into intellectual conversation to smooth over the defects of my attire 
 sergei ivanovich while he kept a conversation with their hostess had one ear for his brother and he glanced askance at him what is the matter with him today why such a conquering hero he thought he did not know that levin was feeling as though he had grown wings levin knew she was listening to his words and that she was glad to listen to him and this was the only thing that interested him not in that room only but in the whole world there existed for him only himself with enormously increased importance and dignity in his own eyes and she he felt himself on a pinnacle that made him giddy and far away down below were all those kind excellent karenins oblonskys and all the world 
 quite without attracting notice without glancing at them as though there were no other places left stepan arkadyevich put levin and kitty side by side 
 oh you may as well sit there he said to levin 
 the dinner was as choice as the china of which stepan arkadyevich was a connoisseur the soupe was a splendid success the tiny patties eaten with it melted in the mouth and were irreproachable the two footmen and matvei in white cravats did their duty with the dishes and wines unobtrusively quietly and dexterously on the material side the dinner was a success it was no less so on the immaterial the conversation at times general and at times between individuals never paused and toward the end the company was so lively that the men rose from the table without stopping speaking and even alexei alexandrovich became lively

 pestsov liked threshing an argument out to the end and was not satisfied with sergei words especially as he felt the injustice of his view 
 i did not mean he said over the soup addressing alexei alexandrovich mere density of population alone but in conjunction with fundamental ideas and not by means of principles 
 it seems to me alexei alexandrovich said languidly and with no haste that the same thing in my opinion influence over another people is only possible to the people which has the higher development which 
 but just the question pestsov broke in in his bass he was always in a hurry to speak and seemed always to put his whole soul into whatever he was saying of what are we to make higher development consist the english the french the germans which is at the highest stage of development which of them will nationalize the other we see the rhine provinces have been turned french yet the germans are not at a lower stage he shouted there is another law at work there 
 i fancy that the greater influence is always on the side of true civilization said alexei alexandrovich slightly lifting his eyebrows 
 but what are we to lay down as the outward signs of true civilization said pestsov 
 i imagine such signs are generally very well known said alexei alexandrovich 
 but are they fully known sergei ivanovich put in with a subtle smile it is the accepted view now that real culture must be purely classical but we see most intense disputes on each side of the question and there is no denying that the opposite camp has strong points in its favor 
 you are for the classics sergei ivanovich will you take red wine said stepan arkadyevich 
 i am not expressing my own opinion of either form of culture sergei ivanovich said holding out his glass with a smile of condescension as to a child i only say that both sides have strong arguments to support them he went on addressing alexei alexandrovich my sympathies are classical from education but in this discussion i am personally unable to arrive at a conclusion i see no distinct grounds for classical studies being given a over scientific studies 
 the natural sciences have just as great an educational value put in pestsov take astronomy take botany or zoology with its system of general principles 
 i cannot quite agree with that responded alexei alexandrovich it seems to me that one must admit that the very process of studying the forms of language has a peculiarly favorable influence on intellectual development moreover it cannot be denied that the influence of the classical authors is in the highest degree moral while unfortunately with the study of the natural sciences are associated the false and noxious doctrines which are the curse of our day 
 sergei ivanovich would have said something but pestsov interrupted him in his rich bass he began warmly contesting the justice of this view sergei ivanovich waited serenely to speak obviously with a convincing reply ready 
 but said sergei ivanovich smiling subtly and addressing karenin one must allow that to weigh all the advantages and disadvantages of classical and scientific studies is a difficult task and the question which form of education was to be preferred would not have been so quickly and conclusively decided if there had not been in favor of classical education as you expressed it just now its moral disons le mot antinihilist influence 
 undoubtedly 
 if it had not been for the distinctive property of antinihilistic influence on the side of classical studies we should have considered the subject more have weighed the arguments on both sides said sergei ivanovich with a subtle smile we should have given elbowroom to both tendencies but now we know that these little pills of classical learning possess the medicinal property of antinihilism and we boldly prescribe them to our patients but what if they had no such medicinal property he added his pinch of attic salt 
 at sergei little pills everyone laughed turovtsin in especial roared loudly and jovially glad at last to have found something to laugh at all he ever looked for in listening to conversation 
 stepan arkadyevich had not made a mistake in inviting pestsov with pestsov intellectual conversation never flagged for an instant directly sergei ivanovich had concluded the conversation with his jest pestsov promptly started a new one 
 i agree even said he that the government had that aim the government obviously is guided by abstract considerations and remains indifferent to the influence its measures may exercise the education of women for instance would naturally be regarded as likely to be harmful but the government opens schools and universities for women 
 and the conversation at once passed to the new subject of the education of women 
 alexei alexandrovich expressed the idea that the education of women is apt to be confounded with the emancipation of women and that it is only so that it can be considered dangerous 
 i consider on the contrary that the two questions are inseparably connected together said pestsov it is a vicious circle woman is deprived of rights from lack of education and the lack of education results from the absence of rights we must not forget that the subjection of women is so complete and dates from such distant ages that we are often unwilling to recognize the gulf that separates them from us said he 
 you mentioned rights said sergei ivanovich waiting till pestsov had finished meaning the right of sitting on juries of voting of presiding at councils the right of entering the civil service of sitting in parliament 
 undoubtedly 
 but if women as a rare exception can occupy such positions it seems to me you are wrong in using the expression rights it would be more correct to say duties every man will agree that in doing the duty of a juryman a witness a telegraph clerk we feel we are performing duties and therefore it would be correct to say that women are seeking duties and quite legitimately and one can but sympathize with this desire to assist in the general labor of man 
 quite so alexei alexandrovich assented the question i imagine is simply whether they are fitted for such duties 
 they will most likely be perfectly fitted said stepan arkadyevich when education has become general among them we see this 
 how about the proverb said the prince who had a long while been intent on the conversation his mocking little eyes twinkling i can say it before my daughters her hair is long but her wit is short 
 just what they thought of the negroes before their emancipation said pestsov angrily 
 what seems strange to me is that women should seek fresh duties said sergei ivanovich while we see unhappily that men usually try to avoid them 
 duties are bound up with rights power money honor those are what women are seeking said pestsov 
 just as though i should seek the right to be a wet nurse and feel injured because women are paid for the work while no one will take me said the old prince 
 turovtsin exploded in a loud roar of laughter and sergei ivanovich regretted that he had not made this comparison even alexei alexandrovich smiled 
 yes but a man nurse a baby said pestsov while a woman 
 no there was an englishman who did suckle his baby on board ship said the old prince feeling this freedom in conversation permissible before his own daughters 
 there are as many such englishmen as there would be women officials said sergei ivanovich 
 yes but what is a girl to do who has no family put in stepan arkadyevich thinking of masha chibisova whom he had had in his mind all along in sympathizing with pestsov and supporting him 
 if the story of such a girl were thoroughly sifted you would find she had abandoned a family her own or a where she might have found a duties darya alexandrovna broke in unexpectedly in a tone of exasperation probably suspecting what sort of girl stepan arkadyevich had in mind 
 but we take our stand on principle on the ideal replied pestsov in his sonorous bass woman desires to have the right to be independent educated she is oppressed humiliated by the consciousness of her disabilities 
 and oppressed and humiliated that they engage me at the foundling asylum the old prince said again to the huge delight of turovtsin who in his mirth dropped his asparagus with the thick end in the sauce

 i fancy that the greater influence is always on the side of true civilization said alexei alexandrovich slightly lifting his eyebrows 
 but what are we to lay down as the outward signs of true civilization said pestsov 
 i imagine such signs are generally very well known said alexei alexandrovich 
 but are they fully known sergei ivanovich put in with a subtle smile it is the accepted view now that real culture must be purely classical but we see most intense disputes on each side of the question and there is no denying that the opposite camp has strong points in its favor 
 you are for the classics sergei ivanovich will you take red wine said stepan arkadyevich 
 i am not expressing my own opinion of either form of culture sergei ivanovich said holding out his glass with a smile of condescension as to a child i only say that both sides have strong arguments to support them he went on addressing alexei alexandrovich my sympathies are classical from education but in this discussion i am personally unable to arrive at a conclusion i see no distinct grounds for classical studies being given a over scientific studies 
 the natural sciences have just as great an educational value put in pestsov take astronomy take botany or zoology with its system of general principles 
 i cannot quite agree with that responded alexei alexandrovich it seems to me that one must admit that the very process of studying the forms of language has a peculiarly favorable influence on intellectual development moreover it cannot be denied that the influence of the classical authors is in the highest degree moral while unfortunately with the study of the natural sciences are associated the false and noxious doctrines which are the curse of our day 
 sergei ivanovich would have said something but pestsov interrupted him in his rich bass he began warmly contesting the justice of this view sergei ivanovich waited serenely to speak obviously with a convincing reply ready 
 but said sergei ivanovich smiling subtly and addressing karenin one must allow that to weigh all the advantages and disadvantages of classical and scientific studies is a difficult task and the question which form of education was to be preferred would not have been so quickly and conclusively decided if there had not been in favor of classical education as you expressed it just now its moral disons le mot antinihilist influence 
 undoubtedly 
 if it had not been for the distinctive property of antinihilistic influence on the side of classical studies we should have considered the subject more have weighed the arguments on both sides said sergei ivanovich with a subtle smile we should have given elbowroom to both tendencies but now we know that these little pills of classical learning possess the medicinal property of antinihilism and we boldly prescribe them to our patients but what if they had no such medicinal property he added his pinch of attic salt 
 at sergei little pills everyone laughed turovtsin in especial roared loudly and jovially glad at last to have found something to laugh at all he ever looked for in listening to conversation 
 stepan arkadyevich had not made a mistake in inviting pestsov with pestsov intellectual conversation never flagged for an instant directly sergei ivanovich had concluded the conversation with his jest pestsov promptly started a new one 
 i agree even said he that the government had that aim the government obviously is guided by abstract considerations and remains indifferent to the influence its measures may exercise the education of women for instance would naturally be regarded as likely to be harmful but the government opens schools and universities for women 
 and the conversation at once passed to the new subject of the education of women 
 alexei alexandrovich expressed the idea that the education of women is apt to be confounded with the emancipation of women and that it is only so that it can be considered dangerous 
 i consider on the contrary that the two questions are inseparably connected together said pestsov it is a vicious circle woman is deprived of rights from lack of education and the lack of education results from the absence of rights we must not forget that the subjection of women is so complete and dates from such distant ages that we are often unwilling to recognize the gulf that separates them from us said he 
 you mentioned rights said sergei ivanovich waiting till pestsov had finished meaning the right of sitting on juries of voting of presiding at councils the right of entering the civil service of sitting in parliament 
 undoubtedly 
 but if women as a rare exception can occupy such positions it seems to me you are wrong in using the expression rights it would be more correct to say duties every man will agree that in doing the duty of a juryman a witness a telegraph clerk we feel we are performing duties and therefore it would be correct to say that women are seeking duties and quite legitimately and one can but sympathize with this desire to assist in the general labor of man 
 quite so alexei alexandrovich assented the question i imagine is simply whether they are fitted for such duties 
 they will most likely be perfectly fitted said stepan arkadyevich when education has become general among them we see this 
 how about the proverb said the prince who had a long while been intent on the conversation his mocking little eyes twinkling i can say it before my daughters her hair is long but her wit is short 
 just what they thought of the negroes before their emancipation said pestsov angrily 
 what seems strange to me is that women should seek fresh duties said sergei ivanovich while we see unhappily that men usually try to avoid them 
 duties are bound up with rights power money honor those are what women are seeking said pestsov 
 just as though i should seek the right to be a wet nurse and feel injured because women are paid for the work while no one will take me said the old prince 
 turovtsin exploded in a loud roar of laughter and sergei ivanovich regretted that he had not made this comparison even alexei alexandrovich smiled 
 yes but a man nurse a baby said pestsov while a woman 
 no there was an englishman who did suckle his baby on board ship said the old prince feeling this freedom in conversation permissible before his own daughters 
 there are as many such englishmen as there would be women officials said sergei ivanovich 
 yes but what is a girl to do who has no family put in stepan arkadyevich thinking of masha chibisova whom he had had in his mind all along in sympathizing with pestsov and supporting him 
 if the story of such a girl were thoroughly sifted you would find she had abandoned a family her own or a where she might have found a duties darya alexandrovna broke in unexpectedly in a tone of exasperation probably suspecting what sort of girl stepan arkadyevich had in mind 
 but we take our stand on principle on the ideal replied pestsov in his sonorous bass woman desires to have the right to be independent educated she is oppressed humiliated by the consciousness of her disabilities 
 and oppressed and humiliated that they engage me at the foundling asylum the old prince said again to the huge delight of turovtsin who in his mirth dropped his asparagus with the thick end in the sauce

 everyone took part in the conversation except kitty and levin at first when they were talking of the influence that one people has on another there rose to mind what he had to say on the subject but these ideas once of such importance in his eyes seemed to come into his brain as in a dream and had now not the slightest interest for him it even struck him as strange that they should be so eager to talk of what was of no use to anyone kitty too one would have supposed should have been interested in what they were saying of the rights and education of women how often she had mused on the subject thinking of her friend abroad varenka of her painful state of dependence how often she had wondered about herself as to what would become of her if she did not marry and how often she had argued with her sister about it but now it did not interest her at all she and levin had a conversation of their own yet not a conversation but a sort of mysterious communication which brought them every moment nearer and stirred in both a sense of glad terror before the unknown into which they were entering 
 at first levin in answer to question how he could have seen her last year in the carriage told her that he had been coming home from the mowing along the highroad and had met her 
 it was very very early in the morning you were probably only just awake your maman was asleep in her corner it was an exquisite morning i was walking along wondering who it could be in the it was a splendid set of four horses with bells and in a second you flashed by and i saw you at the window you were sitting like this holding the strings of your cap in both hands and in awfully deep thought about something he said smiling how i should like to know what you were thinking about then something important 
 i dreadfully untidy she wondered but seeing the smile of ecstasy these reminiscences called up she felt that the impression she had made had been very good she blushed and laughed with delight 
 really i remember 
 how nicely turovtsin laughs said levin admiring his humid eyes and heaving chest 
 have you known him long asked kitty 
 oh everyone knows him 
 and i see you think a horrid man 
 not horrid but nothing in him 
 oh wrong and you must give up thinking so directly said kitty i used to have a very poor opinion of him too but an awfully fine and wonderfully goodhearted man he has a heart of gold 
 how could you find out what sort of heart he has 
 we are great friends i know him very well last winter soon after you came to see us she said with a guilty and at the same time a confiding smile all children had scarlatina and he happened to come to see her and only fancy she said in a whisper he felt so sorry for her that he stayed and began to help her look after the children yes and for three weeks he stopped with them and looked after the children like a nurse 
 i am telling konstantin dmitrievich about turovtsin and the scarlatina she said bending over to her sister 
 yes it was wonderful noble said dolly glancing toward turovtsin who had become aware they were talking of him and smiling gently to him levin glanced once more at turovtsin and wondered how it was he had not realized all this goodness before 
 sorry sorry and never think ill of people again he said gaily genuinely expressing what he felt at the moment

 chapter 
 
 connected with the conversation that had sprung up on the rights of women there were certain questions as to the inequality of rights in marriage improper to discuss before the ladies pestsov had several times during dinner touched upon these questions but sergei ivanovich and stepan arkadyevich carefully drew him off them 
 when they rose from the table and the ladies had gone out pestsov did not follow them but addressing alexei alexandrovich began to expound the chief ground of inequality the inequality in marriage in his opinion lay in the fact that the infidelity of the wife and infidelity of the husband are punished unequally both by the law and by public opinion 
 stepan arkadyevich went hurriedly up to alexei alexandrovich and offered him a cigar 
 no i smoke alexei alexandrovich answered calmly and as though purposely wishing to show that he was not afraid of the subject he turned to pestsov with a chilly smile 
 i imagine that such a view has a foundation in the very nature of things he said and would have gone on to the drawing room but at this point turovtsin broke suddenly and unexpectedly into the conversation addressing alexei alexandrovich 
 you heard perhaps about priachnikov said turovtsin warmed up by the champagne he had drunk and long waiting for an opportunity to break the silence that had weighed on him vassia priachnikov he said with a smile on his moist red lips addressing himself principally to the most important guest alexei alexandrovich they told me today he fought a duel with kvitsky at tver and has killed him 
 just as it always seems that one bruises oneself on a sore place so stepan arkadyevich felt now that the conversation would by ill luck fall at any moment on alexei sore spot he would again have got his away but alexei alexandrovich himself inquired with curiosity 
 what did priachnikov fight about 
 his wife acted like a man he did called him out and shot him 
 ah said alexei alexandrovich indifferently and lifting his eyebrows he went into the drawing room 
 how glad i am you have come dolly said with a frightened smile meeting him in the outer drawing room i must talk to you sit here 
 alexei alexandrovich with the same expression of indifference due to his lifted eyebrows sat down beside darya alexandrovna and smiled affectedly 
 fortunate said he especially as i meant to ask you to excuse me and to be taking leave i have to start tomorrow 
 darya alexandrovna was firmly convinced of innocence and she felt herself growing pale and her lips quivering with anger at this frigid unfeeling man who was so calmly intending to ruin her innocent friend 
 alexei alexandrovich she said with desperate resolution looking him in the face i asked you about anna you made me no answer how is she 
 she is i believe quite well darya alexandrovna replied alexei alexandrovich without looking at her 
 alexei alexandrovich forgive me i have no right but i love anna as a sister and esteem her i beg i beseech you to tell me what is wrong between you what fault do you find with her 
 alexei alexandrovich frowned and almost closing his eyes dropped his head 
 i presume that your husband has told you the grounds on which i consider it necessary to change my attitude to anna arkadyevna he said without looking her in the face but eying with displeasure shcherbatsky who was walking across the drawing room 
 
 i believe it i believe it i believe it dolly said clasping her bony hands before her with a vigorous gesture she rose quickly and laid her hand on alexei sleeve we shall be disturbed here come this way please 
 agitation had an effect on alexei alexandrovich he got up and submissively followed her to the schoolroom they sat down at a table covered with an oilcloth cut in slits by penknives 
 i i believe it dolly said trying to catch his glance still avoiding her 
 one cannot disbelieve facts darya alexandrovna said he with an emphasis on the word facts 
 but what has she done said darya alexandrovna what precisely has she done 
 she has forsaken her duty and deceived her husband what she has done said he 
 no no it be no for sake you are mistaken said dolly putting her hands to her temples and closing her eyes 
 alexei alexandrovich smiled coldly with his lips alone meaning to signify to her and himself the firmness of his conviction but this warm defense though it could not shake him reopened his wound he began to speak with greater heat 
 it is extremely difficult to be mistaken when a wife herself informs her husband of the fact informs him that eight years of her life and a son are all a mistake and that she wants to begin life anew he said angrily with a snort 
 anna and sin i cannot connect them i cannot believe it 
 darya alexandrovna he said now looking straight into kindly troubled face and feeling that his tongue was being loosened in spite of himself i would give a great deal for doubt to be still possible when i doubted i was miserable but it was better than now when i doubted i had hope but now there is no hope and still i doubt everything i am in such doubt of everything that i even hate my son and sometimes do not believe he is my son i am very unhappy 
 he had no need to say that darya alexandrovna had seen that as soon as he glanced into her face and she felt sorry for him and her faith in the innocence of her friend began to waver 
 oh this is awful awful but can it be true that you are resolved on a divorce 
 i am resolved on extreme measures there is nothing else for me to do 
 nothing else to do nothing else to do she replied with tears in her eyes oh no say nothing else to do she said 
 what is horrible in a misfortune of this kind is that one cannot as in any other in loss in death bear trouble in peace but that one must act said he as though guessing her thought one must get out of the humiliating position in which one is placed one live a trois 
 i understand i quite understand that said dolly and her head sank she was silent for a little thinking of herself of her own grief in her family and all at once with an impulsive movement she raised her head and clasped her hands with an imploring gesture but wait a little you are a christian think of her what will become of her if you cast her off 
 i have thought darya alexandrovna i have thought a great deal said alexei alexandrovich his face turned red in patches and his dim eyes looked straight before him darya alexandrovna at that moment pitied him with all her heart that indeed was what i did when she herself made known to me my humiliation i left everything as of old i gave her a chance to reform i tried to save her and with what result she would not regard the least request that she should observe decorum he said getting heated one may save anyone who does not want to be ruined but if the whole nature is so corrupt so depraved that ruin itself seems to her salvation to be done 
 anything only not divorce answered darya alexandrovna 
 but what is anything 
 no it is awful she will be no wife she will be lost 
 what can i do said alexei alexandrovich raising his shoulders and his eyebrows the recollection of his last act had so incensed him that he had become frigid as at the beginning of the conversation i am very grateful for your sympathy but i must be going he said getting up 
 no wait a minute you must not ruin her wait a little i will tell you about myself i was married and my husband deceived me in anger and jealousy i would have thrown up everything i would myself but i came to myself again and who did it anna saved me and here i am living on the children are growing up my husband has come back to his family and feels his fault is growing purer better and i live on i have forgiven it and you ought to forgive 
 alexei alexandrovich heard her but her words had no effect on him now all the hatred of that day when he had resolved on a divorce had sprung up again in his soul he shook himself and said in a shrill loud voice 
 forgive i cannot and do not wish to and i regard it as wrong i have done everything for this woman and she has trodden it all in the mud to which she is kin i am not a spiteful man i have never hated anyone but i hate her with my whole soul and i cannot even forgive her because i hate her too much for all the wrong she has done me he said with tears of hatred in his voice 
 love those that hate you darya alexandrovna whispered timorously 
 alexei alexandrovich smiled contemptuously that he knew long ago but it could not be applied to his case 
 love those that hate you but to love those one hates is impossible forgive me for having troubled you everyone has enough to bear in his own grief and regaining his alexei alexandrovich quietly took leave and went away

 i have thought darya alexandrovna i have thought a great deal said alexei alexandrovich his face turned red in patches and his dim eyes looked straight before him darya alexandrovna at that moment pitied him with all her heart that indeed was what i did when she herself made known to me my humiliation i left everything as of old i gave her a chance to reform i tried to save her and with what result she would not regard the least request that she should observe decorum he said getting heated one may save anyone who does not want to be ruined but if the whole nature is so corrupt so depraved that ruin itself seems to her salvation to be done 
 anything only not divorce answered darya alexandrovna 
 but what is anything

 alexei alexandrovich heard her but her words had no effect on him now all the hatred of that day when he had resolved on a divorce had sprung up again in his soul he shook himself and said in a shrill loud voice

 chapter 
 
 connected with the conversation that had sprung up on the rights of women there were certain questions as to the inequality of rights in marriage improper to discuss before the ladies pestsov had several times during dinner touched upon these questions but sergei ivanovich and stepan arkadyevich carefully drew him off them 
 when they rose from the table and the ladies had gone out pestsov did not follow them but addressing alexei alexandrovich began to expound the chief ground of inequality the inequality in marriage in his opinion lay in the fact that the infidelity of the wife and infidelity of the husband are punished unequally both by the law and by public opinion 
 stepan arkadyevich went hurriedly up to alexei alexandrovich and offered him a cigar 
 no i smoke alexei alexandrovich answered calmly and as though purposely wishing to show that he was not afraid of the subject he turned to pestsov with a chilly smile 
 i imagine that such a view has a foundation in the very nature of things he said and would have gone on to the drawing room but at this point turovtsin broke suddenly and unexpectedly into the conversation addressing alexei alexandrovich 
 you heard perhaps about priachnikov said turovtsin warmed up by the champagne he had drunk and long waiting for an opportunity to break the silence that had weighed on him vassia priachnikov he said with a smile on his moist red lips addressing himself principally to the most important guest alexei alexandrovich they told me today he fought a duel with kvitsky at tver and has killed him 
 just as it always seems that one bruises oneself on a sore place so stepan arkadyevich felt now that the conversation would by ill luck fall at any moment on alexei sore spot he would again have got his away but alexei alexandrovich himself inquired with curiosity 
 what did priachnikov fight about 
 his wife acted like a man he did called him out and shot him 
 ah said alexei alexandrovich indifferently and lifting his eyebrows he went into the drawing room 
 how glad i am you have come dolly said with a frightened smile meeting him in the outer drawing room i must talk to you sit here 
 alexei alexandrovich with the same expression of indifference due to his lifted eyebrows sat down beside darya alexandrovna and smiled affectedly 
 fortunate said he especially as i meant to ask you to excuse me and to be taking leave i have to start tomorrow 
 darya alexandrovna was firmly convinced of innocence and she felt herself growing pale and her lips quivering with anger at this frigid unfeeling man who was so calmly intending to ruin her innocent friend 
 alexei alexandrovich she said with desperate resolution looking him in the face i asked you about anna you made me no answer how is she 
 she is i believe quite well darya alexandrovna replied alexei alexandrovich without looking at her 
 alexei alexandrovich forgive me i have no right but i love anna as a sister and esteem her i beg i beseech you to tell me what is wrong between you what fault do you find with her 
 alexei alexandrovich frowned and almost closing his eyes dropped his head 
 i presume that your husband has told you the grounds on which i consider it necessary to change my attitude to anna arkadyevna he said without looking her in the face but eying with displeasure shcherbatsky who was walking across the drawing room 
 
 i believe it i believe it i believe it dolly said clasping her bony hands before her with a vigorous gesture she rose quickly and laid her hand on alexei sleeve we shall be disturbed here come this way please 
 agitation had an effect on alexei alexandrovich he got up and submissively followed her to the schoolroom they sat down at a table covered with an oilcloth cut in slits by penknives 
 i i believe it dolly said trying to catch his glance still avoiding her 
 one cannot disbelieve facts darya alexandrovna said he with an emphasis on the word facts 
 but what has she done said darya alexandrovna what precisely has she done 
 she has forsaken her duty and deceived her husband what she has done said he 
 no no it be no for sake you are mistaken said dolly putting her hands to her temples and closing her eyes 
 alexei alexandrovich smiled coldly with his lips alone meaning to signify to her and himself the firmness of his conviction but this warm defense though it could not shake him reopened his wound he began to speak with greater heat 
 it is extremely difficult to be mistaken when a wife herself informs her husband of the fact informs him that eight years of her life and a son are all a mistake and that she wants to begin life anew he said angrily with a snort 
 anna and sin i cannot connect them i cannot believe it 
 darya alexandrovna he said now looking straight into kindly troubled face and feeling that his tongue was being loosened in spite of himself i would give a great deal for doubt to be still possible when i doubted i was miserable but it was better than now when i doubted i had hope but now there is no hope and still i doubt everything i am in such doubt of everything that i even hate my son and sometimes do not believe he is my son i am very unhappy 
 he had no need to say that darya alexandrovna had seen that as soon as he glanced into her face and she felt sorry for him and her faith in the innocence of her friend began to waver 
 oh this is awful awful but can it be true that you are resolved on a divorce 
 i am resolved on extreme measures there is nothing else for me to do 
 nothing else to do nothing else to do she replied with tears in her eyes oh no say nothing else to do she said 
 what is horrible in a misfortune of this kind is that one cannot as in any other in loss in death bear trouble in peace but that one must act said he as though guessing her thought one must get out of the humiliating position in which one is placed one live a trois

 when they rose from the table levin would have liked to follow kitty into the drawing room but he was afraid she might dislike this as too obviously paying her attention he remained in the little ring of men taking part in the general conversation and without looking at kitty he was aware of her movements her looks and the place where she was in the drawing room 
 he did at once and without the smallest effort keep the promise he had made her always to think well of all men and to like everyone always the conversation fell on the village commune in which pestsov saw a sort of special principle called by him the choral principle levin did not agree with pestsov nor with his brother who had a special attitude of his own both admitting yet not admitting the significance of the russian commune but he talked to them simply trying to reconcile and soften their differences he was not in the least interested in what he said himself and even less so in what they said all he wanted was that they and everyone should be happy and contented he knew now the one thing of importance and that one thing was at first there in the drawing room and then began moving across and came to a standstill at the door without turning round he felt her eyes fixed on him and her smile and he could not help turning round she was standing in the doorway with shcherbatsky looking at levin 
 i thought you were going toward the piano said he going up to her something i miss in the country music 
 no we only came to fetch you and i thank you she said rewarding him with a smile that was like a gift for coming what do they want to argue for no one ever convinces anyone you know 
 yes true said levin it generally happens that one argues warmly simply because one make out what opponent wants to prove 
 levin had often noticed in discussions between the most intelligent people that after enormous efforts and an enormous expenditure of logical subtleties and words the disputants finally arrived at the realization that what they had so long been struggling to prove to one another had long ago from the beginning of the argument been known to both but that they liked different things and would not define what they liked for fear of its being attacked he had often had the experience of suddenly grasping in a discussion what it was his opponent liked and at once liking it too and immediately he found himself agreeing and then all arguments fell away as useless sometimes too he had experienced the opposite expressing at last what he liked himself which he was devising arguments to defend and chancing to express it well and genuinely he had found his opponent at once agreeing and ceasing to dispute his position he tried to say this 
 she knit her brow trying to understand but directly he began to illustrate his meaning she understood at once 
 i know one must find out what he is arguing for what is precious to him then one can 
 she had completely guessed and expressed his badly expressed idea levin smiled joyfully he was struck by this transition from the confused verbose discussion with pestsov and his brother to this laconic clear almost wordless communication of the most complex ideas 
 shcherbatsky moved away from them and kitty going up to a card table sat down and taking up the chalk began drawing diverging circles over the new green cloth 
 they began again on the subject that had been started at dinner the liberty and occupations of women levin was of the opinion of darya alexandrovna that a girl who did not marry should find a duties in a family he supported this view by the fact that no family can get on without women to help that in every family poor or rich there are and must be nurses either relations or hired 
 no said kitty blushing but looking at him all the more bravely with her truthful eyes a girl may be so circumstanced that she cannot live in the family without humiliation while she herself 
 at the hint he understood her 
 oh yes he said yes yes yes right right 
 and he saw all that pestsov had been maintaining at dinner about the liberty of woman simply from getting a glimpse of the terror of an old existence and its humiliation in heart and loving her he felt that terror and humiliation and at once gave up his arguments 
 a silence followed she was still drawing with the chalk on the table her eyes were shining with a soft light under the influence of her mood he felt in all his being a continually growing tension of happiness 
 ah scribbled all over the table she said and laying down the chalk she made a movement as though to get up 
 what shall i be left alone without her he thought with horror and he took the chalk wait a minute he said sitting down to the table long wanted to ask you one thing 
 he looked straight into her caressing though frightened eyes 
 please ask it 
 here he said and he wrote the initial letters w y t m i c n b d t m n o t these letters meant when you told me it could never be did that mean never or then there seemed no likelihood that she could make out this complicated sentence but he looked at her as though his life depended on her understanding the words 
 she glanced at him seriously then leaned her puckered brow on her hands and began to read once or twice she stole a look at him as though asking him is it what i think it is 
 i understand she said flushing 
 what is this word he said pointing to the n that stood for never 
 it means never she said but not true 
 he quickly rubbed out what he had written gave her the chalk and stood up she wrote t i c n a d 
 dolly was completely comforted in the depression caused by her conversation with alexei alexandrovich when she caught sight of the two figures kitty with the chalk in her hand with a shy and happy smile looking upward at levin and his handsome figure bending over the table with glowing eyes fastened one minute on the table and the next on her he was suddenly radiant he had understood it meant then i could not answer differently 
 he glanced at her questioningly timidly 
 only then 
 yes her smile answered 
 and n and now he asked 
 well read this tell you what i should like should like so much she wrote the initial letters i y c f a f w h this meant if you could forget and forgive what happened 
 he snatched the chalk with nervous trembling fingers and breaking it wrote the initial letters of the following phrase i have nothing to forget and to forgive i have never ceased to love you 
 she glanced at him with a smile that did not waver 
 i understand she said in a whisper 
 he sat down and wrote a long phrase she understood it all and without asking him is it this took the chalk and at once answered 
 for a long while he could not understand what she had written and often looked into her eyes he was stupefied with happiness he could not supply the words she had meant but in her charming eyes beaming with happiness he saw all he needed to know and he wrote three letters but he had hardly finished writing when she read them over her arm and herself finished and wrote the answer yes 
 playing secretaire said the old prince but we must really be getting along if you want to be in time at the theater 
 levin got up and escorted kitty to the door 
 in their conversation everything had been said it had been said that she loved him and that she would tell her father and mother that he would come tomorrow morning

 no we only came to fetch you and i thank you she said rewarding him with a smile that was like a gift for coming what do they want to argue for no one ever convinces anyone you know 
 yes true said levin it generally happens that one argues warmly simply because one make out what opponent wants to prove 
 levin had often noticed in discussions between the most intelligent people that after enormous efforts and an enormous expenditure of logical subtleties and words the disputants finally arrived at the realization that what they had so long been struggling to prove to one another had long ago from the beginning of the argument been known to both but that they liked different things and would not define what they liked for fear of its being attacked he had often had the experience of suddenly grasping in a discussion what it was his opponent liked and at once liking it too and immediately he found himself agreeing and then all arguments fell away as useless sometimes too he had experienced the opposite expressing at last what he liked himself which he was devising arguments to defend and chancing to express it well and genuinely he had found his opponent at once agreeing and ceasing to dispute his position he tried to say this 
 she knit her brow trying to understand but directly he began to illustrate his meaning she understood at once 
 i know one must find out what he is arguing for what is precious to him then one can 
 she had completely guessed and expressed his badly expressed idea levin smiled joyfully he was struck by this transition from the confused verbose discussion with pestsov and his brother to this laconic clear almost wordless communication of the most complex ideas 
 shcherbatsky moved away from them and kitty going up to a card table sat down and taking up the chalk began drawing diverging circles over the new green cloth 
 they began again on the subject that had been started at dinner the liberty and occupations of women levin was of the opinion of darya alexandrovna that a girl who did not marry should find a duties in a family he supported this view by the fact that no family can get on without women to help that in every family poor or rich there are and must be nurses either relations or hired 
 no said kitty blushing but looking at him all the more bravely with her truthful eyes a girl may be so circumstanced that she cannot live in the family without humiliation while she herself 
 at the hint he understood her 
 oh yes he said yes yes yes right right 
 and he saw all that pestsov had been maintaining at dinner about the liberty of woman simply from getting a glimpse of the terror of an old existence and its humiliation in heart and loving her he felt that terror and humiliation and at once gave up his arguments 
 a silence followed she was still drawing with the chalk on the table her eyes were shining with a soft light under the influence of her mood he felt in all his being a continually growing tension of happiness 
 ah scribbled all over the table she said and laying down the chalk she made a movement as though to get up 
 what shall i be left alone without her he thought with horror and he took the chalk wait a minute he said sitting down to the table long wanted to ask you one thing 
 he looked straight into her caressing though frightened eyes 
 please ask it 
 here he said and he wrote the initial letters w y t m i c n b d t m n o t these letters meant when you told me it could never be did that mean never or then there seemed no likelihood that she could make out this complicated sentence but he looked at her as though his life depended on her understanding the words 
 she glanced at him seriously then leaned her puckered brow on her hands and began to read once or twice she stole a look at him as though asking him is it what i think it is 
 i understand she said flushing 
 what is this word he said pointing to the n that stood for never 
 it means never she said but not true 
 he quickly rubbed out what he had written gave her the chalk and stood up she wrote t i c n a d 
 dolly was completely comforted in the depression caused by her conversation with alexei alexandrovich when she caught sight of the two figures kitty with the chalk in her hand with a shy and happy smile looking upward at levin and his handsome figure bending over the table with glowing eyes fastened one minute on the table and the next on her he was suddenly radiant he had understood it meant then i could not answer differently 
 he glanced at her questioningly timidly 
 only then 
 yes her smile answered 
 and n and now he asked 
 well read this tell you what i should like should like so much she wrote the initial letters i y c f a f w h this meant if you could forget and forgive what happened 
 he snatched the chalk with nervous trembling fingers and breaking it wrote the initial letters of the following phrase i have nothing to forget and to forgive i have never ceased to love you 
 she glanced at him with a smile that did not waver 
 i understand she said in a whisper 
 he sat down and wrote a long phrase she understood it all and without asking him is it this took the chalk and at once answered 
 for a long while he could not understand what she had written and often looked into her eyes he was stupefied with happiness he could not supply the words she had meant but in her charming eyes beaming with happiness he saw all he needed to know and he wrote three letters but he had hardly finished writing when she read them over her arm and herself finished and wrote the answer yes 
 playing secretaire said the old prince but we must really be getting along if you want to be in time at the theater 
 levin got up and escorted kitty to the door 
 in their conversation everything had been said it had been said that she loved him and that she would tell her father and mother that he would come tomorrow morning

 when they rose from the table levin would have liked to follow kitty into the drawing room but he was afraid she might dislike this as too obviously paying her attention he remained in the little ring of men taking part in the general conversation and without looking at kitty he was aware of her movements her looks and the place where she was in the drawing room 
 he did at once and without the smallest effort keep the promise he had made her always to think well of all men and to like everyone always the conversation fell on the village commune in which pestsov saw a sort of special principle called by him the choral principle levin did not agree with pestsov nor with his brother who had a special attitude of his own both admitting yet not admitting the significance of the russian commune but he talked to them simply trying to reconcile and soften their differences he was not in the least interested in what he said himself and even less so in what they said all he wanted was that they and everyone should be happy and contented he knew now the one thing of importance and that one thing was at first there in the drawing room and then began moving across and came to a standstill at the door without turning round he felt her eyes fixed on him and her smile and he could not help turning round she was standing in the doorway with shcherbatsky looking at levin

 when kitty had gone and levin was left alone he felt such uneasiness without her and such an impatient longing to get as quickly as possible to tomorrow morning when he would see her again and be plighted to her forever that he felt afraid as though of death of those fourteen hours that he had to get through without her it was essential for him to be with someone to talk to so as not to be left alone to deceive time stepan arkadyevich would have been the companion most congenial to him but he was going out he said to a soiree in reality to the ballet levin only had time to tell him he was happy and that he loved him and would never never forget what he had done for him the eyes and the smile of stepan arkadyevich showed levin that he comprehended that feeling fittingly 
 oh so not time to die yet said stepan arkadyevich pressing hand with emotion 
 said levin 
 darya alexandrovna too as she said to him gave him a sort of congratulation saying how glad i am you have met kitty again one must value old friends levin did not like these words of darya she could not understand how lofty and beyond her it all was and she ought not to have dared to allude to it levin said to them but not to be left alone he attached himself to his brother 
 where are you going 
 going to a meeting 
 well come with you may i 
 what for yes come along said sergei ivanovich smiling what is the matter with you today 
 with me happiness is the matter with me said levin letting down the window of the carriage they were driving in you mind so stifling happiness is all the matter with me why is it you have never married 
 sergei ivanovich smiled 
 i am very glad she seems a lovely gi sergei ivanovich was beginning 
 say it say it shouted levin clutching at the collar of his fur coat with both hands and muffling him up in it a lovely girl were such simple humble words so out of harmony with his feeling 
 sergei ivanovich laughed outright a merry laugh which was rare with him 
 well anyway i may say that very glad of it 
 that you may do tomorrow tomorrow and say no more nothing nothing silence said levin and muffling him once more in his fur coat he added i do like you so well is it possible for me to be present at the meeting 
 of course it is 
 what is your discussion about today asked levin never ceasing smiling 
 they arrived at the meeting levin heard the secretary hesitatingly read the minutes which he obviously did not himself understand but levin saw from this face what a good fine kindhearted person he was this was evident from his confusion and embarrassment in reading the minutes then the discussion began they were disputing about the reckoning off of certain sums and the laying of certain pipes and sergei ivanovich was very cutting to two members and said something at great length with an air of triumph and another member scribbling something on a bit of paper began timidly at first but afterward answered him very viciously and delightfully and then sviiazhsky he was there also said something too very handsomely and nobly levin listened to them and saw clearly that this reckoning off of sums and these pipes were not anything real and that they were not at all angry but were all the finest kindest people and everything was as happy and charming as possible among them they did no harm to anyone and were all enjoying it what struck levin was that he could see through them all today and from little almost imperceptible signs knew the soul of each and saw distinctly that they were all good at heart and they were all extremely fond of levin in particular that day this was evident from the way they spoke to him from the friendly affectionate way even those whom he did not know looked at him 
 well are you contented with it sergei ivanovich asked him 
 very much i never supposed it was so interesting nice capital 
 sviiazhsky went up to levin and invited him to come round to tea with him levin was utterly at a loss to comprehend or recall what it was he had disliked in sviiazhsky what he had failed to find in him he was a clever and wonderfully goodhearted man 
 
 most delighted he said and asked after his wife and and from a queer association of ideas because in his imagination the idea of was connected with marriage it occurred to him that there was no one to whom he could more suitably speak of his happiness than to wife and and he was very glad to go to see them 
 sviiazhsky questioned him about his improvements on his estate presupposing as he always did that there was no possibility of doing anything not done already in europe and now this did not in the least annoy levin on the contrary he felt that sviiazhsky was right that the whole business was of little value and he saw the wonderful suavity and consideration with which sviiazhsky avoided fully expressing his correct view the ladies of the sviiazhsky household were particularly delightful it seemed to levin that they knew all about it already and sympathized with him saying nothing merely out of delicacy he stayed with them one hour two three talking of all sorts of subjects but implied in it the only thing that filled his heart and did not observe that he was boring them dreadfully and that it was long past their bedtime sviiazhsky went with him into the hall yawning and wondering at the strange humor his friend was in it was past one levin went back to his hotel and was dismayed at the thought that all alone now with his impatience he had ten hours still left to get through the servant whose turn it was to be up all night lighted his candles and would have gone away but levin stopped him this servant iegor whom levin had not noticed before struck him as a very intelligent excellent and above all a goodhearted man 
 well iegor hard work not sleeping it 
 to be done part of our work you see in a house easier but then here one makes more 
 it appeared that iegor had a family three boys and a daughter a seamstress whom he wanted to marry to a cashier in a shop 
 levin on hearing this informed iegor that in his opinion in marriage the great thing was love and that with love one would always be happy for happiness rests only on oneself 
 iegor listened attentively and obviously quite took in idea but by way of assent to it he enunciated greatly to surprise the observation that when he had lived with good masters he had always been satisfied with his masters and now was perfectly satisfied with his employer though he was a frenchman 
 wonderfully goodhearted fellow thought levin 
 well but you yourself iegor when you got married did you love your wife 
 ay and why not responded iegor 
 and levin saw that iegor too was in an excited state and intending to express all his most heartfelt emotions 
 my life too has been a wonderful one from a child up he was beginning with flashing eyes apparently catching enthusiasm just as people catch yawning 
 but at that moment a ring was heard iegor departed and levin was left alone he had eaten scarcely anything at dinner had refused tea and supper at but he was incapable of thinking of supper he had not slept the previous night but was incapable of thinking of sleep either his room was cold but he was oppressed by heat he opened both the movable panes in his windows and sat down on the table opposite the open panes over the roofs could be seen a decorated cross with chains and above it the rising triangle of auriga with the yellowish light of capella he gazed at the cross then at the star drank in the fresh freezing air that flowed evenly into the room and followed as though in a dream the images and memories that rose in his imagination at four he heard steps in the passage and peeped out of the door it was the gambler miaskin whom he knew coming from the club he walked gloomily frowning and coughing poor unlucky fellow thought levin and tears came into his eyes from love and pity for this man he would have talked with him and tried to comfort him but remembering that he had nothing but his shirt on he changed his mind and sat down again at the open pane to bathe in the cold air and gaze at the exquisite lines of the cross silent but full of meaning for him and the mounting lurid yellow star at six there was a noise of people polishing the floors and church bells ringing to some divine service and levin felt that he was beginning to get frozen he closed the pane washed dressed and went out into the street

 ay and why not responded iegor 
 and levin saw that iegor too was in an excited state and intending to express all his most heartfelt emotions 
 my life too has been a wonderful one from a child up he was beginning with flashing eyes apparently catching enthusiasm just as people catch yawning 
 but at that moment a ring was heard iegor departed and levin was left alone he had eaten scarcely anything at dinner had refused tea and supper at but he was incapable of thinking of supper he had not slept the previous night but was incapable of thinking of sleep either his room was cold but he was oppressed by heat he opened both the movable panes in his windows and sat down on the table opposite the open panes over the roofs could be seen a decorated cross with chains and above it the rising triangle of auriga with the yellowish light of capella he gazed at the cross then at the star drank in the fresh freezing air that flowed evenly into the room and followed as though in a dream the images and memories that rose in his imagination at four he heard steps in the passage and peeped out of the door it was the gambler miaskin whom he knew coming from the club he walked gloomily frowning and coughing poor unlucky fellow thought levin and tears came into his eyes from love and pity for this man he would have talked with him and tried to comfort him but remembering that he had nothing but his shirt on he changed his mind and sat down again at the open pane to bathe in the cold air and gaze at the exquisite lines of the cross silent but full of meaning for him and the mounting lurid yellow star at six there was a noise of people polishing the floors and church bells ringing to some divine service and levin felt that he was beginning to get frozen he closed the pane washed dressed and went out into the street

 when kitty had gone and levin was left alone he felt such uneasiness without her and such an impatient longing to get as quickly as possible to tomorrow morning when he would see her again and be plighted to her forever that he felt afraid as though of death of those fourteen hours that he had to get through without her it was essential for him to be with someone to talk to so as not to be left alone to deceive time stepan arkadyevich would have been the companion most congenial to him but he was going out he said to a soiree in reality to the ballet levin only had time to tell him he was happy and that he loved him and would never never forget what he had done for him the eyes and the smile of stepan arkadyevich showed levin that he comprehended that feeling fittingly 
 oh so not time to die yet said stepan arkadyevich pressing hand with emotion 
 said levin 
 darya alexandrovna too as she said to him gave him a sort of congratulation saying how glad i am you have met kitty again one must value old friends levin did not like these words of darya she could not understand how lofty and beyond her it all was and she ought not to have dared to allude to it levin said to them but not to be left alone he attached himself to his brother 
 where are you going 
 going to a meeting 
 well come with you may i 
 what for yes come along said sergei ivanovich smiling what is the matter with you today 
 with me happiness is the matter with me said levin letting down the window of the carriage they were driving in you mind so stifling happiness is all the matter with me why is it you have never married 
 sergei ivanovich smiled 
 i am very glad she seems a lovely gi sergei ivanovich was beginning 
 say it say it shouted levin clutching at the collar of his fur coat with both hands and muffling him up in it a lovely girl were such simple humble words so out of harmony with his feeling 
 sergei ivanovich laughed outright a merry laugh which was rare with him 
 well anyway i may say that very glad of it 
 that you may do tomorrow tomorrow and say no more nothing nothing silence said levin and muffling him once more in his fur coat he added i do like you so well is it possible for me to be present at the meeting 
 of course it is 
 what is your discussion about today asked levin never ceasing smiling 
 they arrived at the meeting levin heard the secretary hesitatingly read the minutes which he obviously did not himself understand but levin saw from this face what a good fine kindhearted person he was this was evident from his confusion and embarrassment in reading the minutes then the discussion began they were disputing about the reckoning off of certain sums and the laying of certain pipes and sergei ivanovich was very cutting to two members and said something at great length with an air of triumph and another member scribbling something on a bit of paper began timidly at first but afterward answered him very viciously and delightfully and then sviiazhsky he was there also said something too very handsomely and nobly levin listened to them and saw clearly that this reckoning off of sums and these pipes were not anything real and that they were not at all angry but were all the finest kindest people and everything was as happy and charming as possible among them they did no harm to anyone and were all enjoying it what struck levin was that he could see through them all today and from little almost imperceptible signs knew the soul of each and saw distinctly that they were all good at heart and they were all extremely fond of levin in particular that day this was evident from the way they spoke to him from the friendly affectionate way even those whom he did not know looked at him 
 well are you contented with it sergei ivanovich asked him 
 very much i never supposed it was so interesting nice capital 
 sviiazhsky went up to levin and invited him to come round to tea with him levin was utterly at a loss to comprehend or recall what it was he had disliked in sviiazhsky what he had failed to find in him he was a clever and wonderfully goodhearted man 
 
 most delighted he said and asked after his wife and and from a queer association of ideas because in his imagination the idea of was connected with marriage it occurred to him that there was no one to whom he could more suitably speak of his happiness than to wife and and he was very glad to go to see them 
 sviiazhsky questioned him about his improvements on his estate presupposing as he always did that there was no possibility of doing anything not done already in europe and now this did not in the least annoy levin on the contrary he felt that sviiazhsky was right that the whole business was of little value and he saw the wonderful suavity and consideration with which sviiazhsky avoided fully expressing his correct view the ladies of the sviiazhsky household were particularly delightful it seemed to levin that they knew all about it already and sympathized with him saying nothing merely out of delicacy he stayed with them one hour two three talking of all sorts of subjects but implied in it the only thing that filled his heart and did not observe that he was boring them dreadfully and that it was long past their bedtime sviiazhsky went with him into the hall yawning and wondering at the strange humor his friend was in it was past one levin went back to his hotel and was dismayed at the thought that all alone now with his impatience he had ten hours still left to get through the servant whose turn it was to be up all night lighted his candles and would have gone away but levin stopped him this servant iegor whom levin had not noticed before struck him as a very intelligent excellent and above all a goodhearted man 
 well iegor hard work not sleeping it 
 to be done part of our work you see in a house easier but then here one makes more 
 it appeared that iegor had a family three boys and a daughter a seamstress whom he wanted to marry to a cashier in a shop 
 levin on hearing this informed iegor that in his opinion in marriage the great thing was love and that with love one would always be happy for happiness rests only on oneself 
 iegor listened attentively and obviously quite took in idea but by way of assent to it he enunciated greatly to surprise the observation that when he had lived with good masters he had always been satisfied with his masters and now was perfectly satisfied with his employer though he was a frenchman 
 wonderfully goodhearted fellow thought levin 
 well but you yourself iegor when you got married did you love your wife 
 ay and why not responded iegor 
 and levin saw that iegor too was in an excited state and intending to express all his most heartfelt emotions 
 my life too has been a wonderful one from a child up he was beginning with flashing eyes apparently catching enthusiasm just as people catch yawning 
 but at that moment a ring was heard iegor departed and levin was left alone he had eaten scarcely anything at dinner had refused tea and supper at but he was incapable of thinking of supper he had not slept the previous night but was incapable of thinking of sleep either his room was cold but he was oppressed by heat he opened both the movable panes in his windows and sat down on the table opposite the open panes over the roofs could be seen a decorated cross with chains and above it the rising triangle of auriga with the yellowish light of capella he gazed at the cross then at the star drank in the fresh freezing air that flowed evenly into the room and followed as though in a dream the images and memories that rose in his imagination at four he heard steps in the passage and peeped out of the door it was the gambler miaskin whom he knew coming from the club he walked gloomily frowning and coughing poor unlucky fellow thought levin and tears came into his eyes from love and pity for this man he would have talked with him and tried to comfort him but remembering that he had nothing but his shirt on he changed his mind and sat down again at the open pane to bathe in the cold air and gaze at the exquisite lines of the cross silent but full of meaning for him and the mounting lurid yellow star at six there was a noise of people polishing the floors and church bells ringing to some divine service and levin felt that he was beginning to get frozen he closed the pane washed dressed and went out into the street

 the streets were still empty levin went to the house of the shcherbatskys the visitors doors were closed and everything was asleep he walked back went into his room again and asked for coffee the day servant not iegor this time brought it to him levin would have entered into conversation with him but a bell rang for the servant and he went out levin tried to drink coffee and take a bite of a roll but his mouth was quite at a loss what to do with the roll levin rejecting the roll put on his coat and went out again for a walk it was nine when he reached the shcherbatskys steps the second time in the house they were only just up and the cook came out to go marketing he had to get through at least two hours more 
 all that night and morning levin lived perfectly unconsciously and felt perfectly lifted out of the conditions of material life he had eaten nothing for a whole day he had not slept for two nights had spent several hours undressed in the frozen air and felt not only fresher and stronger than ever but felt utterly independent of his body he moved without muscular effort and felt as if he could do anything he was convinced he could fly upward or lift the corner of the house if need be he spent the remainder of the time in the street incessantly looking at his watch and gazing about him 
 and what he saw then he never saw again after especially the children going to school the doves fluttering down from the roofs to the pavement and the little loaves covered with flour set out by an unseen hand touched him those loaves those doves and those two boys were not of this earth it all happened at the same time a boy ran toward a dove and glanced smiling at levin the dove with a whir of her wings darted away flashing in the sun amid grains of snow that quivered in the air while from a little window there came a smell of bread and the loaves were set out all of this together was so extraordinarily resplendent that levin laughed and cried with delight going a long way round by gazetny lane and kislovka he went back again to the hotel and putting his watch before him sat down to wait for twelve in the next room they were talking about some sort of machines and swindling and coughing their morning coughs they did not realize that the hand was near twelve the hand reached it levin went out on the steps the sleigh drivers clearly knew all about it they crowded round levin with happy faces quarreling among themselves and offering their services trying not to offend the other sleigh drivers and promising to drive with them too levin took one and told him to drive to the shcherbatskys the sleigh driver was splendid in a white shirt collar sticking out over his overcoat and into his strong red neck the sleigh was high and comfortable and altogether such a one as levin never drove in after and the horse was a good one and tried to gallop yet seem to move the driver knew the shcherbatskys house and drew up at the entrance squaring his arms and saying a whoa especially indicative of respect for his fare the shcherbatskys hall porter certainly knew all about it this was evident from the smile in his eyes and the way he said 
 well a long while since been to see us konstantin dmitrievich 
 not only did he know all about it but he was unmistakably delighted and making efforts to conceal his joy looking into his kindly old eyes levin realized even something new in his happiness 
 are they up 
 pray walk in leave it here said he smiling as levin would have come back to take his hat that meant something 
 to whom shall i announce your honor asked the footman 
 the footman though a young man and one of the new school of footmen a dandy was a very kindhearted good fellow and he too knew all about it 
 the princess the prince the young princess said levin 
 the first person he saw was mademoiselle linon she walked across the room and her ringlets and her face were beaming he had barely spoken to her when suddenly he heard the rustle of a skirt at the door and mademoiselle linon vanished from eyes and a joyful terror came over him at the nearness of his happiness mademoiselle linon was in great haste and leaving him went out at the other door directly she had gone out swift swift light steps sounded on the parquet and his bliss his life his own self what was best in himself what he had so long sought and longed for was quickly so quickly approaching him she did not walk but seemed by some unseen force to float toward him 
 he saw nothing but her clear truthful eyes frightened by the same bliss of love that flooded his heart those eyes were shining nearer and nearer blinding him with their light of love she stopped close to him touching him her hands rose and dropped on his shoulders 
 she had done all she could she had run up to him and given herself up entirely shy and happy he put his arms round her and pressed his lips to her mouth which sought his kiss 
 she too had not slept all night and had been expecting him all the morning 
 her mother and father had consented without demur and were happy in her happiness she had been waiting for him she wanted to be the first to tell him her happiness and his she had got ready to see him alone and had been delighted at the idea and had been shy and ashamed and did not know herself what she was to do she had heard his steps and voice and had waited at the door for mademoiselle linon to go mademoiselle linon had gone away without thinking without asking herself how and what she had gone up to him and did as she was doing 
 let us go to mamma she said taking him by the hand for a long while he could say nothing not so much because he was afraid of desecrating the loftiness of his emotion by a word as that every time he tried to say something instead of words he felt that tears of happiness were welling up he took her hand and kissed it 
 can it be true he said at last in a choked voice i believe you love me dear 
 she smiled at that dear and at the timidity with which he glanced at her 
 yes she said significantly deliberately i am so happy 
 without letting go his hand she went into the drawing room the princess seeing them breathed quickly and immediately began to cry and then immediately began to laugh and with a vigorous step levin had not expected ran up to him and hugging his head kissed him wetting his cheeks with her tears 
 so it is all settled i am glad love her i am glad kitty 
 not been long settling things said the old prince trying to seem unmoved but levin noticed that his eyes were wet when he turned to him long always wished for this said the prince taking levin by the arm and drawing him toward himself even when this little featherhead fancied

 can it be true he said at last in a choked voice i believe you love me dear 
 she smiled at that dear and at the timidity with which he glanced at her 
 yes she said significantly deliberately i am so happy 
 without letting go his hand she went into the drawing room the princess seeing them breathed quickly and immediately began to cry and then immediately began to laugh and with a vigorous step levin had not expected ran up to him and hugging his head kissed him wetting his cheeks with her tears 
 so it is all settled i am glad love her i am glad kitty 
 not been long settling things said the old prince trying to seem unmoved but levin noticed that his eyes were wet when he turned to him long always wished for this said the prince taking levin by the arm and drawing him toward himself even when this little featherhead fancied 
 papa shrieked kitty and shut his mouth with her hands 
 well i he said very very plea oh what a fool i am 
 he embraced kitty kissed her face her hand her face again and made the sign of the cross over her 
 and there came over levin a new feeling of love for this man the old prince till then so little known to him when he saw how slowly and tenderly kitty kissed his muscular hand

 the princess went up to her husband kissed him and would have gone away but he held her back embraced her and tenderly as a young lover kissed her several times smiling the old people were obviously muddled for a moment and did not quite know whether it was they who were in love again or their daughter when the prince and the princess had gone levin went up to his betrothed and took her hand he was now and could speak and he had a great deal he wanted to tell her but he did not say at all what he had to say

 take them take these dreadful books she said pushing away the notebooks lying before her on the table why did you give them me no it was better anyway she added touched by his despairing face but awful awful 
 his head sank and he was silent he could say nothing 
 you forgive me he whispered 
 yes i forgive you but horrible 
 but his happiness was so immense that this confession did not shatter it it only added another shade to it she forgave him but from that time more than ever he considered himself unworthy of her morally bowed down lower than ever before her and prized more highly than ever his undeserved happiness

 chapter 
 
 unconsciously going over in his memory the conversations that had taken place during and after dinner alexei alexandrovich returned to his solitary room darya words about forgiveness had aroused in him nothing but annoyance the applicability or nonapplicability of the christian precept to his own case was too difficult a question to be discussed lightly and this question had long ago been answered by alexei alexandrovich in the negative of all that had been said what stuck most in his memory was the phrase of stupid turovtsin acted like a man he did called him out and shot him everyone had apparently shared this feeling though from politeness they had not expressed it 
 but the matter is settled useless thinking about it alexei alexandrovich told himself and thinking of nothing but the journey before him and the revision work he had to do he went into his room and asked the porter who escorted him where his man was the porter said that the man had just gone out alexei alexandrovich ordered tea to be sent him sat down to the table and taking the schedule began considering the route of his journey 
 two telegrams said his valet coming into the room i beg your pardon your excellency just stepped out this very minute 
 alexei alexandrovich took the telegrams and opened them the first telegram was the announcement of appointment to the very post karenin had coveted alexei alexandrovich flung the telegram down and flushing got up and began to pace up and down the room quos vult perdere dementat he said meaning by quos the persons responsible for this appointment he was not so much annoyed at not receiving the post as at having been so conspicuously passed over but it was incomprehensible amazing to him that they did not see that the wordy phrasemonger stremov was the last man fit for it how could they fail to see they were ruining themselves lowering their prestige by this appointment 
 something else in the same line he said to himself bitterly opening the second telegram the telegram was from his wife her name written in blue pencil anna was the first thing that caught his eye i am dying i beg i implore you to come i shall die easier with your forgiveness he read he smiled contemptuously and flung down the telegram that this was a trick and a fraud of that he thought for the first minute there could be no doubt 
 there is no deceit she would stick at she was near her confinement perhaps it is the confinement but what can be their aim to legitimize the child to compromise me and prevent a divorce he thought but something was said in it i am dying he read the telegram again and suddenly the plain meaning of what was said in it struck him and if it is true he said to himself if it is true that in the moment of agony and nearness to death she is genuinely penitent and i taking it for a trick refuse to go that would not only be cruel and everyone would blame me but it would be stupid on my part 
 piotr call a coach i am going to peterburg he said to his servant 
 alexei alexandrovich decided that he would go to peterburg and see his wife if her illness was a trick he would say nothing and go away again if she were really in danger and wished to see him before her death he would forgive her if he found her alive and pay her the last duties if he came too late 
 all the way he thought no more of what he ought to do 
 with a sense of weariness and uncleanness from the night spent in the train in the early fog of peterburg alexei alexandrovich drove through the deserted nevsky prospect and stared straight before him without thinking of what was awaiting him he could not think about it because in picturing what would happen he could not drive away the reflection that her death would at once remove all the difficulty of his position bakers closed shops night cabmen street sweepers sweeping the pavements flashed past his eyes and he watched it all trying to smother the thought of what was awaiting him and what he dared not hope for and yet was hoping for he drove up to the steps a hackney sleigh and a coach with its coachman asleep stood at the entrance as he went into the entry alexei alexandrovich seemed to get out his resolution from the remotest corner of his brain and mastered it thoroughly its meaning ran if a trick then calm contempt and departure if truth do what is seemly 
 the porter opened the door before alexei alexandrovich rang the porter kapitonich looked queer in an old coat without a tie and in slippers 
 how is your mistress 
 she was confined yesterday successfully 
 alexei alexandrovich stopped short and turned white he felt distinctly now how intensely he had longed for her death 
 and how is she 
 kornei in his morning apron ran downstairs 
 very ill he answered there was a consultation yesterday and the here now 
 take my things said alexei alexandrovich and feeling some relief at the news that there was still hope of her death he went into the hall 
 on the hatstand there was a military overcoat alexei alexandrovich noticed it and asked 
 who is here 
 the doctor the midwife and count vronsky 
 alexei alexandrovich went into the inner rooms 
 in the drawing room there was no one at the sound of his steps the midwife came out of boudoir in a cap with lilac ribbons 
 she went up to alexei alexandrovich and with the familiarity given by the approach of death took him by the arm and drew him toward the bedroom 
 thank god come she keeps on talking about you and nothing but you she said 
 make haste with the ice the peremptory voice came from the bedroom 
 alexei alexandrovich went into the boudoir at her table sitting sideways in a low chair was vronsky his face hidden in his hands weeping he jumped up at the voice took his hands from his face and saw alexei alexandrovich seeing the husband he was so overwhelmed that he sat down again drawing his head into his shoulders as if he wanted to disappear but he made an effort over himself got up and said 
 she is dying the doctors say there is no hope i am entirely in your power only let me be here though i am at your disposal i 
 alexei alexandrovich seeing tears felt a rush of that nervous emotion always produced in him by the sight of other sufferings and turning away his face he moved hurriedly to the door without hearing the rest of the words from the bedroom came the sound of voice saying something her voice was lively animated with exceedingly distinct intonations alexei alexandrovich went into the bedroom and walked up to the bed she was lying with her face turned toward him her cheeks were flushed crimson her eyes glittered her little white hands thrust out from the cuffs of her dressing gown were playing with the quilt twisting it about it seemed as though she were not only well and blooming but in the happiest frame of mind she was talking rapidly musically and with exceptionally correct articulation and expressive intonation 
 because alexei i am speaking of alexei alexandrovich what a strange and awful thing that both are alexeis it alexei would not refuse me i should forget he would forgive but why he come so good he know himself how good he is ah my god what pangs give me some water quick oh that will be bad for her my little girl oh very well then give her to a nurse yes i agree better in fact be coming it will hurt him to see her give her to the nurse

 chapter 
 
 unconsciously going over in his memory the conversations that had taken place during and after dinner alexei alexandrovich returned to his solitary room darya words about forgiveness had aroused in him nothing but annoyance the applicability or nonapplicability of the christian precept to his own case was too difficult a question to be discussed lightly and this question had long ago been answered by alexei alexandrovich in the negative of all that had been said what stuck most in his memory was the phrase of stupid turovtsin acted like a man he did called him out and shot him everyone had apparently shared this feeling though from politeness they had not expressed it 
 but the matter is settled useless thinking about it alexei alexandrovich told himself and thinking of nothing but the journey before him and the revision work he had to do he went into his room and asked the porter who escorted him where his man was the porter said that the man had just gone out alexei alexandrovich ordered tea to be sent him sat down to the table and taking the schedule began considering the route of his journey 
 two telegrams said his valet coming into the room i beg your pardon your excellency just stepped out this very minute 
 alexei alexandrovich took the telegrams and opened them the first telegram was the announcement of appointment to the very post karenin had coveted alexei alexandrovich flung the telegram down and flushing got up and began to pace up and down the room quos vult perdere dementat he said meaning by quos the persons responsible for this appointment he was not so much annoyed at not receiving the post as at having been so conspicuously passed over but it was incomprehensible amazing to him that they did not see that the wordy phrasemonger stremov was the last man fit for it how could they fail to see they were ruining themselves lowering their prestige by this appointment 
 something else in the same line he said to himself bitterly opening the second telegram the telegram was from his wife her name written in blue pencil anna was the first thing that caught his eye i am dying i beg i implore you to come i shall die easier with your forgiveness he read he smiled contemptuously and flung down the telegram that this was a trick and a fraud of that he thought for the first minute there could be no doubt 
 there is no deceit she would stick at she was near her confinement perhaps it is the confinement but what can be their aim to legitimize the child to compromise me and prevent a divorce he thought but something was said in it i am dying he read the telegram again and suddenly the plain meaning of what was said in it struck him and if it is true he said to himself if it is true that in the moment of agony and nearness to death she is genuinely penitent and i taking it for a trick refuse to go that would not only be cruel and everyone would blame me but it would be stupid on my part 
 piotr call a coach i am going to peterburg he said to his servant 
 alexei alexandrovich decided that he would go to peterburg and see his wife if her illness was a trick he would say nothing and go away again if she were really in danger and wished to see him before her death he would forgive her if he found her alive and pay her the last duties if he came too late 
 all the way he thought no more of what he ought to do 
 with a sense of weariness and uncleanness from the night spent in the train in the early fog of peterburg alexei alexandrovich drove through the deserted nevsky prospect and stared straight before him without thinking of what was awaiting him he could not think about it because in picturing what would happen he could not drive away the reflection that her death would at once remove all the difficulty of his position bakers closed shops night cabmen street sweepers sweeping the pavements flashed past his eyes and he watched it all trying to smother the thought of what was awaiting him and what he dared not hope for and yet was hoping for he drove up to the steps a hackney sleigh and a coach with its coachman asleep stood at the entrance as he went into the entry alexei alexandrovich seemed to get out his resolution from the remotest corner of his brain and mastered it thoroughly its meaning ran if a trick then calm contempt and departure if truth do what is seemly 
 the porter opened the door before alexei alexandrovich rang the porter kapitonich looked queer in an old coat without a tie and in slippers

 alexei alexandrovich went into the inner rooms 
 in the drawing room there was no one at the sound of his steps the midwife came out of boudoir in a cap with lilac ribbons 
 she went up to alexei alexandrovich and with the familiarity given by the approach of death took him by the arm and drew him toward the bedroom 
 thank god come she keeps on talking about you and nothing but you she said 
 make haste with the ice the peremptory voice came from the bedroom 
 alexei alexandrovich went into the boudoir at her table sitting sideways in a low chair was vronsky his face hidden in his hands weeping he jumped up at the voice took his hands from his face and saw alexei alexandrovich seeing the husband he was so overwhelmed that he sat down again drawing his head into his shoulders as if he wanted to disappear but he made an effort over himself got up and said 
 she is dying the doctors say there is no hope i am entirely in your power only let me be here though i am at your disposal i 
 alexei alexandrovich seeing tears felt a rush of that nervous emotion always produced in him by the sight of other sufferings and turning away his face he moved hurriedly to the door without hearing the rest of the words from the bedroom came the sound of voice saying something her voice was lively animated with exceedingly distinct intonations alexei alexandrovich went into the bedroom and walked up to the bed she was lying with her face turned toward him her cheeks were flushed crimson her eyes glittered her little white hands thrust out from the cuffs of her dressing gown were playing with the quilt twisting it about it seemed as though she were not only well and blooming but in the happiest frame of mind she was talking rapidly musically and with exceptionally correct articulation and expressive intonation 
 because alexei i am speaking of alexei alexandrovich what a strange and awful thing that both are alexeis it alexei would not refuse me i should forget he would forgive but why he come so good he know himself how good he is ah my god what pangs give me some water quick oh that will be bad for her my little girl oh very well then give her to a nurse yes i agree better in fact be coming it will hurt him to see her give her to the nurse

 alexei alexandrovich took the telegrams and opened them the first telegram was the announcement of appointment to the very post karenin had coveted alexei alexandrovich flung the telegram down and flushing got up and began to pace up and down the room quos vult perdere dementat he said meaning by quos the persons responsible for this appointment he was not so much annoyed at not receiving the post as at having been so conspicuously passed over but it was incomprehensible amazing to him that they did not see that the wordy phrasemonger stremov was the last man fit for it how could they fail to see they were ruining themselves lowering their prestige by this appointment 
 something else in the same line he said to himself bitterly opening the second telegram the telegram was from his wife her name written in blue pencil anna was the first thing that caught his eye i am dying i beg i implore you to come i shall die easier with your forgiveness he read he smiled contemptuously and flung down the telegram that this was a trick and a fraud of that he thought for the first minute there could be no doubt 
 there is no deceit she would stick at she was near her confinement perhaps it is the confinement but what can be their aim to legitimize the child to compromise me and prevent a divorce he thought but something was said in it i am dying he read the telegram again and suddenly the plain meaning of what was said in it struck him and if it is true he said to himself if it is true that in the moment of agony and nearness to death she is genuinely penitent and i taking it for a trick refuse to go that would not only be cruel and everyone would blame me but it would be stupid on my part 
 piotr call a coach i am going to peterburg he said to his servant 
 alexei alexandrovich decided that he would go to peterburg and see his wife if her illness was a trick he would say nothing and go away again if she were really in danger and wished to see him before her death he would forgive her if he found her alive and pay her the last duties if he came too late 
 all the way he thought no more of what he ought to do 
 with a sense of weariness and uncleanness from the night spent in the train in the early fog of peterburg alexei alexandrovich drove through the deserted nevsky prospect and stared straight before him without thinking of what was awaiting him he could not think about it because in picturing what would happen he could not drive away the reflection that her death would at once remove all the difficulty of his position bakers closed shops night cabmen street sweepers sweeping the pavements flashed past his eyes and he watched it all trying to smother the thought of what was awaiting him and what he dared not hope for and yet was hoping for he drove up to the steps a hackney sleigh and a coach with its coachman asleep stood at the entrance as he went into the entry alexei alexandrovich seemed to get out his resolution from the remotest corner of his brain and mastered it thoroughly its meaning ran if a trick then calm contempt and departure if truth do what is seemly 
 the porter opened the door before alexei alexandrovich rang the porter kapitonich looked queer in an old coat without a tie and in slippers 
 how is your mistress 
 she was confined yesterday successfully 
 alexei alexandrovich stopped short and turned white he felt distinctly now how intensely he had longed for her death 
 and how is she 
 kornei in his morning apron ran downstairs 
 very ill he answered there was a consultation yesterday and the here now 
 take my things said alexei alexandrovich and feeling some relief at the news that there was still hope of her death he went into the hall 
 on the hatstand there was a military overcoat alexei alexandrovich noticed it and asked 
 who is here 
 the doctor the midwife and count vronsky 
 alexei alexandrovich went into the inner rooms 
 in the drawing room there was no one at the sound of his steps the midwife came out of boudoir in a cap with lilac ribbons 
 she went up to alexei alexandrovich and with the familiarity given by the approach of death took him by the arm and drew him toward the bedroom 
 thank god come she keeps on talking about you and nothing but you she said 
 make haste with the ice the peremptory voice came from the bedroom 
 alexei alexandrovich went into the boudoir at her table sitting sideways in a low chair was vronsky his face hidden in his hands weeping he jumped up at the voice took his hands from his face and saw alexei alexandrovich seeing the husband he was so overwhelmed that he sat down again drawing his head into his shoulders as if he wanted to disappear but he made an effort over himself got up and said 
 she is dying the doctors say there is no hope i am entirely in your power only let me be here though i am at your disposal i 
 alexei alexandrovich seeing tears felt a rush of that nervous emotion always produced in him by the sight of other sufferings and turning away his face he moved hurriedly to the door without hearing the rest of the words from the bedroom came the sound of voice saying something her voice was lively animated with exceedingly distinct intonations alexei alexandrovich went into the bedroom and walked up to the bed she was lying with her face turned toward him her cheeks were flushed crimson her eyes glittered her little white hands thrust out from the cuffs of her dressing gown were playing with the quilt twisting it about it seemed as though she were not only well and blooming but in the happiest frame of mind she was talking rapidly musically and with exceptionally correct articulation and expressive intonation 
 because alexei i am speaking of alexei alexandrovich what a strange and awful thing that both are alexeis it alexei would not refuse me i should forget he would forgive but why he come so good he know himself how good he is ah my god what pangs give me some water quick oh that will be bad for her my little girl oh very well then give her to a nurse yes i agree better in fact be coming it will hurt him to see her give her to the nurse 
 anna arkadyevna he has come here he is said the midwife trying to attract her attention to alexei alexandrovich 
 oh what nonsense anna went on not seeing her husband no give her to me give me my little one he has not come yet you say he forgive me because you know him no one knows him the only one and it was hard for me even i ought to know his eyes seriozha has just such eyes and i bear to see them because of it has seriozha had his dinner i know everyone will forget to do it he would not forget seriozha must be moved into the corner room and mariette must be asked to sleep with him 
 all of a sudden she shrank back and was silent and in terror as though expecting a blow as though to defend herself she raised her hands to her face she had seen her husband 
 no no she began i am not afraid of him i am afraid of death alexei come here i am in a hurry because no time i long left to live the fever will begin directly and i shall understand nothing more now i understand i understand it all i see it all 
 alexei wrinkled face wore an expression of suffering he took her by the hand and tried to say something but he could not utter it his lower lip quivered but he still went on struggling with his emotion and only now and then glanced at her and each time he glanced at her he saw her eyes gazing at him with such passionate and exultant tenderness as he had never yet seen in them 
 wait a minute you know stay a little stay she stopped as though collecting her ideas yes she began yes yes yes this is what i wanted to say be surprised at me still the same but there is another woman in me afraid of her she loved that man and i tried to hate you and could not forget about her that used to be that woman myself now my real self dying now i know i shall die ask him even now i feel see here the weights on my feet on my hands on my fingers my fingers see how huge they are but this will soon be all over only one thing i want forgive me forgive me quite terrible but my nurse would tell me the holy martyr what was her name she was worse and go to rome a wilderness and there i shall be no trouble to anyone only take seriozha and the little one no you forgive me i know it be forgiven no no go away too good she held his hand in one burning hand while she pushed him away with the other 
 the nervous agitation of alexei alexandrovich kept increasing and had by now reached such a point that he ceased to struggle with it he suddenly felt that what he had regarded as nervous agitation was on the contrary a blissful spiritual condition that gave him all at once a new happiness he had never known he did not think that the christian law which he had been all his life trying to follow enjoined on him to forgive and love his enemies but a joyous feeling of love and forgiveness for his enemies filled his heart he knelt down and laying his head in the curve of her arm which burned him as with fire through the sleeve he sobbed like a little child she put her arm around his head which was beginning to grow bald moved toward him and with defiant pride lifted up her eyes 
 that is he i knew him now everyone come again why they go away oh take these fur coats off me 
 the doctor unloosed her hands carefully laying her on the pillow and covered her up to the shoulders she lay back submissively and looked before her with beaming eyes 
 remember one thing that i needed nothing but forgiveness and i want nothing more why he come she said turning to the door toward vronsky do come do come give him your hand 
 vronsky came to the side of the bed and seeing anna again hid his face in his hands 
 uncover your face look at him a saint she said oh uncover your face do uncover it she said angrily alexei alexandrovich do uncover his face i want to see him 
 alexei alexandrovich took hands and drew them away from his face which was awful with the expression of agony and shame upon it 
 give him your hand forgive him 
 alexei alexandrovich gave him his hand not attempting to restrain the tears that streamed from his eyes 
 thank god thank god she said now everything is ready only to stretch my legs a little there capital how badly these flowers are done not a bit like a violet she said pointing to the hangings my god my god when will it end give me some morphine doctor give me some morphine oh my god my god 
 and she tossed about on the bed 
 the doctors said that it was puerperal fever and that chances in a hundred it would end in death the whole day long there was fever delirium and unconsciousness at midnight the patient lay without consciousness and almost without pulse 
 the end was expected every minute 
 vronsky had gone home but in the morning he came to inquire and alexei alexandrovich meeting him in the hall said better stay she might ask for you and himself led him to his boudoir toward morning there was a return again of excitement rapid thought and talk and again it ended in unconsciousness on the third day it was the same thing and the doctors said there was hope that day alexei alexandrovich went into the boudoir where vronsky was sitting and closing the door sat down opposite him 
 alexei alexandrovich said vronsky feeling that a statement of the situation was coming i speak i understand spare me however hard it is for you believe me it is more terrible for me 
 he would have risen but alexei alexandrovich took him by the hand and said 
 i beg you to hear me out it is necessary i must explain my feelings the feelings that have guided me and will guide me so that you may not be in error regarding me you know i had resolved on a divorce and had even begun to take proceedings i conceal from you that in beginning this i was in uncertainty i was in misery i will confess that i was pursued by a desire to revenge myself on you and on her when i got the telegram i came here with the same feelings i will say more i longed for her death but he paused pondering whether to disclose or not to disclose his feelings but i saw her and forgave her and the happiness of forgiveness has revealed to me my duty i forgive completely i would offer the other cheek i would give my cloak if my coat be taken i pray to god only not to take from me the bliss of forgiveness 
 tears stood in his eyes and the luminous serene look in them impressed vronsky 
 this is my position you can trample me in the mud make me the laughingstock of the world i will not abandon her and i will never utter a word of reproach to you alexei alexandrovich went on my duty is clearly marked for me i ought to be with her and i will be if she wishes to see you i will let you know but now i suppose it would be better for you to go away 
 he got up and sobs cut short his words vronsky too was getting up and in a stooping not yet erect posture looked up at him from under his brows he did not understand alexei feeling but he felt that it was something higher and even unattainable for him with his view of life

 after the conversation with alexei alexandrovich vronsky went out on the steps of the karenins house and stood still with difficulty remembering where he was and where he ought to walk or drive he felt disgraced humiliated guilty and deprived of all possibility of washing away his humiliation he felt thrust out of the beaten track along which he had so proudly and lightly walked till then all the habits and rules of his life that had seemed so firm had turned out suddenly false and inapplicable the betrayed husband who had figured till that time as a pitiful creature an incidental and somewhat ludicrous obstacle to his happiness had suddenly been summoned by her herself elevated to an pinnacle and on the pinnacle that husband had shown himself not malignant not false not ludicrous but kind and straightforward and grand vronsky could not but feel this and the roles were suddenly reversed vronsky felt the elevation and his own abasement the truth and his own falsehood he felt that the husband was magnanimous even in his sorrow while he had been base and petty in his deceit but this sense of his own humiliation before the man he had unjustly despised made up only a small part of his misery he felt unutterably wretched now for his passion for anna which had seemed to him of late to be growing cooler now that he knew he had lost her forever was stronger than ever it had been he had seen all of her in her illness had come to know her very soul and it seemed to him that he had never loved her till then and now when he had learned to know her to love her as she should be loved he had been humiliated before her and had lost her forever leaving with her nothing of himself but a shameful memory most terrible of all had been his ludicrous shameful position when alexei alexandrovich had pulled his hands away from his humiliated face he stood on the steps of the karenins house like one distraught and did not know what to do

 to sleep to forget he said to himself with the serene confidence of a healthy man that if he is tired and sleepy he will go to sleep at once and the same instant his head did begin to feel drowsy and he began to drop off into forgetfulness the waves of the sea of unconsciousness had begun to meet over his head when all at once it seemed as though a violent shock of electricity had passed over him he started so that he leaped up on the springs of the sofa and leaning on his arms got on his knees in a fright his eyes were wide open as though he had never been asleep the heaviness in his head and the flabbiness in his limbs that he had felt a minute before had suddenly gone

 after the conversation with alexei alexandrovich vronsky went out on the steps of the karenins house and stood still with difficulty remembering where he was and where he ought to walk or drive he felt disgraced humiliated guilty and deprived of all possibility of washing away his humiliation he felt thrust out of the beaten track along which he had so proudly and lightly walked till then all the habits and rules of his life that had seemed so firm had turned out suddenly false and inapplicable the betrayed husband who had figured till that time as a pitiful creature an incidental and somewhat ludicrous obstacle to his happiness had suddenly been summoned by her herself elevated to an pinnacle and on the pinnacle that husband had shown himself not malignant not false not ludicrous but kind and straightforward and grand vronsky could not but feel this and the roles were suddenly reversed vronsky felt the elevation and his own abasement the truth and his own falsehood he felt that the husband was magnanimous even in his sorrow while he had been base and petty in his deceit but this sense of his own humiliation before the man he had unjustly despised made up only a small part of his misery he felt unutterably wretched now for his passion for anna which had seemed to him of late to be growing cooler now that he knew he had lost her forever was stronger than ever it had been he had seen all of her in her illness had come to know her very soul and it seemed to him that he had never loved her till then and now when he had learned to know her to love her as she should be loved he had been humiliated before her and had lost her forever leaving with her nothing of himself but a shameful memory most terrible of all had been his ludicrous shameful position when alexei alexandrovich had pulled his hands away from his humiliated face he stood on the steps of the karenins house like one distraught and did not know what to do 
 a hack sir asked the porter 
 yes a hack 
 on getting home after three sleepless nights vronsky without undressing lay prone on the sofa clasping his hands and laying his head on them his head was heavy images memories and ideas of the strangest description followed one another with extraordinary rapidity and vividness first it was the medicine he had poured out for the patient and spilled out of the spoon then the white hands then the queer posture of alexei alexandrovich on the floor beside the bed 
 to sleep to forget he said to himself with the serene confidence of a healthy man that if he is tired and sleepy he will go to sleep at once and the same instant his head did begin to feel drowsy and he began to drop off into forgetfulness the waves of the sea of unconsciousness had begun to meet over his head when all at once it seemed as though a violent shock of electricity had passed over him he started so that he leaped up on the springs of the sofa and leaning on his arms got on his knees in a fright his eyes were wide open as though he had never been asleep the heaviness in his head and the flabbiness in his limbs that he had felt a minute before had suddenly gone 
 you may trample me in the mud he heard alexei words and saw him standing before him and saw face with its burning flush and glittering eyes gazing with love and tenderness not at him but at alexei alexandrovich he saw his own as he fancied foolish and ludicrous figure when alexei alexandrovich had taken his hands away from his face he stretched out his legs again and flung himself on the sofa in the same position and shut his eyes 
 to sleep to sleep he repeated to himself but with his eyes shut he saw more distinctly than ever face as it had been on the memorable evening before the races 
 this cannot and will not be and she wants to wipe it out of her memory but i cannot live without it how can we be reconciled how can we be reconciled he said aloud and unconsciously began to repeat these words this repetition of words checked the rising of fresh images and memories which he felt were thronging in his brain but repeating words did not check his imagination for long again in extraordinarily rapid succession his best moments rose before his mind and then his recent humiliation take away his hands voice was saying he takes away his hands and feels the and idiotic expression of his face 
 he was still lying down trying to sleep though he felt there was not the smallest hope of it and kept repeating stray words from some chain of thought trying by this to check the rising flood of fresh images he listened and heard words repeated in a strange mad whisper you did not appreciate it did not make enough of it you did not appreciate it did not make enough of it 
 this am i going out of my mind he said to himself perhaps what makes men go out of their minds what makes men shoot themselves he answered himself and opening his eyes he saw with wonder an embroidered cushion beside him worked by varia his wife he touched the tassel of the cushion and tried to think of varia of when he had seen her last but to think of anything extraneous was an agonizing effort no i must sleep he moved the cushion up and pressed his head into it but he had to make an effort to keep his eyes shut he jumped up and sat down all over for me he said to himself i must think what to do what is left his mind rapidly ran through his life apart from his love of anna 
 ambition serpukhovskoy society the court he could not come to a pause anywhere all of it had had meaning before but now there was no reality in it he got up from the sofa took off his coat undid his belt and uncovering his hairy chest to breathe more freely walked up and down the room this is how people go mad he repeated and how they shoot themselves to escape humiliation he added slowly 
 he went to the door and closed it and then with fixed eyes and clenched teeth he went up to the table took a revolver looked it about turned it to a loaded barrel and sank into thought for two minutes his head bent forward with an expression of an intense effort of thought he stood with the revolver in his hand motionless thinking of course he said to himself as though a logical continuous and clear chain of reasoning had brought him to an indubitable conclusion in reality this of course so convincing to him was simply the result of repeating exactly the same circle of memories and images through which he had already passed ten times during the last hour there were the same memories of happiness lost forever the same conception of the senselessness of everything to come in life the same consciousness of humiliation there was the same sequence of these images and emotions too 
 of course he repeated when for the third time his thought passed again round the same spellbound circle of memories and images and putting the revolver to the left side of his chest and twitching vigorously with his whole hand as though squeezing it in his fist he pulled the trigger he did not hear the sound of the shot but a violent blow on his chest knocked him down he tried to clutch at the edge of the table dropped the revolver staggered and sat down on the ground looking about him in astonishment he did not recognize his room as he looked up from the ground at the bent legs of the table at the wastepaper basket and the tigerskin rug the hurried creaking steps of his servant coming through the drawing room brought him to his senses he made an effort at thought and was aware that he was on the floor and seeing blood on the tigerskin rug and on his arm he knew he had shot himself 
 idiotic missed he said fumbling after the revolver the revolver was close beside him he was groping farther off still groping for it he stretched out to the other side and not being strong enough to keep his balance fell over streaming with blood 
 the elegant whiskered manservant who used to be continually complaining to his acquaintances of the delicacy of his nerves was so on seeing his master lying on the floor that he left him losing blood while he ran for assistance an hour later varia his wife had arrived and with the assistance of three doctors whom she had sent for in all directions and who all appeared at the same moment she got the wounded man to bed and remained to nurse him

 chapter 
 
 the mistake made by alexei alexandrovich when preparing to see his wife in having overlooked the possibility that her repentance might be sincere and that he might forgive her and she might not die this mistake was two months after his return from moscow brought home to him in all its significance but the mistake made by him had arisen not simply from his having overlooked that contingency but also from the fact that until the day of his interview with his dying wife he had not known his own heart at his sick bedside he had for the first time in his life given way to that feeling of sympathetic suffering always roused in him by the sufferings of others and hitherto looked on by him with shame as a harmful weakness and pity for her and remorse for having desired her death and most of all the joy of forgiveness made him at once conscious not simply of the relief of his own sufferings but of a spiritual peace he had never experienced before he suddenly felt that the very thing that was the source of his sufferings had become the source of his spiritual joy that what had seemed insolvable while he was judging blaming and hating had become clear and simple when he forgave and loved 
 he forgave his wife and pitied her for her sufferings and her remorse he forgave vronsky and pitied him especially after reports reached him of his despairing action he felt more for his son than before and he blamed himself now for having taken too little interest in him but for the little newborn baby he felt a quite peculiar sentiment not of pity only but of tenderness at first from a feeling of compassion alone he had been interested in the delicate little creature who was not his child and who was neglected during her illness and would certainly have died if he had not troubled about her and he did not himself observe how fond he became of her he would go into the nursery several times a day and sit there for a long while so that the nurse and wet nurses who were at first afraid of him got quite used to his presence sometimes for half an hour at a stretch he would sit silently gazing at the downy wrinkled face of the sleeping baby watching the movements of the frowning brows and the plump little hands with clenched fingers that rubbed the little eyes and bridge of the nose with the back of their palms at such moments particularly alexei alexandrovich had a sense of perfect peace and inward harmony and saw nothing extraordinary in his position nothing that ought to be changed 
 but as time went on he saw more and more distinctly that however natural the position now seemed to him he would not long be allowed to remain in it he felt that besides the blessed spiritual force controlling his soul there was another a brutal force as powerful or more powerful which controlled his life and that this force would not allow him that humble peace he longed for he felt that everyone was looking at him with inquiring wonder that he was not understood and that something was expected of him above all he felt the instability and unnaturalness of his relations with his wife 
 when the softening effect of the near approach of death had passed away alexei alexandrovich began to notice that anna was afraid of him ill at ease with him and could not look him straight in the face she seemed to be wanting yet not daring to tell him something and as though foreseeing that their present relations could not continue she seemed to be expecting something from him 
 toward the end of february baby daughter who had also been named anna happened to fall ill alexei alexandrovich was in the nursery in the morning and leaving orders for the doctor to be sent for he went to his office on finishing his work he returned home at four going into the hall he saw a handsome footman in a gallooned livery and a cape holding a white fur cloak 
 who is here asked alexei alexandrovich 
 princess elizaveta fiodorovna tverskaia the footman answered and it seemed to alexei alexandrovich that the fellow grinned 
 during all this difficult time alexei alexandrovich had noticed that his worldly acquaintances especially women took a peculiar interest in him and his wife he observed all these acquaintances with difficulty concealing their mirth at something the same mirth that he had perceived in the eyes and just now in the eyes of this footman everyone seemed somehow hugely delighted as though just come from a wedding when they met him they inquired with enjoyment after his health 
 the presence of princess tverskaia was unpleasant to alexei alexandrovich from the memories associated with her and also because he disliked her and he went straight to the nursery in the day nursery seriozha leaning on the table with his legs on a chair was drawing and chatting away merrily the english governess who had during illness replaced the french one was sitting near the boy knitting mignardise she hurriedly got up curtsied and pulled seriozha 
 alexei alexandrovich stroked his hair answered the inquiries about his wife and asked what the doctor had said of the baby 
 the doctor said it was nothing serious and he ordered a bath sir 
 but she is still in pain said alexei alexandrovich listening to the screaming in the next room 
 i think the wet nurse sir the englishwoman said firmly 
 what makes you think so he asked stopping short 
 just as it was at countess sir they gave the baby medicine and it turned out that the baby was simply hungry the wet nurse had no milk sir 
 alexei alexandrovich pondered and after standing still a few seconds he went in at the other door the baby was lying with its head thrown back stiffening itself in the arms and would not take the plump breast offered it and it never ceased screaming in spite of the double hushing of the wet nurse and the other nurse who was bending over her 
 still no better said alexei alexandrovich 
 very restless answered the nurse in a whisper 
 miss edwards says that perhaps the wet nurse has no milk he said 
 i think so too alexei alexandrovich 
 then why you say so 
 one to say it to anna arkadyevna is still ill said the nurse discontentedly 
 the nurse was an old servant of the family and in her simple words there seemed to alexei alexandrovich an allusion to his position 
 the baby screamed louder than ever struggling and choking the nurse with a gesture of despair went to it took it from the wet arms and began walking up and down rocking it 
 you must ask the doctor to examine the wet nurse said alexei alexandrovich 
 the smartly dressed and nurse frightened at the idea of losing her place muttered something to herself and covering her bosom smiled contemptuously at the idea of doubts being cast on her abundance of milk in that smile too alexei alexandrovich saw a sneer at his position 
 luckless child said the nurse hushing the baby and still walking up and down with it 
 alexei alexandrovich sat down and with a despondent and suffering face watched the nurse walking to and fro 
 when the child at last was still and had been put in a deep bed and the nurse after smoothing the little pillow had left her alexei alexandrovich got up and walking awkwardly on tiptoe approached the baby for a minute he was still and with the same despondent face gazed at the baby but all at once a smile that moved his hair and the skin of his forehead came out on his face and he went as softly out of the room 
 in the dining room he rang the bell and told the servant who came in to send again for the doctor he felt vexed with his wife for not being anxious about this charming baby and in this vexed humor he had no wish to go to her he had no wish either to see princess betsy but his wife might wonder why he did not go to her as usual and so overcoming his disinclination he went toward her bedroom as he walked over the soft rug toward the door he could not help overhearing a conversation he did not want to hear 
 if he been going away i could have understood your refusal and his too but your husband ought to be above that betsy was saying 
 not for my husband for myself i wish it say that answered excited voice 
 yes but you must care to say to a man who has shot himself on your account 
 just why i want to 
 with a dismayed and guilty expression alexei alexandrovich stopped and would have gone back unobserved but reflecting that this would be undignified he turned back again and clearing his throat he approached the bedroom the voices were silent and he went in 
 anna in a gray dressing gown with a crop of short clustering black curls on her round head was sitting on a settee the animation died out of her face as it always did at the sight of her husband she dropped her head and looked round uneasily at betsy betsy dressed in the height of the latest fashion in a hat that towered over her head like a shade on a lamp in a dress with crude oblique stripes slanting one way on the bodice and the other way on the skirt was sitting beside anna her tall flat figure held erect bowing her head she greeted alexei alexandrovich with an ironical smile 
 ah she said as though surprised very glad at home you never put in an appearance anywhere and i seen you ever since anna has been ill i have heard all about it your anxiety yes a wonderful husband she said with a significant and affable air as though she were bestowing an order of magnanimity on him for his conduct toward his wife 
 alexei alexandrovich bowed frigidly and kissing his hand asked how she was 
 better i think she said avoiding his eyes 
 but rather a feverish complexion he said laying stress on the word feverish 
 been talking too much said betsy i feel selfishness on my part and i am going away 
 she got up but anna suddenly flushing quickly caught at her hand 
 no wait a minute please i must tell you no i mean you she turned to alexei alexandrovich and her neck and brow were suffused with crimson i and keep anything secret from you she said 
 alexei alexandrovich cracked his fingers and bowed his head 
 been telling me that count vronsky wants to come here to say before his departure for tashkend she did not look at her husband and was evidently in haste to have everything out however hard it might be for her i told her i could not receive him 
 you said my dear that it would depend on alexei alexandrovich betsy corrected her 
 oh no i receive him and what object would there be in she stopped suddenly and glanced inquiringly at her husband he did not look at her in short i wish it 
 alexei alexandrovich advanced and would have taken her hand 
 her first impulse was to jerk back her hand from the damp hand with big swollen veins that sought hers but with an obvious effort to control herself she pressed his hand 
 i am very grateful to you for your confidence but he said feeling with confusion and annoyance that what he could decide easily and clearly by himself he could not discuss before princess tverskaia who to him stood for the incarnation of that brute force which would inevitably control him in the life he led in the eyes of the world and hinder him from giving way to his feeling of love and forgiveness he stopped short looking at princess tverskaia 
 well my darling said betsy getting up she kissed anna and went out alexei alexandrovich escorted her out 
 alexei alexandrovich i know you are a truly magnanimous man said betsy stopping in the little drawing room and with special warmth shaking hands with him once more i am an outsider but i love her so and respect you that i venture to advise receive him alexei vronsky is the soul of honor and he is going away to tashkend 
 thank you princess for your sympathy and advice but the question of whether my wife can or cannot see anyone she must decide herself 
 he said this from habit lifting his brows with dignity and reflected immediately that whatever his words might be there could be no dignity in his position and he saw this by the suppressed malicious and ironical smile with which betsy glanced at him after this phrase

 the nurse was an old servant of the family and in her simple words there seemed to alexei alexandrovich an allusion to his position 
 the baby screamed louder than ever struggling and choking the nurse with a gesture of despair went to it took it from the wet arms and began walking up and down rocking it 
 you must ask the doctor to examine the wet nurse said alexei alexandrovich 
 the smartly dressed and nurse frightened at the idea of losing her place muttered something to herself and covering her bosom smiled contemptuously at the idea of doubts being cast on her abundance of milk in that smile too alexei alexandrovich saw a sneer at his position 
 luckless child said the nurse hushing the baby and still walking up and down with it 
 alexei alexandrovich sat down and with a despondent and suffering face watched the nurse walking to and fro 
 when the child at last was still and had been put in a deep bed and the nurse after smoothing the little pillow had left her alexei alexandrovich got up and walking awkwardly on tiptoe approached the baby for a minute he was still and with the same despondent face gazed at the baby but all at once a smile that moved his hair and the skin of his forehead came out on his face and he went as softly out of the room 
 in the dining room he rang the bell and told the servant who came in to send again for the doctor he felt vexed with his wife for not being anxious about this charming baby and in this vexed humor he had no wish to go to her he had no wish either to see princess betsy but his wife might wonder why he did not go to her as usual and so overcoming his disinclination he went toward her bedroom as he walked over the soft rug toward the door he could not help overhearing a conversation he did not want to hear 
 if he been going away i could have understood your refusal and his too but your husband ought to be above that betsy was saying 
 not for my husband for myself i wish it say that answered excited voice 
 yes but you must care to say to a man who has shot himself on your account 
 just why i want to 
 with a dismayed and guilty expression alexei alexandrovich stopped and would have gone back unobserved but reflecting that this would be undignified he turned back again and clearing his throat he approached the bedroom the voices were silent and he went in 
 anna in a gray dressing gown with a crop of short clustering black curls on her round head was sitting on a settee the animation died out of her face as it always did at the sight of her husband she dropped her head and looked round uneasily at betsy betsy dressed in the height of the latest fashion in a hat that towered over her head like a shade on a lamp in a dress with crude oblique stripes slanting one way on the bodice and the other way on the skirt was sitting beside anna her tall flat figure held erect bowing her head she greeted alexei alexandrovich with an ironical smile 
 ah she said as though surprised very glad at home you never put in an appearance anywhere and i seen you ever since anna has been ill i have heard all about it your anxiety yes a wonderful husband she said with a significant and affable air as though she were bestowing an order of magnanimity on him for his conduct toward his wife 
 alexei alexandrovich bowed frigidly and kissing his hand asked how she was 
 better i think she said avoiding his eyes 
 but rather a feverish complexion he said laying stress on the word feverish 
 been talking too much said betsy i feel selfishness on my part and i am going away 
 she got up but anna suddenly flushing quickly caught at her hand 
 no wait a minute please i must tell you no i mean you she turned to alexei alexandrovich and her neck and brow were suffused with crimson i and keep anything secret from you she said 
 alexei alexandrovich cracked his fingers and bowed his head 
 been telling me that count vronsky wants to come here to say before his departure for tashkend she did not look at her husband and was evidently in haste to have everything out however hard it might be for her i told her i could not receive him 
 you said my dear that it would depend on alexei alexandrovich betsy corrected her 
 oh no i receive him and what object would there be in she stopped suddenly and glanced inquiringly at her husband he did not look at her in short i wish it 
 alexei alexandrovich advanced and would have taken her hand 
 her first impulse was to jerk back her hand from the damp hand with big swollen veins that sought hers but with an obvious effort to control herself she pressed his hand 
 i am very grateful to you for your confidence but he said feeling with confusion and annoyance that what he could decide easily and clearly by himself he could not discuss before princess tverskaia who to him stood for the incarnation of that brute force which would inevitably control him in the life he led in the eyes of the world and hinder him from giving way to his feeling of love and forgiveness he stopped short looking at princess tverskaia 
 well my darling said betsy getting up she kissed anna and went out alexei alexandrovich escorted her out 
 alexei alexandrovich i know you are a truly magnanimous man said betsy stopping in the little drawing room and with special warmth shaking hands with him once more i am an outsider but i love her so and respect you that i venture to advise receive him alexei vronsky is the soul of honor and he is going away to tashkend 
 thank you princess for your sympathy and advice but the question of whether my wife can or cannot see anyone she must decide herself 
 he said this from habit lifting his brows with dignity and reflected immediately that whatever his words might be there could be no dignity in his position and he saw this by the suppressed malicious and ironical smile with which betsy glanced at him after this phrase

 chapter 
 
 the mistake made by alexei alexandrovich when preparing to see his wife in having overlooked the possibility that her repentance might be sincere and that he might forgive her and she might not die this mistake was two months after his return from moscow brought home to him in all its significance but the mistake made by him had arisen not simply from his having overlooked that contingency but also from the fact that until the day of his interview with his dying wife he had not known his own heart at his sick bedside he had for the first time in his life given way to that feeling of sympathetic suffering always roused in him by the sufferings of others and hitherto looked on by him with shame as a harmful weakness and pity for her and remorse for having desired her death and most of all the joy of forgiveness made him at once conscious not simply of the relief of his own sufferings but of a spiritual peace he had never experienced before he suddenly felt that the very thing that was the source of his sufferings had become the source of his spiritual joy that what had seemed insolvable while he was judging blaming and hating had become clear and simple when he forgave and loved 
 he forgave his wife and pitied her for her sufferings and her remorse he forgave vronsky and pitied him especially after reports reached him of his despairing action he felt more for his son than before and he blamed himself now for having taken too little interest in him but for the little newborn baby he felt a quite peculiar sentiment not of pity only but of tenderness at first from a feeling of compassion alone he had been interested in the delicate little creature who was not his child and who was neglected during her illness and would certainly have died if he had not troubled about her and he did not himself observe how fond he became of her he would go into the nursery several times a day and sit there for a long while so that the nurse and wet nurses who were at first afraid of him got quite used to his presence sometimes for half an hour at a stretch he would sit silently gazing at the downy wrinkled face of the sleeping baby watching the movements of the frowning brows and the plump little hands with clenched fingers that rubbed the little eyes and bridge of the nose with the back of their palms at such moments particularly alexei alexandrovich had a sense of perfect peace and inward harmony and saw nothing extraordinary in his position nothing that ought to be changed 
 but as time went on he saw more and more distinctly that however natural the position now seemed to him he would not long be allowed to remain in it he felt that besides the blessed spiritual force controlling his soul there was another a brutal force as powerful or more powerful which controlled his life and that this force would not allow him that humble peace he longed for he felt that everyone was looking at him with inquiring wonder that he was not understood and that something was expected of him above all he felt the instability and unnaturalness of his relations with his wife 
 when the softening effect of the near approach of death had passed away alexei alexandrovich began to notice that anna was afraid of him ill at ease with him and could not look him straight in the face she seemed to be wanting yet not daring to tell him something and as though foreseeing that their present relations could not continue she seemed to be expecting something from him 
 toward the end of february baby daughter who had also been named anna happened to fall ill alexei alexandrovich was in the nursery in the morning and leaving orders for the doctor to be sent for he went to his office on finishing his work he returned home at four going into the hall he saw a handsome footman in a gallooned livery and a cape holding a white fur cloak 
 who is here asked alexei alexandrovich 
 princess elizaveta fiodorovna tverskaia the footman answered and it seemed to alexei alexandrovich that the fellow grinned 
 during all this difficult time alexei alexandrovich had noticed that his worldly acquaintances especially women took a peculiar interest in him and his wife he observed all these acquaintances with difficulty concealing their mirth at something the same mirth that he had perceived in the eyes and just now in the eyes of this footman everyone seemed somehow hugely delighted as though just come from a wedding when they met him they inquired with enjoyment after his health 
 the presence of princess tverskaia was unpleasant to alexei alexandrovich from the memories associated with her and also because he disliked her and he went straight to the nursery in the day nursery seriozha leaning on the table with his legs on a chair was drawing and chatting away merrily the english governess who had during illness replaced the french one was sitting near the boy knitting mignardise she hurriedly got up curtsied and pulled seriozha 
 alexei alexandrovich stroked his hair answered the inquiries about his wife and asked what the doctor had said of the baby 
 the doctor said it was nothing serious and he ordered a bath sir 
 but she is still in pain said alexei alexandrovich listening to the screaming in the next room 
 i think the wet nurse sir the englishwoman said firmly 
 what makes you think so he asked stopping short 
 just as it was at countess sir they gave the baby medicine and it turned out that the baby was simply hungry the wet nurse had no milk sir 
 alexei alexandrovich pondered and after standing still a few seconds he went in at the other door the baby was lying with its head thrown back stiffening itself in the arms and would not take the plump breast offered it and it never ceased screaming in spite of the double hushing of the wet nurse and the other nurse who was bending over her 
 still no better said alexei alexandrovich 
 very restless answered the nurse in a whisper 
 miss edwards says that perhaps the wet nurse has no milk he said 
 i think so too alexei alexandrovich 
 then why you say so 
 one to say it to anna arkadyevna is still ill said the nurse discontentedly 
 the nurse was an old servant of the family and in her simple words there seemed to alexei alexandrovich an allusion to his position

 alexei alexandrovich took leave of betsy in the drawing room and went to his wife she was lying down but hearing his steps she sat up hastily in her former attitude and looked in a scared way at him he saw she had been crying 
 i am very grateful for your confidence in me he repeated gently in russian the phrase he had said in presence in french and sat down beside her when he spoke to her in russian using the russian thou of intimacy and affection it was insufferably irritating to anna and i am very grateful for your decision i too imagine that since he is going away there is no sort of necessity for count vronsky to come here however if 
 but said so already so why repeat it anna suddenly interrupted him with an irritation she could not succeed in repressing no sort of necessity she thought for a man to come and say to the woman he loves for whom he was ready to ruin himself and has ruined himself and who cannot live without him no sort of necessity she compressed her lips and dropped her burning eyes to his hands with their swollen veins they were slowly rubbing each other let us never speak of it she added more calmly 
 i have left this question to you to decide and i am very glad to see alexei alexandrovich was beginning 
 that my wish coincides with your own she finished quickly exasperated at his talking so slowly while she knew beforehand all he would say 
 yes he assented and princess interference in the most difficult private affairs is utterly uncalled for she especially 
 i believe a word of said about her said anna quickly i know she really cares for me 
 alexei alexandrovich sighed and said nothing she played nervously with the tassel of her dressing gown glancing at him with that torturing sensation of physical repulsion for which she blamed herself though she could not control it her only desire now was to be rid of his repelling presence 
 i have just sent for the doctor said alexei alexandrovich 
 i am very well what do i want the doctor for 
 no the little one cries and they say the wet nurse enough milk 
 why you let me nurse her when i begged to anyway alexei alexandrovich knew what was meant by that anyway a baby and killing her she rang the bell and ordered the baby to be brought her i begged to nurse her i allowed to and now blamed for it 
 i blame 
 yes you do blame me my god why i die and she broke into sobs forgive me nervous unjust she said controlling herself but do go away 
 no it go on like this alexei alexandrovich said to himself resolutely as he left his room 
 never had the impossibility of his position in the eyes and his hatred of him and above all the might of that mysterious brutal force that guided his life against his spiritual inclinations and exacted conformity with its decrees and a change in his present attitude to his wife never had it been presented to him with such distinctness as on that day he saw clearly that all the world and anna expected something of him but what exactly he could not make out he felt that this was rousing in his soul a feeling of anger destructive of his peace of mind and of all the good of his achievement he believed that for anna herself it would be better to break off all relations with vronsky but if they all thought this out of the question he was even ready to allow these relations to be renewed so long as the children were not disgraced and he was not deprived of them nor forced to change his position bad as this might be it was at any rate better than a rupture which would put her in a hopeless and shameful position and deprive him of everything he cared for but he felt helpless he knew beforehand that everyone was against him and that he would not be allowed to do what seemed to him now so natural and right but would be forced to do what was wrong though to them it seemed the proper thing

 before betsy had time to walk out of the drawing room she was met in the doorway by stepan arkadyevich who had just come from where a consignment of fresh oysters had been received 
 ah princess what a delightful meeting he began been to see you 
 a meeting for one minute for going said betsy smiling and putting on her glove 
 put on your glove yet princess let me kiss your hand nothing so thankful to the revival of the old fashions for as kissing the hand he kissed hand when shall we see each other 
 you deserve it answered betsy smiling 
 oh yes i deserve a great deal for become a most serious person i not only manage my own domestic affairs but other too he said with a significant expression 
 oh so glad answered betsy at once understanding that he was speaking of anna and going back into the drawing room they stood in a corner killing her said betsy in a whisper full of meaning impossible impossible 
 so glad you think so said stepan arkadyevich shaking his head with a serious and sympathetically distressed expression what come to peterburg for 
 the whole talking of it she said an impossible situation she pines and pines away he understand that one of those women who trifle with their feelings one of two things either let him take her away act with energy or give her a divorce this is stifling her 
 yes yes just so oblonsky said sighing 
 what come for at least not solely for that been made a kammerherr of course one has to give thanks but the chief thing was having to settle this 
 well god help you said betsy 
 after accompanying betsy to the outside hall once more kissing her hand above the glove at the point where the pulse beats and murmuring to her such unseemly nonsense that she did not know whether to laugh or to be angry stepan arkadyevich went to his sister he found her in tears 
 although he happened to be bubbling over with good spirits stepan arkadyevich immediately and quite naturally fell into the sympathetic poetically emotional tone which harmonized with her mood he asked her how she was and how she had spent the morning 
 very very miserably today and this morning and all past days and all the days to come she said 
 i think giving way to pessimism you must rouse yourself you must look life in the face i know hard but 
 i have heard it said that women love men even for their vices anna began suddenly but i hate him for his virtues i live with him do you understand the sight of him has a physical effect in me i am beside myself from it i i live with him what am i to do i have been unhappy and used to think one be unhappier but the awful state of things i am going through now i could never have conceived would you believe it that knowing a good man a splendid man that not worth his little finger i still hate him i hate him for his generosity and nothing left for me but 
 she would have said death but stepan arkadyevich would not let her finish 
 you are ill and overwrought he said believe me exaggerating dreadfully nothing so terrible in it 
 and stepan arkadyevich smiled no one else in stepan place having to do with such despair would have ventured to smile the smile would have seemed brutal but in his smile there was so much of sweetness and almost feminine tenderness that his smile did not wound but softened and soothed his gentle soothing words and smiles were as soothing and softening as almond oil and anna soon felt this 
 no stiva she said lost lost worse than lost i say yet that all is over on the contrary i feel that not over an overstrained cord that must snap but not ended yet and it will have a fearful end 
 no matter we must let the cord be loosened little by little no position from which there is no way of escape 
 i have thought and thought only one 
 again he knew from her terrified eyes that this one way of escape in her thought was death and he would not let her say it 
 not at all he said listen to me you see your own position as i can let me tell you candidly my opinion again he smiled discreetly his smile begin from the beginning you married a man twenty years older than yourself you married him without love and not knowing what love was it was a mistake admit 
 a fearful mistake said anna 
 but i repeat an accomplished fact then you had let us say the misfortune to love a man not your husband that was a misfortune but that too is an accomplished fact and your husband knew it and forgave it he stopped at each sentence waiting for her to object but she made no answer that now the question is can you go on living with your husband do you wish it does he wish it 
 i know nothing nothing 
 but you said yourself that you endure him 
 no i say so i deny it i know anything i understand anything 
 yes but let 
 you understand i feel lying head downward in a sort of pit but i ought not to save myself and i 
 never mind slip something under you and pull you out i understand you i understand that you take it on yourself to express your wishes your feelings 
 nothing nothing i wish except for it to be all over 
 but he sees this and knows it and do you suppose it weighs on him any less than on you wretched wretched and what good can come of it while divorce would solve the whole difficulty with some effort stepan arkadyevich brought out his central idea and looked significantly at her 
 she said nothing and shook her cropped head in dissent but from the look in her face that suddenly brightened into its former beauty he saw that if she did not desire this it was simply because it seemed to her an unattainable happiness 
 awfully sorry for you both and how happy i should be if i could arrange things said stepan arkadyevich smiling more boldly speak say a word god grant only that i may speak as i feel going to him 
 anna looked at him with dreamy shining eyes and said nothing

 before betsy had time to walk out of the drawing room she was met in the doorway by stepan arkadyevich who had just come from where a consignment of fresh oysters had been received 
 ah princess what a delightful meeting he began been to see you 
 a meeting for one minute for going said betsy smiling and putting on her glove 
 put on your glove yet princess let me kiss your hand nothing so thankful to the revival of the old fashions for as kissing the hand he kissed hand when shall we see each other 
 you deserve it answered betsy smiling 
 oh yes i deserve a great deal for become a most serious person i not only manage my own domestic affairs but other too he said with a significant expression 
 oh so glad answered betsy at once understanding that he was speaking of anna and going back into the drawing room they stood in a corner killing her said betsy in a whisper full of meaning impossible impossible 
 so glad you think so said stepan arkadyevich shaking his head with a serious and sympathetically distressed expression what come to peterburg for 
 the whole talking of it she said an impossible situation she pines and pines away he understand that one of those women who trifle with their feelings one of two things either let him take her away act with energy or give her a divorce this is stifling her 
 yes yes just so oblonsky said sighing 
 what come for at least not solely for that been made a kammerherr of course one has to give thanks but the chief thing was having to settle this 
 well god help you said betsy 
 after accompanying betsy to the outside hall once more kissing her hand above the glove at the point where the pulse beats and murmuring to her such unseemly nonsense that she did not know whether to laugh or to be angry stepan arkadyevich went to his sister he found her in tears 
 although he happened to be bubbling over with good spirits stepan arkadyevich immediately and quite naturally fell into the sympathetic poetically emotional tone which harmonized with her mood he asked her how she was and how she had spent the morning 
 very very miserably today and this morning and all past days and all the days to come she said 
 i think giving way to pessimism you must rouse yourself you must look life in the face i know hard but 
 i have heard it said that women love men even for their vices anna began suddenly but i hate him for his virtues i live with him do you understand the sight of him has a physical effect in me i am beside myself from it i i live with him what am i to do i have been unhappy and used to think one be unhappier but the awful state of things i am going through now i could never have conceived would you believe it that knowing a good man a splendid man that not worth his little finger i still hate him i hate him for his generosity and nothing left for me but 
 she would have said death but stepan arkadyevich would not let her finish 
 you are ill and overwrought he said believe me exaggerating dreadfully nothing so terrible in it 
 and stepan arkadyevich smiled no one else in stepan place having to do with such despair would have ventured to smile the smile would have seemed brutal but in his smile there was so much of sweetness and almost feminine tenderness that his smile did not wound but softened and soothed his gentle soothing words and smiles were as soothing and softening as almond oil and anna soon felt this

 chapter 
 
 stepan arkadyevich with the same somewhat solemn expression with which he used to take his presidential chair at his board walked into alexei room alexei alexandrovich was walking about his room with his hands behind his back thinking of just what stepan arkadyevich had been discussing with his wife 
 not interrupting you said stepan arkadyevich on the sight of his becoming suddenly aware of a sense of embarrassment unusual with him to conceal this embarrassment he took out a newly purchased cigarette case that opened in a new way and sniffing the leather took a cigarette out of it 
 no do you want anything alexei alexandrovich said reluctantly 
 yes i wished i wanted yes i wanted to talk to you said stepan arkadyevich with surprise aware of an unaccustomed timidity 
 this feeling was so unexpected and so strange that he did not believe it was the voice of conscience telling him that what he meant to do was wrong stepan arkadyevich made an effort and struggled with the timidity that had come over him 
 i hope you believe in my love for my sister and my sincere affection and respect for you he said reddening 
 alexei alexandrovich stood still and said nothing but his face struck stepan arkadyevich by its expression of an unresisting sacrifice 
 i intended i wanted to have a little talk with you about my sister and your mutual position he said still struggling with an unaccustomed constraint 
 alexei alexandrovich smiled mournfully looked at his and without answering went up to the table took from it an unfinished letter and handed it to his 
 i think unceasingly of the same thing and here is what i had begun writing thinking i could say it better by letter and that my presence irritates her he said as he gave him the letter 
 stepan arkadyevich took the letter looked with incredulous surprise at the lusterless eyes fixed so immovably on him and began to read 
 i see that my presence is irksome to you painful as it is to me to believe it i see that it is so and cannot be otherwise i blame you and god is my witness that on seeing you at the time of your illness i resolved with my whole heart to forget all that had passed between us and to begin a new life i do not regret and shall never regret what i have done but i have desired one thing your good the good of your soul and now i see i have not attained that tell me yourself what will give you true happiness and peace to your soul i put myself entirely in your hands and trust to your feeling of what is right 
 stepan arkadyevich handed back the letter and with the same surprise continued looking at his not knowing what to say this silence was so awkward for both of them that stepan lips began twitching nervously while he still gazed without speaking at face 
 what i wanted to say to her said alexei alexandrovich turning away 
 yes yes said stepan arkadyevich not able to answer for the tears that were choking him yes yes i understand you he brought out at last 
 i want to know what she would like said alexei alexandrovich 
 i am afraid she does not understand her own position she is not a judge said stepan arkadyevich recovering himself she is crushed simply crushed by your generosity if she were to read this letter she would be incapable of saying anything she would only hang her head lower than ever 
 yes but to be done in that case how explain how find out her wishes 
 if you will allow me to give my opinion i think that it lies with you to point out directly the steps you consider necessary to end the situation 
 so you consider it must be ended alexei alexandrovich interrupted him but how he added with a gesture of his hands before his eyes not usual with him i see no possible way out of it 
 there is some way of getting out of every situation said stepan arkadyevich standing up and becoming more cheerful there was a time when you thought of breaking off if you are convinced now that you cannot make each other happy 
 happiness may be variously understood but suppose that i agree to everything that i want nothing what way is there of getting out of our situation 
 if you care to know my opinion said stepan arkadyevich with the same smile of softening tenderness with which he had been talking to anna his kindly smile was so winning that alexei alexandrovich feeling his own weakness and unconsciously swayed by it was ready to believe what stepan arkadyevich was saying she will never speak out about it but one thing is possible one thing she might desire he went on that is the cessation of your relations and all memories associated with them to my thinking in your situation the essential thing is the formation of a new attitude to one another and that can only rest on a basis of freedom on both sides 
 divorce alexei alexandrovich interrupted in a tone of aversion 
 yes i imagine that divorce yes divorce stepan arkadyevich repeated reddening that is from every point of view the most rational course for married people who find themselves in the situation you are in what can be done if married people find that life is impossible for them together that may always happen 
 alexei alexandrovich sighed heavily and closed his eyes 
 only one point to be considered is either of the parties desirous of forming new ties if not it is very simple said stepan arkadyevich feeling more and more free from constraint 
 alexei alexandrovich scowling with emotion muttered something to himself and made no answer all that seemed so simple to stepan arkadyevich alexei alexandrovich had thought over thousands of times and so far from being simple it all seemed to him utterly impossible divorce the details of which he knew by this time seemed to him now out of the question because the sense of his own dignity and respect for religion forbade his taking upon himself a fictitious charge of adultery and still more suffering his wife pardoned and beloved by him to be caught in the fact and put to public shame divorce appeared to him impossible also on other still more weighty grounds 
 what would become of his son in case of a divorce to leave him with his mother was out of the question the divorced mother would have her own illegitimate family in which his status as a stepson and his education would be probably bad keep him with him he knew that would be an act of vengeance on his part and that he did not desire but apart from this what more than all made divorce seem impossible to alexei alexandrovich was that by consenting to a divorce he would be completely ruining anna the saying of darya alexandrovna at moscow that in deciding on a divorce he was thinking of himself and not considering that by this he would be ruining her irrevocably had sunk into his heart and connecting this saying with his forgiveness of her with his devotion to the children he understood it now in his own way to consent to a divorce to give her her freedom meant in his thoughts to take from himself the last tie that bound him to life the children whom he loved and to take from her the last prop that kept her on the path of right to thrust her down to her ruin if she were divorced he knew she would join her life to and their tie would be an illegitimate and criminal one since a wife by the interpretation of the ecclesiastical law could not marry while her husband was living she will join him and in a year or two he will throw her over or she will form a new tie thought alexei alexandrovich and i by agreeing to an unlawful divorce shall be to blame for her ruin he had thought it all over hundreds of times and was convinced that a divorce was not at all simple as stepan arkadyevich had said but was utterly impossible he did not believe a single word stepan arkadyevich said to him to every word he had a thousand objections to make but he listened to him feeling that his words were the expression of that mighty brutal force which controlled his life and to which he would have to submit 
 the only question is on what terms you agree to give her a divorce she does not want anything does not dare ask you for anything she leaves it all to your magnanimity 
 my god my god what for thought alexei alexandrovich remembering the details of divorce proceedings in which the husband took the blame on himself and with just the same gesture with which vronsky had done it he hid his face in his hands in shame 
 you are troubled i understand that but if you think it over 
 and unto him that smiteth thee on the one cheek offer also the other and him that taketh away thy cloak forbid not to take thy coat also thought alexei alexandrovich 
 yes yes he cried in a shrill voice i will take the disgrace on myself i will give up even my son but but it be better to let it alone still you may do as you like 
 and turning away so that his could not see him he sat down on a chair at the window there was bitterness there was shame in his heart but with bitterness and shame he felt joy and emotion at the height of his own meekness 
 stepan arkadyevich was touched he was silent for a space 
 alexei alexandrovich believe me she appreciates your magnanimity he said but it seems it was the will of god he added and as he said it felt how foolish a remark it was and with difficulty repressed a smile at his own foolishness 
 alexei alexandrovich would have made some reply but tears stopped him 
 this is an unhappy fatality and one must accept it as such i accept the calamity as an accomplished fact and am doing my best to help both her and you said stepan arkadyevich 
 when he went out of his room he was touched but that did not prevent him from being glad he had successfully brought the matter to a conclusion for he felt certain alexei alexandrovich would not go back on his words to this satisfaction was added the fact that an idea had just struck him for a conundrum turning on his successful achievement when the affair was over he would put it to his wife and most intimate friends he tried this conundrum in two or three different ways but work it out better than that he said to himself with a smile

 what would become of his son in case of a divorce to leave him with his mother was out of the question the divorced mother would have her own illegitimate family in which his status as a stepson and his education would be probably bad keep him with him he knew that would be an act of vengeance on his part and that he did not desire but apart from this what more than all made divorce seem impossible to alexei alexandrovich was that by consenting to a divorce he would be completely ruining anna the saying of darya alexandrovna at moscow that in deciding on a divorce he was thinking of himself and not considering that by this he would be ruining her irrevocably had sunk into his heart and connecting this saying with his forgiveness of her with his devotion to the children he understood it now in his own way to consent to a divorce to give her her freedom meant in his thoughts to take from himself the last tie that bound him to life the children whom he loved and to take from her the last prop that kept her on the path of right to thrust her down to her ruin if she were divorced he knew she would join her life to and their tie would be an illegitimate and criminal one since a wife by the interpretation of the ecclesiastical law could not marry while her husband was living she will join him and in a year or two he will throw her over or she will form a new tie thought alexei alexandrovich and i by agreeing to an unlawful divorce shall be to blame for her ruin he had thought it all over hundreds of times and was convinced that a divorce was not at all simple as stepan arkadyevich had said but was utterly impossible he did not believe a single word stepan arkadyevich said to him to every word he had a thousand objections to make but he listened to him feeling that his words were the expression of that mighty brutal force which controlled his life and to which he would have to submit 
 the only question is on what terms you agree to give her a divorce she does not want anything does not dare ask you for anything she leaves it all to your magnanimity 
 my god my god what for thought alexei alexandrovich remembering the details of divorce proceedings in which the husband took the blame on himself and with just the same gesture with which vronsky had done it he hid his face in his hands in shame 
 you are troubled i understand that but if you think it over 
 and unto him that smiteth thee on the one cheek offer also the other and him that taketh away thy cloak forbid not to take thy coat also thought alexei alexandrovich 
 yes yes he cried in a shrill voice i will take the disgrace on myself i will give up even my son but but it be better to let it alone still you may do as you like 
 and turning away so that his could not see him he sat down on a chair at the window there was bitterness there was shame in his heart but with bitterness and shame he felt joy and emotion at the height of his own meekness 
 stepan arkadyevich was touched he was silent for a space 
 alexei alexandrovich believe me she appreciates your magnanimity he said but it seems it was the will of god he added and as he said it felt how foolish a remark it was and with difficulty repressed a smile at his own foolishness 
 alexei alexandrovich would have made some reply but tears stopped him 
 this is an unhappy fatality and one must accept it as such i accept the calamity as an accomplished fact and am doing my best to help both her and you said stepan arkadyevich 
 when he went out of his room he was touched but that did not prevent him from being glad he had successfully brought the matter to a conclusion for he felt certain alexei alexandrovich would not go back on his words to this satisfaction was added the fact that an idea had just struck him for a conundrum turning on his successful achievement when the affair was over he would put it to his wife and most intimate friends he tried this conundrum in two or three different ways but work it out better than that he said to himself with a smile

 stepan arkadyevich with the same somewhat solemn expression with which he used to take his presidential chair at his board walked into alexei room alexei alexandrovich was walking about his room with his hands behind his back thinking of just what stepan arkadyevich had been discussing with his wife 
 not interrupting you said stepan arkadyevich on the sight of his becoming suddenly aware of a sense of embarrassment unusual with him to conceal this embarrassment he took out a newly purchased cigarette case that opened in a new way and sniffing the leather took a cigarette out of it 
 no do you want anything alexei alexandrovich said reluctantly 
 yes i wished i wanted yes i wanted to talk to you said stepan arkadyevich with surprise aware of an unaccustomed timidity 
 this feeling was so unexpected and so strange that he did not believe it was the voice of conscience telling him that what he meant to do was wrong stepan arkadyevich made an effort and struggled with the timidity that had come over him 
 i hope you believe in my love for my sister and my sincere affection and respect for you he said reddening 
 alexei alexandrovich stood still and said nothing but his face struck stepan arkadyevich by its expression of an unresisting sacrifice 
 i intended i wanted to have a little talk with you about my sister and your mutual position he said still struggling with an unaccustomed constraint 
 alexei alexandrovich smiled mournfully looked at his and without answering went up to the table took from it an unfinished letter and handed it to his 
 i think unceasingly of the same thing and here is what i had begun writing thinking i could say it better by letter and that my presence irritates her he said as he gave him the letter 
 stepan arkadyevich took the letter looked with incredulous surprise at the lusterless eyes fixed so immovably on him and began to read 
 i see that my presence is irksome to you painful as it is to me to believe it i see that it is so and cannot be otherwise i blame you and god is my witness that on seeing you at the time of your illness i resolved with my whole heart to forget all that had passed between us and to begin a new life i do not regret and shall never regret what i have done but i have desired one thing your good the good of your soul and now i see i have not attained that tell me yourself what will give you true happiness and peace to your soul i put myself entirely in your hands and trust to your feeling of what is right 
 stepan arkadyevich handed back the letter and with the same surprise continued looking at his not knowing what to say this silence was so awkward for both of them that stepan lips began twitching nervously while he still gazed without speaking at face 
 what i wanted to say to her said alexei alexandrovich turning away 
 yes yes said stepan arkadyevich not able to answer for the tears that were choking him yes yes i understand you he brought out at last 
 i want to know what she would like said alexei alexandrovich 
 i am afraid she does not understand her own position she is not a judge said stepan arkadyevich recovering himself she is crushed simply crushed by your generosity if she were to read this letter she would be incapable of saying anything she would only hang her head lower than ever 
 yes but to be done in that case how explain how find out her wishes 
 if you will allow me to give my opinion i think that it lies with you to point out directly the steps you consider necessary to end the situation 
 so you consider it must be ended alexei alexandrovich interrupted him but how he added with a gesture of his hands before his eyes not usual with him i see no possible way out of it 
 there is some way of getting out of every situation said stepan arkadyevich standing up and becoming more cheerful there was a time when you thought of breaking off if you are convinced now that you cannot make each other happy 
 happiness may be variously understood but suppose that i agree to everything that i want nothing what way is there of getting out of our situation 
 if you care to know my opinion said stepan arkadyevich with the same smile of softening tenderness with which he had been talking to anna his kindly smile was so winning that alexei alexandrovich feeling his own weakness and unconsciously swayed by it was ready to believe what stepan arkadyevich was saying she will never speak out about it but one thing is possible one thing she might desire he went on that is the cessation of your relations and all memories associated with them to my thinking in your situation the essential thing is the formation of a new attitude to one another and that can only rest on a basis of freedom on both sides 
 divorce alexei alexandrovich interrupted in a tone of aversion 
 yes i imagine that divorce yes divorce stepan arkadyevich repeated reddening that is from every point of view the most rational course for married people who find themselves in the situation you are in what can be done if married people find that life is impossible for them together that may always happen 
 alexei alexandrovich sighed heavily and closed his eyes 
 only one point to be considered is either of the parties desirous of forming new ties if not it is very simple said stepan arkadyevich feeling more and more free from constraint 
 alexei alexandrovich scowling with emotion muttered something to himself and made no answer all that seemed so simple to stepan arkadyevich alexei alexandrovich had thought over thousands of times and so far from being simple it all seemed to him utterly impossible divorce the details of which he knew by this time seemed to him now out of the question because the sense of his own dignity and respect for religion forbade his taking upon himself a fictitious charge of adultery and still more suffering his wife pardoned and beloved by him to be caught in the fact and put to public shame divorce appeared to him impossible also on other still more weighty grounds

 wound had been a dangerous one though it did not touch the heart and for several days he hovered between life and death the first time he was able to speak varia his wife was alone in the room 
 varia he said looking sternly at her i shot myself by accident and please never speak of it and tell everyone so or else too ridiculous 
 without answering his words varia bent over him and with a delighted smile gazed into his face his eyes were clear not feverish but their expression was stern 
 thank god she said not in pain 
 a little here he pointed to his breast 
 then let me change your bandages 
 in silence stiffening his broad jaws he looked at her while she bandaged him up when she had finished he said 
 not delirious please manage that there may be no talk of my having shot myself on purpose 
 no one says so only i hope you shoot yourself by accident any more she said with a questioning smile 
 i think i but it would have been better 
 and he smiled gloomily 
 in spite of these words and this smile which so frightened varia when the inflammation was over and he began to recover he felt that he was completely free from one part of his misery by his action he had as it were washed away the shame and humiliation he had felt before he could now think calmly of alexei alexandrovich he recognized all his magnanimity but he did not now feel himself humiliated by it besides he got back again into the beaten track of his life he saw the possibility of looking men in the face again without shame and he could live in accordance with his own habits one thing he could not pluck out of his heart though he never ceased struggling with it the regret amounting to despair at having lost her forever that having expiated his sin against the husband he was now bound to renounce her and never in future to stand between her with her repentance and her husband he had firmly decided in his heart but he could not tear out of his heart his regret at the loss of her love he could not erase from his memory those moments of happiness which he had known with her and had so little prized at the time and which haunted him with all their charm 
 serpukhovskoy had planned his appointment at tashkend and vronsky agreed to the proposal without the slightest hesitation but the nearer the time of departure came the bitterer was the sacrifice he was making to what he thought his duty 
 his wound had healed and he was driving about making preparations for his departure for tashkend 
 to see her once and then to bury myself to die he thought and as he was paying farewell visits he uttered this thought to betsy charged with this commission betsy had gone to anna and brought him back a negative reply 
 so much the better thought vronsky when he received the news it was a weakness which would have shattered what strength i have left 
 next day betsy herself came to him in the morning and announced that she had heard through oblonsky as a positive fact that alexei alexandrovich had agreed to a divorce and that therefore vronsky could see anna 
 without even troubling himself to see betsy out of his flat forgetting all his resolutions without asking when he could see her or where her husband was vronsky drove straight to the karenins he ran up the stairs seeing no one and nothing and with a rapid step almost breaking into a run he went into her room and without considering without noticing whether there was anyone in the room or not he flung his arms round her and began to cover with kisses her face her hands her neck 
 anna had been preparing herself for this meeting had thought what she would say to him but she did not succeed in saying anything his passion mastered her she tried to calm him to calm herself but it was too late his feeling infected her her lips trembled so that for a long while she could say nothing 
 yes you have conquered me and i am yours she said at last pressing his hands to her bosom 
 so it had to be he said so long as we live it must be so i know it now 
 true she said getting whiter and whiter and embracing his head still there is something terrible in it after all that has happened 
 it will all pass it will all pass we shall be so happy our love if it only could be stronger will be strengthened by there being something terrible in it he said lifting his head and showing his strong teeth in a smile 
 and she could not but respond with a smile not to his words but to the love in his eyes she took his hand and stroked her chilled cheeks and cropped head with it 
 i know you with this short hair grown so pretty a boy but how pale you are 
 yes very weak she said smiling and her lips began trembling again 
 go to italy you will get strong he said 
 can it be possible we could be like husband and wife alone our own family she said looking close into his eyes 
 it only seems strange to me that it can ever have been otherwise 
 stiva says that he has agreed to everything but i accept his magnanimity she said looking dreamily past face i want a divorce all the same to me now only i know what he will decide about seriozha 
 he could not conceive how at this moment of their meeting she could remember and think of her son of divorce what did it all matter 
 speak of that think of it he said turning her hand in his and trying to draw her attention to him but still she did not look at him 
 oh why i die it would have been better she said and without sobbing tears flowed down both her cheeks but she tried to smile so as not to wound him 
 to decline the flattering and dangerous appointment at tashkend would have been vronsky had till then considered disgraceful and impossible but now without an consideration he declined it and observing dissatisfaction in the upper quarters at this step he immediately retired from the army 
 a month later alexei alexandrovich was left alone with his son in his house at peterburg while anna had gone abroad with vronsky without having obtained a divorce and having absolutely declined all idea of one

 wound had been a dangerous one though it did not touch the heart and for several days he hovered between life and death the first time he was able to speak varia his wife was alone in the room 
 varia he said looking sternly at her i shot myself by accident and please never speak of it and tell everyone so or else too ridiculous 
 without answering his words varia bent over him and with a delighted smile gazed into his face his eyes were clear not feverish but their expression was stern 
 thank god she said not in pain 
 a little here he pointed to his breast 
 then let me change your bandages 
 in silence stiffening his broad jaws he looked at her while she bandaged him up when she had finished he said 
 not delirious please manage that there may be no talk of my having shot myself on purpose 
 no one says so only i hope you shoot yourself by accident any more she said with a questioning smile 
 i think i but it would have been better 
 and he smiled gloomily 
 in spite of these words and this smile which so frightened varia when the inflammation was over and he began to recover he felt that he was completely free from one part of his misery by his action he had as it were washed away the shame and humiliation he had felt before he could now think calmly of alexei alexandrovich he recognized all his magnanimity but he did not now feel himself humiliated by it besides he got back again into the beaten track of his life he saw the possibility of looking men in the face again without shame and he could live in accordance with his own habits one thing he could not pluck out of his heart though he never ceased struggling with it the regret amounting to despair at having lost her forever that having expiated his sin against the husband he was now bound to renounce her and never in future to stand between her with her repentance and her husband he had firmly decided in his heart but he could not tear out of his heart his regret at the loss of her love he could not erase from his memory those moments of happiness which he had known with her and had so little prized at the time and which haunted him with all their charm 
 serpukhovskoy had planned his appointment at tashkend and vronsky agreed to the proposal without the slightest hesitation but the nearer the time of departure came the bitterer was the sacrifice he was making to what he thought his duty 
 his wound had healed and he was driving about making preparations for his departure for tashkend 
 to see her once and then to bury myself to die he thought and as he was paying farewell visits he uttered this thought to betsy charged with this commission betsy had gone to anna and brought him back a negative reply 
 so much the better thought vronsky when he received the news it was a weakness which would have shattered what strength i have left 
 next day betsy herself came to him in the morning and announced that she had heard through oblonsky as a positive fact that alexei alexandrovich had agreed to a divorce and that therefore vronsky could see anna 
 without even troubling himself to see betsy out of his flat forgetting all his resolutions without asking when he could see her or where her husband was vronsky drove straight to the karenins he ran up the stairs seeing no one and nothing and with a rapid step almost breaking into a run he went into her room and without considering without noticing whether there was anyone in the room or not he flung his arms round her and began to cover with kisses her face her hands her neck 
 anna had been preparing herself for this meeting had thought what she would say to him but she did not succeed in saying anything his passion mastered her she tried to calm him to calm herself but it was too late his feeling infected her her lips trembled so that for a long while she could say nothing 
 yes you have conquered me and i am yours she said at last pressing his hands to her bosom 
 so it had to be he said so long as we live it must be so i know it now 
 true she said getting whiter and whiter and embracing his head still there is something terrible in it after all that has happened 
 it will all pass it will all pass we shall be so happy our love if it only could be stronger will be strengthened by there being something terrible in it he said lifting his head and showing his strong teeth in a smile 
 and she could not but respond with a smile not to his words but to the love in his eyes she took his hand and stroked her chilled cheeks and cropped head with it 
 i know you with this short hair grown so pretty a boy but how pale you are 
 yes very weak she said smiling and her lips began trembling again 
 go to italy you will get strong he said 
 can it be possible we could be like husband and wife alone our own family she said looking close into his eyes 
 it only seems strange to me that it can ever have been otherwise 
 stiva says that he has agreed to everything but i accept his magnanimity she said looking dreamily past face i want a divorce all the same to me now only i know what he will decide about seriozha 
 he could not conceive how at this moment of their meeting she could remember and think of her son of divorce what did it all matter 
 speak of that think of it he said turning her hand in his and trying to draw her attention to him but still she did not look at him 
 oh why i die it would have been better she said and without sobbing tears flowed down both her cheeks but she tried to smile so as not to wound him 
 to decline the flattering and dangerous appointment at tashkend would have been vronsky had till then considered disgraceful and impossible but now without an consideration he declined it and observing dissatisfaction in the upper quarters at this step he immediately retired from the army 
 a month later alexei alexandrovich was left alone with his son in his house at peterburg while anna had gone abroad with vronsky without having obtained a divorce and having absolutely declined all idea of one

 it is not all in all sufficient to be wicked in order to prosper the was in a bad way 
 thanks to the francs thenardier had been able to avoid a protest and to honor his signature 
 on the following month they were again in need of money 
 the woman took outfit to paris and pawned it at the for sixty francs as soon as that sum was spent the thenardiers grew accustomed to look on the little girl merely as a child whom they were caring for out of charity and they treated her accordingly 
 as she had no longer any clothes they dressed her in the petticoats and chemises of the thenardier brats that is to say in rags they fed her on what all the rest had little better than the dog a little worse than the cat 
 moreover the cat and the dog were her habitual cosette ate with them under the table from a wooden bowl similar to theirs 
 the mother who had established herself as we shall see later on at m sur m wrote or more correctly caused to be written a letter every month that she might have news of her child the thenardiers replied invariably cosette is doing wonderfully well 
 at the expiration of the first six months the mother sent seven francs for the seventh month and continued her remittances with tolerable regularity from month to month 
 the year was not completed when thenardier said 
 a fine favor she is doing us in sooth 
 what does she expect us to do with her seven francs and he wrote to demand twelve francs 
 the mother whom they had persuaded into the belief that her child was happy and was coming on well submitted and forwarded the twelve francs 
 certain natures cannot love on the one hand without hating on the other 
 mother thenardier loved her two daughters passionately which caused her to hate the stranger 
 it is sad to think that the love of a mother can possess villainous aspects 
 little as was the space occupied by cosette it seemed to her as though it were taken from her own and that that little child diminished the air which her daughters breathed this woman like many women of her sort had a load of caresses and a burden of blows and injuries to dispense each day if she had not had cosette it is certain that her daughters idolized as they were would have received the whole of it but the stranger did them the service to divert the blows to herself her daughters received nothing but caresses 
 cosette could not make a motion which did not draw down upon her head a heavy shower of violent blows and unmerited chastisement 
 the sweet feeble being who should not have understood anything of this world or of god incessantly punished scolded beaten and seeing beside her two little creatures like herself who lived in a ray of dawn

 they are not rich and yet they are bringing up a poor child who was abandoned on their hands 
 they thought that mother had forgotten her 
 in the meanwhile thenardier having learned it is impossible to say by what obscure means that the child was probably a bastard and that the mother could not acknowledge it exacted fifteen francs a month saying that the creature was growing and eating and threatening to send her away 
 let her not bother me he exclaimed or fire her brat right into the middle of her secrets i must have an increase 
 the mother paid the fifteen francs 
 from year to year the child grew and so did her wretchedness 
 as long as cosette was little she was the of the two other children as soon as she began to develop a little that is to say before she was even five years old she became the servant of the household 
 five years old the reader will say that is not probable alas it is true 
 social suffering begins at all ages have we not recently seen the trial of a man named dumollard an orphan turned bandit who from the age of five as the official documents state being alone in the world worked for his living and stole 
 cosette was made to run on errands to sweep the rooms the courtyard the street to wash the dishes to even carry burdens 
 the thenardiers considered themselves all the more authorized to behave in this manner since the mother who was still at m sur m had become irregular in her payments 
 some months she was in arrears 
 if this mother had returned to montfermeil at the end of these three years she would not have recognized her child 
 cosette so pretty and rosy on her arrival in that house was now thin and pale she had an indescribably uneasy look 
 the sly creature said the thenardiers 
 injustice had made her peevish and misery had made her ugly nothing remained to her except her beautiful eyes which inspired pain because large as they were it seemed as though one beheld in them a still larger amount of sadness 
 it was a thing to see this poor child not yet six years old shivering in the winter in her old rags of linen full of holes sweeping the street before daylight with an enormous broom in her tiny red hands and a tear in her great eyes 
 she was called the lark in the neighborhood 
 the populace who are fond of these figures of speech had taken a fancy to bestow this name on this trembling frightened and shivering little creature no bigger than a bird who was awake every morning before any one else in the house or the village and was always in the street or the fields before daybreak 
 only the little lark never sang

 book two 
 chapter xii 
 
 at the levee prince andrew stood among the austrian officers as he had been told to and the emperor francis merely looked fixedly into his face and just nodded to him with to him with his long head but after it was over the adjutant he had seen the previous day ceremoniously informed bolkonski that the emperor desired to give him an audience the emperor francis received him standing in the middle of the room before the conversation began prince andrew was struck by the fact that the emperor seemed confused and blushed as if not knowing what to say 
 tell me when did the battle begin he asked hurriedly 
 prince andrew replied then followed other questions just as simple was kutuzov well when had he left krems and so on the emperor spoke as if his sole aim were to put a given number of questions the answers to these questions as was only too evident did not interest him 
 at what did the battle begin asked the emperor 
 i cannot inform your majesty at what the battle began at the front but at durrenstein where i was our attack began after five in the afternoon replied bolkonski growing more animated and expecting that he would have a chance to give a reliable account which he had ready in his mind of all he knew and had seen but the emperor smiled and interrupted him 
 how many miles 
 from where to where your majesty 
 from durrenstein to krems 
 three and a half miles your majesty 
 the french have abandoned the left bank 
 according to the scouts the last of them crossed on rafts during the night 
 is there sufficient forage in krems 
 forage has not been supplied to the extent 
 the emperor interrupted him 
 at what was general schmidt killed 
 at seven i believe 
 at seven very sad very sad 
 the emperor thanked prince andrew and bowed prince andrew withdrew and was immediately surrounded by courtiers on all sides everywhere he saw friendly looks and heard friendly words adjutant reproached him for not having stayed at the palace and offered him his own house the minister of war came up and congratulated him on the maria theresa order of the third grade which the emperor was conferring on him the empress chamberlain invited him to see her majesty the archduchess also wished to see him he did not know whom to answer and for a few seconds collected his thoughts then the russian ambassador took him by the shoulder led him to the window and began to talk to him 
 contrary to forecast the news he had brought was joyfully received a thanksgiving service was arranged kutuzov was awarded the grand cross of maria theresa and the whole army received rewards bolkonski was invited everywhere and had to spend the whole morning calling on the principal austrian dignitaries between four and five in the afternoon having made all his calls he was returning to house thinking out a letter to his father about the battle and his visit to brunn at the door he found a vehicle half full of luggage franz man was dragging a portmanteau with some difficulty out of the front door 
 before returning to prince andrew had gone to bookshop to provide himself with some books for the campaign and had spent some time in the shop 
 what is it he asked 
 oh your excellency said franz with difficulty rolling the portmanteau into the vehicle we are to move on still farther the scoundrel is again at our heels 
 eh what asked prince andrew 
 bilibin came out to meet him his usually calm face showed excitement 
 there now confess that this is delightful said he this affair of the thabor bridge at vienna they have crossed without striking a blow 
 prince andrew could not understand 
 but where do you come from not to know what every coachman in the town knows 
 i come from the archduchess i heard nothing there 
 and you see that everybody is packing up 
 i did not what is it all about inquired prince andrew impatiently 
 it all about why the french have crossed the bridge that auersperg was defending and the bridge was not blown up so murat is now rushing along the road to brunn and will be here in a day or two 
 what here but why did they not blow up the bridge if it was mined 
 that is what i ask you no one not even bonaparte knows why 
 bolkonski shrugged his shoulders 
 but if the bridge is crossed it means that the army too is lost it will be cut off said he 
 just it answered bilibin listen the french entered vienna as i told you very well next day which was yesterday those gentlemen messieurs les marechaux murat belliard mount and ride to bridge observe that all three are gascons gentlemen says one of them you know the thabor bridge is mined and doubly mined and that there are menacing fortifications at its head and an army of fifteen thousand men has been ordered to blow up the bridge and not let us cross but it will please our sovereign the emperor napoleon if we take this bridge so let us three go and take it yes say the others and off they go and take the bridge cross it and now with their whole army are on this side of the danube marching on us you and your lines of communication 
 the marshalls 
 stop jesting said prince andrew sadly and seriously this news grieved him and yet he was pleased 
 as soon as he learned that the russian army was in such a hopeless situation it occurred to him that it was he who was destined to lead it out of this position that here was the toulon that would lift him from the ranks of obscure officers and offer him the first step to fame listening to bilibin he was already imagining how on reaching the army he would give an opinion at the war council which would be the only one that could save the army and how he alone would be entrusted with the executing of the plan 
 stop this jesting he said 
 i am not jesting bilibin went on nothing is truer or sadder these gentlemen ride onto the bridge alone and wave white handkerchiefs they assure the officer on duty that they the marshals are on their way to negotiate with prince auersperg he lets them enter the they spin him a thousand gasconades saying that the war is over that the emperor francis is arranging a meeting with bonaparte that they desire to see prince auersperg and so on the officer sends for auersperg these gentlemen embrace the officers crack jokes sit on the cannon and meanwhile a french battalion gets to the bridge unobserved flings the bags of incendiary material into the water and approaches the at length appears the lieutenant general our dear prince auersperg von mautern himself dearest foe flower of the austrian army hero of the turkish wars hostilities are ended we can shake one hand the emperor napoleon burns with impatience to make prince acquaintance in a word those gentlemen gascons indeed so bewildered him with fine words and he is so flattered by his rapidly established intimacy with the french marshals and so dazzled by the sight of mantle and ostrich plumes voit que du feu et oublie celui devait faire faire sur in spite of the animation of his speech bilibin did not forget to pause after this mot to give time for its due appreciation the french battalion rushes to the bridgehead spikes the guns and the bridge is taken but what is best of all he went on his excitement subsiding under the delightful interest of his own story is that the sergeant in charge of the cannon which was to give the signal to fire the mines and blow up the bridge this sergeant seeing that the french troops were running onto the bridge was about to fire but lannes stayed his hand the sergeant who was evidently wiser than his general goes up to auersperg and says prince you are being deceived here are the french murat seeing that all is lost if the sergeant is allowed to speak turns to auersperg with feigned astonishment he is a true gascon and says i recognize the austrian discipline if you allow a subordinate to address you like that it was a stroke of genius prince auersperg feels his dignity at stake and orders the sergeant to be arrested come you must own that this affair of the thabor bridge is delightful it is not exactly stupidity nor rascality 
 bridgehead 
 that their fire gets into his eyes and he forgets that he ought to be firing at the enemy 
 it may be treachery said prince andrew vividly imagining the gray overcoats wounds the smoke of gunpowder the sounds of firing and the glory that awaited him 
 not that either that puts the court in too bad a light replied not treachery nor rascality nor stupidity it is just as at ulm it is he seemed to be trying to find the right expression du mack nous sommes mackes it is it is a bit of mack we are macked he concluded feeling that he had produced a good epigram a fresh one that would be repeated his hitherto puckered brow became smooth as a sign of pleasure and with a slight smile he began to examine his nails 
 where are you off to he said suddenly to prince andrew who had risen and was going toward his room 
 i am going away 
 where to 
 to the army 
 but you meant to stay another two days 
 but now i am off at once 
 and prince andrew after giving directions about his departure went to his room 
 do you know mon cher said bilibin following him i have been thinking about you why are you going 
 and in proof of the conclusiveness of his opinion all the wrinkles vanished from his face 
 prince andrew looked inquiringly at him and gave no reply 
 why are you going i know you think it your duty to gallop back to the army now that it is in danger i understand that mon cher it is heroism 
 not at all said prince andrew 
 but as you are a philosopher be a consistent one look at the other side of the question and you will see that your duty on the contrary is to take care of yourself leave it to those who are no longer fit for anything else you have not been ordered to return and have not been dismissed from here therefore you can stay and go with us wherever our ill luck takes us they say we are going to olmutz and olmutz is a very decent town you and i will travel comfortably in my caleche 
 do stop joking bilibin cried bolkonski 
 i am speaking sincerely as a friend consider where and why are you going when you might remain here you are faced by one of two things and the skin over his left temple puckered either you will not reach your regiment before peace is concluded or you will share defeat and disgrace with whole army 
 and bilibin unwrinkled his temple feeling that the dilemma was insoluble 
 i cannot argue about it replied prince andrew coldly but he thought i am going to save the army 
 my dear fellow you are a hero said bilibin

 book two 
 chapter xii 
 
 at the levee prince andrew stood among the austrian officers as he had been told to and the emperor francis merely looked fixedly into his face and just nodded to him with to him with his long head but after it was over the adjutant he had seen the previous day ceremoniously informed bolkonski that the emperor desired to give him an audience the emperor francis received him standing in the middle of the room before the conversation began prince andrew was struck by the fact that the emperor seemed confused and blushed as if not knowing what to say 
 tell me when did the battle begin he asked hurriedly 
 prince andrew replied then followed other questions just as simple was kutuzov well when had he left krems and so on the emperor spoke as if his sole aim were to put a given number of questions the answers to these questions as was only too evident did not interest him 
 at what did the battle begin asked the emperor 
 i cannot inform your majesty at what the battle began at the front but at durrenstein where i was our attack began after five in the afternoon replied bolkonski growing more animated and expecting that he would have a chance to give a reliable account which he had ready in his mind of all he knew and had seen but the emperor smiled and interrupted him 
 how many miles 
 from where to where your majesty 
 from durrenstein to krems 
 three and a half miles your majesty 
 the french have abandoned the left bank 
 according to the scouts the last of them crossed on rafts during the night 
 is there sufficient forage in krems 
 forage has not been supplied to the extent 
 the emperor interrupted him 
 at what was general schmidt killed 
 at seven i believe 
 at seven very sad very sad 
 the emperor thanked prince andrew and bowed prince andrew withdrew and was immediately surrounded by courtiers on all sides everywhere he saw friendly looks and heard friendly words adjutant reproached him for not having stayed at the palace and offered him his own house the minister of war came up and congratulated him on the maria theresa order of the third grade which the emperor was conferring on him the empress chamberlain invited him to see her majesty the archduchess also wished to see him he did not know whom to answer and for a few seconds collected his thoughts then the russian ambassador took him by the shoulder led him to the window and began to talk to him 
 contrary to forecast the news he had brought was joyfully received a thanksgiving service was arranged kutuzov was awarded the grand cross of maria theresa and the whole army received rewards bolkonski was invited everywhere and had to spend the whole morning calling on the principal austrian dignitaries between four and five in the afternoon having made all his calls he was returning to house thinking out a letter to his father about the battle and his visit to brunn at the door he found a vehicle half full of luggage franz man was dragging a portmanteau with some difficulty out of the front door 
 before returning to prince andrew had gone to bookshop to provide himself with some books for the campaign and had spent some time in the shop 
 what is it he asked 
 oh your excellency said franz with difficulty rolling the portmanteau into the vehicle we are to move on still farther the scoundrel is again at our heels 
 eh what asked prince andrew 
 bilibin came out to meet him his usually calm face showed excitement 
 there now confess that this is delightful said he this affair of the thabor bridge at vienna they have crossed without striking a blow 
 prince andrew could not understand 
 but where do you come from not to know what every coachman in the town knows 
 i come from the archduchess i heard nothing there 
 and you see that everybody is packing up 
 i did not what is it all about inquired prince andrew impatiently 
 it all about why the french have crossed the bridge that auersperg was defending and the bridge was not blown up so murat is now rushing along the road to brunn and will be here in a day or two 
 what here but why did they not blow up the bridge if it was mined 
 that is what i ask you no one not even bonaparte knows why 
 bolkonski shrugged his shoulders 
 but if the bridge is crossed it means that the army too is lost it will be cut off said he 
 just it answered bilibin listen the french entered vienna as i told you very well next day which was yesterday those gentlemen messieurs les marechaux murat belliard mount and ride to bridge observe that all three are gascons gentlemen says one of them you know the thabor bridge is mined and doubly mined and that there are menacing fortifications at its head and an army of fifteen thousand men has been ordered to blow up the bridge and not let us cross but it will please our sovereign the emperor napoleon if we take this bridge so let us three go and take it yes say the others and off they go and take the bridge cross it and now with their whole army are on this side of the danube marching on us you and your lines of communication 
 the marshalls 
 stop jesting said prince andrew sadly and seriously this news grieved him and yet he was pleased 
 as soon as he learned that the russian army was in such a hopeless situation it occurred to him that it was he who was destined to lead it out of this position that here was the toulon that would lift him from the ranks of obscure officers and offer him the first step to fame listening to bilibin he was already imagining how on reaching the army he would give an opinion at the war council which would be the only one that could save the army and how he alone would be entrusted with the executing of the plan

 chapter forty 
 
 
 when the first bitterness was over the family accepted the inevitable and tried to bear it cheerfully helping one another by the increased affection which comes to bind households tenderly together in times of trouble they put away their grief and each did his or her part toward making that last year a happy one 
 the pleasantest room in the house was set apart for beth and in it was gathered everything that she most loved flowers pictures her piano the little worktable and the beloved pussies best books found their way there easy chair desk finest sketches and every day meg brought her babies on a loving pilgrimage to make sunshine for aunty beth john quietly set apart a little sum that he might enjoy the pleasure of keeping the invalid supplied with the fruit she loved and longed for old hannah never wearied of concocting dainty dishes to tempt a capricious appetite dropping tears as she worked and from across the sea came little gifts and cheerful letters seeming to bring breaths of warmth and fragrance from lands that know no winter 
 here cherished like a household saint in its shrine sat beth tranquil and busy as ever for nothing could change the sweet unselfish nature and even while preparing to leave life she tried to make it happier for those who should remain behind the feeble fingers were never idle and one of her pleasures was to make little things for the school children daily passing to and fro to drop a pair of mittens from her window for a pair of purple hands a needlebook for some small mother of many dolls penwipers for young penmen toiling through forests of pothooks scrapbooks for eyes and all manner of pleasant devices till the reluctant climbers of the ladder of learning found their way strewn with flowers as it were and came to regard the gentle giver as a sort of fairy godmother who sat above there and showered down gifts miraculously suited to their tastes and needs if beth had wanted any reward she found it in the bright little faces always turned up to her window with nods and smiles and the droll little letters which came to her full of blots and gratitude 
 the first few months were very happy ones and beth often used to look round and say how beautiful this is as they all sat together in her sunny room the babies kicking and crowing on the floor mother and sisters working near and father reading in his pleasant voice from the wise old books which seemed rich in good and comfortable words as applicable now as when written centuries ago a little chapel where a paternal priest taught his flock the hard lessons all must learn trying to show them that hope can comfort love and faith make resignation possible simple sermons that went straight to the souls of those who listened for the heart was in the religion and the frequent falter in the voice gave a double eloquence to the words he spoke or read 
 it was well for all that this peaceful time was given them as preparation for the sad hours to come for beth said the needle was so heavy and put it down forever talking wearied her faces troubled her pain claimed her for its own and her tranquil spirit was sorrowfully perturbed by the ills that vexed her feeble flesh ah me such heavy days such long long nights such aching hearts and imploring prayers when those who loved her best were forced to see the thin hands stretched out to them beseechingly to hear the bitter cry help me help me and to feel that there was no help a sad eclipse of the serene soul a sharp struggle of the young life with death but both were mercifully brief and then the natural rebellion over the old peace returned more beautiful than ever with the wreck of her frail body soul grew strong and though she said little those about her felt that she was ready saw that the first pilgrim called was likewise the fittest and waited with her on the shore trying to see the shining ones coming to receive her when she crossed the river 
 jo never left her for an hour since beth had said i feel stronger when you are here she slept on a couch in the room waking often to renew the fire to feed lift or wait upon the patient creature who seldom asked for anything and tried not to be a trouble all day she haunted the room jealous of any other nurse and prouder of being chosen then than of any honor her life ever brought her precious and helpful hours to jo for now her heart received the teaching that it needed lessons in patience were so sweetly taught her that she could not fail to learn them charity for all the lovely spirit that can forgive and truly forget unkindness the loyalty to duty that makes the hardest easy and the sincere faith that fears nothing but trusts undoubtingly 
 often when she woke jo found beth reading in her little book heard her singing softly to beguile the sleepless night or saw her lean her face upon her hands while slow tears dropped through the transparent fingers and jo would lie watching her with thoughts too deep for tears feeling that beth in her simple unselfish way was trying to wean herself from the dear old life and fit herself for the life to come by sacred words of comfort quiet prayers and the music she loved so well 
 seeing this did more for jo than the wisest sermons the saintliest hymns the most fervent prayers that any voice could utter for with eyes made clear by many tears and a heart softened by the tenderest sorrow she recognized the beauty of her unambitious yet full of the genuine virtues which smell sweet and blossom in the dust the that makes the humblest on earth remembered soonest in heaven the true success which is possible to all 
 one night when beth looked among the books upon her table to find something to make her forget the mortal weariness that was almost as hard to bear as pain as she turned the leaves of her old favorite progress she found a little paper scribbled over in hand the name caught her eye and the blurred look of the lines made her sure that tears had fallen on it 
 poor jo fast asleep so i wake her to ask leave she shows me all her things and i think mind if i look at this thought beth with a glance at her sister who lay on the rug with the tongs beside her ready to wake up the minute the log fell apart 
 
 
 my beth 
 sitting patient in the shadow 
 till the blessed light shall come 
 a serene and saintly presence 
 sanctifies our troubled home 
 earthly joys and hopes and sorrows 
 break like ripples on the strand 
 of the deep and solemn river 
 where her willing feet now stand 
 o my sister passing from me 
 out of human care and strife 
 leave me as a gift those virtues 
 which have beautified your life 
 dear bequeath me that great patience 
 which has power to sustain 
 a cheerful uncomplaining spirit 
 in its of pain 
 give me for i need it sorely 
 of that courage wise and sweet 
 which has made the path of duty 
 green beneath your willing feet 
 give me that unselfish nature 
 that with charity devine 
 can pardon wrong for dear sake 
 meek heart forgive me mine 
 thus our parting daily loseth 
 something of its bitter pain 
 and while learning this hard lesson 
 my great loss becomes my gain 
 for the touch of grief will render 
 my wild nature more serene 
 give to life new aspirations 
 a new trust in the unseen 
 henceforth safe across the river 
 i shall see forever more 
 a beloved household spirit 
 waiting for me on the shore 
 hope and faith born of my sorrow 
 guardian angels shall become 
 and the sister gone before me 
 by their hands shall lead me home 
 
 blurred and blotted faulty and feeble as the lines were they brought a look of inexpressible comfort to face for her one regret had been that she had done so little and this seemed to assure her that her life had not been useless that her death would not bring the despair she feared as she sat with the paper folded between her hands the charred log fell asunder jo started up revived the blaze and crept to the bedside hoping beth slept 
 not asleep but so happy dear see i found this and read it i knew you care have i been all that to you jo she asked with wistful humble earnestness 
 oh beth so much so much and head went down upon the pillow beside her 
 then i feel as if wasted my life not so good as you make me but i have tried to do right and now when too late to begin even to do better such a comfort to know that someone loves me so much and feels as if helped them 
 more than any one in the world beth i used to think i let you go but learning to feel that i lose you that be more to me than ever and death part us though it seems to 
 i know it cannot and i fear it any longer for sure i shall be your beth still to love and help you more than ever you must take my place jo and be everything to father and mother when gone they will turn to you fail them and if hard to work alone remember that i forget you and that be happier in doing that than writing splendid books or seeing all the world for love is the only thing that we can carry with us when we go and it makes the go easy 
 try beth and then and there jo renounced her old ambition pledged herself to a new and better one acknowledging the poverty of other desires and feeling the blessed solace of a belief in the immortality of love 
 so the spring days came and went the sky grew clearer the earth greener the flowers were up fairly early and the birds came back in time to say goodbye to beth who like a tired but trustful child clung to the hands that had led her all her life as father and mother guided her tenderly through the valley of the shadow and gave her up to god 
 seldom except in books do the dying utter memorable words see visions or depart with beatified countenances and those who have sped many parting souls know that to most the end comes as naturally and simply as sleep as beth had hoped the tide went out easily and in the dark hour before dawn on the bosom where she had drawn her first breath she quietly drew her last with no farewell but one loving look one little sigh 
 with tears and prayers and tender hands mother and sisters made her ready for the long sleep that pain would never mar again seeing with grateful eyes the beautiful serenity that soon replaced the pathetic patience that had wrung their hearts so long and feeling with reverent joy that to their darling death was a benignant angel not a phantom full of dread 
 when morning came for the first time in many months the fire was out place was empty and the room was very still but a bird sang blithely on a budding bough close by the snowdrops blossomed freshly at the window and the spring sunshine streamed in like a benediction over the placid face upon the pillow a face so full of painless peace that those who loved it best smiled through their tears and thanked god that beth was well at last

 autumn seemed to arrive suddenly that year the morning of the first of september was crisp as an apple and as the little family bobbed across the rumbling road toward the great sooty station the fumes of car exhausts and the breath of pedestrians sparkled like cobwebs in the cold air two large cages tattled on top of the laden trolleys the parents were pushing the owls inside them hooted indignantly and the redheaded girl trailed fearfully behind here brothers clutching her fathers arm 
 
 it wont be long and youll be going too harry told her 
 
 two years sniffed lily i want to go now 
 
 the commuters stared curiously at the owls as the family wove its way toward the barrier between platforms nine and ten albuss voice drifted back to harry over the surrounding clamor his sons had resumed the argument they had started in the car 
 
 i wont i wont be a slytherin 
 
 james give it a rest said ginny 
 
 i only said he might be said james grinning at his younger brother theres nothing wrong with that he might be in slytherin 
 
 but james caught his mothers eye and fell silent the five potters approached the barrier with a slightly cocky look over his shoulder at his younger brother james took the trolley from his mother and broke into a run a moment later he had vanished 
 
 youll write to me wont you albus asked his parents immediately capitalizing on the momentary absence of his brother 
 
 every day if you want us to said ginny 
 
 not every day said albus quickly james says most people only get letters from home about once a month 
 
 we wrote to james three times a week last year said ginny 
 
 and you dont want to believe everything he tells you about hogwarts harry put in he likes a laugh your brother 
 
 side by side they pushed the second trolley forward gathering speed as they reached the barrier albus winced but no collision came instead the family emerged onto platform nine and which was obscured by thick white steam that was pouring from the scarlet hogwarts express indistinct figures were swarming through the mist into which james had already disappeared 
 
 where are they asked albus anxiously peering at the hazy forms they passed as they made their way down the platform 
 
 well find them said ginny reassuringly 
 
 but the vapor was dense and it was difficult to make out anybodys faces detached from their owners voices sounded unnaturally loud harry thought he head percy discoursing loudly on broomstick regulations and was quite glad of the excuse not to stop and say hello 
 
 i think thats them al said ginny suddenly 
 
 a group of four people emerged from the mist standing alongside the very last carriage their faces only came into focus when harry ginny lily and albus had drawn right up to them 
 
 hi said albus sounding immensely relieved 
 
 rose who was already wearing her hogwarts robes beamed at him 
 
 parked all right then ron asked harry i did hermione didnt believe i could pass a muggle driving test did you she thought id have to confound the examiner 
 
 no i didnt said hermione i had complete faith in you 
 
 as a matter of fact i did confund him ron whispered to harry as together they lifted albuss trunk and owl onto the train i only forgot to look in the wing mirror and lets face it i can use a supersensory charm for that 
 
 back on the platform they found lily and hugo roses younger brother having an animated discussion about which house they would be sorted into when they finally went to hogwarts 
 
 if youre not in gryffindor well disinherit you said ron but no pressure 
 
 ron 
 
 lily and hugo laughed but albus and rose looked solemn 
 
 he doesnt mean it said hermione and ginny but ron was no longer paying attention catching harrys eye he nodded covertly to a point some fifty yards away the steam had thinned for a moment and three people stood in sharp relief against the shifting mist 
 
 look who it is 
 
 draco malfoy was standing there with his wife and son a dark coat buttoned up to his throat his hair was receding somewhat which emphasized the pointed chin the new boy resembled draco as much as albus resembled harry draco caught sight of harry ron hermione and ginny staring at him nodded curtly and turned away again 
 
 so thats little scorpius said ron under his breath make sure you beat him in every test rosie thank god you inherited your mothers brains

 harry crouched down so that albuss face was slightly above his own alone of harrys three children albus had inherited lilys eyes 
 
 albus severus harry said quietly so that nobody but ginny could hear and she was tactful enough to pretend to be waving to rose who was now on the train you were named for two headmasters of hogwarts one of them was a slytherin and he was probably the bravest man i ever knew

 albus rose hugo and lily laughed the train began to more and harry walked alongside it watching his sons thin face already ablaze with excitement harry kept smiling and waving even though it was like a little bereavement watching his son glide away from him 
 
 the last trace of steam evaporated in the autumn air the train rounded a corner harrys hand was still raised in farewell

 fairy tales of hans christian andersen 
 the butterfly 
 by hans christian andersen 
 
 there was once a butterfly who wished for a bride and as may 
 be supposed he wanted to choose a very pretty one from among the 
 flowers he glanced with a very critical eye at all the 
 and found that the flowers were seated quietly and demurely on their 
 stalks just as maidens should sit before they are engaged but 
 there was a great number of them and it appeared as if his search 
 would become very wearisome the butterfly did not like to take too 
 much trouble so he flew off on a visit to the daisies the french 
 call this flower marguerite and they say that the little daisy 
 can prophesy lovers pluck off the leaves and as they pluck each 
 leaf they ask a question about their lovers thus does he or she 
 love me ardently distractedly very much a little not at all 
 and so on every one speaks these words in his own language the 
 butterfly came also to marguerite to inquire but he did not pluck off 
 her leaves he pressed a kiss on each of them for he thought there 
 was always more to be done by kindness 
 
 darling marguerite daisy he said to her you are the wisest 
 woman of all the flowers pray tell me which of the flowers i shall 
 choose for my wife which will be my bride when i know i will fly 
 directly to her and propose 
 
 but marguerite did not answer him she was offended that he should 
 call her a woman when she was only a girl and there is a great 
 difference he asked her a second time and then a third but she 
 remained dumb and answered not a word then he would wait no 
 longer but flew away to commence his wooing at once it was in the 
 early spring when the crocus and the snowdrop were in full bloom 
 they are very pretty thought the butterfly charming little 
 lasses but they are rather formal 
 
 then as the young lads often do he looked out for the elder 
 girls he next flew to the anemones these were rather sour to his 
 taste the violet a little too sentimental the too 
 small and besides there was such a large family of them the 
 though they looked like roses bloomed but 
 might fall off with the first wind that blew and he 
 thought that a marriage with one of them might last too short a 
 time the pleased him most of all she was white and 
 red graceful and slender and belonged to those domestic maidens 
 who have a pretty appearance and can yet be useful in the kitchen he was just about to make her an offer when close by the maiden he saw a pod with a withered flower hanging at the end 
 
 who is that he asked 
 
 that is my sister replied the 
 
 oh indeed and you will be like her some day said he and he 
 flew away directly for he felt quite shocked 
 
 a honeysuckle hung forth from the hedge in full bloom but 
 there were so many girls like her with long faces and sallow 
 complexions no he did not like her but which one did he like 
 spring went by and summer drew towards its close autumn came 
 but he had not decided the flowers now appeared in their most 
 gorgeous robes but all in vain they had not the fresh fragrant 
 air of youth for the heart asks for fragrance even when it is no 
 longer young and there is very little of that to be found in the 
 dahlias or the dry chrysanthemums therefore the butterfly turned to 
 the mint on the ground you know this plant has no blossom but it is sweetness all over full of fragrance from head to foot with the 
 scent of a flower in every leaf 
 
 i will take her said the butterfly and he made her an offer 
 but the mint stood silent and stiff as she listened to him at last 
 she said 
 
 friendship if you please nothing more i am old and you are 
 old but we may live for each other just the same as to marrying no 
 let us appear ridiculous at our age 
 
 and so it happened that the butterfly got no wife at all he had 
 been too long choosing which is always a bad plan and the 
 butterfly became what is called an old bachelor 
 
 it was late in the autumn with rainy and cloudy weather the cold 
 wind blew over the bowed backs of the willows so that they creaked 
 again it was not the weather for flying about in summer clothes 
 but fortunately the butterfly was not out in it he had got a 
 shelter by chance it was in a room heated by a stove and as warm 
 as summer he could exist here he said well enough 
 
 but it is not enough merely to exist said he i need 
 freedom sunshine and a little flower for a companion 
 
 then he flew against the and was seen and admired 
 by those in the room who caught him and stuck him on a pin in a box of curiosities they could not do more for him 
 
 now i am perched on a stalk like the flowers said the 
 butterfly it is not very pleasant certainly i should imagine it is 
 something like being married for here i am stuck fast and with this 
 thought he consoled himself a little 
 
 that seems very poor consolation said one of the plants in 
 the room that grew in a pot 
 
 ah thought the butterfly one very well trust these 
 plants in pots they have too much to do with mankind

 of usury 
 many have made witty invectives against usury they say that it is pity the devil 
 should have part which is the tithe that the usurer is me greatest sabbath 
 breaker because his plough goeth every sunday that the userer is the drone that 
 virgil speaketh of ignavum fucos pecus a praesepibus arcent 
 
 that the usurer breaketh the first law that was made for mankind after the fall 
 which was in sudore vultus tui comedes panem tuum not in sudore vultus aliem that usurers should have bonnets because they do judaise that it is against nature for money to beget money and the like i say this only that usury is a concessum propter duritiem cads for since there must be borrowing and lending and men are so hard of heart as they will not lend freely usury must be permitted some others have made suspicious and cunning propositions of banks discovery of estates and other inventions 
 but few have spoken of usury usefully it is good to set before us the incommodides and commodities of usury that the good may be either weighed out or culled out and warily to provide that while we make forth to that which is better we meet not with that which is worse 
 
 the discommodities of usury are first that it makes fewer merchants for were it 
 not for this lazy trade of usury money would not lie still but would in great part 
 be employed upon merchandising which is the vena porta of wealth in a state the 
 second that it makes poor merchants for as a fanner cannot husband his ground so well if he sit at a great rent so the merchant cannot drive his trade so well if 
 he sit at great usury the third is incident to the other two and that is the decay of customs of kings or states which ebb or flow with merchandising the fourth that it bringeth the treasure of a realm or state into a few hands for the usurer being at certainties and others at uncertainties at the end of the game most of the money will be in the box and ever a state flourisheth when wealth is more equally spread the fifth that it beats down the price of land for the employment of money is chiefly either merchandising or purchasing and usury waylays both the sixth that it dolh dull and damp all industries improvements and new inventions wherein money would be stirring if it were not for this slug the last that it is the cancer and ruin of many estates which in process of time breeds a public poverty 
 on the other side the commodities of usury are first that howsoever usury in some respect hindereth merchandising yet in some other it advanceth it for it is certain that the greatest part of trade is driven by young merchants upon borrowing at interest so as if the usurer either call in or keep back his money there will ensue presently a great stand of trade the second is that were it not for this easy borrowing upon interest necessities would draw upon them a most sudden undoing in that they would be forced to sell their means be it lands or goods far under foot and so whereas duty doth but gnaw upon them bad markets would swallow them quite up 
 as for mortgaging or pawning it will lime mend the matter for either men will not take pawns without use or if they do they will look precisely for the forfeiture i remember a cruel moneyed man in the country that would say the devil 
 take this usury it keeps us from forfeitures of mortgages and bonds the third and 
 last is that it is a vanity to conceive that there would be ordinary borrowing without 
 profit and it is impossible to conceive the number ofinconveniencies that will ensue if borrowing be cramped 
 therefore to speak of the abolishing of usury is idle all states have ever had it in one kind or rate or other so as that opinion must be sent to utopia 
 
 to speak now of the reformation and reiglement of usury how the discommodities of it may be best avoided and the commodities retained it appears by the balance of commodities and discommodities of usury two things are to be reconciled the one that the tooth of usury be grinded that it bite not too much the other that there be left open a means to invite moneyed men to lend to the merchants for the continuing and quickening of trade this cannot be done except you introduce two several sorts of usury a less and a greater for if you reduce usury to one low rate it will ease the common borrower but the merchant will be to seek for money and it is to be noted that the trade of merchandise being the most lucrative may bear usury at a good rate other contracts not so 
 
 to serve both intentions the way would be briefly thus that there be two rates of 
 usury the one free and general for all the other under licence only to certain 
 persons and in certain places of merchandising first therefore let usury in

 of usury 
 many have made witty invectives against usury they say that it is pity the devil 
 should have part which is the tithe that the usurer is me greatest sabbath 
 breaker because his plough goeth every sunday that the userer is the drone that 
 virgil speaketh of ignavum fucos pecus a praesepibus arcent 
 
 that the usurer breaketh the first law that was made for mankind after the fall 
 which was in sudore vultus tui comedes panem tuum not in sudore vultus aliem that usurers should have bonnets because they do judaise that it is against nature for money to beget money and the like i say this only that usury is a concessum propter duritiem cads for since there must be borrowing and lending and men are so hard of heart as they will not lend freely usury must be permitted some others have made suspicious and cunning propositions of banks discovery of estates and other inventions 
 but few have spoken of usury usefully it is good to set before us the incommodides and commodities of usury that the good may be either weighed out or culled out and warily to provide that while we make forth to that which is better we meet not with that which is worse 
 
 the discommodities of usury are first that it makes fewer merchants for were it 
 not for this lazy trade of usury money would not lie still but would in great part 
 be employed upon merchandising which is the vena porta of wealth in a state the 
 second that it makes poor merchants for as a fanner cannot husband his ground so well if he sit at a great rent so the merchant cannot drive his trade so well if 
 he sit at great usury the third is incident to the other two and that is the decay of customs of kings or states which ebb or flow with merchandising the fourth that it bringeth the treasure of a realm or state into a few hands for the usurer being at certainties and others at uncertainties at the end of the game most of the money will be in the box and ever a state flourisheth when wealth is more equally spread the fifth that it beats down the price of land for the employment of money is chiefly either merchandising or purchasing and usury waylays both the sixth that it dolh dull and damp all industries improvements and new inventions wherein money would be stirring if it were not for this slug the last that it is the cancer and ruin of many estates which in process of time breeds a public poverty 
 on the other side the commodities of usury are first that howsoever usury in some respect hindereth merchandising yet in some other it advanceth it for it is certain that the greatest part of trade is driven by young merchants upon borrowing at interest so as if the usurer either call in or keep back his money there will ensue presently a great stand of trade the second is that were it not for this easy borrowing upon interest necessities would draw upon them a most sudden undoing in that they would be forced to sell their means be it lands or goods far under foot and so whereas duty doth but gnaw upon them bad markets would swallow them quite up 
 as for mortgaging or pawning it will lime mend the matter for either men will not take pawns without use or if they do they will look precisely for the forfeiture i remember a cruel moneyed man in the country that would say the devil 
 take this usury it keeps us from forfeitures of mortgages and bonds the third and 
 last is that it is a vanity to conceive that there would be ordinary borrowing without 
 profit and it is impossible to conceive the number ofinconveniencies that will ensue if borrowing be cramped 
 therefore to speak of the abolishing of usury is idle all states have ever had it in one kind or rate or other so as that opinion must be sent to utopia 
 
 to speak now of the reformation and reiglement of usury how the discommodities of it may be best avoided and the commodities retained it appears by the balance of commodities and discommodities of usury two things are to be reconciled the one that the tooth of usury be grinded that it bite not too much the other that there be left open a means to invite moneyed men to lend to the merchants for the continuing and quickening of trade this cannot be done except you introduce two several sorts of usury a less and a greater for if you reduce usury to one low rate it will ease the common borrower but the merchant will be to seek for money and it is to be noted that the trade of merchandise being the most lucrative may bear usury at a good rate other contracts not so 
 
 to serve both intentions the way would be briefly thus that there be two rates of 
 usury the one free and general for all the other under licence only to certain 
 persons and in certain places of merchandising first therefore let usury in 
 general be reduced to five in the hundred and let that rate be proclaimed to be 
 free and current and let the state shut itself out to take any penalty for the same 
 
 this will preserve borrowing from any general stop or dryness this will ease infinite borrowers in the country this will in good part raise the price of land because land purchased at sixteen years purchase will yield six in the hundred and somewhat more whereas this rate of interest yields but five this by like reason will encourage and edge industrious and profitable improvements because many will rather venture in that kind than take five in the hundred especially having been used to greater profit secondly let there be certain persons licensed to lend to known merchants upon usury at a higher rate and let it be with the cautions following 
 let the rate be even with the merchant himself somewhat more easy than that he 
 used formerly to pay for by that means all borrowers shall have some ease by this reformation be he merchant or whosoever let it be no rank or common stock but every man be master of his own money not that i altogether mislike banks but they will hardly be brooked in regard of certain suspicions let me state be answered some small matter for the licence and the rest left to the lender for if the abatement be but small it will no whit discourage the lender for he for example that took before ten or nine in the hundred will sooner descend to eight in the hundred than give over his trade of usury and go from certain gains to gains of hazard 
 let these licenced lenders be in number indefinite but restrained to certain 
 principal cities and towns of merchandising for then they will be hardly able to 
 colour other monies in the country so as the licence of nine will not suck 
 away the current rate of five for no man will send his monies far off nor put them 
 into unknown hands 
 
 if it be objected that this doth in a sort authorise usury which before was in 
 some places but permissive the answer is mat it is better to mitigate usury by 
 declaration than to suffer it to rage by connivance

 that same night having taken leave of the minister of war bolkonski set off to rejoin the army not knowing where he would find it and fearing to be captured by the french on the way to krems 
 in brunn everybody attached to the court was packing up and the heavy baggage was already being dispatched to olmutz near hetzelsdorf prince andrew struck the high road along which the russian army was moving with great haste and in the greatest disorder the road was so obstructed with carts that it was impossible to get by in a carriage prince andrew took a horse and a cossack from a cossack commander and hungry and weary making his way past the baggage wagons rode in search of the commander in chief and of his own luggage very sinister reports of the position of the army reached him as he went along and the appearance of the troops in their disorderly flight confirmed these rumors 
 cette armee russe que de a transportee des extremites de nous allons lui faire eprouver le meme sort le sort de he remembered these words in address to his army at the beginning of the campaign and they awoke in him astonishment at the genius of his hero a feeling of wounded pride and a hope of glory and should there be nothing left but to die he thought well if need be i shall do it no worse than others 
 that russian army which has been brought from the ends of the earth by english gold we shall cause to share the same fate the fate of the army at ulm 
 he looked with disdain at the endless confused mass of detachments carts guns artillery and again baggage wagons and vehicles of all kinds overtaking one another and blocking the muddy road three and sometimes four abreast from all sides behind and before as far as ear could reach there were the rattle of wheels the creaking of carts and gun carriages the tramp of horses the crack of whips shouts the urging of horses and the swearing of soldiers orderlies and officers all along the sides of the road fallen horses were to be seen some flayed some not and carts beside which solitary soldiers sat waiting for something and again soldiers straggling from their companies crowds of whom set off to the neighboring villages or returned from them dragging sheep fowls hay and bulging sacks at each ascent or descent of the road the crowds were yet denser and the din of shouting more incessant soldiers floundering in mud pushed the guns and wagons themselves whips cracked hoofs slipped traces broke and lungs were strained with shouting the officers directing the march rode backward and forward between the carts their voices were but feebly heard amid the uproar and one saw by their faces that they despaired of the possibility of checking this disorder 
 here is our dear orthodox russian army thought bolkonski recalling words 
 wishing to find out where the commander in chief was he rode up to a convoy directly opposite to him came a strange vehicle evidently rigged up by soldiers out of any available materials and looking like something between a cart a cabriolet and a caleche a soldier was driving and a woman enveloped in shawls sat behind the apron under the leather hood of the vehicle prince andrew rode up and was just putting his question to a soldier when his attention was diverted by the desperate shrieks of the woman in the vehicle an officer in charge of transport was beating the soldier who was driving the vehicle for trying to get ahead of others and the strokes of his whip fell on the apron of the equipage the woman screamed piercingly seeing prince andrew she leaned out from behind the apron and waving her thin arms from under the woolen shawl cried 
 mr mr for sake protect me what will become of us i am the wife of the doctor of the seventh chasseurs they let us pass we are left behind and have lost our people 
 flatten you into a pancake shouted the angry officer to the soldier turn back with your slut 
 mr help me what does it all mean screamed the wife 
 kindly let this cart pass you see a woman said prince andrew riding up to the officer 
 the officer glanced at him and without replying turned again to the soldier teach you to push on back 
 let them pass i tell you repeated prince andrew compressing his lips 
 and who are you cried the officer turning on him with tipsy rage who are you are you in command here eh i am commander here not you go back or flatten you into a pancake repeated he this expression evidently pleased him 
 that was a nice snub for the little came a voice from behind 
 prince andrew saw that the officer was in that state of senseless tipsy rage when a man does not know what he is saying he saw that his championship of the wife in her queer trap might expose him to what he dreaded more than anything in the world to ridicule but his instinct urged him on before the officer finished his sentence prince andrew his face distorted with fury rode up to him and raised his riding whip 
 let them pass 
 the officer flourished his arm and hastily rode away 
 all the fault of these fellows on the staff that this disorder he muttered do as you like 
 prince andrew without lifting his eyes rode hastily away from the wife who was calling him her deliverer and recalling with a sense of disgust the minutest details of this humiliating scene he galloped on to the village where he was told that the commander in chief was 
 on reaching the village he dismounted and went to the nearest house intending to rest if but for a moment eat something and try to sort out the stinging and tormenting thoughts that confused his mind this is a mob of scoundrels and not an army he was thinking as he went up to the window of the first house when a familiar voice called him by name 
 he turned round handsome face looked out of the little window nesvitski moving his moist lips as he chewed something and flourishing his arm called him to enter 
 bolkonski bolkonski you hear eh come quick he shouted 
 entering the house prince andrew saw nesvitski and another adjutant having something to eat they hastily turned round to him asking if he had any news on their familiar faces he read agitation and alarm this was particularly noticeable on usually laughing countenance 
 where is the commander in chief asked bolkonski 
 here in that house answered the adjutant 
 well is it true that peace and capitulation asked nesvitski 
 i was going to ask you i know nothing except that it was all i could do to get here 
 and we my dear boy terrible i was wrong to laugh at mack getting it still worse said nesvitski but sit down and have something to eat 
 you be able to find either your baggage or anything else now prince and god only knows where your man peter is said the other adjutant 
 where are headquarters 
 we are to spend the night in znaim 
 well i have got all i need into packs for two horses said nesvitski made up splendid packs for me fit to cross the bohemian mountains with a bad lookout old fellow but the matter with you you must be ill to shiver like that he added noticing that prince andrew winced as at an electric shock 
 nothing replied prince andrew 
 he had just remembered his recent encounter with the wife and the convoy officer 
 what is the commander in chief doing here he asked 
 i make out at all said nesvitski 
 well all i can make out is that everything is abominable abominable quite abominable said prince andrew and he went off to the house where the commander in chief was 
 passing by carriage and the exhausted saddle horses of his suite with their cossacks who were talking loudly together prince andrew entered the passage kutuzov himself he was told was in the house with prince bagration and weyrother weyrother was the austrian general who had succeeded schmidt in the passage little kozlovski was squatting on his heels in front of a clerk the clerk with cuffs turned up was hastily writing at a tub turned bottom upwards face looked worn he too had evidently not slept all night he glanced at prince andrew and did not even nod to him 
 second line have you written it he continued dictating to the clerk the kiev grenadiers podolian 
 one write so fast your honor said the clerk glancing angrily and disrespectfully at kozlovski 
 through the door came the sounds of voice excited and dissatisfied interrupted by another an unfamiliar voice from the sound of these voices the inattentive way kozlovski looked at him the disrespectful manner of the exhausted clerk the fact that the clerk and kozlovski were squatting on the floor by a tub so near to the commander in chief and from the noisy laughter of the cossacks holding the horses near the window prince andrew felt that something important and disastrous was about to happen 
 he turned to kozlovski with urgent questions 
 immediately prince said kozlovski dispositions for bagration 
 what about capitulation 
 nothing of the sort orders are issued for a battle 
 prince andrew moved toward the door from whence voices were heard just as he was going to open it the sounds ceased the door opened and kutuzov with his eagle nose and puffy face appeared in the doorway prince andrew stood right in front of kutuzov but the expression of the commander in one sound eye showed him to be so preoccupied with thoughts and anxieties as to be oblivious of his presence he looked straight at his face without recognizing him 
 well have you finished said he to kozlovski 
 one moment your excellency 
 bagration a gaunt man of medium height with a firm impassive face of oriental type came out after the commander in chief 
 i have the honor to present myself repeated prince andrew rather loudly handing kutuzov an envelope 
 ah from vienna very good later later 
 kutuzov went out into the porch with bagration 
 well prince said he to bagration my blessing and may christ be with you in your great endeavor 
 his face suddenly softened and tears came into his eyes with his left hand he drew bagration toward him and with his right on which he wore a ring he made the sign of the cross over him with a gesture evidently habitual offering his puffy cheek but bagration kissed him on the neck instead 
 christ be with you kutuzov repeated and went toward his carriage get in with me said he to bolkonski 
 your excellency i should like to be of use here allow me to remain with prince detachment 
 get in said kutuzov and noticing that bolkonski still delayed he added i need good officers myself need them myself 
 they got into the carriage and drove for a few minutes in silence 
 there is still much much before us he said as if with an old penetration he understood all that was passing in mind if a tenth part of his detachment returns i shall thank god he added as if speaking to himself 
 prince andrew glanced at face only a foot distant from him and involuntarily noticed the carefully washed seams of the scar near his temple where an ismail bullet had pierced his skull and the empty eye socket yes he has a right to speak so calmly of those death thought bolkonski 
 that is why i beg to be sent to that detachment he said 
 kutuzov did not reply he seemed to have forgotten what he had been saying and sat plunged in thought five minutes later gently swaying on the soft springs of the carriage he turned to prince andrew there was not a trace of agitation on his face with delicate irony he questioned prince andrew about the details of his interview with the emperor about the remarks he had heard at court concerning the krems affair and about some ladies they both knew

 kutuzov did not reply he seemed to have forgotten what he had been saying and sat plunged in thought five minutes later gently swaying on the soft springs of the carriage he turned to prince andrew there was not a trace of agitation on his face with delicate irony he questioned prince andrew about the details of his interview with the emperor about the remarks he had heard at court concerning the krems affair and about some ladies they both knew

 lecture did laurie good though of course he did not own it till long afterward men seldom do for when women are the advisers the lords of creation take the advice till they have persuaded themselves that it is just what they intended to do then they act upon it and if it succeeds they give the weaker vessel half the credit of it if it fails they generously give her the whole laurie went back to his grandfather and was so dutifully devoted for several weeks that the old gentleman declared the climate of nice had improved him wonderfully and he had better try it again there was nothing the young gentleman would have liked better but elephants could not have dragged him back after the scolding he had received pride forbid and whenever the longing grew very strong he fortified his resolution by repeating the words that had made the deepest impression i despise you go and do something splendid that will make her love you 
 laurie turned the matter over in his mind so often that he soon brought himself to confess that he had been selfish and lazy but then when a man has a great sorrow he should be indulged in all sorts of vagaries till he has lived it down he felt that his blighted affections were quite dead now and though he should never cease to be a faithful mourner there was no occasion to wear his weeds ostentatiously jo love him but he might make her respect and admire him by doing something which should prove that a no had not spoiled his life he had always meant to do something and advice was quite unnecessary he had only been waiting till the aforesaid blighted affections were decently interred that being done he felt that he was ready to hide his stricken heart and still toil on 
 as goethe when he had a joy or a grief put it into a song so laurie resolved to embalm his love sorrow in music and to compose a requiem which should harrow up soul and melt the heart of every hearer therefore the next time the old gentleman found him getting restless and moody and ordered him off he went to vienna where he had musical friends and fell to work with the firm determination to distinguish himself but whether the sorrow was too vast to be embodied in music or music too ethereal to uplift a mortal woe he soon discovered that the requiem was beyond him just at present it was evident that his mind was not in working order yet and his ideas needed clarifying for often in the middle of a plaintive strain he would find himself humming a dancing tune that vividly recalled the christmas ball at nice especially the stout frenchman and put an effectual stop to tragic composition for the time being 
 then he tried an opera for nothing seemed impossible in the beginning but here again unforeseen difficulties beset him he wanted jo for his heroine and called upon his memory to supply him with tender recollections and romantic visions of his love but memory turned traitor and as if possessed by the perverse spirit of the girl would only recall oddities faults and freaks would only show her in the most unsentimental mats with her head tied up in a bandana barricading herself with the sofa pillow or throwing cold water over his passion a la an irresistable laugh spoiled the pensive picture he was endeavoring to paint jo be put into the opera at any price and he had to give her up with a bless that girl what a torment she is and a clutch at his hair as became a distracted composer 
 when he looked about him for another and a less intractable damsel to immortalize in melody memory produced one with the most obliging readiness this phantom wore many faces but it always had golden hair was enveloped in a diaphanous cloud and floated airily before his eye in a pleasing chaos of roses peacocks white ponies and blue ribbons he did not give the complacent wraith any name but he took her for his heroine and grew quite fond of her as well he might for he gifted her with every gift and grace under the sun and escorted her unscathed through trials which would have annihilated any mortal woman 
 thanks to this inspiration he got on swimmingly for a time but gradually the work lost its charm and he forgot to compose while he sat musing pen in hand or roamed about the gay city to get some new ideas and refresh his mind which seemed to be in a somewhat unsettled state that winter he did not do much but he thought a great deal and was conscious of a change of some sort going on in spite of himself genius simmering perhaps let it simmer and see what comes of it he said with a secret suspicion all the while that it genius but something far more common whatever it was it simmered to some purpose for he grew more and more discontented with his desultory life began to long for some real and earnest work to go at soul and body and finally came to the wise conclusion that everyone who loved music was not a composer returning from one of grand operas splendidly performed at the royal theatre he looked over his own played a few of the best parts sat staring at the busts of mendelssohn beethoven and bach who stared benignly back again then suddenly he tore up his music sheets one by one and as the last fluttered out of his hand he said soberly to himself 
 she is right talent genius and you make it so that music has taken the vanity out of my as rome took it out of her and i be a humbug any longer now what shall i do 
 that seemed a hard question to answer and laurie began to wish he had to work for his daily bread now if ever occurred an eligible opportunity for going to the devil as he once forcibly expressed it for he had plenty of money and nothing to do and satan is proverbially fond of providing employment for full and idle hands the poor fellow had temptations enough from without and from within but he withstood them pretty well for much as he valued liberty he valued good faith and confidence more so his promise to his grandfather and his desire to be able to look honestly into the eyes of the women who loved him and say well kept him safe and steady 
 very likely some mrs grundy will observe i believe it boys will be boys young men must sow their wild oats and women must not expect miracles i dare say you mrs grundy but true nevertheless women work a good many miracles and i have a persuasion that they may perform even that of raising the standard of manhood by refusing to echo such sayings let the boys be boys the longer the better and let the young men sow their wild oats if they must but mothers sisters and friends may help to make the crop a small one and keep many tares from spoiling the harvest by believing and showing that they believe in the possibility of loyalty to the virtues which make men manliest in good eyes if it is a feminine delusion leave us to enjoy it while we may for without it half the beauty and the romance of life is lost and sorrowful forebodings would embitter all our hopes of the brave tenderhearted little lads who still love their mothers better than themselves and are not ashamed to own it 
 laurie thought that the task of forgetting his love for jo would absorb all his powers for years but to his great surprise he discovered it grew easier every day he refused to believe it at first got angry with himself and understand it but these hearts of ours are curious and contrary things and time and nature work their will in spite of us heart ache the wound persisted in healing with a rapidity that astonished him and instead of trying to forget he found himself trying to remember he had not foreseen this turn of affairs and was not prepared for it he was disgusted with himself surprised at his own fickleness and full of a queer mixture of disappointment and relief that he could recover from such a tremendous blow so soon he carefully stirred up the embers of his lost love but they refused to burst into a blaze there was only a comfortable glow that warmed and did him good without putting him into a fever and he was reluctantly obliged to confess that the boyish passion was slowly subbsiding into a more tranquil sentiment very tender a little sad and resentful still but that was sure to pass away in time leaving a brotherly affection which would last unbroken to the end 
 as the word brotherly passed through his mind in one of his reveries he smiled and glanced up at the picture of mozart that was before him 
 well he was a great man and when he have one sister he took the other and was happy 
 laurie did not utter the words but he thought them and the next instant kissed the little old ring saying to himself no i i forgotten i never can try again and if that fails why then 
 leaving his sentence unfinished he seized pen and paper and wrote to jo telling her that he could not settle to anything while there was the least hope of her changing her mind she she and let him come home and be happy while waiting for an answer he did nothing but he did it energetically for he was in a fever of impatience it came at last and settled his mind effectually on one point for jo decidedly and she was wrapped up in beth and never wished to hear the word love again then she begged him to be happy with somebody else but always keep a little corner of his ghart for his loving sister jo in a postscript she desired him not to tell amy that beth was worse she was coming home in the spring and there was no need of saddening the remainder of her stay that would be time enough please god but laurie must write to her often and not let her feel lonely homesick or anxious 
 so i will at once poor little girl it will be a sad going home for her afraid and laurie opened his desk as if writing to amy had been the proper conclusion of the sentence left unfinished some weeks before 
 but he did not write the letter that day for as he rummaged out his best paper he came across something which changed his purpose tumbling about in one part of the desk among bills passports and business documents of various kinds were several of letters and in another compartment were three notes from amy carefully tied up with one of her blue ribbons and sweetly suggestive of the little dead roses put away inside with a expression laurie gathered up all letters smoothed folded and put them neatly into a small drawer of the desk stood a minute turning the ring thoughtfully on his finger then slowly drew it off laid it with the letters locked the drawer and went out to hear high mass at saint feeling as if there had been a funeral and though not overwhelmed with affliction this seemed a more proper way to spend the rest of the day than in writing letters to charming young ladies 
 the letter went very soon however and was promptly answered for amy was homesick and confessed it in the most delightfully confiding manner the correspondence flourished famously and letters flew to and fro with unfailing regularity all through the early spring laurie sold his busts made allumettes of his opera and went back to paris hoping somebody would arrive before long he wanted desperately to go to nice but would not till he was asked and amy would not ask him for just then she was having little experiences of her own which made her rather wish to avoid the quizzical eyes of out boy 
 fred vaughn had returned and put the question to which she had once decided to answer yes thank you but now she said no thank you kindly but steadily for when the time came her courage failed her and she found that something more than money and position was needed to satisfy the new longing that filled her heart so full of tender hopes and fears the words fred is a good fellow but not at all the man i fancied you would ever like and face when he uttered them kept returning to her as pertinaciously as her own did when she said in look if not in words i shall marry for money it troubled her to remember that now she wished she could take it back it sounded so unwomanly she want laurie to think her a heartless worldly creature she care to be a queen of society now half so much as she did to be a lovable woman she was so glad he hate her for the dreadful things she said but took them so beautifully and was kinder than ever his letters were such a comfort for the home letters were very irregular and not half so satisfactory as his when they did come it was not only a pleasure but a duty to answer them for the poor fellow was forlorn and needed petting since jo persisted in being stonyhearted she ought to have made an effort and tried to love him it be very hard many people would be proud and glad to have such a dear boy care for them but jo never would act like other girls so there was nothing to do but be very kind and treat him like a brother 
 if all brothers were treated as well as laurie was at this period they would be a much happier race of beings than they are amy never lectured now she asked his opinion on all subjects she was interested in everything he did made charming little presents for him and sent him two letters a week full of lively gossip sisterly confidences and captivating sketches of the lovely scenes about her as few brothers are complimented by having their letters carried about in their pockets read and reread diligently cried over when short kissed when long and treasured carefully we will not hint that amy did any of these fond and foolish things but she certainly did grow a little pale and pensive that spring lost much of her relish for society and went out sketching alone a good deal she never had much to show when she came home but was studying nature i dare say while she sat for hours with her hands folded on the terrace at valrosa or absently sketched any fancy that occurred to her a stalwart knight carved on a tomb a young man asleep in the grass with his hat over his eyes or a curly haired girl in gorgeous array promenading down a ballroom on the arm of a tall gentleman both faces being left a blur according to the last fashion in art which was safe but not altogether satisfactory 
 her aunt thought that she regretted her answer to fred and finding denials useless and explanations impossible amy left her to think what she liked taking care that laurie should know that fred had gone to egypt that was all but he understood it and looked relieved as he said to himself with a venerable air 
 i was sure she would think better of it poor old fellow been through it all and i can sympathize 
 with that he heaved a great sigh and then as if he had discharged his duty to the past put his feet up on the sofa and enjoyed letter luxuriously 
 while these changes were going on abroad trouble had come at home but the letter telling that beth was failing never reached amy and when the next found her at vevay for the heat had driven them from nice in may and they had travelled slowly to switzerland by way of genoa and the italian lakes she bore it very well and quietly submitted to the family decree that she should not shorten her visit for since it was too late to say goodbye to beth she had better stay and let absence soften her sorrow but her heart was very heavy she longed to be at home and every day looked wistfully across the lake waiting for laurie to come and comfort her 
 he did come very soon for the same mail brought letters to them both but he was in germany and it took some days to reach him the moment he read it he packed his knapsack bade adieu to his fellow pedestrians and was off to keep his promise with a heart full of joy and sorrow hope and suspense 
 he knew vevay well and as soon as the boat touched the little quay he hurried along the shore to la tour where the carrols were living en pension the garcon was in despair that the whole family had gone to take a promenade on the lake but no the blonde mademoiselle might be in the chateau garden if monsier would give himself the pain of sitting down a flash of time should present her but monsieur could not wait even a flash of time and in the middle of the speech departed to find mademoiselle himself 
 a pleasant old garden on the borders of the lovely lake with chestnuts rustling overhead ivy climbing everywhere and the black shadow of the tower falling far across the sunny water at one corner of the wide low wall was a seat and here amy often came to read or work or console herself with the beauty all about her she was sitting here that day leaning her head on her hand with a homesick heart and heavy eyes thinking of beth and wondering why laurie did not come she did not hear him cross the courtyard beyond nor see him pause in the archway that led from the subterranean path into the garden he stood a minute looking at her with new eyes seeing what no one had ever seen before the tender side of character everything about her mutely suggested love and sorrow the blotted letters in her lap the black ribbon that tied up her hair the womanly pain and patience in her face even the little ebony cross at her throat seemed pathetic to laurie for he had given it to her and she wore it as her only ornament if he had any doubts about the reception she would give him they were set at rest the minute she looked up and saw him for dropping everything she ran to him exclaiming in a tone of unmistakable love and longing 
 oh laurie laurie i knew come to me 
 i think everything was said and settled then for as they stood together quite silent for a moment with the dark head bent down protectingly over the light one amy felt that no one could comfort and sustain her so well as laurie and laurie decided that amy was the only woman in the world who could fill place and make him happy he did not tell her so but she was not disappointed for both felt the truth were satisfied and gladly left the rest to silence 
 in a minute amy went back to her place and while she dried her tears laurie gathered up the scattered papers finding in the sight of sundry letters and suggestive sketches good omens for the future as he sat down beside her amy felt shy again and turned rosy red at the recollection of her impulsive greeting 
 i help it i felt so lonely and sad and was so very glad to see you it was such a surprise to look up and find you just as i was beginning to fear you come she said trying in vain to speak quite naturally 
 i came the minute i heard i wish i could say something to comfort you for the loss of dear little beth but i can only feel and he could not get any further for her too turned bashful all of a sudden and did not quite know what to say he longed to lay head down on his shoulder and tell her to have a good cry but he did not dare so took her hand instead and gave it a sympathetic squeeze that was better than words 
 you say anything this comforts me she said softly beth is well and happy and i wish her back but i dread the going home much as i long to see them all we talk about it now for it makes me cry and i want to enjoy you while you stay you go right back need you 
 not if you want me dear 
 i do so much aunt and flo are very kind but you seem like one of the family and it would be so comfortable to have you for a little while 
 amy spoke and looked so like a homesick child whose heart was full that laurie forgot his bashfulness all at once and gave her just what she petting she was used to and the cheerful conversation she needed 
 poor little soul you look as if grieved yourself half sick going to take care of you so cry any more but come and walk about with me the wind is too chilly for you to sit still he said in the way that amy liked as he tied on her hat drew her arm through his and began to pace up and down the sunny walk under the chestnuts he felt more at ease upon his legs and amy found it pleasant to have a strong arm to lean upon a familiar face to smile at her and a kind voice to talk delightfully for her alone 
 the quaint old garden had sheltered many pairs of lovers and seemed expressly made for them so sunny and secluded was it with nothing but the tower to overlook them and the wide lake to carry away the echo of their words as it rippled by below for an hour this new pair walked and talked or rested on the wall enjoying the sweet influences which gave such a charm to time and place and when an unromantic dinner bell warned them away amy felt as if she left her burden of lonliness and sorrow behind her in the chateau garden 
 the moment mrs carrol saw the altered face she was illuminated with a new idea and exclaimed to herself now i understand it child has been pining for young laurence bless my heart i never thought of such a thing 
 with praiseworthy discretion the good lady said nothing and betrayed no sign of enlightenment but cordially urged laurie to stay and begged amy to enjoy his society for it would do her more good than so much solitude amy was a model of docility and as her aunt was a good deal occupied with flo she was left to entertain her friend and did it with more than her usual success 
 at nice laurie had lounged and amy had scolded at vevay laurie was never idle but always walking riding boating or studying in the most energetic manner while amy admired everything he did and followed his example as far and as fast as she could he said the change was owing to the climate and she did not contradict him being glad of a like excuse for her own recovered health and spirits 
 the invigorating air did them both good and much exercise worked wholesome changes in minds as well as bodies they seemed to get clearer views of life and duty up there among the everlasting hills the fresh winds blew away desponding doubts delusive fancies and moody mists the warm spring sunshine brought out all sorts of aspiring ideas tender hopes and happy thoughts the lake seemed to wash away the troubles of the past and the grand old mountains to look benignly down upon them saying little children love one another 
 in spite of the new sorrow it was a very happy time so happy that laurie could not bear to disturb it by a word it took him a little while to recover from his surprise at the cure of his first and as he had firmly believed his last and only love he consoled himself for the seeming disloyalty by the thought that sister was almost the same as self and the conviction that it would have been impossible to love any other woman but amy so soon and so well his first wooing had been of the tempestuous order and he looked back upon it as if through a long vista of years with a feeling of compassion blended with regret he was not ashamed of it but put it away as one of the experiences of his life for which he could be grateful when the pain was over his second wooing he resolved should be as calm and simple as possible there was no need of having a scene hardly any need of telling amy that he loved her she knew it without words and had given him his answer long ago it all came about so naturally that no one could complain and he knew that everybody would be pleased even jo but when our first little passion has been crushed we are apt to be wary and slow in making a second trial so laurie let the days pass enjoying every hour and leaving to chance the utterance of the word that would put an end to the first and sweetest part of his new romance 
 he had rather imagined that the denoument would take place in the chateau garden by moonlight and in the most graceful and decorus manner but it turned out exactly the reverse for the matter was settled on the lake at noonday in a few blunt words they had been floating about all the morning from gloomy st gingolf to sunny montreux with the alps of savoy on one side mont st bernard and the dent du midi on the other pretty vevay in the valley and lausanne upon the hill beyond a cloudless blue sky overhead and the bluer lake below dotted with the picturesque boats that look like gulls 
 they had been talking of bonnivard as they glided past chillon and of rousseau as they looked up at clarens where he wrote his heloise neither had read it but they knew it was a love story and each privately wondered if it was half as interesting as their own amy had been dabbling her hand in the water during the little pause that fell between them and when she looked up laurie was leaning on his oars with an expression in his eyes that made her say hastily merely for the sake of saying something 
 you must be tired rest a little and let me row it will do me good for since you came i have been altogether lazy and luxurious 
 not tired but you may take an oar if you like room enough though i have to sit nearly in the middle else the boat trim returned laurie as if he rather liked the arrangment 
 feeling that she had not mended matters much amy took the offered third of a seat shook her hair over her face and accepted an oar she rowed as well as she did many other things and though she used both hands and laurie but one the oars kept time and the boat went smoothly through the water 
 how well we pull together we said amy who objected to silence just then 
 so well that i wish we might always pull in the same boat will you amy very tenderly 
 yes laurie very low 
 then they both stopped rowing and unconsciously added a pretty little tableau of human love and happiness to the dissolving views reflected in the lake

 if all brothers were treated as well as laurie was at this period they would be a much happier race of beings than they are amy never lectured now she asked his opinion on all subjects she was interested in everything he did made charming little presents for him and sent him two letters a week full of lively gossip sisterly confidences and captivating sketches of the lovely scenes about her as few brothers are complimented by having their letters carried about in their pockets read and reread diligently cried over when short kissed when long and treasured carefully we will not hint that amy did any of these fond and foolish things but she certainly did grow a little pale and pensive that spring lost much of her relish for society and went out sketching alone a good deal she never had much to show when she came home but was studying nature i dare say while she sat for hours with her hands folded on the terrace at valrosa or absently sketched any fancy that occurred to her a stalwart knight carved on a tomb a young man asleep in the grass with his hat over his eyes or a curly haired girl in gorgeous array promenading down a ballroom on the arm of a tall gentleman both faces being left a blur according to the last fashion in art which was safe but not altogether satisfactory 
 her aunt thought that she regretted her answer to fred and finding denials useless and explanations impossible amy left her to think what she liked taking care that laurie should know that fred had gone to egypt that was all but he understood it and looked relieved as he said to himself with a venerable air 
 i was sure she would think better of it poor old fellow been through it all and i can sympathize 
 with that he heaved a great sigh and then as if he had discharged his duty to the past put his feet up on the sofa and enjoyed letter luxuriously 
 while these changes were going on abroad trouble had come at home but the letter telling that beth was failing never reached amy and when the next found her at vevay for the heat had driven them from nice in may and they had travelled slowly to switzerland by way of genoa and the italian lakes she bore it very well and quietly submitted to the family decree that she should not shorten her visit for since it was too late to say goodbye to beth she had better stay and let absence soften her sorrow but her heart was very heavy she longed to be at home and every day looked wistfully across the lake waiting for laurie to come and comfort her 
 he did come very soon for the same mail brought letters to them both but he was in germany and it took some days to reach him the moment he read it he packed his knapsack bade adieu to his fellow pedestrians and was off to keep his promise with a heart full of joy and sorrow hope and suspense 
 he knew vevay well and as soon as the boat touched the little quay he hurried along the shore to la tour where the carrols were living en pension the garcon was in despair that the whole family had gone to take a promenade on the lake but no the blonde mademoiselle might be in the chateau garden if monsier would give himself the pain of sitting down a flash of time should present her but monsieur could not wait even a flash of time and in the middle of the speech departed to find mademoiselle himself 
 a pleasant old garden on the borders of the lovely lake with chestnuts rustling overhead ivy climbing everywhere and the black shadow of the tower falling far across the sunny water at one corner of the wide low wall was a seat and here amy often came to read or work or console herself with the beauty all about her she was sitting here that day leaning her head on her hand with a homesick heart and heavy eyes thinking of beth and wondering why laurie did not come she did not hear him cross the courtyard beyond nor see him pause in the archway that led from the subterranean path into the garden he stood a minute looking at her with new eyes seeing what no one had ever seen before the tender side of character everything about her mutely suggested love and sorrow the blotted letters in her lap the black ribbon that tied up her hair the womanly pain and patience in her face even the little ebony cross at her throat seemed pathetic to laurie for he had given it to her and she wore it as her only ornament if he had any doubts about the reception she would give him they were set at rest the minute she looked up and saw him for dropping everything she ran to him exclaiming in a tone of unmistakable love and longing 
 oh laurie laurie i knew come to me 
 i think everything was said and settled then for as they stood together quite silent for a moment with the dark head bent down protectingly over the light one amy felt that no one could comfort and sustain her so well as laurie and laurie decided that amy was the only woman in the world who could fill place and make him happy he did not tell her so but she was not disappointed for both felt the truth were satisfied and gladly left the rest to silence 
 in a minute amy went back to her place and while she dried her tears laurie gathered up the scattered papers finding in the sight of sundry letters and suggestive sketches good omens for the future as he sat down beside her amy felt shy again and turned rosy red at the recollection of her impulsive greeting 
 i help it i felt so lonely and sad and was so very glad to see you it was such a surprise to look up and find you just as i was beginning to fear you come she said trying in vain to speak quite naturally 
 i came the minute i heard i wish i could say something to comfort you for the loss of dear little beth but i can only feel and he could not get any further for her too turned bashful all of a sudden and did not quite know what to say he longed to lay head down on his shoulder and tell her to have a good cry but he did not dare so took her hand instead and gave it a sympathetic squeeze that was better than words 
 you say anything this comforts me she said softly beth is well and happy and i wish her back but i dread the going home much as i long to see them all we talk about it now for it makes me cry and i want to enjoy you while you stay you go right back need you 
 not if you want me dear 
 i do so much aunt and flo are very kind but you seem like one of the family and it would be so comfortable to have you for a little while 
 amy spoke and looked so like a homesick child whose heart was full that laurie forgot his bashfulness all at once and gave her just what she petting she was used to and the cheerful conversation she needed 
 poor little soul you look as if grieved yourself half sick going to take care of you so cry any more but come and walk about with me the wind is too chilly for you to sit still he said in the way that amy liked as he tied on her hat drew her arm through his and began to pace up and down the sunny walk under the chestnuts he felt more at ease upon his legs and amy found it pleasant to have a strong arm to lean upon a familiar face to smile at her and a kind voice to talk delightfully for her alone 
 the quaint old garden had sheltered many pairs of lovers and seemed expressly made for them so sunny and secluded was it with nothing but the tower to overlook them and the wide lake to carry away the echo of their words as it rippled by below for an hour this new pair walked and talked or rested on the wall enjoying the sweet influences which gave such a charm to time and place and when an unromantic dinner bell warned them away amy felt as if she left her burden of lonliness and sorrow behind her in the chateau garden 
 the moment mrs carrol saw the altered face she was illuminated with a new idea and exclaimed to herself now i understand it child has been pining for young laurence bless my heart i never thought of such a thing 
 with praiseworthy discretion the good lady said nothing and betrayed no sign of enlightenment but cordially urged laurie to stay and begged amy to enjoy his society for it would do her more good than so much solitude amy was a model of docility and as her aunt was a good deal occupied with flo she was left to entertain her friend and did it with more than her usual success 
 at nice laurie had lounged and amy had scolded at vevay laurie was never idle but always walking riding boating or studying in the most energetic manner while amy admired everything he did and followed his example as far and as fast as she could he said the change was owing to the climate and she did not contradict him being glad of a like excuse for her own recovered health and spirits 
 the invigorating air did them both good and much exercise worked wholesome changes in minds as well as bodies they seemed to get clearer views of life and duty up there among the everlasting hills the fresh winds blew away desponding doubts delusive fancies and moody mists the warm spring sunshine brought out all sorts of aspiring ideas tender hopes and happy thoughts the lake seemed to wash away the troubles of the past and the grand old mountains to look benignly down upon them saying little children love one another 
 in spite of the new sorrow it was a very happy time so happy that laurie could not bear to disturb it by a word it took him a little while to recover from his surprise at the cure of his first and as he had firmly believed his last and only love he consoled himself for the seeming disloyalty by the thought that sister was almost the same as self and the conviction that it would have been impossible to love any other woman but amy so soon and so well his first wooing had been of the tempestuous order and he looked back upon it as if through a long vista of years with a feeling of compassion blended with regret he was not ashamed of it but put it away as one of the experiences of his life for which he could be grateful when the pain was over his second wooing he resolved should be as calm and simple as possible there was no need of having a scene hardly any need of telling amy that he loved her she knew it without words and had given him his answer long ago it all came about so naturally that no one could complain and he knew that everybody would be pleased even jo but when our first little passion has been crushed we are apt to be wary and slow in making a second trial so laurie let the days pass enjoying every hour and leaving to chance the utterance of the word that would put an end to the first and sweetest part of his new romance 
 he had rather imagined that the denoument would take place in the chateau garden by moonlight and in the most graceful and decorus manner but it turned out exactly the reverse for the matter was settled on the lake at noonday in a few blunt words they had been floating about all the morning from gloomy st gingolf to sunny montreux with the alps of savoy on one side mont st bernard and the dent du midi on the other pretty vevay in the valley and lausanne upon the hill beyond a cloudless blue sky overhead and the bluer lake below dotted with the picturesque boats that look like gulls 
 they had been talking of bonnivard as they glided past chillon and of rousseau as they looked up at clarens where he wrote his heloise neither had read it but they knew it was a love story and each privately wondered if it was half as interesting as their own amy had been dabbling her hand in the water during the little pause that fell between them and when she looked up laurie was leaning on his oars with an expression in his eyes that made her say hastily merely for the sake of saying something 
 you must be tired rest a little and let me row it will do me good for since you came i have been altogether lazy and luxurious 
 not tired but you may take an oar if you like room enough though i have to sit nearly in the middle else the boat trim returned laurie as if he rather liked the arrangment 
 feeling that she had not mended matters much amy took the offered third of a seat shook her hair over her face and accepted an oar she rowed as well as she did many other things and though she used both hands and laurie but one the oars kept time and the boat went smoothly through the water 
 how well we pull together we said amy who objected to silence just then 
 so well that i wish we might always pull in the same boat will you amy very tenderly 
 yes laurie very low 
 then they both stopped rowing and unconsciously added a pretty little tableau of human love and happiness to the dissolving views reflected in the lake

 fairy tales of hans christian andersen 
 the child in the grave 
 by hans christian andersen 
 
 it was a very sad day and every heart in the house felt the 
 deepest grief for the youngest child a boy of four years old the 
 joy and hope of his parents was dead two daughters the elder of 
 whom was going to be confirmed still remained they were both good charming girls but the lost child always seems the dearest and 
 when it is youngest and a son it makes the trial still more heavy 
 
 the sisters mourned as young hearts can mourn and were especially 
 grieved at the sight of their parents sorrow the heart 
 was bowed down but the mother sunk completely under the deep grief 
 
 day and night she had attended to the sick child nursing and carrying 
 it in her bosom as a part of herself she could not realize the 
 fact that the child was dead and must be laid in a coffin to rest 
 in the ground she thought god could not take her darling little one 
 from her and when it did happen notwithstanding her hopes and her 
 belief and there could be no more doubt on the subject she said in 
 her feverish agony god does not know it he has 
 ministering spirits on earth who do according to their own will 
 and heed not a prayers thus in her great grief she fell 
 away from her faith in god and dark thoughts arose in her mind 
 respecting death and a future state she tried to believe that man was 
 but dust and that with his life all existence ended but these doubts 
 were no support to her nothing on which she could rest and she 
 sunk into the fathomless depths of despair in her darkest hours she 
 ceased to weep and thought not of the young daughters who were 
 still left to her the tears of her husband fell on her forehead 
 but she took no notice of him her thoughts were with her dead 
 child her whole existence seemed wrapped up in the remembrances of the little one and of every innocent word it had uttered 
 
 the day of the little funeral came for nights 
 previously the mother had not slept but in the morning twilight of 
 this day she sunk from weariness into a deep sleep in the mean time 
 the coffin was carried into a distant room and there nailed down 
 that she might not hear the blows of the hammer when she awoke and wanted to see her child the husband with tears said we have 
 closed the coffin it was necessary to do so 
 
 when god is so hard to me how can i expect men to be better 
 she said with groans and tears 
 
 the coffin was carried to the grave and the disconsolate mother 
 sat with her young daughters she looked at them but she saw them 
 not for her thoughts were far away from the domestic hearth she gave herself up to her grief and it tossed her to and fro as the sea 
 tosses a ship without compass or rudder so the day of the funeral 
 passed away and similar days followed of dark wearisome pain 
 
 with tearful eyes and mournful glances the sorrowing daughters and 
 the afflicted husband looked upon her who would not hear their words of comfort and indeed what comforting words could they speak when they were themselves so full of grief it seemed as if she 
 would never again know sleep and yet it would have been her best 
 friend one who would have strengthened her body and poured peace into her soul they at last persuaded her to lie down and then she would lie as still as if she slept 
 
 one night when her husband listened as he often did to her 
 breathing he quite believed that she had at length found rest and 
 relief in sleep he folded his arms and prayed and soon sunk 
 himself into healthful sleep therefore he did not notice that his 
 wife arose threw on her clothes and glided silently from the 
 house to go where her thoughts constantly lingered to the grave of 
 her child she passed through the garden to a path across a field 
 that led to the churchyard no one saw her as she walked nor did 
 she see any one for her eyes were fixed upon the one object of her 
 wanderings it was a lovely starlight night in the beginning of 
 september and the air was mild and still she entered the 
 churchyard and stood by the little grave which looked like a large 
 nosegay of fragrant flowers she sat down and bent her head low over the grave as if she could see her child through the earth that 
 covered him her little boy whose smile was so vividly before her 
 and the gentle expression of whose eyes even on his she 
 could not forget how full of meaning that glance had been as she 
 leaned over him holding in hers the pale hand which he had no longer 
 strength to raise as she had sat by his little cot so now she sat 
 by his grave and here she could weep freely and her tears fell upon 
 it 
 
 thou wouldst gladly go down and be with thy child said a 
 voice quite close to her a voice that sounded so deep and clear 
 that it went to her heart 
 
 she looked up and by her side stood a man wrapped in a black 
 cloak with a hood closely drawn over his face but her keen glance 
 could distinguish the face under the hood it was stern yet 
 awakened confidence and the eyes beamed with youthful radiance 
 
 down to my child she repeated and tones of despair and 
 entreaty sounded in the words 
 
 darest thou to follow me asked the form i am death 
 she bowed her head in token of assent then suddenly it appeared 
 as if all the stars were shining with the radiance of the full moon on 
 the flowers that decked the grave the earth that covered it was drawn back like a floating drapery she sunk down and the spectre covered her with a black cloak night closed around her the night of death she sank deeper than the spade of the sexton could penetrate till the churchyard became a roof above her then the cloak was removed and she found herself in a large hall of 
 dimensions in which there was a subdued light like 
 twilight reigning and in a moment her child appeared before her 
 smiling and more beautiful than ever with a silent cry she pressed 
 him to her heart a glorious strain of music sounded now distant now near never had she listened to such tones as these they came from beyond a large dark curtain which separated the regions of death 
 from the land of eternity 
 
 my sweet darling mother she heard the child say it was the 
 beloved voice and kiss followed kiss in boundless 
 delight then the child pointed to the dark curtain there is nothing 
 so beautiful on earth as it is here mother do you not see them 
 all oh it is happiness indeed 
 
 but the mother saw nothing of what the child pointed out only the 
 dark curtain she looked with earthly eyes and could not see as the 
 child saw he whom god has called to be with himself she could 
 hear the sounds of music but she heard not the words the word in 
 which she was to trust 
 
 i can fly now mother said the child i can fly with other 
 happy children into the presence of the almighty i would fain fly 
 away now but if you weep for me as you are weeping now you may never see me again and yet i would go so gladly may i not fly away and you will come to me soon will you not dear mother 
 
 oh stay stay implored the mother only one moment more only 
 once more that i may look upon thee and kiss thee and press thee to my heart 
 
 then she kissed and fondled her child suddenly her name was 
 called from above what could it mean her name uttered in a plaintive 
 voice 
 
 hearest thou said the child it is my father who calls 
 thee and in a few moments deep sighs were heard as of children 
 weeping they are my sisters said the child mother surely you 
 have not forgotten them 
 
 and then she remembered those she left behind and a great 
 terror came over her she looked around her at the dark night dim 
 forms flitted by she seemed to recognize some of them as they 
 floated through the regions of death towards the dark curtain where 
 they vanished would her husband and her daughters flit past no 
 their sighs and lamentations still sounded from above and she had 
 nearly forgotten them for the sake of him who was dead 
 
 mother now the bells of heaven are ringing said the child 
 
 mother the sun is going to rise 
 
 an overpowering light streamed in upon her the child had 
 vanished and she was being borne upwards all around her became cold 
 
 she lifted her head and saw that she was lying in the churchyard 
 on the grave of her child the lord in a dream had been a guide to 
 her feet and a light to her spirit she bowed her knees and prayed 
 for forgiveness she had wished to keep back a soul from its 
 immortal flight she had forgotten her duties towards the living who 
 were left her and when she had offered this prayer her heart felt 
 lighter the sun burst forth over her head a little bird carolled his 
 song and the sounded for the early service everything 
 around her seemed holy and her heart was chastened she 
 acknowledged the goodness of god she acknowledged the duties she had to perform and eagerly she returned home she bent over her 
 husband who still slept her warm devoted kiss awakened him and 
 words of heartfelt love fell from the lips of both now she was gentle 
 and strong as a wife can be and from her lips came the words of 
 faith whatever he doeth is right and best 
 
 then her husband asked from whence hast thou all at once derived 
 such strength and comforting faith 
 
 and as she kissed him and her children she said it came from 
 god through my child in the grave

 of youth age 
 a man that is young in years may be old in hours if he have lost no time but that 
 happeneth rarely generally youth is like the first cogitations not so wise as the 
 second for there is a youth in thoughts as well as in ages and yet the invention 
 of young men is more lively than that of old and imaginations stream into their minds better and as it were more divinely natures that have much heat and great and violent desires and perturbations are not ripe for action till they have passed 
 the meridian of meir years as it was with julius caesar and septimius severus of 
 the latter of whom it is said iuventutem egit enwibus imo fwonbus plenorn and 
 yet he was the ablest emperor almost of all me list but reposed natures may do well in youth as it is seen in augustus caesar cosmus duke of florence gaston de fois and others 
 on the other side heat and vivacity in age is an excellent composition 
 for business young men are fitter to invent than to judge fitter for execution 
 than for counsel and fitter for new projects man for settled business for the 
 experience of age in things that fall within the compass of it directeth them but 
 in new things abuseth them the errors of young men are the ruin of business but

 of youth age 
 a man that is young in years may be old in hours if he have lost no time but that 
 happeneth rarely generally youth is like the first cogitations not so wise as the 
 second for there is a youth in thoughts as well as in ages and yet the invention 
 of young men is more lively than that of old and imaginations stream into their minds better and as it were more divinely natures that have much heat and great and violent desires and perturbations are not ripe for action till they have passed 
 the meridian of meir years as it was with julius caesar and septimius severus of 
 the latter of whom it is said iuventutem egit enwibus imo fwonbus plenorn and 
 yet he was the ablest emperor almost of all me list but reposed natures may do well in youth as it is seen in augustus caesar cosmus duke of florence gaston de fois and others 
 on the other side heat and vivacity in age is an excellent composition 
 for business young men are fitter to invent than to judge fitter for execution 
 than for counsel and fitter for new projects man for settled business for the 
 experience of age in things that fall within the compass of it directeth them but 
 in new things abuseth them the errors of young men are the ruin of business but 
 me errors of aged men amount but to this that more might have been done or sooner 
 
 young men in the conduct and manage of actions embrace more than they can hold stir more than they can quiet fly to the end without consideration of the means and degrees pursue some few principles which they have chanced upon absurdly care not to innovate which draws unknown inconveniences use extreme remedies at first and that which doubled all errors will not acknowledge or retract them like an unready horse that will neither stop nor turn men of age object too much consult too long adventure too little repent too soon and seldom drive business home to the full period but content themselves with a mediocrity of success

 on november kutuzov had received through a spy news that the army he commanded was in an almost hopeless position the spy reported that the french after crossing the bridge at vienna were advancing in immense force upon line of communication with the troops that were arriving from russia if kutuzov decided to remain at krems army of one hundred and fifty thousand men would cut him off completely and surround his exhausted army of forty thousand and he would find himself in the position of mack at ulm if kutuzov decided to abandon the road connecting him with the troops arriving from russia he would have to march with no road into unknown parts of the bohemian mountains defending himself against superior forces of the enemy and abandoning all hope of a junction with buxhowden if kutuzov decided to retreat along the road from krems to olmutz to unite with the troops arriving from russia he risked being forestalled on that road by the french who had crossed the vienna bridge and encumbered by his baggage and transport having to accept battle on the march against an enemy three times as strong who would hem him in from two sides 
 kutuzov chose this latter course 
 the french the spy reported having crossed the vienna bridge were advancing by forced marches toward znaim which lay miles off on the line of retreat if he reached znaim before the french there would be great hope of saving the army to let the french forestall him at znaim meant the exposure of his whole army to a disgrace such as that of ulm or to utter destruction but to forestall the french with his whole army was impossible the road for the french from vienna to znaim was shorter and better than the road for the russians from krems to znaim 
 the night he received the news kutuzov sent vanguard four thousand strong to the right across the hills from the to the road bagration was to make this march without resting and to halt facing vienna with znaim to his rear and if he succeeded in forestalling the french he was to delay them as long as possible kutuzov himself with all his transport took the road to znaim 
 marching thirty miles that stormy night across roadless hills with his hungry soldiers and losing a third of his men as stragglers by the way bagration came out on the road at hollabrunn a few hours ahead of the french who were approaching hollabrunn from vienna kutuzov with his transport had still to march for some days before he could reach znaim hence bagration with his four thousand hungry exhausted men would have to detain for days the whole enemy army that came upon him at hollabrunn which was clearly impossible but a freak of fate made the impossible possible the success of the trick that had placed the vienna bridge in the hands of the french without a fight led murat to try to deceive kutuzov in a similar way meeting weak detachment on the znaim road he supposed it to be whole army to be able to crush it absolutely he awaited the arrival of the rest of the troops who were on their way from vienna and with this object offered a three days truce on condition that both armies should remain in position without moving murat declared that negotiations for peace were already proceeding and that he therefore offered this truce to avoid unnecessary bloodshed count nostitz the austrian general occupying the advanced posts believed emissary and retired leaving division exposed another emissary rode to the russian line to announce the peace negotiations and to offer the russian army the three days truce bagration replied that he was not authorized either to accept or refuse a truce and sent his adjutant to kutuzov to report the offer he had received 
 a truce was sole chance of gaining time giving exhausted troops some rest and letting the transport and heavy convoys whose movements were concealed from the french advance if but one stage nearer znaim the offer of a truce gave the only and a quite unexpected chance of saving the army on receiving the news he immediately dispatched adjutant general wintzingerode who was in attendance on him to the enemy camp wintzingerode was not merely to agree to the truce but also to offer terms of capitulation and meanwhile kutuzov sent his adjutants back to hasten to the utmost the movements of the baggage trains of the entire army along the road exhausted and hungry detachment which alone covered this movement of the transport and of the whole army had to remain stationary in face of an enemy eight times as strong as itself 
 expectations that the proposals of capitulation which were in no way binding might give time for part of the transport to pass and also that mistake would very soon be discovered proved correct as soon as bonaparte who was at schonbrunn sixteen miles from hollabrunn received dispatch with the proposal of a truce and a capitulation he detected a ruse and wrote the following letter to murat 
 schonbrunn th brumaire 
 at eight in the morning 
 to prince murat 
 i cannot find words to express to you my displeasure you command only my advance guard and have no right to arrange an armistice without my order you are causing me to lose the fruits of a campaign break the armistice immediately and march on the enemy inform him that the general who signed that capitulation had no right to do so and that no one but the emperor of russia has that right 
 if however the emperor of russia ratifies that convention i will ratify it but it is only a trick march on destroy the russian army you are in a position to seize its baggage and artillery 
 the russian is an impostor officers are nothing when they have no powers this one had none the austrians let themselves be tricked at the crossing of the vienna bridge you are letting yourself be tricked by an of the emperor 
 napoleon 
 adjutant rode full gallop with this menacing letter to murat bonaparte himself not trusting to his generals moved with all the guards to the field of battle afraid of letting a ready victim escape and four thousand men merrily lighted campfires dried and warmed themselves cooked their porridge for the first time for three days and not one of them knew or imagined what was in store for him

 chapter 
 
 
 it was easy to promise when self was wrapped up in another and heart and soul were purified by a sweet example but when the helpful voice was silent the daily lesson over the beloved presence gone and nothing remained but lonliness and grief then jo found her promise very hard to keep how could she comfort father and mother when her own heart ached with a ceaseless longing for her sister how could she make the house cheerful when all its light and warmth and beauty seemed to have deserted it when beth left the old home for the new and where in all the world could she find some useful happy work to do that would take the place of the loving service which had been its own reward she tried in a blind hopeless way to do her duty secretly rebelling against it all the while for it seemed unjust that her few joys should be lessened her burdens made heavier and life get harder and harder as she toiled along some people seemed to get all sunshine and some all shadow it was not fair for she tried more than amy to be good but never got any reward only disappointment trouble and hard work 
 poor jo these were dark days to her for something like despair came over her when she thought of spending all her life in that quiet house devoted to humdrum cares a few small pleasures and the duty that never seemed to grow any easier i do it i meant for a life like this and i know i shall break away and do something desperate if somebody come and help me she said to herself when her first efforts failed and she fell into the moody miserable state of mind which often comes when strong wills have to yield to the inevitable 
 but someone did come and help her though jo did not recognize her good angels at once because they wore familiar shapes and used the simple spells best fitted to poor humanity often she started up at night thinking beth called her and when the sight of the little empty bed made her cry with the bitter cry of unsubmissive sorrow oh beth come back come back she did not stretch out her yearning arms in vain for as quick to hear her sobbing as she had been to hear her faintest whisper her mother came to comfort her not with words only but the patient tenderness that soothes by a touch tears that were mute reminders of a greater grief than and broken whispers more eloquent than prayers because hopeful resignation went with natural sorrow sacred moments when heart talked to heart in the silence of the night turning affliction to a blessing which chastened grief and strengthned love feeling this burden seemed easier to bear duty grew sweeter and life looked more endurable seen from the safe shelter of her arms 
 when aching heart was a little comforted troubled mind likewise found help for one day she went to the study and leaning over the good gray head lifted to welcome her with a tranquil smile she said very humbly father talk to me as you did to beth i need it more than she did for all wrong 
 my dear nothing can comfort me like this he answered with a falter in his voice and both arms round her as if he too needed help and did not fear to ask for it 
 then sitting in little chair close beside him jo told her troubles the resentful sorrow for her loss the fruitless efforts that discouraged her the want of faith that made life look so dark and all the sad bewilderment which we call despair she gave him entire confidence he gave her the help she needed and both found consolation in the act for the time had come when they could talk together not only as father and daughter but as man and woman able and glad to serve each other with mutual sympathy as well as mutual love happy thoughtful times there in the old study which jo called the church of one member and from which she came with fresh courage recovered cheerfulness and a more submissive spirit for the parents who had taught one child to meet death without fear were trying now to teach another to accept life without despondency or distrust and to use its beautiful opportunities with gratitude and power 
 other helps had wholesome duties and delights that would not be denied their part in serving her and which she slowly learned to see and value brooms and dishcloths never could be as distasteful as they once had been for beth had presided over both and something of her housewifely spirit seemed to linger around the little mop and the old brush never thrown away as she used them jo found herself humming the songs beth used to hum imitating orderly ways and giving the little touches here and there that kept everything fresh and cozy which was the first step toward making home happy though she know it till hannah said with an approving squeeze of the hand

 as they sat sewing together jo discovered how much improved her sister meg was how well she could talk how much she knew about good womanly impulses thoughts and feelings how happy she was in husband and children and how much they were all doing for each other 
 marriage is an excellent thing after all i wonder if i should blossom out half as well as you have if i tried it said jo as she constructed a kite for demi in the nursery

 meg laughed for she was glad to see a glimmer of old spirit but she felt it her duty to enforce her opinion by every argument in her power and the sisterly chats were not wasted especially as two of most effective arguments were the babies whom jo loved tenderly grief is the best opener of some hearts and was nearly ready for the bag a little more sunshine to ripen the nut then not a impatient shake but a hand reached up to pick it gently from the burr and find the kernal sound and sweet if she suspected this she would have shut up tight and been more prickly than ever fortunately she thinking about herself so when the time came down she dropped 
 now if she had been the heroine of a moral storybook she ought at this period of her life to have become quite saintly renounced the world and gone about doing good in a mortified bonnet with tracts in her pocket but you see jo a heroine she was only a struggling human girl like hundreds of others and she just acted out her nature being sad cross listless or energetic as the mood suggested highly virtuous to say be good but we do it all at once and it takes a long pull a strong pull and a pull all together before some of us even get our feet set in the right way jo had got so far she was learning to do her duty and to feel unhappy if she did not but to do it cheerfully ah that was another thing she had often said she wanted to do something splendid no matter how hard and now she had her wish for what could be more beautiful than to devote her life to father and mother trying to make home as happy to them as they had to her and if difficulties were necessary to increase the splendor of the effort what could be harder for a restless ambitious girl than to give up her own hopes plans and desires and cheerfully live for others 
 providence had taken her at her word here was the task not what she had expected but better because self had no part in it now could she do it she decided that she would try and in her first attempt she found the helps i have suggested still another was given her and she took it not as a reward but as a comfort as christian took the refreshment afforded by the little arbor where he rested as he climbed the hill called difficulty 
 why you write that always used to make you happy said her mother once when the desponding fit jo 
 no heart to write and if i had nobody cares for my things 
 we do write something for us and never mind the rest of the world try it dear sure it would do you good and please us very much 
 believe i can but jo got out her desk and began to overhaul her manuscripts 
 an hour afterward her mother peeped in and there she was scratching away with her black pinafore on and an absorbed expression which caused mrs march to smile and slip away well pleased with the success of her suggestion jo never knew how it happened but something got into that story that went straight to the hearts of those who read it for when her family had laughed and cried over it her father sent it much against her will to one of the popular magazines and to her utter surprise it was not only paid for but others requested letters from several persons whose praise was honor followed the appearance of the little story newspapers copied it and strangers as well as friends admired it for a small thing it was a great success and jo was more astonished than when her novel was commended and condemned all at once 
 i understand it what can there be in a simple little story like that to make people praise it so she said quite bewildered 
 there is truth in it jo the secret humor and pathos make it alive and you have found your style at last you wrote with not thoughts of fame and money and put your heart into it my daughter you have had the bitter now comes the sweet do your best and grow as happy as we are in your success 
 if there is anything good or true in what i write it mine i owe it all to you and mother and beth said jo more touched by her words than by any amount of praise from the world 
 so taught by love and sorrow jo wrote her little stories and sent them away to make friends for themselves and her finding it a very charitable world to such humble wanderers for they were kindly welcomed and sent home comfortable tokens to their mother like dutiful children whom good fortune overtakes 
 when amy and laurie wrote of their engagement mrs march feared that jo would find it difficult to rejoice over it but her fears were soon set at rest for thought jo looked grave at first she took it very quietly and was full of hopes and plans for the children before she read the letter twice it was a sort of written duet wherein each glorified the other in loverlike fashion very pleasant to read and satisfactory to think of for no one had any objection to make 
 you like it mother said jo as they laid down the closely written sheets and looked at one another 
 yes i hoped it would be so ever since amy wrote that she had refused fred i felt sure then that something better than what you call the mercenary spirit had come over her and a hint here and there in her letters made me suspect that love and laurie would win the day 
 how sharp you are marmee and how silent you never said a worked to me 
 mothers have need of sharp eyes and discreet tongues when they have girls to manage i was half afraid to put the idea into your head lest you should write and congratulate them before the thing was settled 
 not the scatterbrain i was you may trust me sober and sensible enough for confidante now 
 so you are my dear and i should have made you mine only i fancied it might pain you to learn that your teddy loved someone else 
 now mother did you really think i could be so silly and selfish after refused his love when it was freshest if not best 
 i knew you were sincere then jo but lately i have thought that if he came back and asked again you might perhaps feel like giving another answer forgive me dear i help seeing that you are very lonely and sometimes there is a hungry look in your eyes that goes to my heart so i fancied that your boy might fill the empty place if he tried now 
 no mother it is better as it ia and glad amy has learned to love him but you are right in one thing i am lonely and perhaps if teddy had tried again i might have said yes not because i love him any more but because i care more to be loved than when he went away 
 glad of that jo for it shows that you are getting on there are plenty to love you so try to be satisfied with father and mother sisters and brothers friends and babies till the best lover of all comes to give you your reward 
 mothers are the best lovers in the world but i mind whispering to marmee that like to try all kinds very curious but the more i try to satisfy myself with all sorts of natural affections the more i seem to want no idea hearts could take in so many mine is so elastic it never seems full now and i used to be quite contented with my family i understand it 
 i do and mrs march smiled her wise smile as jo turned back the leaves to read what amy said of laurie 
 it is so beautiful to be loved as laurie loves me he sentimental say much about it but i see and feel it in all he says and does and it makes me so happy and so humble that i seem to be the same girl i was i never knew how good and generous and tender he was till now for he lets me read his heart and i find it full of noble impulses and hopes and purposes and am so proud to know mine he says he feels as if he could make a prosperous voyage now with me aboard as mate and lots of love for ballast i pray he may and try to be all he believes me for i love my gallant captain with all my heart and soul and might and never will desert him while god lets us be together oh mother i never knew how much like heaven this world could be when two people love and live for one another 
 and our cool reserved and worldly amy truly love does work miracles how very very happy they must be and jo laid the rustling sheets together with a careful hand as one might shut the covers of a lovely romance which holds the reader fast till the end comes and he finds himself alone in the workaday world again 
 jo roamed away upstairs for it was rainy and she could not walk a restless spirit possessed her and the old feeling came again not bitter as it once was but a sorrowfully patient wonder why one sister should have all she asked the other nothing it was not true she knew that and tried to put it away but the natural craving for affection was strong and happiness woke the hungry longing for someone to love with heart and soul and cling to while god let them be together up in the garret where unquiet wanderings ended stood four little wooden chests in a row each marked with its owners name and each filled with relics of the childhood and girlhood ended now for all jo glanced into them and when she came to her own leaned her chin on the edge and stared absently at the chaotic collection till a bundle of old exercise books caught her eye she drew them out turned them over and relived that pleasant winter at kind mrs she had smiled at first then she looked thoughtful next sad and when she came to a little message written in the hand her lips began to tremble the books slid out of her lap and she sat looking at the friendly words as they took a new meaning and touched a tender spot in her heart 
 wait for me my friend i may be a little late but i shall surely come 
 oh if he only would so kine so good so patient with me always my dear old fritz i value him half enough when i had him but now how i should love to see him for everyone seems going away from me and all alone 
 and holding the little paper fast as if it were a promise yet to be fulfilled jo laid her head down on a comfortable rag bag and cried as if in opposition to the rain pattering on the roof 
 was it all loneliness or low spirits or was it the waking up of a sentiment which had bided its time as patiently as its inspirer who shall say

 chapter 
 
 
 it was easy to promise when self was wrapped up in another and heart and soul were purified by a sweet example but when the helpful voice was silent the daily lesson over the beloved presence gone and nothing remained but lonliness and grief then jo found her promise very hard to keep how could she comfort father and mother when her own heart ached with a ceaseless longing for her sister how could she make the house cheerful when all its light and warmth and beauty seemed to have deserted it when beth left the old home for the new and where in all the world could she find some useful happy work to do that would take the place of the loving service which had been its own reward she tried in a blind hopeless way to do her duty secretly rebelling against it all the while for it seemed unjust that her few joys should be lessened her burdens made heavier and life get harder and harder as she toiled along some people seemed to get all sunshine and some all shadow it was not fair for she tried more than amy to be good but never got any reward only disappointment trouble and hard work 
 poor jo these were dark days to her for something like despair came over her when she thought of spending all her life in that quiet house devoted to humdrum cares a few small pleasures and the duty that never seemed to grow any easier i do it i meant for a life like this and i know i shall break away and do something desperate if somebody come and help me she said to herself when her first efforts failed and she fell into the moody miserable state of mind which often comes when strong wills have to yield to the inevitable 
 but someone did come and help her though jo did not recognize her good angels at once because they wore familiar shapes and used the simple spells best fitted to poor humanity often she started up at night thinking beth called her and when the sight of the little empty bed made her cry with the bitter cry of unsubmissive sorrow oh beth come back come back she did not stretch out her yearning arms in vain for as quick to hear her sobbing as she had been to hear her faintest whisper her mother came to comfort her not with words only but the patient tenderness that soothes by a touch tears that were mute reminders of a greater grief than and broken whispers more eloquent than prayers because hopeful resignation went with natural sorrow sacred moments when heart talked to heart in the silence of the night turning affliction to a blessing which chastened grief and strengthned love feeling this burden seemed easier to bear duty grew sweeter and life looked more endurable seen from the safe shelter of her arms 
 when aching heart was a little comforted troubled mind likewise found help for one day she went to the study and leaning over the good gray head lifted to welcome her with a tranquil smile she said very humbly father talk to me as you did to beth i need it more than she did for all wrong 
 my dear nothing can comfort me like this he answered with a falter in his voice and both arms round her as if he too needed help and did not fear to ask for it 
 then sitting in little chair close beside him jo told her troubles the resentful sorrow for her loss the fruitless efforts that discouraged her the want of faith that made life look so dark and all the sad bewilderment which we call despair she gave him entire confidence he gave her the help she needed and both found consolation in the act for the time had come when they could talk together not only as father and daughter but as man and woman able and glad to serve each other with mutual sympathy as well as mutual love happy thoughtful times there in the old study which jo called the church of one member and from which she came with fresh courage recovered cheerfulness and a more submissive spirit for the parents who had taught one child to meet death without fear were trying now to teach another to accept life without despondency or distrust and to use its beautiful opportunities with gratitude and power 
 other helps had wholesome duties and delights that would not be denied their part in serving her and which she slowly learned to see and value brooms and dishcloths never could be as distasteful as they once had been for beth had presided over both and something of her housewifely spirit seemed to linger around the little mop and the old brush never thrown away as she used them jo found herself humming the songs beth used to hum imitating orderly ways and giving the little touches here and there that kept everything fresh and cozy which was the first step toward making home happy though she know it till hannah said with an approving squeeze of the hand 
 you thoughtful creeter determined we miss that dear lamb ef you can help it we say much but we see it and the lord will bless you see ef he 
 as they sat sewing together jo discovered how much improved her sister meg was how well she could talk how much she knew about good womanly impulses thoughts and feelings how happy she was in husband and children and how much they were all doing for each other 
 marriage is an excellent thing after all i wonder if i should blossom out half as well as you have if i tried it said jo as she constructed a kite for demi in the nursery 
 just what you need to bring out the tender womanly half of your nature jo you are like a chestnut burr prickly outside but within and a sweet kernal if one can only get at it love will make you show your heart one day and then the rough burr will fall off 
 frost opens chestnut burrs and it takes a good shake to bring them down boys go nutting and i care to be bagged by them returned jo pasting away at the kite which no wind that blows would ever carry up for daisy had tied herself on as a bob

 fairy tales of hans christian andersen 
 the conceited 
 by hans christian andersen 
 
 it was the month of may the wind still blew cold but from bush 
 and tree field and flower came the welcome sound spring is 
 come in profusion covered the hedges under the 
 little spring seemed busy and told his tale from one of 
 the branches which hung fresh and blooming and covered with 
 delicate pink blossoms that were just ready to open the branch well 
 knew how beautiful it was this knowledge exists as much in the leaf 
 as in the blood i was therefore not surprised when a 
 carriage in which sat the young countess stopped in the road just 
 by she said that an was a most lovely object and an 
 emblem of spring in its most charming aspect then the branch was 
 broken off for her and she held it in her delicate hand and 
 sheltered it with her silk parasol then they drove to the castle 
 in which were lofty halls and splendid pure white 
 curtains fluttered before the open windows and beautiful flowers 
 stood in shining transparent vases and in one of them which 
 looked as if it had been cut out of newly fallen snow the 
 was placed among some fresh light twigs of beech it 
 was a charming sight then the branch became proud which was very much like human nature 
 
 people of every description entered the room and according to 
 their position in society so dared they to express their admiration some few said nothing others expressed too much and the very soon got to understand that there was as much difference in the characters of human beings as in those of plants and flowers some are all for pomp and parade others have a great deal to do to maintain their own importance while the rest might be spared without much loss to society so thought the as he stood before the open window from which he could see out over gardens and fields where there were flowers and plants enough for him to think and reflect upon some rich and beautiful some poor and humble indeed 
 
 poor despised herbs said the there is really 
 a difference between them and such as i am how unhappy they must 
 be if they can feel as those in my position do there is a difference 
 indeed and so there ought to be or we should all be equals 
 
 and the looked with a sort of pity upon them especially on a certain little flower that is found in fields and in ditches no one bound these flowers together in a nosegay they were too common they were even known to grow between the shooting up everywhere like bad weeds and they bore the very ugly name of or dandelions 
 
 poor despised plants said the it is not your 
 fault that you are so ugly and that you have such an ugly name but 
 it is with plants as with men there must be a difference 
 
 a difference cried the sunbeam as he kissed the blooming 
 and then kissed the yellow dandelion out in the 
 fields all were brothers and the sunbeam kissed them the poor 
 flowers as well as the rich 
 
 the had never thought of the boundless love of god 
 which extends over all the works of creation over everything which 
 lives and moves and has its being in him he had never thought of 
 the good and beautiful which are so often hidden but can never remain forgotten by him not only among the lower creation but also among men the sunbeam the ray of light knew better 
 
 you do not see very far nor very clearly he said to the 
 which is the despised plant you so specially pity 
 
 the dandelion he replied no one ever places it in a 
 nosegay it is often trodden under foot there are so many of them 
 and when they run to seed they have flowers like wool which fly away in little pieces over the roads and cling to the dresses of the 
 people they are only weeds but of course there must be weeds o i am really very thankful that i was not made like one of these 
 flowers 
 
 there came presently across the fields a whole group of 
 children the youngest of whom was so small that it had to be 
 carried by the others and when he was seated on the grass among 
 the yellow flowers he laughed aloud with joy kicked out his little 
 legs rolled about plucked the yellow flowers and kissed them in 
 childlike innocence the elder children broke off the flowers with 
 long stems bent the stalks one round the other to form links and 
 made first a chain for the neck then one to go across the 
 shoulders and hang down to the waist and at last a wreath to wear 
 round the head so that they looked quite splendid in their garlands 
 of green stems and golden flowers but the eldest among them 
 gathered carefully the faded flowers on the stem of which was grouped together the seed in the form of a white feathery coronal these loose airy are very beautiful and look like fine 
 snowy feathers or down the children held them to their mouths and 
 tried to blow away the whole coronal with one puff of the breath 
 they had been told by their grandmothers that who ever did so would be sure to have new clothes before the end of the year the despised flower was by this raised to the position of a prophet or foreteller of 
 events 
 
 do you see said the sunbeam do you see the beauty of these 
 flowers do you see their powers of giving pleasure 
 yes to children said the 
 
 an old woman came into the field and with a blunt 
 knife without a handle began to dig round the roots of some of the 
 and pull them up with some of these she intended to make tea for herself but the rest she was going to sell to the 
 chemist and obtain some money 
 
 but beauty is of higher value than all this said the 
 branch only the chosen ones can be admitted into the realms of the 
 beautiful there is a difference between plants just as there is a 
 difference between men 
 
 then the sunbeam spoke of the boundless love of god as seen in 
 creation and over all that lives and of the equal distribution of 
 his gifts both in time and in eternity 
 
 that is your opinion said the 
 
 then some people came into the room and among them the young 
 countess the lady who had placed the in the 
 transparent vase so pleasantly beneath the rays of the sunlight 
 she carried in her hand something that seemed like a flower the 
 object was hidden by two or three great leaves which covered it 
 like a shield so that no draught or gust of wind could injure it and 
 it was carried more carefully than the had ever been 
 very cautiously the large leaves were removed and there appeared 
 the feathery of the despised dandelion this was what the 
 lady had so carefully plucked and carried home so safely covered 
 so that not one of the delicate feathery arrows of which its 
 shape was so lightly formed should flutter away she now drew it 
 forth quite uninjured and wondered at its beautiful form and airy 
 lightness and singular construction so soon to be blown away by 
 the wind 
 
 see she exclaimed how wonderfully god has made this little 
 flower i will paint it with the together every one 
 admires the beauty of the but this humble flower has been endowed by heaven with another kind of loveliness and although they differ in appearance both are the children of the realms of beauty 
 
 then the sunbeam kissed the lowly flower and he kissed the 
 blooming upon whose leaves appeared a rosy blush 
 
 the end

 which extends over all the works of creation over everything which 
 lives and moves and has its being in him he had never thought of 
 the good and beautiful which are so often hidden but can never remain forgotten by him not only among the lower creation but also among men the sunbeam the ray of light knew better 
 
 you do not see very far nor very clearly he said to the 
 which is the despised plant you so specially pity 
 
 the dandelion he replied no one ever places it in a 
 nosegay it is often trodden under foot there are so many of them 
 and when they run to seed they have flowers like wool which fly away in little pieces over the roads and cling to the dresses of the 
 people they are only weeds but of course there must be weeds o i am really very thankful that i was not made like one of these 
 flowers 
 
 there came presently across the fields a whole group of 
 children the youngest of whom was so small that it had to be 
 carried by the others and when he was seated on the grass among 
 the yellow flowers he laughed aloud with joy kicked out his little 
 legs rolled about plucked the yellow flowers and kissed them in 
 childlike innocence the elder children broke off the flowers with 
 long stems bent the stalks one round the other to form links and 
 made first a chain for the neck then one to go across the 
 shoulders and hang down to the waist and at last a wreath to wear 
 round the head so that they looked quite splendid in their garlands 
 of green stems and golden flowers but the eldest among them 
 gathered carefully the faded flowers on the stem of which was grouped together the seed in the form of a white feathery coronal these loose airy are very beautiful and look like fine 
 snowy feathers or down the children held them to their mouths and 
 tried to blow away the whole coronal with one puff of the breath 
 they had been told by their grandmothers that who ever did so would be sure to have new clothes before the end of the year the despised flower was by this raised to the position of a prophet or foreteller of 
 events 
 
 do you see said the sunbeam do you see the beauty of these 
 flowers do you see their powers of giving pleasure 
 yes to children said the 
 
 an old woman came into the field and with a blunt 
 knife without a handle began to dig round the roots of some of the 
 and pull them up with some of these she intended to make tea for herself but the rest she was going to sell to the 
 chemist and obtain some money 
 
 but beauty is of higher value than all this said the 
 branch only the chosen ones can be admitted into the realms of the 
 beautiful there is a difference between plants just as there is a 
 difference between men 
 
 then the sunbeam spoke of the boundless love of god as seen in 
 creation and over all that lives and of the equal distribution of 
 his gifts both in time and in eternity 
 
 that is your opinion said the 
 
 then some people came into the room and among them the young 
 countess the lady who had placed the in the 
 transparent vase so pleasantly beneath the rays of the sunlight 
 she carried in her hand something that seemed like a flower the 
 object was hidden by two or three great leaves which covered it 
 like a shield so that no draught or gust of wind could injure it and 
 it was carried more carefully than the had ever been 
 very cautiously the large leaves were removed and there appeared 
 the feathery of the despised dandelion this was what the 
 lady had so carefully plucked and carried home so safely covered 
 so that not one of the delicate feathery arrows of which its 
 shape was so lightly formed should flutter away she now drew it 
 forth quite uninjured and wondered at its beautiful form and airy 
 lightness and singular construction so soon to be blown away by 
 the wind 
 
 see she exclaimed how wonderfully god has made this little 
 flower i will paint it with the together every one 
 admires the beauty of the but this humble flower has been endowed by heaven with another kind of loveliness and although they differ in appearance both are the children of the realms of beauty 
 
 then the sunbeam kissed the lowly flower and he kissed the 
 blooming upon whose leaves appeared a rosy blush

 chapter xv 
 
 between three and four in the afternoon prince andrew who had persisted in his request to kutuzov arrived at grunth and reported himself to bagration adjutant had not yet reached detachment and the battle had not yet begun in detachment no one knew anything of the general position of affairs they talked of peace but did not believe in its possibility others talked of a battle but also disbelieved in the nearness of an engagement bagration knowing bolkonski to be a favorite and trusted adjutant received him with distinction and special marks of favor explaining to him that there would probably be an engagement that day or the next and giving him full liberty to remain with him during the battle or to join the rearguard and have an eye on the order of retreat which is also very important 
 however there will hardly be an engagement today said bagration as if to reassure prince andrew 
 if he is one of the ordinary little staff dandies sent to earn a medal he can get his reward just as well in the rearguard but if he wishes to stay with me let him be of use here if a brave officer thought bagration prince andrew without replying asked the permission to ride round the position to see the disposition of the forces so as to know his bearings should he be sent to execute an order the officer on duty a handsome elegantly dressed man with a diamond ring on his forefinger who was fond of speaking french though he spoke it badly offered to conduct prince andrew 
 on all sides they saw officers with dejected faces who seemed to be seeking something and soldiers dragging doors benches and fencing from the village 
 there now prince we stop those fellows said the staff officer pointing to the soldiers the officers keep them in hand and there he pointed to a tent they crowd in and sit this morning i turned them all out and now look full again i must go there prince and scare them a bit it take a moment 
 yes go in and i will get myself a roll and some cheese said prince andrew who had not yet had time to eat anything 
 why you mention it prince i would have offered you something 
 they dismounted and entered the tent several officers with flushed and weary faces were sitting at the table eating and drinking 
 now what does this mean gentlemen said the staff officer in the reproachful tone of a man who has repeated the same thing more than once you know it do to leave your posts like this the prince gave orders that no one should leave his post now you captain and he turned to a thin dirty little artillery officer who without his boots he had given them to the canteen keeper to dry in only his stockings rose when they entered smiling not altogether comfortably 
 well you ashamed of yourself captain tushin he continued one would think that as an artillery officer you would set a good example yet here you are without your boots the alarm will be sounded and be in a pretty position without your boots the staff officer smiled kindly return to your posts gentlemen all of you all he added in a tone of command 
 prince andrew smiled involuntarily as he looked at the artillery officer tushin who silent and smiling shifting from one stockinged foot to the other glanced inquiringly with his large intelligent kindly eyes from prince andrew to the staff officer 
 the soldiers say it feels easier without boots said captain tushin smiling shyly in his uncomfortable position evidently wishing to adopt a jocular tone but before he had finished he felt that his jest was unacceptable and had not come off he grew confused 
 kindly return to your posts said the staff officer trying to preserve his gravity 
 prince andrew glanced again at the artillery small figure there was something peculiar about it quite unsoldierly rather comic but extremely attractive 
 the staff officer and prince andrew mounted their horses and rode on 
 having ridden beyond the village continually meeting and overtaking soldiers and officers of various regiments they saw on their left some entrenchments being thrown up the freshly dug clay of which showed up red several battalions of soldiers in their shirt sleeves despite the cold wind swarmed in these earthworks like a host of white ants spadefuls of red clay were continually being thrown up from behind the bank by unseen hands prince andrew and the officer rode up looked at the entrenchment and went on again just behind it they came upon some dozens of soldiers continually replaced by others who ran from the entrenchment they had to hold their noses and put their horses to a trot to escape from the poisoned atmosphere of these latrines 
 voila des camps monsieur le prince said the staff officer 
 this is a pleasure one gets in camp prince 
 they rode up the opposite hill from there the french could already be seen prince andrew stopped and began examining the position 
 our battery said the staff officer indicating the highest point in charge of the queer fellow we saw without his boots you can see everything from there go there prince 
 thank you very much i will go on alone said prince andrew wishing to rid himself of this staff company please trouble yourself further 
 the staff officer remained behind and prince andrew rode on alone 
 the farther forward and nearer the enemy he went the more orderly and cheerful were the troops the greatest disorder and depression had been in the baggage train he had passed that morning on the znaim road seven miles away from the french at grunth also some apprehension and alarm could be felt but the nearer prince andrew came to the french lines the more confident was the appearance of our troops the soldiers in their greatcoats were ranged in lines the sergeants major and company officers were counting the men poking the last man in each section in the ribs and telling him to hold his hand up soldiers scattered over the whole place were dragging logs and brushwood and were building shelters with merry chatter and laughter around the fires sat others dressed and undressed drying their shirts and leg bands or mending boots or overcoats and crowding round the boilers and porridge cookers in one company dinner was ready and the soldiers were gazing eagerly at the steaming boiler waiting till the sample which a quartermaster sergeant was carrying in a wooden bowl to an officer who sat on a log before his shelter had been tasted 
 another company a lucky one for not all the companies had vodka crowded round a sergeant major who tilting a keg filled one after another the canteen lids held out to him the soldiers lifted the canteen lids to their lips with reverential faces emptied them rolling the vodka in their mouths and walked away from the sergeant major with brightened expressions licking their lips and wiping them on the sleeves of their greatcoats all their faces were as serene as if all this were happening at home awaiting peaceful encampment and not within sight of the enemy before an action in which at least half of them would be left on the field after passing a chasseur regiment and in the lines of the kiev grenadiers fine fellows busy with similar peaceful affairs near the shelter of the regimental commander higher than and different from the others prince andrew came out in front of a platoon of grenadiers before whom lay a naked man two soldiers held him while two others were flourishing their switches and striking him regularly on his bare back the man shrieked unnaturally a stout major was pacing up and down the line and regardless of the screams kept repeating 
 a shame for a soldier to steal a soldier must be honest honorable and brave but if he robs his fellows there is no honor in him a scoundrel go on go on 
 so the swishing sound of the strokes and the desperate but unnatural screams continued 
 go on go on said the major 
 a young officer with a bewildered and pained expression on his face stepped away from the man and looked round inquiringly at the adjutant as he rode by 
 prince andrew having reached the front line rode along it our front line and that of the enemy were far apart on the right and left flanks but in the center where the men with a flag of truce had passed that morning the lines were so near together that the men could see one faces and speak to one another besides the soldiers who formed the picket line on either side there were many curious onlookers who jesting and laughing stared at their strange foreign enemies 
 since early morning despite an injunction not to approach the picket line the officers had been unable to keep away the soldiers forming the picket line like showmen exhibiting a curiosity no longer looked at the french but paid attention to the and grew weary waiting to be relieved prince andrew halted to have a look at the french 
 look look there one soldier was saying to another pointing to a russian musketeer who had gone up to the picket line with an officer and was rapidly and excitedly talking to a french grenadier hark to him jabbering fine it all the frenchy can do to keep up with him there now sidorov 
 wait a bit and listen fine answered sidorov who was considered an adept at french 
 the soldier to whom the laughers referred was dolokhov prince andrew recognized him and stopped to listen to what he was saying dolokhov had come from the left flank where their regiment was stationed with his captain 
 now then go on go on incited the officer bending forward and trying not to lose a word of the speech which was incomprehensible to him more please more he saying 
 dolokhov did not answer the captain he had been drawn into a hot dispute with the french grenadier they were naturally talking about the campaign the frenchman confusing the austrians with the russians was trying to prove that the russians had surrendered and had fled all the way from ulm while dolokhov maintained that the russians had not surrendered but had beaten the french 
 we have orders to drive you off here and we shall drive you off said dolokhov 
 only take care you and your cossacks are not all captured said the french grenadier 
 the french onlookers and listeners laughed 
 make you dance as we did under suvorov said dolokhov 
 on vous fera danser 
 qu chante asked a frenchman 
 he singing about 
 ancient history said another guessing that it referred to a former war the emperor will teach your suvara as he has taught the others 
 bonaparte began dolokhov but the frenchman interrupted him 
 not bonaparte he is the emperor sacre nom cried he angrily 
 the devil skin your emperor 
 and dolokhov swore at him in coarse russian and shouldering his musket walked away 
 let us go ivan lukich he said to the captain 
 ah the way to talk french said the picket soldiers now sidorov you have a try 
 sidorov turning to the french winked and began to jabber meaningless sounds very fast kari mala tafa safi muter kaska he said trying to give an expressive intonation to his voice 
 ho ho ho ha ha ha ha ouh ouh came peals of such healthy and laughter from the soldiers that it infected the french involuntarily so much so that the only thing left to do seemed to be to unload the muskets muskets explode the ammunition and all return home as quickly as possible 
 but the guns remained loaded the loopholes in blockhouses and entrenchments looked out just as menacingly and the unlimbered cannon confronted one another as before

 having ridden beyond the village continually meeting and overtaking soldiers and officers of various regiments they saw on their left some entrenchments being thrown up the freshly dug clay of which showed up red several battalions of soldiers in their shirt sleeves despite the cold wind swarmed in these earthworks like a host of white ants spadefuls of red clay were continually being thrown up from behind the bank by unseen hands prince andrew and the officer rode up looked at the entrenchment and went on again just behind it they came upon some dozens of soldiers continually replaced by others who ran from the entrenchment they had to hold their noses and put their horses to a trot to escape from the poisoned atmosphere of these latrines 
 voila des camps monsieur le prince said the staff officer 
 this is a pleasure one gets in camp prince 
 they rode up the opposite hill from there the french could already be seen prince andrew stopped and began examining the position 
 our battery said the staff officer indicating the highest point in charge of the queer fellow we saw without his boots you can see everything from there go there prince 
 thank you very much i will go on alone said prince andrew wishing to rid himself of this staff company please trouble yourself further 
 the staff officer remained behind and prince andrew rode on alone 
 the farther forward and nearer the enemy he went the more orderly and cheerful were the troops the greatest disorder and depression had been in the baggage train he had passed that morning on the znaim road seven miles away from the french at grunth also some apprehension and alarm could be felt but the nearer prince andrew came to the french lines the more confident was the appearance of our troops the soldiers in their greatcoats were ranged in lines the sergeants major and company officers were counting the men poking the last man in each section in the ribs and telling him to hold his hand up soldiers scattered over the whole place were dragging logs and brushwood and were building shelters with merry chatter and laughter around the fires sat others dressed and undressed drying their shirts and leg bands or mending boots or overcoats and crowding round the boilers and porridge cookers in one company dinner was ready and the soldiers were gazing eagerly at the steaming boiler waiting till the sample which a quartermaster sergeant was carrying in a wooden bowl to an officer who sat on a log before his shelter had been tasted 
 another company a lucky one for not all the companies had vodka crowded round a sergeant major who tilting a keg filled one after another the canteen lids held out to him the soldiers lifted the canteen lids to their lips with reverential faces emptied them rolling the vodka in their mouths and walked away from the sergeant major with brightened expressions licking their lips and wiping them on the sleeves of their greatcoats all their faces were as serene as if all this were happening at home awaiting peaceful encampment and not within sight of the enemy before an action in which at least half of them would be left on the field after passing a chasseur regiment and in the lines of the kiev grenadiers fine fellows busy with similar peaceful affairs near the shelter of the regimental commander higher than and different from the others prince andrew came out in front of a platoon of grenadiers before whom lay a naked man two soldiers held him while two others were flourishing their switches and striking him regularly on his bare back the man shrieked unnaturally a stout major was pacing up and down the line and regardless of the screams kept repeating 
 a shame for a soldier to steal a soldier must be honest honorable and brave but if he robs his fellows there is no honor in him a scoundrel go on go on 
 so the swishing sound of the strokes and the desperate but unnatural screams continued 
 go on go on said the major 
 a young officer with a bewildered and pained expression on his face stepped away from the man and looked round inquiringly at the adjutant as he rode by 
 prince andrew having reached the front line rode along it our front line and that of the enemy were far apart on the right and left flanks but in the center where the men with a flag of truce had passed that morning the lines were so near together that the men could see one faces and speak to one another besides the soldiers who formed the picket line on either side there were many curious onlookers who jesting and laughing stared at their strange foreign enemies 
 since early morning despite an injunction not to approach the picket line the officers had been unable to keep away the soldiers forming the picket line like showmen exhibiting a curiosity no longer looked at the french but paid attention to the and grew weary waiting to be relieved prince andrew halted to have a look at the french 
 look look there one soldier was saying to another pointing to a russian musketeer who had gone up to the picket line with an officer and was rapidly and excitedly talking to a french grenadier hark to him jabbering fine it all the frenchy can do to keep up with him there now sidorov 
 wait a bit and listen fine answered sidorov who was considered an adept at french 
 the soldier to whom the laughers referred was dolokhov prince andrew recognized him and stopped to listen to what he was saying dolokhov had come from the left flank where their regiment was stationed with his captain 
 now then go on go on incited the officer bending forward and trying not to lose a word of the speech which was incomprehensible to him more please more he saying 
 dolokhov did not answer the captain he had been drawn into a hot dispute with the french grenadier they were naturally talking about the campaign the frenchman confusing the austrians with the russians was trying to prove that the russians had surrendered and had fled all the way from ulm while dolokhov maintained that the russians had not surrendered but had beaten the french 
 we have orders to drive you off here and we shall drive you off said dolokhov 
 only take care you and your cossacks are not all captured said the french grenadier 
 the french onlookers and listeners laughed 
 make you dance as we did under suvorov said dolokhov 
 on vous fera danser 
 qu chante asked a frenchman 
 he singing about 
 ancient history said another guessing that it referred to a former war the emperor will teach your suvara as he has taught the others 
 bonaparte began dolokhov but the frenchman interrupted him 
 not bonaparte he is the emperor sacre nom cried he angrily 
 the devil skin your emperor 
 and dolokhov swore at him in coarse russian and shouldering his musket walked away 
 let us go ivan lukich he said to the captain 
 ah the way to talk french said the picket soldiers now sidorov you have a try 
 sidorov turning to the french winked and began to jabber meaningless sounds very fast kari mala tafa safi muter kaska he said trying to give an expressive intonation to his voice 
 ho ho ho ha ha ha ha ouh ouh came peals of such healthy and laughter from the soldiers that it infected the french involuntarily so much so that the only thing left to do seemed to be to unload the muskets muskets explode the ammunition and all return home as quickly as possible 
 but the guns remained loaded the loopholes in blockhouses and entrenchments looked out just as menacingly and the unlimbered cannon confronted one another as before

 chapter 
 
 
 jo was alone in the twilight lying on the old sofa looking at the fire and thinking it was her favorite way of spending the hour of dusk no one disturbed her and she used to lie there on little red pillow planning stories dreaming dreams or thinking tender thoughts of the sister who never seemed far away her face looked tired grave and rather sad for tomorrow was her birthday and she was thinking how fast the years went by how old she was getting and how little she seemed to have accomplished almost and nothing to show for it jo was mistaken in that there was a good deal to show and she saw and was grateful for it 
 an old maid what to be a literary spinster with a pen for a spouse a family of stories for children and twenty years hence a morsel of fame perhaps when like poor johnson old and enjoy it solitary and share it independent and need it well i be a sour saint nor a selfish sinner and i dare say old maids are very comfortable when they get used to it but and there jo sighed as if the prospect was not inviting 
 it seldom is at first and thirty seems the end of all things to but not as bad as it looks and one can get on quite happily if one has something in self to fall back upon at girls begin to talk about being old maids but secretly resolve that they never will be at thirty they say nothing about it but quietly accept the fact and if sensible console themselves by remembering that they have twenty more useful happy years in which they may be learning to grow old gracefully laugh at the spinsters dear girls for often very tender tragic romances are hidden away in the hearts that beat so quietly under the sober gowns and many silent sacrifices of youth health ambition love itself make the faded faces beautiful in sight even the sad sour sisters should be kindly dealt with because they have missed the sweetest part of life if for no other reason and looking at them with compassion not contempt girls in their bloom should remember that they too may miss the blossom time that rosy cheeks last forever that silver threads will come in the bonnie brown hair and that kindness and respect will be as sweet as love and admiration now 
 gentlemen which means boys be courteous to the old maids no matter how poor and plain and prim for the only chivalry worth having is that which is the readiest to pay deference to the old protect the feeble and serve womankind regardless of rank age or color just recollect the good aunts who have not only lectured and fussed but nursed and petted too often without thanks the scrapes they have helped you out of the tips they have given you from their small store the stitches the patient old fingers have set for you the steps the willing old feet have taken and gratefully pay the dear old ladies the little attentions that women love to receive as long as they live the girls are quick to see such traits and will like you all the better for them and if death almost the only power that can part mother and son should rob you of yours you will be sure to find a tender welcome and maternal cherishing from some aunt priscilla who has kept the warmest corner of her lonely old heart for the best nevvy in the world 
 jo must have fallen asleep as i dare say my reader has during this little homily for suddenly ghost seemed to stand before her a substantial lifelike ghost leaning over her with the very look he used to wear when he felt a good deal and like to show it but like jenny in the ballad 
 
 
 she could not think it he 
 and lay staring up at him in startled silence till he stooped 
 and kissed her then she knew him and flew up crying joyfully 
 oh my teddy oh my teddy 
 dear jo you are glad to see me then 
 glad my blessed boy words express my gladness amy 
 your mother has got her down at we stopped there by the way and there was no getting my wife out of their clutches 
 your what cried jo for laurie uttered those two words with an unconscious pride and satisfaction which betrayed him 
 oh the dickens now done it and he looked so guilty that jo was down on him like a flash 
 gone and got married 
 yes please but i never will again and he went down upon his knees with a penitent clasping of hands and a face full of mischief mirth and triumph 
 actually married 
 very much so thank you 
 mercy on us what dreadful thing will you do next and jo fell into her seat with a gasp 
 a characteristic but not exactly complimentary congratulation returned laurie still in an abject attitude but beaming with satisfaction 
 what can you expect when you take breath away creeping in like a burglar and letting cats out of bags like that get up you ridiculous boy and tell me all about it 
 not a word unless you let me come in my old place and promise not to barricade 
 jo laughed at that as she had not done for many a long day and patted the sofa invitingly as she said in a cordial tone the old pillow is up garret and we need it now so come and fess teddy 
 how good it sounds to hear you say teddy no one ever calls me that but you and laurie sat down with an air of great content 
 what does amy call you 
 my lord 
 like her well you look it and eye plainly betrayed that she found her boy comelier than ever 
 the pillow was gone but there was a barricade nevertheless a natural one raised by time absence and change of heart both felt it and for a minute looked at one another as if that invisible barrier cast a little shadow over them it was gone directly however for laurie said with a vain attempt at dignity 
 i look like a married man and the head of a family not a bit and you never will grown bigger and bonnier but you are the same scapegrace as ever 
 now really jo you ought to treat me with more respect began laurie who enjoyed it all immensely 
 how can i when the mere idea of you married and settled is so irresistibly funny that i keep sober answered jo smiling all over her face so infectiously that they had another laugh and then settled down for a good talk quite in the pleasant old fashion 
 no use your going out in the cold to get amy for they are all coming up presently i wait i wanted to be the one to tell you the grand surprise and have first skim as we used to say when we squabbled about the cream 
 of course you did and spoiled your story by beginning at the wrong end now start right and tell me how it all happened pining to know 
 well i did it to please amy began laurie with a twinkle that made jo exclaim 
 fib number one amy did it to please you go on and tell the truth if you can sir 
 now beginning to marm it it jolly to hear her said laurie to the fire and the fire glowed and sparkled as if it quite agreed all the same you know she and i being one we planned to come home with the carrols a month or more ago but they suddenly changed their minds and decided to pass another winter in paris but grandpa wanted to come home he went to please me and i let him go along neither could i leave amy and mrs carrol had got english notions about chaperons and such nonsense and let amy come with us so i just settled the difficulty by saying be married and then we can do as we like 
 of course you did you always have things to suit you 
 not always and something in voice made jo say hastily 
 how did you ever get aunt to agree 
 it was hard work but between us we talked her over for we had heaps of good reasons on our side there time to write and ask leave but you all liked it had consented to it and it was only taking time by the fetlock as my wife says 
 we proud of those two word and we like to say them interrupted jo addressing the fire in her turn and watching with delight the happy light it seemed to kindle in the eyes that had been so tragically gloomy when she saw them last a trifle perhaps such a captivating little woman i help being proud of her well then uncle and aunt were there to play propriety we were so absorbed in one another we were of no mortal use apart and that charming arrangement woul make everything easy all round so we did it 
 when where how asked jo in a fever of feminine interest and curiosity for she could not realize it a particle 
 six weeks ago at the american in paris a very quiet wedding of course for even in our happiness we forget dear little beth 
 jo put her hand in his as he said that and laurie gently smoothed the little red pillow which he remembered well 
 why you let us know afterward asked jo in a quieter tone when they had sat quite still a minute 
 we wanted to surprise you we thought we were coming directly home at first but the dear old gentleman as soon as we were married found he be ready under a month at least and sent us off to spend our honeymoon wherever we liked amy had once called valrosa a regular honeymoon home so we went there and were as happy as people are but once in their lives my faith it love among the roses 
 laurie seemed to forget jo for a minute and jo was glad of it for the fact that he told her these things so freely and so naturally assured her that he had quite forgiven and forgotten she tried to draw away her hand but as if he guessed the thought that prompted the impulse laurie held it fast and said with a manly gravity she had never seen in him before 
 jo dear i want to say one thing and then put it by forever as i told you in my letter when i wrote that amy had been so kind to me i never shall stop loving you but the love is altered and i have learned to see that it is better as it is amy and you changed places in my heart all i think it was meant to be so and would have come about naturally if i had waited as you tried to make me but i never could be patient and so i got a heartache i was a boy then headstrong and violent and it took a hard lesson to show me my mistake for it was one jo as you said and i found it out after making a fool of myself upon my word i was so tumbled up in my mind at one time that i know which i loved best you or amy and tried to love you both alike but i and when i saw her in switzerland everything seemed to clear up all at once you both got into your right places and i felt sure that it was well off with the old love before it was on with the new that i could honestly share my heart between sister jo and wife amy and love them dearly will you believe it and go back to the happy old times when we first knew one another 
 believe it with all my heart but teddy we never can be boy and girl again the happy old times come back and we expect it we are man and woman now with sober work to do for playtime is over and we must give up frolicking sure you feel this i see the change in you and find it in me i shall miss my boy but i shall love the man as much and admire him more because he means to be what i hoped he would we be little playmates any longer but we will be brother and sister to love and help one another all our lives we laurie 
 he did not say a word but took the hand she offered him and laid his face down on it for a minute feeling that out of the grave of a boyish passion there had risen a beautiful strong friendship to bless them both presently jo said cheerfully for she the coming home to be a sad one i make it true that you children are really married and going to set up housekeeping why it seems only yesterday that i was buttoning pinafore and pulling your hair when you teased mercy me how time does fly 
 as one of the children is older than yourself you talk so like a grandma i flatter myself a gentleman growed as peggotty said of david and when you see amy find her rather a precocious infant said laurie looking amused at her maternal air 
 you may be a little older in years but ever so much older in feeling teddy women always are and this last year has been such a hard one that i feel forty 
 
 poor jo we left you to bear it alone while we went pleasuring you are older a line and another unless you smile your eyes look sad and when i touched the cushion just now i found a tear on it had a great deal to bear and had to bear it all alone what a selfish beast been and laurie pulled his own hair with a remorseful look 
 but jo only turned over the traitorous pillow and answered in a tone which she tried to make more cheerful no i had father and mother to help me and the dear babies to comfort me and the thought that you and amy were safe and happy to make the troubles here easier to bear i am lonely sometimes but i dare say good for me and 
 you never shall be again broke in laurie putting his arm about her as if to fence out every human ill amy and i get on without you so you must come and teach the children to keep house and go halves in everything just as we used to do and let us pet you and all be blissfully happy and friendly together 
 if i be in the way it would be very pleasant i begin to feel quite young already for somehow all my troubles seemed to fly away when you came you always were a comfort teddy and jo leaned her head on his shoulder just as she did years ago when beth lay ill and laurie told her to hold on to him 
 he looked down at her wondering if she remembered the time but jo was smiling to herself as if in truth her troubles had all vanished at his coming 
 you are the same jo still dropping tears about one minute and laughing the next you look a little wicked now what is it grandma 
 i was wondering how you and amy get on together 
 like angels 
 yes of course but which rules 
 i mind telling you that she does now at least i let her think so it pleases her you know we shall take turns for marriage they say halves rights and doubles duties 
 go on as you begin and amy will rule you all the days of your life 
 well she does it so imperceptibly that i think i shall mind much she is the sort of woman who knows how to rule well in fact i rather like it for she winds one round her finger as softly and prettily as a skein of silk and makes you feel as if she was doing you a favor all the while 
 that ever i should live to see you a henpecked husband and enjoying it cried jo with uplifted hands 
 it was good to see laurie square his shoulders and smile with masculine scorn at that insinuation as he replied with his high and mighty air amy is too for that and i am not the sort of man to submit to it my wife and i respect ourselves and one another too much ever to tyrannize or quarrel 
 jo like that and thought the new dignity very becoming but the boy seemed changing very fast into the man and regret mingled with her pleasure 
 i am sure of that amy and you never did quarrel as we used to she is the sun and i the wind in the fable and the sun managed the man best you remember 
 she can blow him up as well as shine on him laughed laurie such a lecture as i got at nice i give you my word it was a deal worse than any or your scoldings a regular rouser tell you all about it sometime she never will because after telling me that she despised and was ashamed of me she lost her heart to the despicable party and married the 
 what baseness well if she abuses you come to me and defend you 
 i look as if i needed it i said laurie getting up and striking an attitude which suddenly changed from the imposing to the rapturous as voice was heard calling where is she my dear old jo 
 in trooped the whole family and everyone was hugged and kissed all over again and after several vain attempts the three wanderers were set down to be looked at and exulted over mr laurence hale and hearty as ever was quite as much improved as the others by his foreign tour for the crustiness seemed to be early gone and the courtliness had received a polish which made it kindlier than ever it was good to see him beam at my children as he called the young pair it was better still to see amy pay him the daughterly duty and affection which completely won his old heart and best of all to watch laurie revolve about the two as if never tired of enjoying the pretty picture they made 
 the minute she put her eyes upon amy meg became conscious that her own dress a parisian air that young mrs mofffat would be entirely eclipsed by young mrs laurence and that her ladyship was altogether a most elegant and graceful woman jo thought as she watched the pair how well they look together i was right and laurie has found the beautiful accomplished girl who will become his home better than clumsy old jo and be a pride not a torment tohim mrs march and her husband smiled and nodded at each other with happy faces for they saw that their youngest had done well not only in worldly things but the better wealth of love confidence and happiness 
 for face was full of the soft brightness which betokens a peaceful heart her voice had a new tenderness in it and the cool prim carriage was changed to a gentle dignity both womanly and winning no little affectations marred it and the cordial sweetness of her manner was more charming than the new beauty or the old grace for it stamped her at once with the unmistakable sign of the true gentlewoman she had hoped to become 
 love has done much for our little girl said her mother softly 
 she has had a good example before her all her life my dear mr march whispered back with a loving look at the worn face and gray head beside him 
 daisy found it impossible to keep her eyes off her pitty aunty but attached herself like a lap dog to the wonderful chatelaine full of delightful charms demi paused to consider the new relationship before he compromised himself by the rash acceptance of a bribe which took the tempting form of a family of wooden bears from berne a flank movement produced an unconditional surrender however for laurie knew where to have him 
 young man when i first had the honor of making your acquaintance you hit me in the face now i demand the satisfaction of a gentleman and with that the tall uncle proceeded to toss and tousle the small nephew in a way that damaged his philosophical dignity as much as it delighted his boyish soul 
 blest if she in silk from head to foot it a relishin sight to see her settin there as fine as a fiddle anch a happy procession as filed away into the little dining room mr march proudly escorted mrs laurence mrs march as proudly leaned on the arm of my son the old gentleman took jo with a whispered you must be my girl now and a glance at the empty corner by thefire that made jo whisper back try to fill her place sir 
 the twins pranced behind feeling that the millennium was at hand for everyone was so busy with the newcomers that they were left to revel at their own sweet will and you may be sure they made the most of the opportunity they steal sips of tea stuff gingerbread ad libitum get a hot biscuit apiece and as a crowning trespass they each whisk a captivating little tart into their tiny pockets there to stick and crumble treacherously teaching them that both human nature and a pastry are frail burdened with the guilty consciousness of the sequestered tarts and fearing that sharp eyes would pierce the thin disguise of cambric and merino which hid their booty the little sinners attached themselves to dranpa who his spectacles on amy who was handed about like refreshments returned to the parlor on father arm the others paired off as before and this arrangement left jo companionless she did not mind it at the minute for she lingered to answer eager inquiry 
 will miss amy ride in her coop coupe and use all them lovely silver dishes stored away over yander 
 wonder if she drove six white horses ate off gold plate and wore diamonds and point lace every day teddy thinks nothing too good for her returned jo with infinite satisfaction 
 no more there is will you have hash or fishballs for breakfast asked hannah who wisely mingled poetry and prose 
 i care and jo shut the door feeling that food was an uncongenial topic just then she stood a minute looking at the party vanishing above and as short plaid legs toiled up the last stair a sudden sense of lonliness came over her so strongly that she looked about her with dim eyes as if to find something to lean upon for even teddy had deserted her if she had known what birthday gift was coming every minute nearer and nearer she would not have said to herself weep a little weep when i go to bed it do to be dismal now then she drew her hand over her eyes for one of her boyish habits was never to know where her handkerchief was and had just managed to call up a smile when there came a knock at the porch door 
 she opened with hospitable haste and started as if another ghost had come to surprise her for there stood a tall bearded gentleman beaming on her from the darkness like a midnight sun 
 oh mr bhaer i am so glad to see you cried jo with a clutch as if she feared the night would swallow him up before she could get him in 
 and i to see miss marsch but no you haf a party and the professor paused as the sound of voices and the tap of dancing feet came down to them 
 no we only the family my sister and friends have just come home and we are all very happy come in and make one of us 
 though a very social man i think mr bhaer would have gone decorously away and come again another day but how could he when jo shut the door behind him and bereft him of his hat perhaps her face had something to do with it for she forgot to hide her joy at seeing him and showed it with a frankness that proved irresistible to the solitary man whose welcome far exceeded his boldest hopes 
 if i shall not be monsieur de trop i will so gladly see them all you haf been ill my friend 
 he put the question abruptly for as jo hung up his coat the light fell on her face and he saw a change in it 
 not ill but tired and sorrowful we have had trouble since i saw you last 
 ah yes i know my heart was sore for you when i heard that and he shook hands again with such a sympathetic face that jo felt as if no comfort could equal the look of the kind eyes the grasp of the big warm hand 
 father mother this is my friend professor bhaer she said with a face and tone of such irrepressible pride and pleasure that she might as well have blown a trumpet and opened the door with a flourish 
 if the stranger had any doubts about his reception they were set at rest in a minute by the cordial welcome he received everyone greeted him kindly for sake at first but very soon they liked him for his own they could not help it for he carried the talisman that opens all hearts and these simple people warmed to him at once feeling even the more friendly because he was poor for poverty enriches those who live above it and is a sure passport to truly hospitable spirits mr bhaer sat looking about him with the air of a traveler who knocks at a strange door and when it opens finds himself at home the children went to him like bees to a honeypot and establishing themselves on each knee proceeded to captivate him by rifling his pockets pulling his beard and investigating his watch with juvenile audacity the women telegraphed their approval to one another and mr march feeling that he had got a kindred spirit opened his choicest stores for his benefit while silent john listened and enjoyed the talk but said not a word and mr laurence found it impossible to go to sleep 
 if jo had not been otherwise engaged behavior would have amused her for a faint twinge not of jealousy but something like suspicion caused that gentleman to stand aloof at first and observe the newcomer with brotherly circumspection but it did not last long he got interested in spite of himself and before he knew it was drawn into the circle for mr bhaer talked well in this genial atmosphere and did himself justice he seldom spoke to laurie but he looked at him often and a shadow would pass across his face as if regretting his own lost youth as he watched the young man in his prime then his eyes would turn to jo so wistfully that she would have surely answered the mute inquiry if she had seen it but jo had her own eyes to take care of and feeling that they could not be trusted she prudently kept them on the little sock she was knitting like a model maiden aunt 
 a stealthy glance now and then refreshed her like sips of fresh water after a dusty walk for the sidelong peeps showed her several propitious omens mr face had lost the expression and looked all alive with interest in the present moment actually young and handsome she thought forgetting to compare him with laurie as she usually did strange men to their great detriment then he seemed quite inspired though the burial customs of the ancients to which the conversation had strayed might not be considered an exhilarating topic jo quite glowed with triumph when teddy got quenched in an argument and thought to herself as she watched her absorbed face how he would enjoy having such a man as my professor to talk with every day lastly mr bhaer was dressed in a new suit of black which made him look more like a gentleman than ever his bushy hair had been cut and smoothly brushed but stay in order long for in exciting moments he rumpled it up in the droll way he used to do and jo liked it rampantly erect better than flat because she thought it gave his fine forehead a aspect poor jo how she did glorify that plain man as she sat knitting away so quietly yet letting nothing escape her not even the fact that mr bhaer actually had gold in his immaculate wristbands 
 dear old fellow he have got himself up with more care if been going said jo to herself and then a sudden thought born of the words made her blush so dreadfully that she had to drop her ball and go down after it to hide her face 
 the maneuver did not succeed as well as she expected however for though just in the act of setting fire to a funeral pyre the professor dropped his torch metaphorically speaking and made a dive after the little blue ball of course they bumped their heads smartly together saw stars and both came up flushed and laughing without the ball to resume their seats wishing they had not left them 
 nobody knew where the evening went to for hannah skillfully abstracted the babies at an early hour nodding like two rosy poppies and mr laurence went home to rest the others sat round the fire talking away utterly regardless of the lapse of time till meg whose maternal was impressed with a firm conviction that daisy had tumbled out of be and demi set his nightgown afire studying the structure of matches made a move to go 
 we must have our sing in the good old way for we are all together again once more said jo feeling that a good shout would be a safe and pleasant vent for the jubilant emotions of her soul 
 they were not all there but no one found the words thougtless or untrue for beth still seemed among them a peaceful presence invisible but dearer than ever since death could not break the household league that love made disoluble the little chair stood in its old place the tidy basket with the bit of work she left unfinished when the needle grew so heavy was still on its accustomed shelf the beloved instrument seldom touched now had not been moved and above it face serene and smiling as in the early days looked down upon them seeming to say be happy i am here 
 play something amy let them hear how much you have improved said laurie with pardonable pride in his promising pupil 
 but amy whispered with full eyes as she twirled the faded stool not tonight dear i show off tonight 
 but she did show something better than brilliancy or skill for she sang songs with a tender music in her voice which the best master could not have taught and touched the hearts with a sweeter power than any other inspiration could have given her the room was very still when the clear voice failed suddenly at the last line of favorite hymn it was hard to say 
 earth hath no sorrow that heaven cannot heal 
 and amy leaned against her husband who stood behind her feeling that her welcome home was not quite perfect without kiss 
 now we must finish with song for mr bhaer sings that said jo before the pause grew painful and mr bhaer cleared his throat with a gratified hem as he stepped into the corner where jo stood saying 
 you will sing with me we go excellently well together 
 a pleasing fiction by the way for jo had no more idea of 
 music than a grasshopper but she would have consented if he had 
 proposed to sing a whole opera and warbled away blissfully regardless 
 of time and tune it much matter for mr bhaer 
 sang like a true german heartily and well and jo soon subsided 
 into a subdued hum that she might listen to the mellow voice that 
 seemed to sing for her alone 
 thou the land where the citron blooms 
 used to be the favorite line for das land meant germany to him but now he seemed to dwell with peculiar warmth and melody upon the words 
 
 there oh there might i with thee o my beloved go and one listener was so thrilled by the tender invitation that she longed to say she did know the land and would joyfully depart thither whenever he liked the song was considered a great success and the singer retired covered with laurels but a few minutes afterward he forgot his manners entirely and stared at amy putting on her bonnet for she had been introduced simply as my sister and on one had called her by her new name since her came he forgot himself still further when laurie said in his most gracious manner at parting 
 my wife and i are very glad to meet you sir please remember that there is always a welcome waiting for you over the way 
 then the professor thanked him so heartily and looked so suddenly illuminated with satisfaction that laurie thought him the most delightfully demonstrative old fellow he ever met 
 i too shall go but i shall gladly come again if you will gif me leave dear madame for a little business in the city will keep me here some days 
 he spoke to mrs march but he looked at jo and the voice gave as cordial an assent as did the eyes for mrs march was not so blind to her interest as mrs moffat supposed 
 i suspect that is a wise man remarked mr march with placid satisfaction from the hearthrug after the last guest had gone 
 i know he is a good one added mrs march with decided approval as she wound up the clock 
 i thought like him was all jo said as she slipped away to her bed 
 she wondered what the business was that brought mr bhaer to the city and finally decided that he had been appointed to some great honor somewhere but had been too modest to mention the fact if she had seen his face when safe in his own room he looked at the picture of a severe and rigid young lady with a good deal of hair who appeared to be gazing darkly into futurity it might have thrown some light upon the subject especially when he turned off the gas and kissed the picture in the dark

 chapter 
 
 
 jo was alone in the twilight lying on the old sofa looking at the fire and thinking it was her favorite way of spending the hour of dusk no one disturbed her and she used to lie there on little red pillow planning stories dreaming dreams or thinking tender thoughts of the sister who never seemed far away her face looked tired grave and rather sad for tomorrow was her birthday and she was thinking how fast the years went by how old she was getting and how little she seemed to have accomplished almost and nothing to show for it jo was mistaken in that there was a good deal to show and she saw and was grateful for it 
 an old maid what to be a literary spinster with a pen for a spouse a family of stories for children and twenty years hence a morsel of fame perhaps when like poor johnson old and enjoy it solitary and share it independent and need it well i be a sour saint nor a selfish sinner and i dare say old maids are very comfortable when they get used to it but and there jo sighed as if the prospect was not inviting 
 it seldom is at first and thirty seems the end of all things to but not as bad as it looks and one can get on quite happily if one has something in self to fall back upon at girls begin to talk about being old maids but secretly resolve that they never will be at thirty they say nothing about it but quietly accept the fact and if sensible console themselves by remembering that they have twenty more useful happy years in which they may be learning to grow old gracefully laugh at the spinsters dear girls for often very tender tragic romances are hidden away in the hearts that beat so quietly under the sober gowns and many silent sacrifices of youth health ambition love itself make the faded faces beautiful in sight even the sad sour sisters should be kindly dealt with because they have missed the sweetest part of life if for no other reason and looking at them with compassion not contempt girls in their bloom should remember that they too may miss the blossom time that rosy cheeks last forever that silver threads will come in the bonnie brown hair and that kindness and respect will be as sweet as love and admiration now 
 gentlemen which means boys be courteous to the old maids no matter how poor and plain and prim for the only chivalry worth having is that which is the readiest to pay deference to the old protect the feeble and serve womankind regardless of rank age or color just recollect the good aunts who have not only lectured and fussed but nursed and petted too often without thanks the scrapes they have helped you out of the tips they have given you from their small store the stitches the patient old fingers have set for you the steps the willing old feet have taken and gratefully pay the dear old ladies the little attentions that women love to receive as long as they live the girls are quick to see such traits and will like you all the better for them and if death almost the only power that can part mother and son should rob you of yours you will be sure to find a tender welcome and maternal cherishing from some aunt priscilla who has kept the warmest corner of her lonely old heart for the best nevvy in the world 
 jo must have fallen asleep as i dare say my reader has during this little homily for suddenly ghost seemed to stand before her a substantial lifelike ghost leaning over her with the very look he used to wear when he felt a good deal and like to show it but like jenny in the ballad 
 
 
 she could not think it he 
 and lay staring up at him in startled silence till he stooped 
 and kissed her then she knew him and flew up crying joyfully 
 oh my teddy oh my teddy 
 dear jo you are glad to see me then 
 glad my blessed boy words express my gladness amy 
 your mother has got her down at we stopped there by the way and there was no getting my wife out of their clutches 
 your what cried jo for laurie uttered those two words with an unconscious pride and satisfaction which betrayed him 
 oh the dickens now done it and he looked so guilty that jo was down on him like a flash 
 gone and got married 
 yes please but i never will again and he went down upon his knees with a penitent clasping of hands and a face full of mischief mirth and triumph 
 actually married 
 very much so thank you 
 mercy on us what dreadful thing will you do next and jo fell into her seat with a gasp 
 a characteristic but not exactly complimentary congratulation returned laurie still in an abject attitude but beaming with satisfaction 
 what can you expect when you take breath away creeping in like a burglar and letting cats out of bags like that get up you ridiculous boy and tell me all about it 
 not a word unless you let me come in my old place and promise not to barricade 
 jo laughed at that as she had not done for many a long day and patted the sofa invitingly as she said in a cordial tone the old pillow is up garret and we need it now so come and fess teddy 
 how good it sounds to hear you say teddy no one ever calls me that but you and laurie sat down with an air of great content 
 what does amy call you 
 my lord 
 like her well you look it and eye plainly betrayed that she found her boy comelier than ever 
 the pillow was gone but there was a barricade nevertheless a natural one raised by time absence and change of heart both felt it and for a minute looked at one another as if that invisible barrier cast a little shadow over them it was gone directly however for laurie said with a vain attempt at dignity 
 i look like a married man and the head of a family not a bit and you never will grown bigger and bonnier but you are the same scapegrace as ever 
 now really jo you ought to treat me with more respect began laurie who enjoyed it all immensely 
 how can i when the mere idea of you married and settled is so irresistibly funny that i keep sober answered jo smiling all over her face so infectiously that they had another laugh and then settled down for a good talk quite in the pleasant old fashion 
 no use your going out in the cold to get amy for they are all coming up presently i wait i wanted to be the one to tell you the grand surprise and have first skim as we used to say when we squabbled about the cream 
 of course you did and spoiled your story by beginning at the wrong end now start right and tell me how it all happened pining to know 
 well i did it to please amy began laurie with a twinkle that made jo exclaim 
 fib number one amy did it to please you go on and tell the truth if you can sir 
 now beginning to marm it it jolly to hear her said laurie to the fire and the fire glowed and sparkled as if it quite agreed all the same you know she and i being one we planned to come home with the carrols a month or more ago but they suddenly changed their minds and decided to pass another winter in paris but grandpa wanted to come home he went to please me and i let him go along neither could i leave amy and mrs carrol had got english notions about chaperons and such nonsense and let amy come with us so i just settled the difficulty by saying be married and then we can do as we like 
 of course you did you always have things to suit you 
 not always and something in voice made jo say hastily 
 how did you ever get aunt to agree 
 it was hard work but between us we talked her over for we had heaps of good reasons on our side there time to write and ask leave but you all liked it had consented to it and it was only taking time by the fetlock as my wife says 
 we proud of those two word and we like to say them interrupted jo addressing the fire in her turn and watching with delight the happy light it seemed to kindle in the eyes that had been so tragically gloomy when she saw them last a trifle perhaps such a captivating little woman i help being proud of her well then uncle and aunt were there to play propriety we were so absorbed in one another we were of no mortal use apart and that charming arrangement woul make everything easy all round so we did it 
 when where how asked jo in a fever of feminine interest and curiosity for she could not realize it a particle 
 six weeks ago at the american in paris a very quiet wedding of course for even in our happiness we forget dear little beth 
 jo put her hand in his as he said that and laurie gently smoothed the little red pillow which he remembered well 
 why you let us know afterward asked jo in a quieter tone when they had sat quite still a minute 
 we wanted to surprise you we thought we were coming directly home at first but the dear old gentleman as soon as we were married found he be ready under a month at least and sent us off to spend our honeymoon wherever we liked amy had once called valrosa a regular honeymoon home so we went there and were as happy as people are but once in their lives my faith it love among the roses 
 laurie seemed to forget jo for a minute and jo was glad of it for the fact that he told her these things so freely and so naturally assured her that he had quite forgiven and forgotten she tried to draw away her hand but as if he guessed the thought that prompted the impulse laurie held it fast and said with a manly gravity she had never seen in him before 
 jo dear i want to say one thing and then put it by forever as i told you in my letter when i wrote that amy had been so kind to me i never shall stop loving you but the love is altered and i have learned to see that it is better as it is amy and you changed places in my heart all i think it was meant to be so and would have come about naturally if i had waited as you tried to make me but i never could be patient and so i got a heartache i was a boy then headstrong and violent and it took a hard lesson to show me my mistake for it was one jo as you said and i found it out after making a fool of myself upon my word i was so tumbled up in my mind at one time that i know which i loved best you or amy and tried to love you both alike but i and when i saw her in switzerland everything seemed to clear up all at once you both got into your right places and i felt sure that it was well off with the old love before it was on with the new that i could honestly share my heart between sister jo and wife amy and love them dearly will you believe it and go back to the happy old times when we first knew one another 
 believe it with all my heart but teddy we never can be boy and girl again the happy old times come back and we expect it we are man and woman now with sober work to do for playtime is over and we must give up frolicking sure you feel this i see the change in you and find it in me i shall miss my boy but i shall love the man as much and admire him more because he means to be what i hoped he would we be little playmates any longer but we will be brother and sister to love and help one another all our lives we laurie 
 he did not say a word but took the hand she offered him and laid his face down on it for a minute feeling that out of the grave of a boyish passion there had risen a beautiful strong friendship to bless them both presently jo said cheerfully for she the coming home to be a sad one i make it true that you children are really married and going to set up housekeeping why it seems only yesterday that i was buttoning pinafore and pulling your hair when you teased mercy me how time does fly 
 as one of the children is older than yourself you talk so like a grandma i flatter myself a gentleman growed as peggotty said of david and when you see amy find her rather a precocious infant said laurie looking amused at her maternal air 
 you may be a little older in years but ever so much older in feeling teddy women always are and this last year has been such a hard one that i feel forty 
 
 poor jo we left you to bear it alone while we went pleasuring you are older a line and another unless you smile your eyes look sad and when i touched the cushion just now i found a tear on it had a great deal to bear and had to bear it all alone what a selfish beast been and laurie pulled his own hair with a remorseful look 
 but jo only turned over the traitorous pillow and answered in a tone which she tried to make more cheerful no i had father and mother to help me and the dear babies to comfort me and the thought that you and amy were safe and happy to make the troubles here easier to bear i am lonely sometimes but i dare say good for me and 
 you never shall be again broke in laurie putting his arm about her as if to fence out every human ill amy and i get on without you so you must come and teach the children to keep house and go halves in everything just as we used to do and let us pet you and all be blissfully happy and friendly together 
 if i be in the way it would be very pleasant i begin to feel quite young already for somehow all my troubles seemed to fly away when you came you always were a comfort teddy and jo leaned her head on his shoulder just as she did years ago when beth lay ill and laurie told her to hold on to him 
 he looked down at her wondering if she remembered the time but jo was smiling to herself as if in truth her troubles had all vanished at his coming 
 you are the same jo still dropping tears about one minute and laughing the next you look a little wicked now what is it grandma 
 i was wondering how you and amy get on together 
 like angels 
 yes of course but which rules 
 i mind telling you that she does now at least i let her think so it pleases her you know we shall take turns for marriage they say halves rights and doubles duties 
 go on as you begin and amy will rule you all the days of your life 
 well she does it so imperceptibly that i think i shall mind much she is the sort of woman who knows how to rule well in fact i rather like it for she winds one round her finger as softly and prettily as a skein of silk and makes you feel as if she was doing you a favor all the while 
 that ever i should live to see you a henpecked husband and enjoying it cried jo with uplifted hands 
 it was good to see laurie square his shoulders and smile with masculine scorn at that insinuation as he replied with his high and mighty air amy is too for that and i am not the sort of man to submit to it my wife and i respect ourselves and one another too much ever to tyrannize or quarrel 
 jo like that and thought the new dignity very becoming but the boy seemed changing very fast into the man and regret mingled with her pleasure 
 i am sure of that amy and you never did quarrel as we used to she is the sun and i the wind in the fable and the sun managed the man best you remember 
 she can blow him up as well as shine on him laughed laurie such a lecture as i got at nice i give you my word it was a deal worse than any or your scoldings a regular rouser tell you all about it sometime she never will because after telling me that she despised and was ashamed of me she lost her heart to the despicable party and married the 
 what baseness well if she abuses you come to me and defend you 
 i look as if i needed it i said laurie getting up and striking an attitude which suddenly changed from the imposing to the rapturous as voice was heard calling where is she my dear old jo 
 in trooped the whole family and everyone was hugged and kissed all over again and after several vain attempts the three wanderers were set down to be looked at and exulted over mr laurence hale and hearty as ever was quite as much improved as the others by his foreign tour for the crustiness seemed to be early gone and the courtliness had received a polish which made it kindlier than ever it was good to see him beam at my children as he called the young pair it was better still to see amy pay him the daughterly duty and affection which completely won his old heart and best of all to watch laurie revolve about the two as if never tired of enjoying the pretty picture they made 
 the minute she put her eyes upon amy meg became conscious that her own dress a parisian air that young mrs mofffat would be entirely eclipsed by young mrs laurence and that her ladyship was altogether a most elegant and graceful woman jo thought as she watched the pair how well they look together i was right and laurie has found the beautiful accomplished girl who will become his home better than clumsy old jo and be a pride not a torment tohim mrs march and her husband smiled and nodded at each other with happy faces for they saw that their youngest had done well not only in worldly things but the better wealth of love confidence and happiness 
 for face was full of the soft brightness which betokens a peaceful heart her voice had a new tenderness in it and the cool prim carriage was changed to a gentle dignity both womanly and winning no little affectations marred it and the cordial sweetness of her manner was more charming than the new beauty or the old grace for it stamped her at once with the unmistakable sign of the true gentlewoman she had hoped to become 
 love has done much for our little girl said her mother softly 
 she has had a good example before her all her life my dear mr march whispered back with a loving look at the worn face and gray head beside him 
 daisy found it impossible to keep her eyes off her pitty aunty but attached herself like a lap dog to the wonderful chatelaine full of delightful charms demi paused to consider the new relationship before he compromised himself by the rash acceptance of a bribe which took the tempting form of a family of wooden bears from berne a flank movement produced an unconditional surrender however for laurie knew where to have him 
 young man when i first had the honor of making your acquaintance you hit me in the face now i demand the satisfaction of a gentleman and with that the tall uncle proceeded to toss and tousle the small nephew in a way that damaged his philosophical dignity as much as it delighted his boyish soul 
 blest if she in silk from head to foot it a relishin sight to see her settin there as fine as a fiddle anch a happy procession as filed away into the little dining room mr march proudly escorted mrs laurence mrs march as proudly leaned on the arm of my son the old gentleman took jo with a whispered you must be my girl now and a glance at the empty corner by thefire that made jo whisper back try to fill her place sir 
 the twins pranced behind feeling that the millennium was at hand for everyone was so busy with the newcomers that they were left to revel at their own sweet will and you may be sure they made the most of the opportunity they steal sips of tea stuff gingerbread ad libitum get a hot biscuit apiece and as a crowning trespass they each whisk a captivating little tart into their tiny pockets there to stick and crumble treacherously teaching them that both human nature and a pastry are frail burdened with the guilty consciousness of the sequestered tarts and fearing that sharp eyes would pierce the thin disguise of cambric and merino which hid their booty the little sinners attached themselves to dranpa who his spectacles on amy who was handed about like refreshments returned to the parlor on father arm the others paired off as before and this arrangement left jo companionless she did not mind it at the minute for she lingered to answer eager inquiry 
 will miss amy ride in her coop coupe and use all them lovely silver dishes stored away over yander 
 wonder if she drove six white horses ate off gold plate and wore diamonds and point lace every day teddy thinks nothing too good for her returned jo with infinite satisfaction 
 no more there is will you have hash or fishballs for breakfast asked hannah who wisely mingled poetry and prose 
 i care and jo shut the door feeling that food was an uncongenial topic just then she stood a minute looking at the party vanishing above and as short plaid legs toiled up the last stair a sudden sense of lonliness came over her so strongly that she looked about her with dim eyes as if to find something to lean upon for even teddy had deserted her if she had known what birthday gift was coming every minute nearer and nearer she would not have said to herself weep a little weep when i go to bed it do to be dismal now then she drew her hand over her eyes for one of her boyish habits was never to know where her handkerchief was and had just managed to call up a smile when there came a knock at the porch door 
 she opened with hospitable haste and started as if another ghost had come to surprise her for there stood a tall bearded gentleman beaming on her from the darkness like a midnight sun 
 oh mr bhaer i am so glad to see you cried jo with a clutch as if she feared the night would swallow him up before she could get him in 
 and i to see miss marsch but no you haf a party and the professor paused as the sound of voices and the tap of dancing feet came down to them 
 no we only the family my sister and friends have just come home and we are all very happy come in and make one of us 
 though a very social man i think mr bhaer would have gone decorously away and come again another day but how could he when jo shut the door behind him and bereft him of his hat perhaps her face had something to do with it for she forgot to hide her joy at seeing him and showed it with a frankness that proved irresistible to the solitary man whose welcome far exceeded his boldest hopes 
 if i shall not be monsieur de trop i will so gladly see them all you haf been ill my friend 
 he put the question abruptly for as jo hung up his coat the light fell on her face and he saw a change in it 
 not ill but tired and sorrowful we have had trouble since i saw you last 
 ah yes i know my heart was sore for you when i heard that and he shook hands again with such a sympathetic face that jo felt as if no comfort could equal the look of the kind eyes the grasp of the big warm hand 
 father mother this is my friend professor bhaer she said with a face and tone of such irrepressible pride and pleasure that she might as well have blown a trumpet and opened the door with a flourish 
 if the stranger had any doubts about his reception they were set at rest in a minute by the cordial welcome he received everyone greeted him kindly for sake at first but very soon they liked him for his own they could not help it for he carried the talisman that opens all hearts and these simple people warmed to him at once feeling even the more friendly because he was poor for poverty enriches those who live above it and is a sure passport to truly hospitable spirits mr bhaer sat looking about him with the air of a traveler who knocks at a strange door and when it opens finds himself at home the children went to him like bees to a honeypot and establishing themselves on each knee proceeded to captivate him by rifling his pockets pulling his beard and investigating his watch with juvenile audacity the women telegraphed their approval to one another and mr march feeling that he had got a kindred spirit opened his choicest stores for his benefit while silent john listened and enjoyed the talk but said not a word and mr laurence found it impossible to go to sleep 
 if jo had not been otherwise engaged behavior would have amused her for a faint twinge not of jealousy but something like suspicion caused that gentleman to stand aloof at first and observe the newcomer with brotherly circumspection but it did not last long he got interested in spite of himself and before he knew it was drawn into the circle for mr bhaer talked well in this genial atmosphere and did himself justice he seldom spoke to laurie but he looked at him often and a shadow would pass across his face as if regretting his own lost youth as he watched the young man in his prime then his eyes would turn to jo so wistfully that she would have surely answered the mute inquiry if she had seen it but jo had her own eyes to take care of and feeling that they could not be trusted she prudently kept them on the little sock she was knitting like a model maiden aunt 
 a stealthy glance now and then refreshed her like sips of fresh water after a dusty walk for the sidelong peeps showed her several propitious omens mr face had lost the expression and looked all alive with interest in the present moment actually young and handsome she thought forgetting to compare him with laurie as she usually did strange men to their great detriment then he seemed quite inspired though the burial customs of the ancients to which the conversation had strayed might not be considered an exhilarating topic jo quite glowed with triumph when teddy got quenched in an argument and thought to herself as she watched her absorbed face how he would enjoy having such a man as my professor to talk with every day lastly mr bhaer was dressed in a new suit of black which made him look more like a gentleman than ever his bushy hair had been cut and smoothly brushed but stay in order long for in exciting moments he rumpled it up in the droll way he used to do and jo liked it rampantly erect better than flat because she thought it gave his fine forehead a aspect poor jo how she did glorify that plain man as she sat knitting away so quietly yet letting nothing escape her not even the fact that mr bhaer actually had gold in his immaculate wristbands 
 dear old fellow he have got himself up with more care if been going said jo to herself and then a sudden thought born of the words made her blush so dreadfully that she had to drop her ball and go down after it to hide her face 
 the maneuver did not succeed as well as she expected however for though just in the act of setting fire to a funeral pyre the professor dropped his torch metaphorically speaking and made a dive after the little blue ball of course they bumped their heads smartly together saw stars and both came up flushed and laughing without the ball to resume their seats wishing they had not left them 
 nobody knew where the evening went to for hannah skillfully abstracted the babies at an early hour nodding like two rosy poppies and mr laurence went home to rest the others sat round the fire talking away utterly regardless of the lapse of time till meg whose maternal was impressed with a firm conviction that daisy had tumbled out of be and demi set his nightgown afire studying the structure of matches made a move to go 
 we must have our sing in the good old way for we are all together again once more said jo feeling that a good shout would be a safe and pleasant vent for the jubilant emotions of her soul 
 they were not all there but no one found the words thougtless or untrue for beth still seemed among them a peaceful presence invisible but dearer than ever since death could not break the household league that love made disoluble the little chair stood in its old place the tidy basket with the bit of work she left unfinished when the needle grew so heavy was still on its accustomed shelf the beloved instrument seldom touched now had not been moved and above it face serene and smiling as in the early days looked down upon them seeming to say be happy i am here 
 play something amy let them hear how much you have improved said laurie with pardonable pride in his promising pupil 
 but amy whispered with full eyes as she twirled the faded stool not tonight dear i show off tonight 
 but she did show something better than brilliancy or skill for she sang songs with a tender music in her voice which the best master could not have taught and touched the hearts with a sweeter power than any other inspiration could have given her the room was very still when the clear voice failed suddenly at the last line of favorite hymn it was hard to say 
 earth hath no sorrow that heaven cannot heal 
 and amy leaned against her husband who stood behind her feeling that her welcome home was not quite perfect without kiss 
 now we must finish with song for mr bhaer sings that said jo before the pause grew painful and mr bhaer cleared his throat with a gratified hem as he stepped into the corner where jo stood saying 
 you will sing with me we go excellently well together 
 a pleasing fiction by the way for jo had no more idea of 
 music than a grasshopper but she would have consented if he had 
 proposed to sing a whole opera and warbled away blissfully regardless 
 of time and tune it much matter for mr bhaer 
 sang like a true german heartily and well and jo soon subsided 
 into a subdued hum that she might listen to the mellow voice that 
 seemed to sing for her alone 
 thou the land where the citron blooms 
 used to be the favorite line for das land meant germany to him but now he seemed to dwell with peculiar warmth and melody upon the words 
 
 there oh there might i with thee o my beloved go and one listener was so thrilled by the tender invitation that she longed to say she did know the land and would joyfully depart thither whenever he liked the song was considered a great success and the singer retired covered with laurels but a few minutes afterward he forgot his manners entirely and stared at amy putting on her bonnet for she had been introduced simply as my sister and on one had called her by her new name since her came he forgot himself still further when laurie said in his most gracious manner at parting 
 my wife and i are very glad to meet you sir please remember that there is always a welcome waiting for you over the way 
 then the professor thanked him so heartily and looked so suddenly illuminated with satisfaction that laurie thought him the most delightfully demonstrative old fellow he ever met 
 i too shall go but i shall gladly come again if you will gif me leave dear madame for a little business in the city will keep me here some days 
 he spoke to mrs march but he looked at jo and the voice gave as cordial an assent as did the eyes for mrs march was not so blind to her interest as mrs moffat supposed 
 i suspect that is a wise man remarked mr march with placid satisfaction from the hearthrug after the last guest had gone 
 i know he is a good one added mrs march with decided approval as she wound up the clock 
 i thought like him was all jo said as she slipped away to her bed 
 she wondered what the business was that brought mr bhaer to the city and finally decided that he had been appointed to some great honor somewhere but had been too modest to mention the fact if she had seen his face when safe in his own room he looked at the picture of a severe and rigid young lady with a good deal of hair who appeared to be gazing darkly into futurity it might have thrown some light upon the subject especially when he turned off the gas and kissed the picture in the dark

 fairy tales of hans christian andersen 
 the daisy 
 by hans christian andersen 
 
 now listen in the country close by the high road stood a 
 farmhouse perhaps you have passed by and seen it yourself there 
 was a little flower garden with painted wooden palings in front of it 
 close by was a ditch on its fresh green bank grew a little daisy the 
 sun shone as warmly and brightly upon it as on the magnificent 
 garden flowers and therefore it thrived well one morning it had 
 quite opened and its little petals stood round the 
 yellow centre like the rays of the sun it did not mind that nobody 
 saw it in the grass and that it was a poor despised flower on the 
 contrary it was quite happy and turned towards the sun looking 
 upward and listening to the song of the lark high up in the air 
 
 the little daisy was as happy as if the day had been a great 
 holiday but it was only monday all the children were at school 
 and while they were sitting on the forms and learning their lessons 
 it sat on its thin green stalk and learnt from the sun and from its 
 surroundings how kind god is and it rejoiced that the song of the 
 little lark expressed so sweetly and distinctly its own feelings with 
 a sort of reverence the daisy looked up to the bird that could fly and 
 sing but it did not feel envious i can see and hear it thought 
 the sun shines upon me and the forest kisses me how rich i am 
 in the garden close by grew many large and magnificent flowers 
 and strange to say the less fragrance they had the haughtier and 
 prouder they were the peonies puffed themselves up in order to be 
 larger than the roses but size is not everything the tulips had 
 the finest colours and they knew it well too for they were standing 
 bolt upright like candles that one might see them the better in 
 their pride they did not see the little daisy which looked over to 
 them and thought how rich and beautiful they are i am sure the 
 pretty bird will fly down and call upon them thank god that i 
 stand so near and can at least see all the splendour and while the 
 daisy was still thinking the lark came flying down crying tweet 
 but not to the peonies and tulips no into the grass to the poor 
 daisy its joy was so great that it did not know what to think the 
 little bird hopped round it and sang how beautifully soft the 
 grass is and what a lovely little flower with its golden heart and 
 silver dress is growing here the yellow centre in the daisy did 
 indeed look like gold while the little petals shone as brightly as 
 silver 
 
 how happy the daisy was no one has the least idea the bird 
 kissed it with its beak sang to it and then rose again up to the 
 blue sky it was certainly more than a quarter of an hour before the 
 daisy recovered its senses half ashamed yet glad at heart it looked 
 over to the other flowers in the garden surely they had witnessed its 
 pleasure and the honour that had been done to it they understood 
 its joy but the tulips stood more stiffly than ever their faces were 
 pointed and red because they were vexed the peonies were sulky it 
 was well that they could not speak otherwise they would have given 
 the daisy a good lecture the little flower could very well see that 
 they were ill at ease and pitied them sincerely 
 
 shortly after this a girl came into the garden with a large sharp 
 knife she went to the tulips and began cutting them off one after 
 another ugh sighed the daisy that is terrible now they are done 
 for 
 
 the girl carried the tulips away the daisy was glad that it was 
 outside and only a small flower it felt very grateful at sunset 
 it folded its petals and fell asleep and dreamt all night of the sun 
 and the little bird 
 
 on the following morning when the flower once more stretched 
 forth its tender petals like little arms towards the air and 
 light the daisy recognised the voice but what it sang sounded 
 so sad indeed the poor bird had good reason to be sad for it had 
 been caught and put into a cage close by the open window it sang of 
 the happy days when it could merrily fly about of fresh green corn in 
 the fields and of the time when it could soar almost up to the 
 clouds the poor lark was most unhappy as a prisoner in a cage the 
 little daisy would have liked so much to help it but what could be 
 done indeed that was very difficult for such a small flower to 
 find out it entirely forgot how beautiful everything around it was 
 how warmly the sun was shining and how splendidly white its own 
 petals were it could only think of the poor captive bird for which 
 it could do nothing then two little boys came out of the garden 
 one of them had a large sharp knife like that with which the girl had 
 cut the tulips they came straight towards the little daisy which 
 could not understand what they wanted 
 
 here is a fine piece of turf for the lark said one of the boys 
 and began to cut out a square round the daisy so that it remained 
 in the centre of the grass 
 
 pluck the flower off said the other boy and the daisy 
 trembled for fear for to be pulled off meant death to it and it 
 wished so much to live as it was to go with the square of turf into 
 the poor captive cage 
 
 no let it stay said the other boy it looks so pretty 
 
 and so it stayed and was brought into the cage the poor 
 bird was lamenting its lost liberty and beating its wings against the 
 wires and the little daisy could not speak or utter a consoling word 
 much as it would have liked to do so so the forenoon passed 
 i have no water said the captive lark they have all gone out 
 and forgotten to give me anything to drink my throat is dry and 
 burning i feel as if i had fire and ice within me and the air is 
 so oppressive alas i must die and part with the warm sunshine 
 the fresh green meadows and all the beauty that god has created 
 and it thrust its beak into the piece of grass to refresh itself a 
 little then it noticed the little daisy and nodded to it and kissed 
 it with its beak and said you must also fade in here poor little 
 flower you and the piece of grass are all they have given me in 
 exchange for the whole world which i enjoyed outside each little 
 blade of grass shall be a green tree for me each of your white petals 
 a fragrant flower alas you only remind me of what i have lost 
 i wish i could console the poor lark thought the daisy it 
 could not move one of its leaves but the fragrance of its delicate 
 petals streamed forth and was much stronger than such flowers usually have the bird noticed it although it was dying with thirst and in its pain tore up the green blades of grass but did not touch the 
 flower 
 
 the evening came and nobody appeared to bring the poor bird a 
 drop of water it opened its beautiful wings and fluttered about in 
 its anguish a faint and mournful tweet tweet was all it could 
 utter then it bent its little head towards the flower and its 
 heart broke for want and longing the flower could not as on the 
 previous evening fold up its petals and sleep it dropped 
 sorrowfully the boys only came the next morning when they saw the dead bird they began to cry bitterly dug a nice grave for it and 
 adorned it with flowers the body was placed in a pretty red 
 box they wished to bury it with royal honours while it was alive and 
 sang they forgot it and let it suffer want in the cage now they 
 cried over it and covered it with flowers the piece of turf with the 
 little daisy in it was thrown out on the dusty highway nobody 
 thought of the flower which had felt so much for the bird and had so

 fairy tales of hans christian andersen 
 the daisy 
 by hans christian andersen 
 
 now listen in the country close by the high road stood a 
 farmhouse perhaps you have passed by and seen it yourself there 
 was a little flower garden with painted wooden palings in front of it 
 close by was a ditch on its fresh green bank grew a little daisy the 
 sun shone as warmly and brightly upon it as on the magnificent 
 garden flowers and therefore it thrived well one morning it had 
 quite opened and its little petals stood round the 
 yellow centre like the rays of the sun it did not mind that nobody 
 saw it in the grass and that it was a poor despised flower on the 
 contrary it was quite happy and turned towards the sun looking 
 upward and listening to the song of the lark high up in the air 
 
 the little daisy was as happy as if the day had been a great 
 holiday but it was only monday all the children were at school 
 and while they were sitting on the forms and learning their lessons 
 it sat on its thin green stalk and learnt from the sun and from its 
 surroundings how kind god is and it rejoiced that the song of the 
 little lark expressed so sweetly and distinctly its own feelings with 
 a sort of reverence the daisy looked up to the bird that could fly and 
 sing but it did not feel envious i can see and hear it thought 
 the sun shines upon me and the forest kisses me how rich i am 
 in the garden close by grew many large and magnificent flowers 
 and strange to say the less fragrance they had the haughtier and 
 prouder they were the peonies puffed themselves up in order to be 
 larger than the roses but size is not everything the tulips had 
 the finest colours and they knew it well too for they were standing 
 bolt upright like candles that one might see them the better in 
 their pride they did not see the little daisy which looked over to 
 them and thought how rich and beautiful they are i am sure the 
 pretty bird will fly down and call upon them thank god that i 
 stand so near and can at least see all the splendour and while the 
 daisy was still thinking the lark came flying down crying tweet 
 but not to the peonies and tulips no into the grass to the poor 
 daisy its joy was so great that it did not know what to think the 
 little bird hopped round it and sang how beautifully soft the 
 grass is and what a lovely little flower with its golden heart and 
 silver dress is growing here the yellow centre in the daisy did 
 indeed look like gold while the little petals shone as brightly as 
 silver 
 
 how happy the daisy was no one has the least idea the bird 
 kissed it with its beak sang to it and then rose again up to the 
 blue sky it was certainly more than a quarter of an hour before the 
 daisy recovered its senses half ashamed yet glad at heart it looked 
 over to the other flowers in the garden surely they had witnessed its 
 pleasure and the honour that had been done to it they understood 
 its joy but the tulips stood more stiffly than ever their faces were 
 pointed and red because they were vexed the peonies were sulky it 
 was well that they could not speak otherwise they would have given 
 the daisy a good lecture the little flower could very well see that 
 they were ill at ease and pitied them sincerely 
 
 shortly after this a girl came into the garden with a large sharp 
 knife she went to the tulips and began cutting them off one after 
 another ugh sighed the daisy that is terrible now they are done 
 for 
 
 the girl carried the tulips away the daisy was glad that it was 
 outside and only a small flower it felt very grateful at sunset 
 it folded its petals and fell asleep and dreamt all night of the sun 
 and the little bird 
 
 on the following morning when the flower once more stretched 
 forth its tender petals like little arms towards the air and 
 light the daisy recognised the voice but what it sang sounded 
 so sad indeed the poor bird had good reason to be sad for it had 
 been caught and put into a cage close by the open window it sang of 
 the happy days when it could merrily fly about of fresh green corn in 
 the fields and of the time when it could soar almost up to the 
 clouds the poor lark was most unhappy as a prisoner in a cage the 
 little daisy would have liked so much to help it but what could be 
 done indeed that was very difficult for such a small flower to 
 find out it entirely forgot how beautiful everything around it was 
 how warmly the sun was shining and how splendidly white its own 
 petals were it could only think of the poor captive bird for which 
 it could do nothing then two little boys came out of the garden 
 one of them had a large sharp knife like that with which the girl had 
 cut the tulips they came straight towards the little daisy which 
 could not understand what they wanted 
 
 here is a fine piece of turf for the lark said one of the boys 
 and began to cut out a square round the daisy so that it remained 
 in the centre of the grass 
 
 pluck the flower off said the other boy and the daisy 
 trembled for fear for to be pulled off meant death to it and it 
 wished so much to live as it was to go with the square of turf into 
 the poor captive cage 
 
 no let it stay said the other boy it looks so pretty 
 
 and so it stayed and was brought into the cage the poor 
 bird was lamenting its lost liberty and beating its wings against the 
 wires and the little daisy could not speak or utter a consoling word 
 much as it would have liked to do so so the forenoon passed 
 i have no water said the captive lark they have all gone out 
 and forgotten to give me anything to drink my throat is dry and 
 burning i feel as if i had fire and ice within me and the air is 
 so oppressive alas i must die and part with the warm sunshine 
 the fresh green meadows and all the beauty that god has created 
 and it thrust its beak into the piece of grass to refresh itself a 
 little then it noticed the little daisy and nodded to it and kissed 
 it with its beak and said you must also fade in here poor little 
 flower you and the piece of grass are all they have given me in 
 exchange for the whole world which i enjoyed outside each little 
 blade of grass shall be a green tree for me each of your white petals 
 a fragrant flower alas you only remind me of what i have lost

 of deformity 
 deformed persons are commonly even with nature for as nature hath done ill by them so do they by nature being for the most part as die scripture saith void of natural affection and so they have their revenge of nature certainly there is a consent between the body and the mind and where nature erreth in the one she ventureth in the other but because there is in man an election touching the frame of his mind and a necessity in the frame of his body the stars of natural inclination are sometimes obscured by the sun of discipline and virtue 
 
 therefore it is good to consider of deformity not as a sign which is more deceivable but as a cause which seldom failed of the effect whosoever hath anything fixed in his person thafdoth induce contempt hath also a perpetual spur in himself to rescue and deliver himself from scorn therefore all deformed persons are extreme bold 
 first as in their own defence as being exposed to scorn but in process of time by a general habit also it stirreth in hem industry and especially of this kind to watch and observe the weakness of others that they may have somewhat to repay 
 again in their superiors it quencheth jealousy towards them as persons that they mink they may at pleasure despise and it layeth their competitors and emulators asleep as never believing they should be in possibility of advancement till they see them in possession so that upon the matter in a great wit deformity is an advantage to rising kings in ancient times and at this present in some countries were wont to put great trust in eunuchs because they that are envious towards all are more obnoxious and officious towards one but yet their trust towards them hath rather been as to good spials and good whisperers man good magistrates and officers 
 and much like is the reason of deformed persons still the ground is they will if they be of spirit seek to free themselves from scorn which must be either by virtue or malice and therefore let it not be marvelled if sometimes they prove excellent persons as was agesilaus zanger the son of solyman aesop gasca president of peru and socrates may go likewise amongst them with others

 m madeleine in mourning 
 at the beginning of the newspapers announced the death of m myriel bishop of d surnamed monseigneur bienvenu who had died in the odor of sanctity at the age of 
 the bishop of d to supply here a detail which the papers omitted had been blind for many years before his death and content to be blind as his sister was beside him 
 let us remark by the way that to be blind and to be loved is in fact one of the most strangely exquisite forms of happiness upon this earth where nothing is complete 
 to have continually at side a woman a daughter a sister a charming being who is there because you need her and because she cannot do without you to know that we are indispensable to a person who is necessary to us to be able to incessantly measure affection by the amount of her presence which she bestows on us and to say to ourselves since she consecrates the whole of her time to me it is because i possess the whole of her heart to behold her thought in lieu of her face to be able to verify the fidelity of one being amid the eclipse of the world to regard the rustle of a gown as the sound of wings to hear her come and go retire speak return sing and to think that one is the centre of these steps of this speech to manifest at each instant personal attraction to feel self all the more powerful because of infirmity to become in obscurity and through obscurity the star around which this angel felicities equal this the supreme happiness of life consists in the conviction that one is loved loved for own us say rather loved in spite of self this conviction the blind man possesses to be served in distress is to be caressed 
 does he lack anything no one does not lose the sight when one has love 
 and what love a love wholly constituted of virtue 
 there is no blindness where there is certainty 
 soul seeks soul gropingly and finds it and this soul found and tested is a woman 
 a hand sustains you it is hers 
 a mouth lightly touches your brow it is her mouth you hear a breath very near you it is hers 
 to have everything of her from her worship to her pity never to be left to have that sweet weakness aiding you to lean upon that immovable reed to touch providence with hands and to be able to take it in made bliss 
 the heart that obscure celestial flower undergoes a mysterious blossoming one would not exchange that shadow for all brightness the angel soul is there uninterruptedly there if she departs it is but to return again she vanishes like a dream and reappears like reality 
 one feels warmth approaching and behold she is there one overflows with serenity with gayety with ecstasy one is a radiance amid the night 
 and there are a thousand little cares nothings which are enormous in that void 
 the most ineffable accents of the feminine voice employed to lull you and supplying the vanished universe to you 
 one is caressed with the soul one sees nothing but one feels that one is adored 
 it is a paradise of shadows 
 it was from this paradise that monseigneur welcome had passed to the other 
 the announcement of his death was reprinted by the local journal of m sur m on the following day m madeleine appeared clad wholly in black and with crape on his hat 
 this mourning was noticed in the town and commented on 
 it seemed to throw a light on m origin 
 it was concluded that some relationship existed between him and the venerable bishop 
 he has gone into mourning for the bishop of d said the this raised m credit greatly and procured for him instantly and at one blow a certain consideration in the noble world of m sur m the microscopic faubourg of the place meditated raising the quarantine against m madeleine the probable relative of a bishop 
 m madeleine perceived the advancement which he had obtained by the more numerous courtesies of the old women and the more plentiful smiles of the young ones one evening a ruler in that petty great world who was curious by right of seniority ventured to ask him m le maire is doubtless a cousin of the late bishop of d 
 he said no madame 
 but resumed the dowager you are wearing mourning for him 
 he replied it is because i was a servant in his family in my youth 
 another thing which was remarked was that every time that he encountered in the town a young savoyard who was roaming about the country and seeking chimneys to sweep the mayor had him summoned inquired his name and gave him money 
 the little savoyards told each other about it 
 a great many of them passed that way

 having ridden round the whole line from right flank to left prince andrew made his way up to the battery from which the staff officer had told him the whole field could be seen here he dismounted and stopped beside the farthest of the four unlimbered cannon before the guns an artillery sentry was pacing up and down he stood at attention when the officer arrived but at a sign resumed his measured monotonous pacing behind the guns were their limbers and still farther back picket ropes and bonfires to the left not far from the farthest cannon was a small newly constructed wattle shed from which came the sound of officers voices in eager conversation 
 it was true that a view over nearly the whole russian position and the greater part of the opened out from this battery just facing it on the crest of the opposite hill the village of schon grabern could be seen and in three places to left and right the french troops amid the smoke of their campfires the greater part of whom were evidently in the village itself and behind the hill to the left from that village amid the smoke was something resembling a battery but it was impossible to see it clearly with the naked eye our right flank was posted on a rather steep incline which dominated the french position our infantry were stationed there and at the farthest point the dragoons in the center where battery stood and from which prince andrew was surveying the position was the easiest and most direct descent and ascent to the brook separating us from schon grabern on the left our troops were close to a copse in which smoked the bonfires of our infantry who were felling wood the french line was wider than ours and it was plain that they could easily outflank us on both sides behind our position was a steep and deep dip making it difficult for artillery and cavalry to retire prince andrew took out his notebook and leaning on the cannon sketched a plan of the position he made some notes on two points intending to mention them to bagration his idea was first to concentrate all the artillery in the center and secondly to withdraw the cavalry to the other side of the dip prince andrew being always near the commander in chief closely following the mass movements and general orders and constantly studying historical accounts of battles involuntarily pictured to himself the course of events in the forthcoming action in broad outline he imagined only important possibilities if the enemy attacks the right flank he said to himself the kiev grenadiers and the podolsk chasseurs must hold their position till reserves from the center come up in that case the dragoons could successfully make a flank counterattack if they attack our center we having the center battery on this high ground shall withdraw the left flank under its cover and retreat to the dip by echelons so he reasoned all the time he had been beside the gun he had heard the voices of the officers distinctly but as often happens had not understood a word of what they were saying suddenly however he was struck by a voice coming from the shed and its tone was so sincere that he could not but listen 
 no friend said a pleasant and as it seemed to prince andrew a familiar voice what i say is that if it were possible to know what is beyond death none of us would be afraid of it so friend 
 another a younger voice interrupted him afraid or not you escape it anyhow 
 all the same one is afraid oh you clever people said a third manly voice interrupting them both of course you artillery men are very wise because you can take everything along with you vodka and snacks 
 and the owner of the manly voice evidently an infantry officer laughed 
 yes one is afraid continued the first speaker he of the familiar voice one is afraid of the unknown what it is whatever we may say about the soul going to the sky we know there is no sky but only an atmosphere 
 the manly voice again interrupted the artillery officer 
 well stand us some of your herb vodka tushin it said 
 why thought prince andrew the captain who stood up in the hut without his boots he recognized the agreeable philosophizing voice with pleasure 
 some herb vodka certainly said tushin but still to conceive a future life 
 he did not finish just then there was a whistle in the air nearer and nearer faster and louder louder and faster a cannon ball as if it had not finished saying what was necessary thudded into the ground near the shed with super human force throwing up a mass of earth the ground seemed to groan at the terrible impact 
 and immediately tushin with a short pipe in the corner of his mouth and his kind intelligent face rather pale rushed out of the shed followed by the owner of the manly voice a dashing infantry officer who hurried off to his company buttoning up his coat as he ran

 certainly go dear i forgot that you have any home but this and mrs march pressed the white hand that wore the wedding ring as if asking pardon for her maternal covetousness 
 i have come over if i could have helped it but i get on without my little woman any more than a 
 weathercock can without the wind suggested jo as he paused for a simile jo had grown quite her own saucy self again since teddy came home 
 exactly for amy keeps me pointing due west most of the time with only an occasional whiffle round to the south and i had an easterly spell since i was married know anything about the north but am altogether salubrious and balmy hey my lady 
 lovely weather so far i know how long it will last but not afraid of storms for learning how to sail my ship come home dear and find your bootjack i suppose what you are rummaging after among my things men are so helpless mother said amy with a matronly air which delighted her husband 
 what are you going to do with yourselves after you get settled asked jo buttoning cloak as she used to button her pinafores 
 we have our plans we mean to say much about them yet because we are such very new brooms but we intend to be idle going into business with a devotion that shall delight grandfather and prove to him that not spoiled i need something of the sort to keep me steady tired of dawdling and mean to work like a man 
 and amy what is she going to do asked mrs march well pleased at decision and the energy with which he spoke 
 after doing the civil all round and airing our best bonnet we shall astonish you by the elegant hospitalities of our mansion the brilliant society we shall draw about us and the beneficial influence we shall exert over the world at large about it it madame recamier asked laurie with a quizzical look at amy 
 time will show come away impertinence and shock my family by calling me names before their faces answered amy resolving that there should be a home with a good wife in it before she set up a salon as a queen of society 
 how happy those children seem together observed mr march finding it difficult to become absorbed in his aristotle after the young couple had gone 
 yes and i think it will last added mrs march with the restful expression of a pilot who has brought a ship safely into port 
 i know it will happy amy and jo sighed then smiled brightly as professor bhaer opened the gate with an impatient push 
 later in the evening when his mind had been set at rest about the bootjack laurie said suddenly to his wife mrs laurence 
 my lord 
 that man intends to marry our jo 
 i hope so you dear 
 well my love i consider him a trump in the fullest sense of that expressive word but i do wish he was a little younger and a good deal richer

 yes and i think it will last added mrs march with the restful expression of a pilot who has brought a ship safely into port 
 i know it will happy amy and jo sighed then smiled brightly as professor bhaer opened the gate with an impatient push

 fairy tales of hans christian andersen 
 the 
 by hans christian andersen 
 
 there was once a who thought herself so fine that 
 she fancied she must be fit for embroidery hold me tight she would say to the fingers when they took her up let me fall if 
 you do i shall never be found again i am so very fine 
 
 that is your opinion is it said the fingers as they seized 
 her round the body 
 
 see i am coming with a train said the 
 drawing a long thread after her but there was no knot in the thread 
 the fingers then placed the point of the needle against the 
 slipper there was a crack in the upper leather which had to be 
 sewn together 
 
 what coarse work said the i shall never get 
 through i shall break i am breaking and sure enough she broke 
 
 did i not say so said the i know i am too fine for 
 such work as that 
 
 this needle is quite useless for sewing now said the fingers 
 but they still held it fast and the cook dropped some 
 on the needle and fastened her handkerchief with it in front 
 
 so now i am a said the i knew 
 very well i should come to honor some day merit is sure to rise and 
 she laughed quietly to herself for of course no one ever saw a 
 laugh and there she sat as proudly as if she were in a 
 state coach and looked all around her may i be allowed to ask if 
 you are made of gold she inquired of her neighbor a pin you 
 have a very pretty appearance and a curious head although you are 
 rather small you must take pains to grow for it is not every one who 
 has dropped upon him and as she spoke the 
 drew herself up so proudly that she fell out of the 
 handkerchief right into the sink which the cook was cleaning now 
 i am going on a journey said the needle as she floated away with 
 the dirty water i do hope i shall not be lost but she really was 
 lost in a gutter i am too fine for this world said the 
 as she lay in the gutter but i know who i am and 
 that is always some comfort so the kept up her 
 proud behavior and did not lose her good humor then there floated 
 over her all sorts of things chips and straws and pieces of old 
 newspaper see how they sail said the they do 
 not know what is under them i am here and here i shall stick see 
 there goes a chip thinking of nothing in the world but himself 
 only a chip a straw going by now how he turns and twists 
 about be thinking too much of yourself or you may chance to 
 run against a stone there swims a piece of newspaper what is written upon it has been forgotten long ago and yet it gives itself airs i sit here patiently and quietly i know who i am so i shall not move 
 
 one day something lying close to the glittered so 
 splendidly that she thought it was a diamond yet it was only a 
 piece of broken bottle the spoke to it because it 
 sparkled and represented herself as a i suppose you 
 are really a diamond she said 
 
 why yes something of the kind he replied and so each believed 
 the other to be very valuable and then they began to talk about the 
 world and the conceited people in it 
 
 i have been in a said the 
 and this lady was the cook she had on each hand five fingers and 
 anything so conceited as these five fingers i have never seen and yet 
 they were only employed to take me out of the box and to put me back again 
 
 were they not 
 
 said the no indeed but so 
 haughty they were five brothers all born fingers they kept very 
 proudly together though they were of different lengths the one who 
 stood first in the rank was named the thumb he was short and thick 
 and had only one joint in his back and could therefore make but one 
 bow but he said that if he were cut off from a hand that man 
 would be unfit for a soldier his neighbor dipped 
 himself into sweet or sour pointed to the sun and moon and formed 
 the letters when the fingers wrote longman the middle finger looked 
 over the heads of all the others the next finger wore a 
 golden circle round his waist and little playman did nothing at 
 all and seemed proud of it they were boasters and boasters they 
 will remain and therefore i left them 
 
 and now we sit here and glitter said the piece of broken bottle 
 
 at the same moment more water streamed into the gutter so that it 
 overflowed and the piece of bottle was carried away 
 
 so he is promoted said the while i remain 
 here i am too fine but that is my pride and what do i care and so 
 she sat there in her pride and had many such thoughts as these i 
 could almost fancy that i came from a sunbeam i am so fine it 
 seems as if the sunbeams were always looking for me under the water 
 
 ah i am so fine that even my mother cannot find me had i still my 
 old eye which was broken off i believe i should weep but no i 
 would not do that it is not genteel to cry 
 
 one day a couple of street boys were paddling in the gutter for 
 they sometimes found old nails farthings and other treasures it was 
 dirty work but they took great pleasure in it hallo cried one as 
 he pricked himself with the a fellow for you 
 i am not a fellow i am a young lady said the 
 but no one heard her 
 
 the had come off and she was quite black but black 
 makes a person look slender so she thought herself even finer than 
 before 
 
 here comes an sailing along said one of the boys 
 so they stuck the into the 
 
 white walls and i am black myself said the 
 that looks well now i can be seen but i hope i shall not be 
 or i shall break again she was not and she did 
 not break it is a good thing against to have a steel 
 stomach and not to forget own importance now my has past delicate people can bear a great deal 
 
 crack went the as a waggon passed over it good 
 heavens how it crushes said the i shall be sick

 of building 
 houses are built to live in and not to look on therefore let use be preferred before 
 uniformity except where both may be had leave the goodly fabrics of houses for 
 beauty only to the enchanted palaces of the poets who build them wilh small cost 
 he that builds a fair house upon an ill seat committeth himself to prison neither 
 do i reckon it an ill seat only where the air is unwholesome but likewise where the 
 air is unequal as you shall see many fine seats set upon a knap of ground environed with higher hills round about it whereby the heat of the sun is pent in and the wind gathereth as in troubles so as you shall have and that suddenly as great diversity of heat and cold as if you dwelt in several places neither is it ill air 
 only that maketh an ill seat but ill ways ill markets and if you will consult 
 with momus ill neighbours 
 i speak not of many more want of water want of wood shade and shelter want of fruitfulness and mixture of grounds of several natures want of prospect want of level grounds want of places at some near distance for sports of hunting hawking and races too near the sea too remote having the commodity of navigable rivers or the discommodity of their overflowing too far off from great cities which may hinder business or too near them which lurcheth all provisions and maketh every thing dear where a man hath a great living laid together and where he is scanted all which as it is impossible perhaps to find together so it is good to know them and think of them that a man may take as many as he can and if he have several dwellings that he sort them so that what he wanteth in the one he may find in the other lucullus answered pompey well who when he saw his stately galleries and rooms so large and lightsome in one of his houses said 
 
 surely an excellent place for summer but how do you in winter 
 lucullus answered why do you not think me as wise as some fowl are that ever change their abode towards the winter 
 
 to pass from the seat to the house itself we will do as cicero doth in the art who writes books de oratore and a book he entitles orator whereof the former delivers the precepts of the art and the latter the perfection we will therefore describe a princely palace making a brief model thereof for it is strange to see now in europe such huge buildings as the vatican and escurial and some others be and yet scarce a very fair room in them 
 
 first therefore i say you cannot have a perfect palace except you have two several sides a side for me banquet as is spoken of in the book of hester and a side for the household the one for feasts and triumphs and the other for dwelling 
 i understand both these sides to be not only returns but parts of the front and to 
 be uniform without though severally partitioned within and to be on both sides of 
 a great and stately tower in the midst of the front that as it were joinefh them 
 together on either hand i would have on the side of the banquet in front one only 
 goodly room above stairs of some forty foot high and under it a room for a dressing or preparing place at times of triumphs on the other side which is the household side i wish it divided at the first into a hall and a chapel with a partition 
 between both of good state and bigness and those not to go all the length but 
 to have at the further end a winter and a summer parlour both fair and under these rooms a fair and large cellar sunk under ground and likewise some privy kitchens with butteries and pantries and the like 
 as for the tower i would have it two storeys of eighteen foot high a piece above the two wings and a goodly leads upon the top railed with statues interposed and the same tower to be divided into rooms as shall be thought fit the stairs likewise to the upper rooms let them be upon a fair open newel and finely railed in with images of wood cast into a brass colour and a very fair landing place at the top but this to be if you do not point any of the lower rooms for a dining place of servants for otherwise you shall have the servants dinner after your own for the steam of it will come up as in a tunnel 
 
 and so much for the front only i understand the height of the first stairs to be 
 sixteen foot which is the height of the lower room 
 
 beyond this front is there to be a fair court but three sides of it of a far lower 
 building than the front and in all the four comers of that 
 court fair staircases cast into turrets on the outside and not within the row 
 of buildings themselves but those towers are not to be of the height of the front 
 but rather proportionable to the lower building let the court not be paved for that 
 striketh up a great heat in summer and much cold in winter but only some side alleys with a cross and me quarters to graze being kept shorn but not too near shorn 
 the row of return on the banquet side let it be all stately galleries in which 
 galleries let there be three or four fine cupolas in me length of it placed at 
 equal distance and fine coloured windows of several works on the household side chambers of presence and ordinary entertainments with some and let all three sides be a double house without through lights on the sides that you may have rooms from the sun both for forenoon and afternoon cast it also that you may born for summer and winter shady for summer and warm for winter 
 
 you shall have sometimes fair houses so full of glass that one cannot tell where 
 to become to be out of the sun or cold for inbowed windows i hold them of good use in cities indeed upright do better in respect of the uniformity towards the street for they be pretty retiring places for conference and besides they keep

 of building 
 houses are built to live in and not to look on therefore let use be preferred before 
 uniformity except where both may be had leave the goodly fabrics of houses for 
 beauty only to the enchanted palaces of the poets who build them wilh small cost 
 he that builds a fair house upon an ill seat committeth himself to prison neither 
 do i reckon it an ill seat only where the air is unwholesome but likewise where the 
 air is unequal as you shall see many fine seats set upon a knap of ground environed with higher hills round about it whereby the heat of the sun is pent in and the wind gathereth as in troubles so as you shall have and that suddenly as great diversity of heat and cold as if you dwelt in several places neither is it ill air 
 only that maketh an ill seat but ill ways ill markets and if you will consult 
 with momus ill neighbours 
 i speak not of many more want of water want of wood shade and shelter want of fruitfulness and mixture of grounds of several natures want of prospect want of level grounds want of places at some near distance for sports of hunting hawking and races too near the sea too remote having the commodity of navigable rivers or the discommodity of their overflowing too far off from great cities which may hinder business or too near them which lurcheth all provisions and maketh every thing dear where a man hath a great living laid together and where he is scanted all which as it is impossible perhaps to find together so it is good to know them and think of them that a man may take as many as he can and if he have several dwellings that he sort them so that what he wanteth in the one he may find in the other lucullus answered pompey well who when he saw his stately galleries and rooms so large and lightsome in one of his houses said 
 
 surely an excellent place for summer but how do you in winter 
 lucullus answered why do you not think me as wise as some fowl are that ever change their abode towards the winter 
 
 to pass from the seat to the house itself we will do as cicero doth in the art who writes books de oratore and a book he entitles orator whereof the former delivers the precepts of the art and the latter the perfection we will therefore describe a princely palace making a brief model thereof for it is strange to see now in europe such huge buildings as the vatican and escurial and some others be and yet scarce a very fair room in them 
 
 first therefore i say you cannot have a perfect palace except you have two several sides a side for me banquet as is spoken of in the book of hester and a side for the household the one for feasts and triumphs and the other for dwelling 
 i understand both these sides to be not only returns but parts of the front and to 
 be uniform without though severally partitioned within and to be on both sides of 
 a great and stately tower in the midst of the front that as it were joinefh them 
 together on either hand i would have on the side of the banquet in front one only 
 goodly room above stairs of some forty foot high and under it a room for a dressing or preparing place at times of triumphs on the other side which is the household side i wish it divided at the first into a hall and a chapel with a partition 
 between both of good state and bigness and those not to go all the length but 
 to have at the further end a winter and a summer parlour both fair and under these rooms a fair and large cellar sunk under ground and likewise some privy kitchens with butteries and pantries and the like 
 as for the tower i would have it two storeys of eighteen foot high a piece above the two wings and a goodly leads upon the top railed with statues interposed and the same tower to be divided into rooms as shall be thought fit the stairs likewise to the upper rooms let them be upon a fair open newel and finely railed in with images of wood cast into a brass colour and a very fair landing place at the top but this to be if you do not point any of the lower rooms for a dining place of servants for otherwise you shall have the servants dinner after your own for the steam of it will come up as in a tunnel 
 
 and so much for the front only i understand the height of the first stairs to be 
 sixteen foot which is the height of the lower room 
 
 beyond this front is there to be a fair court but three sides of it of a far lower 
 building than the front and in all the four comers of that 
 court fair staircases cast into turrets on the outside and not within the row 
 of buildings themselves but those towers are not to be of the height of the front 
 but rather proportionable to the lower building let the court not be paved for that 
 striketh up a great heat in summer and much cold in winter but only some side alleys with a cross and me quarters to graze being kept shorn but not too near shorn 
 the row of return on the banquet side let it be all stately galleries in which 
 galleries let there be three or four fine cupolas in me length of it placed at 
 equal distance and fine coloured windows of several works on the household side chambers of presence and ordinary entertainments with some and let all three sides be a double house without through lights on the sides that you may have rooms from the sun both for forenoon and afternoon cast it also that you may born for summer and winter shady for summer and warm for winter 
 
 you shall have sometimes fair houses so full of glass that one cannot tell where 
 to become to be out of the sun or cold for inbowed windows i hold them of good use in cities indeed upright do better in respect of the uniformity towards the street for they be pretty retiring places for conference and besides they keep 
 both the wind and sun off for that which would strike almost through the room doth scarce pass the window but let them be but few four in the court on the sides only 
 
 beyond this court let there be an inward court of the same square and height which is to be environed with the garden on all sides and in the inside cloistered on all sides upon decent and beautiful arches as high as the first storey on the under storey towards the garden let it be turned to a grotto or place of shade or estivation and only have opening and windows towards the garden and be level upon the floor no whit sunk under ground to avoid all dampishness and let there be a fountain or some fair work of statues in the midst of this court and to be paved as the other court was these buildings to be for privy lodgings on both sides and the end for privy galleries 
 whereof you must foresee that one of them be for an infirmary if the prince or any special person should be sick with chambers antecamera and recamera joining to it this upon the second storey upon the ground storey a fair gallery open upon pillars and upon uie third storey likewise an open gallery upon pillars to take the prospect and freshness of the garden 
 at both comers of the further side by way of return let there be two delicate or rich cabinets daintily paved richly hanged glazed with crystalline glass and a rich cupola in die midst and all other elegancy that may be thought upon in the upper gallery too i wish that there may be if the place will yield it some fountains running in divers places from the wall with some fine avoidances and thus much for the model of the palace save that you must have before you come to the front three courts a green court plain with a wall about it a second court of the same but more garnished with little turrets or rather embellishments upon the wall and a third court to make a square with the front but not to be built nor yet enclosed with a naked wall but enclosed with terraces leaded aloft and fairly garnished on the three sides and cloistered on the inside with pillars and not with arches below

 book descent 
 chapter v 
 
 vague flashes on the horizon 
 little by little and in the course of time all this opposition subsided 
 there had at first been exercised against m madeleine in virtue of a sort of law which all those who rise must submit to blackening and calumnies then they grew to be nothing more than then merely malicious remarks then even this entirely disappeared respect became complete unanimous cordial and towards the moment arrived when the word monsieur le maire was pronounced at m sur m with almost the same accent as monseigneur the bishop had been pronounced in d in 
 people came from a distance of ten leagues around to consult m madeleine 
 he put an end to differences he prevented lawsuits he reconciled enemies every one took him for the judge and with good reason it seemed as though he had for a soul the book of the natural law it was like an epidemic of veneration which in the course of six or seven years gradually took possession of the whole district 
 one single man in the town in the arrondissement absolutely escaped this contagion and whatever father madeleine did remained his opponent as though a sort of incorruptible and imperturbable instinct kept him on the alert and uneasy 
 it seems in fact as though there existed in certain men a veritable bestial instinct though pure and upright like all instincts which creates antipathies and sympathies which fatally separates one nature from another nature which does not hesitate which feels no disquiet which does not hold its peace and which never belies itself clear in its obscurity infallible imperious intractable stubborn to all counsels of the intelligence and to all the dissolvents of reason and which in whatever manner destinies are arranged secretly warns the of the presence of the and the of the presence of the 
 it frequently happened that when m madeleine was passing along a street calm affectionate surrounded by the blessings of all a man of lofty stature clad in an armed with a heavy cane and wearing a battered hat turned round abruptly behind him and followed him with his eyes until he disappeared with folded arms and a slow shake of the head and his upper lip raised in company with his lower to his nose a sort of significant grimace which might be translated by 
 what is that man after all i certainly have seen him somewhere 
 in any case i am not his dupe 
 this person grave with a gravity which was almost menacing was one of those men who even when only seen by a rapid glimpse arrest the attention 
 his name was javert and he belonged to the police 
 at m sur m he exercised the unpleasant but useful functions of an inspector 
 he had not seen beginnings 
 javert owed the post which he occupied to the protection of m chabouillet the secretary of the minister of state comte angeles then prefect of police at paris 
 when javert arrived at m sur m the fortune of the great manufacturer was already made and father madeleine had become monsieur madeleine 
 certain police officers have a peculiar physiognomy which is complicated with an air of baseness mingled with an air of authority javert possessed this physiognomy minus the baseness 
 it is our conviction that if souls were visible to the eyes we should be able to see distinctly that strange thing that each one individual of the human race corresponds to some one of the species of the animal creation and we could easily recognize this truth hardly perceived by the thinker that from the oyster to the eagle from the pig to the tiger all animals exist in man and that each one of them is in a man 
 sometimes even several of them at a time 
 animals are nothing else than the figures of our virtues and our vices straying before our eyes the visible phantoms of our souls god shows them to us in order to induce us to reflect 
 only since animals are mere shadows god has not made them capable of education in the full sense of the word what is the use 
 on the contrary our souls being realities and having a goal which is appropriate to them god has bestowed on them intelligence that is to say the possibility of education 
 social education when well done can always draw from a soul of whatever sort it may be the utility which it contains 
 this be it said is of course from the restricted point of view of the terrestrial life which is apparent and without prejudging the profound question of the anterior or ulterior personality of the beings which are not man 
 the visible i in nowise authorizes the thinker to deny the latent i 
 having made this reservation let us pass on 
 now if the reader will admit for a moment with us that in every man there is one of the animal species of creation it will be easy for us to say what there was in police officer javert 
 the peasants of asturias are convinced that in every litter of wolves there is one dog which is killed by the mother because otherwise as he grew up he would devour the other little ones 
 give to this of a wolf a human face and the result will be javert 
 javert had been born in prison of a whose husband was in the galleys 
 as he grew up he thought that he was outside the pale of society and he despaired of ever it he observed that society unpardoningly excludes two classes of men those who attack it and those who guard it he had no choice except between these two classes at the same time he was conscious of an indescribable foundation of rigidity regularity and probity complicated with an inexpressible hatred for the race of bohemians whence he was sprung 
 he entered the police he succeeded there at forty years of age he was an inspector 
 during his youth he had been employed in the convict establishments of the south 
 before proceeding further let us come to an understanding as to the words human face which we have just applied to javert 
 the human face of javert consisted of a flat nose with two deep nostrils towards which enormous whiskers ascended on his cheeks one felt ill at ease when he saw these two forests and these two caverns for the first time 
 when javert his laugh was rare and thin lips parted and revealed to view not only his teeth but his gums and around his nose there formed a flattened and savage fold as on the muzzle of a wild beast javert serious was a watchdog when he laughed he was a tiger as for the rest he had very little skull and a great deal of jaw his hair concealed his forehead and fell over his eyebrows between his eyes there was a permanent central frown like an imprint of wrath his gaze was obscure his mouth pursed up and terrible his air that of ferocious command 
 this man was composed of two very simple and two very good sentiments comparatively but he rendered them almost bad by dint of exaggerating for authority hatred of rebellion and in his eyes murder robbery all crimes are only forms of rebellion 
 he enveloped in a blind and profound faith every one who had a function in the state from the prime minister to the rural policeman 
 he covered with scorn aversion and disgust every one who had once crossed the legal threshold of evil he was absolute and admitted no exceptions 
 on the one hand he said the functionary can make no mistake the magistrate is never the wrong 
 on the other hand he said these men are irremediably lost 
 nothing good can come from them 
 he fully shared the opinion of those extreme minds which attribute to human law i know not what power of making or if the reader will have it so of authenticating demons and who place a styx at the base of society 
 he was stoical serious austere a melancholy dreamer humble and haughty like fanatics 
 his glance was like a gimlet cold and piercing 
 his whole life hung on these two words watchfulness and supervision 
 he had introduced a straight line into what is the most crooked thing in the world he possessed the conscience of his usefulness the religion of his functions and he was a spy as other men are priests 
 woe to the man who fell into his hands 
 he would have arrested his own father if the latter had escaped from the galleys and would have denounced his mother if she had broken her ban 
 and he would have done it with that sort of inward satisfaction which is conferred by virtue 
 and withal a life of privation isolation abnegation chastity with never a diversion 
 it was implacable duty the police understood as the spartans understood sparta a pitiless lying in wait a ferocious honesty a marble informer brutus in vidocq 
 whole person was expressive of the man who spies and who withdraws himself from observation 
 the mystical school of joseph de maistre which at that epoch seasoned with lofty cosmogony those things which were called the ultra newspapers would not have failed to declare that javert was a symbol his brow was not visible it disappeared beneath his hat his eyes were not visible since they were lost under his eyebrows his chin was not visible for it was plunged in his cravat his hands were not visible they were drawn up in his sleeves and his cane was not visible he carried it under his coat but when the occasion presented itself there was suddenly seen to emerge from all this shadow as from an ambuscade a narrow and angular forehead a baleful glance a threatening chin enormous hands and a monstrous cudgel 
 in his leisure moments which were far from frequent he read although he hated books this caused him to be not wholly illiterate this could be recognized by some emphasis in his speech 
 as we have said he had no vices 
 when he was pleased with himself he permitted himself a pinch of snuff 
 therein lay his connection with humanity 
 the reader will have no difficulty in understanding that javert was the terror of that whole class which the annual statistics of the ministry of justice designates under the rubric vagrants the name of javert routed them by its mere utterance the face of javert petrified them at sight 
 such was this formidable man 
 javert was like an eye constantly fixed on m madeleine 
 an eye full of suspicion and conjecture 
 m madeleine had finally perceived the fact but it seemed to be of no importance to him 
 he did not even put a question to javert he neither sought nor avoided him he bore that embarrassing and almost oppressive gaze without appearing to notice it 
 he treated javert with ease and courtesy as he did all the rest of the world 
 it was divined from some words which escaped javert that he had secretly investigated with that curiosity which belongs to the race and into which there enters as much instinct as will all the anterior traces which father madeleine might have left elsewhere he seemed to know and he sometimes said in covert words that some one had gleaned certain information in a certain district about a family which had disappeared 
 once he chanced to say as he was talking to himself i think i have him then he remained pensive for three days and uttered not a word it seemed that the thread which he thought he held had broken 
 moreover and this furnishes the necessary corrective for the too absolute sense which certain words might present there can be nothing really infallible in a human creature and the peculiarity of instinct is that it can become confused thrown off the track and defeated 
 otherwise it would be superior to intelligence and the beast would be found to be provided with a better light than man 
 javert was evidently somewhat disconcerted by the perfect naturalness and tranquillity of m madeleine 
 one day nevertheless his strange manner appeared to produce an impression on m madeleine 
 it was on the following occasion

 book two 
 chapter xvii 
 
 mounting his horse again prince andrew lingered with the battery looking at the puff from the gun that had sent the ball his eyes ran rapidly over the wide space but he only saw that the hitherto motionless masses of the french now swayed and that there really was a battery to their left the smoke above it had not yet dispersed two mounted frenchmen probably adjutants were galloping up the hill a small but distinctly visible enemy column was moving down the hill probably to strengthen the front line the smoke of the first shot had not yet dispersed before another puff appeared followed by a report the battle had begun prince andrew turned his horse and galloped back to grunth to find prince bagration he heard the cannonade behind him growing louder and more frequent evidently our guns had begun to reply from the bottom of the slope where the parleys had taken place came the report of musketry 
 lemarrois had just arrived at a gallop with stern letter and murat humiliated and anxious to expiate his fault had at once moved his forces to attack the center and outflank both the russian wings hoping before evening and before the arrival of the emperor to crush the contemptible detachment that stood before him 
 it has begun here it is thought prince andrew feeling the blood rush to his heart but where and how will my toulon present itself 
 passing between the companies that had been eating porridge and drinking vodka a quarter of an hour before he saw everywhere the same rapid movement of soldiers forming ranks and getting their muskets ready and on all their faces he recognized the same eagerness that filled his heart it has begun here it is dreadful but enjoyable was what the face of each soldier and each officer seemed to say 
 before he had reached the embankments that were being thrown up he saw in the light of the dull autumn evening mounted men coming toward him the foremost wearing a cossack cloak and lambskin cap and riding a white horse was prince bagration prince andrew stopped waiting for him to come up prince bagration reined in his horse and recognizing prince andrew nodded to him he still looked ahead while prince andrew told him what he had seen 
 the feeling it has begun here it is was seen even on prince hard brown face with its dull sleepy eyes prince andrew gazed with anxious curiosity at that impassive face and wished he could tell what if anything this man was thinking and feeling at that moment is there anything at all behind that impassive face prince andrew asked himself as he looked prince bagration bent his head in sign of agreement with what prince andrew told him and said very good in a tone that seemed to imply that everything that took place and was reported to him was exactly what he had foreseen prince andrew out of breath with his rapid ride spoke quickly prince bagration uttering his words with an oriental accent spoke particularly slowly as if to impress the fact that there was no need to hurry however he put his horse to a trot in the direction of battery prince andrew followed with the suite behind prince bagration rode an officer of the suite the personal adjutant zherkov an orderly officer the staff officer on duty riding a fine bobtailed horse and a civilian an accountant who had asked permission to be present at the battle out of curiosity the accountant a stout man looked around him with a naive smile of satisfaction and presented a strange appearance among the hussars cossacks and adjutants in his camlet coat as he jolted on his horse with a convoy saddle 
 he wants to see a battle said zherkov to bolkonski pointing to the accountant but he feels a pain in the pit of his stomach already 
 oh leave off said the accountant with a beaming but rather cunning smile as if flattered at being made the subject of joke and purposely trying to appear stupider than he really was 
 it is very strange mon monsieur prince said the staff officer he remembered that in french there is some peculiar way of addressing a prince but could not get it quite right 
 by this time they were all approaching battery and a ball struck the ground in front of them 
 that that has fallen asked the accountant with a naive smile 
 a french pancake answered zherkov

 book two 
 chapter xvii 
 
 mounting his horse again prince andrew lingered with the battery looking at the puff from the gun that had sent the ball his eyes ran rapidly over the wide space but he only saw that the hitherto motionless masses of the french now swayed and that there really was a battery to their left the smoke above it had not yet dispersed two mounted frenchmen probably adjutants were galloping up the hill a small but distinctly visible enemy column was moving down the hill probably to strengthen the front line the smoke of the first shot had not yet dispersed before another puff appeared followed by a report the battle had begun prince andrew turned his horse and galloped back to grunth to find prince bagration he heard the cannonade behind him growing louder and more frequent evidently our guns had begun to reply from the bottom of the slope where the parleys had taken place came the report of musketry 
 lemarrois had just arrived at a gallop with stern letter and murat humiliated and anxious to expiate his fault had at once moved his forces to attack the center and outflank both the russian wings hoping before evening and before the arrival of the emperor to crush the contemptible detachment that stood before him 
 it has begun here it is thought prince andrew feeling the blood rush to his heart but where and how will my toulon present itself 
 passing between the companies that had been eating porridge and drinking vodka a quarter of an hour before he saw everywhere the same rapid movement of soldiers forming ranks and getting their muskets ready and on all their faces he recognized the same eagerness that filled his heart it has begun here it is dreadful but enjoyable was what the face of each soldier and each officer seemed to say 
 before he had reached the embankments that were being thrown up he saw in the light of the dull autumn evening mounted men coming toward him the foremost wearing a cossack cloak and lambskin cap and riding a white horse was prince bagration prince andrew stopped waiting for him to come up prince bagration reined in his horse and recognizing prince andrew nodded to him he still looked ahead while prince andrew told him what he had seen 
 the feeling it has begun here it is was seen even on prince hard brown face with its dull sleepy eyes prince andrew gazed with anxious curiosity at that impassive face and wished he could tell what if anything this man was thinking and feeling at that moment is there anything at all behind that impassive face prince andrew asked himself as he looked prince bagration bent his head in sign of agreement with what prince andrew told him and said very good in a tone that seemed to imply that everything that took place and was reported to him was exactly what he had foreseen prince andrew out of breath with his rapid ride spoke quickly prince bagration uttering his words with an oriental accent spoke particularly slowly as if to impress the fact that there was no need to hurry however he put his horse to a trot in the direction of battery prince andrew followed with the suite behind prince bagration rode an officer of the suite the personal adjutant zherkov an orderly officer the staff officer on duty riding a fine bobtailed horse and a civilian an accountant who had asked permission to be present at the battle out of curiosity the accountant a stout man looked around him with a naive smile of satisfaction and presented a strange appearance among the hussars cossacks and adjutants in his camlet coat as he jolted on his horse with a convoy saddle 
 he wants to see a battle said zherkov to bolkonski pointing to the accountant but he feels a pain in the pit of his stomach already 
 oh leave off said the accountant with a beaming but rather cunning smile as if flattered at being made the subject of joke and purposely trying to appear stupider than he really was 
 it is very strange mon monsieur prince said the staff officer he remembered that in french there is some peculiar way of addressing a prince but could not get it quite right 
 by this time they were all approaching battery and a ball struck the ground in front of them 
 that that has fallen asked the accountant with a naive smile 
 a french pancake answered zherkov 
 so what they hit with asked the accountant how awful 
 he seemed to swell with satisfaction he had hardly finished speaking when they again heard an unexpectedly violent whistling which suddenly ended with a thud into something soft and a cossack riding a little to their right and behind the accountant crashed to earth with his horse zherkov and the staff officer bent over their saddles and turned their horses away the accountant stopped facing the cossack and examined him with attentive curiosity the cossack was dead but the horse still struggled 
 prince bagration screwed up his eyes looked round and seeing the cause of the confusion turned away with indifference as if to say is it worth while noticing trifles he reined in his horse with the case of a skillful rider and slightly bending over disengaged his saber which had caught in his cloak it was an saber of a kind no longer in general use prince andrew remembered the story of suvorov giving his saber to bagration in italy and the recollection was particularly pleasant at that moment they had reached the battery at which prince andrew had been when he examined the battlefield

 chapter 
 
 i cannot feel that i have done my duty as humble historian of the march family without devoting at least one chapter to the two most precious and important members of it daisy and demi had now arrived at years of discretion for in this fast age babies of three or four assert their rights and get them too which is more than many of their elders do if there ever were a pair of twins in danger of being utterly spoiled by adoration it was these prattling brookes of course they were the most remarkable children ever born as will be shown when i mention that they walked at eight months talked fluently at twelve months and at two years they took their places at table and behaved with a propriety which charmed all beholders at three daisy demanded a needler and actually made a bag with four stitches in it she likewise set up housekeeping in the sideboard and managed a microscopic cooking stove with a skill that brought tears of pride to eyes while demi learned his letters with his grandfather who invented a new mode of teaching the alphabet by forming letters with his arms and legs thus uniting gymnastics for head and heels the boy early developed a mechanical genius which delighted his father and distracted his mother for he tried to imitate every machine he saw and kept the nursery in a chaotic condition with his sewinsheen a mysterious structure of string chairs clothespins and spools for wheels to go wound and wound also a basket hung over the back of a chair in which he vainly tried to hoist his too confiding sister who with feminine devotion allowed her little head to be bumped till rescued when the young inventor indignantly remarked why marmar my lellywaiter and trying to pull her up 
 
 though utterly unlike in character the twins got on remarkably well together and seldom quarreled more than thrice a day of course demi tyrannized over daisy and gallantly defended her from every other aggressor while daisy made a galley slave of herself and adored her brother as the one perfect being in the world a rosy chubby sunshiny little soul was daisy who found her way to heart and nestled there one of the captivating children who seem made to be kissed and cuddled adorned and adored like little goddesses and produced for general approval on all festive occasions her small virtues were so sweet that she would have been quite angelic if a few small naughtinesses had not kept her delightfully human it was all fair weather in her world and every morning she scrambled up to the window in her little nightgown to look our and say no matter whether it rained or shone oh pitty day oh pitty day everyone was a friend and she offered kisses to a stranger so confidingly that the most inveterate bachelor relented and became faithful worshipers 
 
 me loves evvybody she once said opening her arms with her spoon in one hand and her mug in the other as if eager to embrace and nourish the whole world 
 
 as she grew her mother began to feel that the dovecote would be blessed by the presence of an inmate as serene and loving as that which had helped to make the old house home and to pray that she might be spared a loss like that which had latelytaught them how long they had entertained an angel unawares her grandfather often called her beth and her grandmother watched over her with untiring devotion as if trying to atone for some past mistake which no eye but her own could see 
 
 demi like a true yankee was of an inquiring turn wanting to know everything and often getting much disturbed because he could not get satisfactory answers to his perpetual what for 
 
 he also possessed a philosophic bent to the great delight of his grandfather who used to hold socratic conversations with him in which the precocious pupil occasionally posed his teacher to the undisguised satisfaction of the womenfolk 
 
 what makes my legs go dranpa asked the young philosopher surveying those active portions of his frame with a meditative air while resting after a frolic one night 
 
 your little mind demi replied the sage stroking the yellow head respectfully 
 
 what is a little mine 
 
 it is something which makes your body move as the spring made the wheels go in my watch when i showed it to you 
 
 open me i want to see it go wound 
 
 i do that any more than you could open the watch god winds you up and you go till he stops you 
 
 does i and brown eyes grew big and bright as he took in the new thought is i wounded up like the watch 
 
 yes but i show you how for it is done when we see 
 
 demi felt his back as if expecting to find it like that of the watch and then gravely remarked i dess dod does it when asleep 
 
 a careful explanation followed to which he listened so attentively that his anxious grandmother said my dear do you think it wise to talk about such things to that baby getting great bumps 
 over his eyes and learning to ask the most unanswerable questions 
 if he is old enough to ask the question he is old enough to receive true answers i am not putting the thoughts into his head but helping him unfold those already there these children are wiser than we are and i have no doubt the boy understands every word i have said to him now demi tell me where you keep your mind 
 
 if the boy had replied like alcibiades by the gods socrates i cannot tell his grandfather would not have been surprised but when after standing a moment on one leg like a meditative youngstork he answered in a tone of calm conviction in my little belly the old gentleman could only join in laugh and dismiss the class in metaphysics 
 
 there might have been cause for maternal anxiety if demi had not given convincing proofs that he was a true boy as well as a budding philosopher for often after a discussion which caused hannah to prophesy with ominous nods that child long for this world he would turn about and set her fears at rest by some of the pranks with which dear dirty naughty little rascals distract and delight their souls 
 
 meg made many moral rules and tried to keep them but what mother was ever proof against the winning wiles the ingenious evasions or the tranquil audacity of the miniature men and women who so early show themselves accomplished artful dodgers 
 
 no more raisins demi make you sick says mamma to the young person who offers his services in the kitchen with unfailing regularity on day 
 
 me likes to be sick 
 
 i want to have you so run away and help daisy make patty cakes 
 
 he reluctantly departs but his wrongs weigh upon his spirit and when an opportunity comes to redress them he outwits mamma by a shrewd bargain 
 
 now you have been good children and play anything you like says meg as she leads her assistant cooks upstairs when the pudding is safely bouncing in the pot 
 
 truly marmar asks demi with a brilliant idea in his head 
 
 yes truly anything you say replies the shortsighted parent preparing herself to sing the three little kittens half a dozen times over or to take her family to buy a penny bun regardless of wind or limb but demi corners her by the cool reply 
 
 then go and eat up all the raisins 
 
 aunt dodo was chief playmate and confidante of both children and the trio turned the little house aunt amy was as yet only a name to them aunt beth soon faded into a pleasantly vague memory but aunt dodo was a living reality and they made the most of her for which compliment she was deeply grateful but when mr bhaer came jo neglected her playfellows and dismay and desolation fell upon their little souls daisy who was fond of going about peddling kisses lost her best customer and became bankrupt demi with infantile penetration soon discovered that dodo like to play with the better than she did him but though hurt he concealed his anguish for he the heart to insult a rival who kept a mine of chocolate drops inhis waistcoat pocket and a watch that could be taken out of its case and freely shaken by ardent admirers 
 
 some persons might have considered these pleasing liberties as bribes but demi see it in that light and continued to patronize the the with pensive affability while daisy bestowed her small affections upon him at the third call and considered his shoulder her throne his arm her refuge his gifts treasures surpassing worth 
 
 gentlemen are sometimes seized with sudden fits of admiration for the young relatives of ladies whom they honor with their regard but this counterfeit philoprogenitiveness sits uneasily upon them and does not deceive anybody a particle mr devotion was sincere however likewise honesty is the best policy in love as in law he was one of the men who are at home with children and looked particularly well when little faces made a pleasant contrast with his manly one his business whatever it was detained him from day to day but evening seldom failed to bring him out to he always asked for mr march so i suppose he was the attraction the excellent papa labored under the delusion that he was and reveled in long discussions with the kindred spirit till a chance remark of his more observing grandson suddenly enlightened him 
 
 mr bhaer came in one evening to pause on the threshold of the study astonished by the spectacle that met his eye prone uponthe floor lay mr march with his respectable legs in the air and beside him likewise prone was demi trying to imitate the attitude with his own short legs both grovelers so seriously absorbed that they were unconscious of spectators till mr bhaer laughed his sonorous laugh and jo cried out with a scandalized face 
 
 father father the professor 
 
 down went the black legs and up came the gray head as the preceptor said with undisturbed dignity good evening mr bhaer excuse me for a moment we are just finishing our lesson now demi make the letter and tell its name 
 
 i knows him and after a few convulsive efforts the red legs tok the shape of a pair of compasses and the intelligent pupil triumphantly shouted a we dranpa a we 
 
 a born weller laughed jo as her parent gathered himself up and her nephew tried to stand on his head as the only mode of expressing his satisfaction that school was over 
 
 what have you been at today bubchen asked mr bhaer picking up the gymnast 
 
 me went to see little mary 
 
 and what did you there 
 
 i kissed her began demi with artless frankness prut thou beginnest early what did the little mary say to that asked mr bhaer continuing to confess the young sinner who stood upon the knee exploring the waistcoat pocket 
 
 oh she liked it and she kissed me and i liked it little boys like little girls asked demi with his mouth full and an air of bland satisfaction 
 
 you precious chick who put that into your head said jo enjoying the innocent revelation as much as the professor 
 
 in mine head in mine mouf answered literal demi putting out his tongue with a chocolate drop on it thinking she alluded to confectionery not ideas 
 
 thou shouldst save some for the little friend sweets to the sweet mannling and mr bhaer offered jo some with a look that made her wonder if chocolate was not the nectar drunk by the gods demi also saw the smile was impressed by it and artlessy inquired 
 
 do great boys like great girls to fessor 
 
 like young washington mr bhaer tell a lie so he gave the somewhat vague reply that he believed they did sometimes in a tone that made mr march put down his clothesbrush glance at retiring face and then sink into his chair looking as if the precocious chick had put an idea into his head that was both sweet and sour 
 
 why dodo when she caught him in the china closet half an hour afterward nearly squeezed the breath out of his little body with a tender embrace instead of shaking him for being there and why she followed up this novel performance by the unexpected gift of a big slice of bread and jelly remained one of the problems over which demi puzzled his small wits and was forced to leave unsolved forever

 like young washington mr bhaer tell a lie so he gave the somewhat vague reply that he believed they did sometimes in a tone that made mr march put down his clothesbrush glance at retiring face and then sink into his chair looking as if the precocious chick had put an idea into his head that was both sweet and sour 
 
 why dodo when she caught him in the china closet half an hour afterward nearly squeezed the breath out of his little body with a tender embrace instead of shaking him for being there and why she followed up this novel performance by the unexpected gift of a big slice of bread and jelly remained one of the problems over which demi puzzled his small wits and was forced to leave unsolved forever

 fairy tales of hans christian andersen 
 the drop of water 
 by hans christian andersen 
 
 of course you know what is meant by a magnifying glass one of 
 those round that make everything look a hundred 
 times bigger than it is when any one takes one of these and holds 
 it to his eye and looks at a drop of water from the pond yonder he 
 sees above a thousand wonderful creatures that are otherwise never 
 discerned in the water but there they are and it is no delusion 
 it almost looks like a great plateful of spiders jumping about in a 
 crowd and how fierce they are they tear off each legs and 
 arms and bodies before and behind and yet they are merry and 
 joyful in their way 
 
 now there once was an old man whom all the people called 
 for that was his name he always wanted the best of 
 everything and when he could not manage it otherwise he did it by 
 magic 
 
 there he sat one day and held his to his eye 
 and looked at a drop of water that had been taken out of a puddle by 
 the ditch but what a kribbling and krabbling was there all the 
 thousands of little creatures hopped and sprang and tugged at one 
 another and ate each other up 
 
 that is horrible said old can one not 
 persuade them to live in peace and quietness so that each one may 
 mind his own business 
 
 and he thought it over and over but it would not do and so he 
 had recourse to magic 
 
 i must give them color that they may be seen more plainly said 
 he and he poured something like a little drop of red wine into the 
 drop of water but it was witches blood from the lobes of the ear 
 the finest kind at ninepence a drop and now the wonderful little 
 creatures were pink all over it looked like a whole town of naked 
 wild men 
 
 what have you there asked another old magician who had no 
 name and that was the best thing about him 
 
 yes if you can guess what it is said 
 make you a present of it 
 
 but it is not so easy to find out if one does not know 
 and the magician who had no name looked through the 
 
 
 it looked really like a great town reflected there in which all 
 the people were running about without clothes it was terrible but it 
 was still more terrible to see how one beat and pushed the other 
 and bit and hacked and tugged and mauled him those at the top were being pulled down and those at the bottom were struggling upwards 
 
 look look his leg is longer than mine bah away with it there 
 is one who has a little bruise it hurts him but it shall hurt him 
 still more 
 
 and they hacked away at him and they pulled at him and ate him 
 up because of the little bruise and there was one sitting as still 
 as any little maiden and wishing only for peace and quietness but 
 now she had to come out and they tugged at her and pulled her about and ate her up 
 
 funny said the magician 
 
 yes but what do you think it is said can you 
 find that out

 of gardens 
 god almighty first planted a garden and indeed it is the purest of human pleasure it is the greatest refreshment to the spirits of man 
 without which buildings and palaces are but gross and a man shall ever see that when ages grow to civility and elegance men come to build stately sooner than to garden finely as if gardening were the greater perfection i do hold it in the royal ordering of gardens there ought to be gardens for all the months in 
 me year in which severally things of beauty may be then in season for december and january and the latter part of november you must take such things as are green all winter holly ivy bays juniper cypress trees yew pineapple trees fir trees rosemary lavender periwinkle the white the purple and the blue germander flags orange trees lemon trees and myrtles if they be stoved and sweet marjoram warm set 
 there followeth for the latter part of january and february the mezereon tree 
 which then blossoms avcusvemus both the yellow and the grey primroses anemones the early tulip hyadnthus onentalis for march there come violets specially the single blue which are the earliest the yellow daffodil 
 the daisy the almond tree in blossom the peach tree in blossom the cornelian tree 
 in blossom sweet briar 
 in april follow the double white violet the wallflower the stock gillyflower the cowslip and lilies of all natures rosemary flowers the tulip the double peony the pale daffodil the french honeysuckle the cherry tree in blossom the damson and plum trees in blossom the white thorn in leaf the lilac tree in may and june come pinks of all sorts specially the blush pink roses of all kinds except the musk which comes later honeysuckles strawberries bugloss columbine the french marigold ftos qfiiainus cheny tree in fruit rihs figs in fruit 
 raspberries vine flowers lavender in flowers the sweet satyrian with the white 
 flower herba nvsoana iilaan comaswm the apple tree in blossom in july come 
 gillyflowers of all varieties musk roses the lime tree in blossom early pears 
 and plums in fruit ginnitings quadlins in august come plums of all sorts in fruit pears apricots berberries filberts musk melons of all colours in september come grapes apples poppies of all colours peaches nectarines cornelians wardens quinces in october and the beginning of november come services medlars bullises roses cut or removed to come late holly oaks and such like 
 these particulars are for the climate of london but my meaning is perceived that you may have verperpecuwn as the place affords 
 
 and because me breath of flowers is far sweeter in the air where it comes and goes like the warbling of music than in the hand therefore nothing is more fit for that delight than to know what be the flowers and plants that do best perfume the air 
 roses damask and red are fast flowers of their smells so that you may walk by a 
 whole row of them and find nothing of their sweetness yea though it be in a dew bays likewise yield no smell as they grow rosemary little nor sweet marjoram 
 
 that which above all others yields the sweetest smell in the air is the violet 
 specially the white double violet which comes twice a year about the middle of april and about next to that is the musk rose then the strawberry leaves dying which yield a most excellent cordial smell then the flower of me vines it is a little dust like the dust of a bent which grows upon the cluster in the first coming forth then sweet briar then wallflowers which are very delightful to be set under a parlour or lower chamber window then pinks and gillyflowers specially the matted pink and clove gillyflower then the flowers of the lime tree 
 then the honeysuckles so they be somewhat a far off of bean flowers i speak not because they are field flowers but those which perfume the air most delightfully not passed by as me rest but being trodden upon and crushed are three that is bumet wild thyme and water mints therefore you are to set whole alleys of them to have the pleasure when you walk or tread 
 
 for gardens speaking of those which are indeed princelike as we have done of 
 buildings the contents ought not well to be under thirty acres of ground and to 
 be divided into three parts a green in the entrance a heath or desert in die going 
 forth and the main garden in the midst besides alleys on both sides and i like 
 well that four acres of ground be assigned to the green six to the heath four and 
 four to either side and twelve to the main garden the green hath two pleasures 
 the one because nothing is more pleasant to the eye than green grass kept finely 
 shorn the other because it will give you a fair alley in the midst by which you 
 may go in front upon a stately hedge which is to enclose the garden 
 but because the alley will be long and in great heat of the year or day you ought not to buy the shade in the garden by going in the sun through the green therefore you are of either side the green to plant a covert alley upon work about twelve foot in height by which you may go in shade into the garden as for the making of knots or figures with divers coloured earths mat they may lie under the windows of the house on that side which the garden stands they be but toys you may see as good sights many times in tarts t 
 the garden is best to be square encompassed on all the four sides with a stately arched hedge the arches to be upon pillars of work of some ten foot high and six foot broad and the spaces between of the same dimension with the breadth of the arch over the arches let there be an entire hedge of some four foot high framed also upon work and upon the upper hedge over every arch a little turret with a belly enough to receive a cage of birds and over every space between the arches some other lime figure with broad plates of round coloured glass gilt for the sun to play upon but mis hedge i intend to be raised upon a bank not steep but gently slope of some six foot set all with flowers 
 also i understand that this square of the garden should not be the whole breadth of the ground but to leave on either side ground enough for diversity of side alleys unto which the two covert alleys of the green may deliver you but there must be no alleys with hedges at either end of this great enclosure not at the hither end for letting your prospect upon mis fair hedge from the green nor at the further end for letting your prospect from the hedge through the arches upon the heath 
 
 for the ordering of the ground within the great hedge i leave it to variety of device advising nevertheless that whatsoever form you cast it into first it be not too busy or full of work wherein i for my part do not like images cut out in juniper or other garden stuff they be for children little low hedges round like welts with some pretty pyramids i like well and in some places fair columns upon frames of work i would also have the alleys spacious and fair 
 you may have closer alleys upon the side grounds but none in the main garden i wish also in the very middle a fair mount with three ascents and alleys enough for four to walk abreast which i would have to be perfect circles without any bulwarks or embossment and the whole mount to be thirty foot high and some fine banqueting house with some chimneys neatly cast and without too much glass 
 
 for fountains they are a great beauty and refreshment but pools mar all and make the garden unwholesome and full of flies and frogs fountains i intend to be of two natures the one that sprinkleth or spouteth water the other a fair receipt 
 of water of some thirty or forty foot square but without fish or slime or mud 
 for the first the ornaments of images gilt or of marble which are in use do well 
 but the main matter is so to convey the water as it never stay either in the bowls 
 or in the cistern that the water be never by rest discoloured green or red or 
 the like or gather any mossiness or putrefaction besides that it is to be cleansed 
 every day by the hand also some steps up to it and some fine pavement about it 
 doth well 
 as for the other kind of fountain which we may call a bathing pool it may admit much curiosity and beauty wherewith we will not trouble ourselves as 
 that the bottom be finely paved and with images the sides likewise and withal 
 embellished with coloured glass and such things of lustre encompassed also with 
 fine rails of low statues but the main point is the same which we mentioned in 
 the former kind of fountain which is that the water be in perpetual motion fed 
 by a water higher than the pool and delivered into it by fair spouts and then 
 discharged away under ground by some equality of bores that it stay little and 
 for fine devices of arching water without spilling and making it rise in several 
 forms of feathers drinking glasses canopies and the like they be pretty things 
 to look on but nothing to health and sweetness 
 for the heath which was the third part of our plot i wish it to be framed as much 
 as may be to a natural wildness trees i would have none in it but some thickets 
 made only of and honeysuckle and some wild vine amongst and the ground set with violets strawberries and primroses for these are sweet and prosper in the shade 
 and these to be in the heath here and there not in any order i like 
 also little heaps in the nature of such as are in wild heaths to be 
 set some with wild thyme some with pinks some with germander that gives a good flower to the eye some with periwinkles some with violets some with strawberries some with cowslips some with daisies some with red roses some with lilium convallium some with red some with and the like low flowers being withal sweet and sightly part of which heaps to be with standards of little bushes pricked upon their top and part without 
 
 the standards to be roses jumper holly berberries but here and there because of the smell of their blossom red currants gooseberries rosemary bays and such like but these standards to be kept with cutting that they grow not out of course 
 
 for the side grounds you are to fill them with variety of alleys private to give 
 a full shade some of them wheresoever the sun be you are to frame some of them likewise for shelter that when the wind blows sharp you may walk as in a gallery 
 
 and those alleys must be likewise hedged at both ends to keep out the wind and 
 these closer alleys must be ever finely gravelled and no grass because of going 
 wet in many of these alleys likewise you are to set fruit trees of all sorts as 
 well upon the walls as in ranges and this would be generally observed that the 
 borders wherein you plant your fruit trees be fair and large and low and not steep and set with fine flowers but thin and sparingly lest they deceive trees at the end of both the side grounds i would have a mount of some pretty height leaving the wall of the enclosure breast high to look abroad into the fields 
 
 for the main garden i do not deny but there should be some fair alleys ranged on 
 both sides with fruit trees and some pretty tufts of fruit trees and arbours with 
 seats set in some decent order but these to be by no means set too thick but to 
 leave the main garden so as it be not close but the air open and free for as for 
 shade i would have you rest upon the alleys of the side grounds there to walk if 
 you be disposed in the heat of the year or day but to make account that the main 
 garden is for the more temperate parts of the year and in the heat of summer for 
 the morning and the evening or days 
 
 for aviaries i like them not except they be of that largeness as they may be turfed and have living plants and bushes set in them that the birds may have more scope and natural nesting and that no foulness appear in the floor of the aviary so i have made a platform of a princely garden partly by precept partly by drawing not a model but some general lines of it and in this i have spared for no cost but it is nothing for great princes that for the most part taking advice with workmen with no less cost set their things together and sometimes add statues and such things for state and magnificence but nothing to the true pleasure of a garden

 chapter vi 
 
 father fauchelevent 
 one morning m madeleine was passing through an unpaved alley of m sur m he heard a noise and saw a group some distance away he approached 
 an old man named father fauchelevent had just fallen beneath his cart his horse having tumbled down 
 this fauchelevent was one of the few enemies whom m madeleine had at that time 
 when madeleine arrived in the neighborhood fauchelevent an and a peasant who was almost educated had a business which was beginning to be in a bad way 
 fauchelevent had seen this simple workman grow rich while he a lawyer was being ruined this had filled him with jealousy and he had done all he could on every occasion to injure madeleine 
 then bankruptcy had come and as the old man had nothing left but a cart and a horse and neither family nor children he had turned carter 
 the horse had two broken legs and could not rise 
 the old man was caught in the wheels 
 the fall had been so unlucky that the whole weight of the vehicle rested on his breast 
 the cart was quite heavily laden 
 father fauchelevent was rattling in the throat in the most lamentable manner 
 they had tried but in vain to drag him out 
 an unmethodical effort aid awkwardly given a wrong shake might kill him 
 it was impossible to disengage him otherwise than by lifting the vehicle off of him 
 javert who had come up at the moment of the accident had sent for a 
 m madeleine arrived 
 people stood aside respectfully 
 help cried old fauchelevent 
 who will be good and save the old man 
 turned towards those present 
 is there a to be had 
 one has been sent for answered the peasant 
 how long will it take to get it 
 they have gone for the nearest to place where there is a farrier but it makes no difference it will take a good quarter of an hour 
 a quarter of an hour exclaimed madeleine 
 it had rained on the preceding night the soil was soaked 
 the cart was sinking deeper into the earth every moment and crushing the old breast more and more it was evident that his ribs would be broken in five minutes more 
 it is impossible to wait another quarter of an hour said madeleine to the peasants who were staring at him 
 we must 
 but it will be too late then 
 you see that the cart is sinking 
 well 
 listen resumed madeleine there is still room enough under the cart to allow a man to crawl beneath it and raise it with his back only half a minute and the poor man can be taken out 
 is there any one here who has stout loins and heart 
 there are five louis to be earned 
 not a man in the group stirred 
 ten louis said madeleine 
 the persons present dropped their eyes 
 one of them muttered a man would need to be devilish strong 
 and then he runs the risk of getting crushed 
 come began madeleine again twenty louis 
 the same silence 
 it is not the will which is lacking said a voice 
 m madeleine turned round and recognized javert 
 he had not noticed him on his arrival 
 javert went on

 father fauchelevent 
 one morning m madeleine was passing through an unpaved alley of m sur m he heard a noise and saw a group some distance away he approached 
 an old man named father fauchelevent had just fallen beneath his cart his horse having tumbled down 
 this fauchelevent was one of the few enemies whom m madeleine had at that time 
 when madeleine arrived in the neighborhood fauchelevent an and a peasant who was almost educated had a business which was beginning to be in a bad way 
 fauchelevent had seen this simple workman grow rich while he a lawyer was being ruined this had filled him with jealousy and he had done all he could on every occasion to injure madeleine 
 then bankruptcy had come and as the old man had nothing left but a cart and a horse and neither family nor children he had turned carter 
 the horse had two broken legs and could not rise 
 the old man was caught in the wheels 
 the fall had been so unlucky that the whole weight of the vehicle rested on his breast 
 the cart was quite heavily laden 
 father fauchelevent was rattling in the throat in the most lamentable manner 
 they had tried but in vain to drag him out 
 an unmethodical effort aid awkwardly given a wrong shake might kill him 
 it was impossible to disengage him otherwise than by lifting the vehicle off of him 
 javert who had come up at the moment of the accident had sent for a 
 m madeleine arrived 
 people stood aside respectfully 
 help cried old fauchelevent 
 who will be good and save the old man 
 turned towards those present 
 is there a to be had 
 one has been sent for answered the peasant 
 how long will it take to get it 
 they have gone for the nearest to place where there is a farrier but it makes no difference it will take a good quarter of an hour 
 a quarter of an hour exclaimed madeleine 
 it had rained on the preceding night the soil was soaked 
 the cart was sinking deeper into the earth every moment and crushing the old breast more and more it was evident that his ribs would be broken in five minutes more 
 it is impossible to wait another quarter of an hour said madeleine to the peasants who were staring at him 
 we must 
 but it will be too late then 
 you see that the cart is sinking 
 well 
 listen resumed madeleine there is still room enough under the cart to allow a man to crawl beneath it and raise it with his back only half a minute and the poor man can be taken out 
 is there any one here who has stout loins and heart 
 there are five louis to be earned 
 not a man in the group stirred 
 ten louis said madeleine 
 the persons present dropped their eyes 
 one of them muttered a man would need to be devilish strong 
 and then he runs the risk of getting crushed 
 come began madeleine again twenty louis 
 the same silence 
 it is not the will which is lacking said a voice 
 m madeleine turned round and recognized javert 
 he had not noticed him on his arrival 
 javert went on 
 it is strength 
 one would have to be a terrible man to do such a thing as lift a cart like that on his back 
 then gazing fixedly at m madeleine he went on emphasizing every word that he uttered 
 monsieur madeleine i have never known but one man capable of doing what you ask

 chapter 
 
 while laurie and amy were taking conjugal strolls over velvet carpets as they set their house in order and planned a blissful future mr bhaer and jo were enjoying promenades of a different sort along muddy roads and sodden fields 
 
 i always do take a walk toward evening and i know why i should give it up just because i happen to meet the professor on his way out said jo to herself after two or three encounters for though there were two paths to whichever one she took she was sure to meet him either going or returning 
 he was always walking rapidly and never seemed to see her until quite close when he would look as if his eyes had failed to recognize the approaching lady till that moment then if she was going to he always had something for the babies if her face was turned homeward he had merely strolled down to see the river and was just returning unless they were tired of his frequent calls 
 
 under the circumstances what could jo do but greet him civilly and invite him in if she was tired of his visits she concealed her weariness with perfect skill and took care that there should be coffee for supper as mean mr like tea 
 
 by the second week everyone knew perfectly well what was going on yet everyone tried to look as if they were to the changes in face they never asked why she sang about her work did up her hair three times a day and got so blooming with her evening exercise and no one seemed to have the slightest suspicion that professor bhaer while talking philosophy with the father was giving the daughter lessons in love 
 
 jo even lose her heart in a decorous manner but sternly tried to quench her feelings and failing to do so led a somewhat agitated life she was mortally afraid of being laughed at for surrendering after her many and vehement declarations of independence laurie was her especial dread but thanks to the new manager he behaved with praiseworthy propriety never called mr bhaer a capital old fellow in public never alluded in the remotest manner to improved appearance or expressed the least surprise at seeing the hat on the marches table nearly every evening but he exulted in private and longed for the time to come when he could give jo a piece of plate with a bear and a ragged staff on it as an appropriate coat of arms 
 
 for a fortnight the professor came and went with regularity then he stayed away for three whole days and made no sign a proceeding which caused everybody to look sober and jo to become pensive at first and for cross 
 
 disgusted i dare say and gone home as suddenly as he came nothing tome of course but i should think he would have come and bid us goodbye like a gentleman she said to herself with a despairing look at the gate as she put on her things for the customary walk one dull afternoon 
 
 better take the little umbrella dear it looks like rain said her mother observing that she had on her new bonnet but not alluding to the fact 
 yes marmee do you want anything in town got to run in and get some paper returned jo pulling out the bow under her chin before the glass as an excuse for not looking at her mother 
 
 yes i want some twilled silesia a paper of number nine needles and two yards of narrow lavender ribbon have you got your thick boots on and something warm under your cloak 
 
 i believe so answered jo absently 
 
 if you happen to meet mr bhaer bring him home to tea i quite long to see the dear man added mrs march 
 
 jo heard that but made no answer except to kiss her mother and walk rapidly away thinking with a glow of gratitude in spite of her heartache how good she is to me what do girls do who any mothers to help them through their troubles 
 
 the stores were not down among the banks and wholesale warerooms where gentlemen most do congregate but jo found herself in that part of the city before she did a single errand loitering along as if waiting for someone examining engineering instruments in one window and samples of wool in another with most unfeminine interest tumbling over by descending bales and hustled unceremoniously by busy men who looked as if they wondered how the deuce she got there a drop of rain on her cheek recalled her thoughts from baffled hopes to ruined ribbons for the drops continued to fall and being a woman as well as a lover she felt that though it was too late to save her heart she might her bonnet now she remembered the little umbrella which she had forgotten to take in her hurry to be off but regret was unavailing and nothing could be done but borrow one or submit to to a drenching she looked up at the lowering sky down at the crimson bow already flecked with black forward along the muddy street then one long lingering look behind at a certain grimy warehouse with hoffmann swartz co over the door and said to herself with a sternly reproachful air 
 
 it serves me right what business had i to put on all my best things and come philandering down here hoping to see the professor jo ashamed of you no you shall not go there to borrow an umbrella or find out where he is from his friends you shall trudge away and do your errands in the rain and if you catch your death and ruin your bonnet no more than you deserve now then 
 
 with that she rushed across the street so impetuously that she narrowly escaped annihilation from a passing truck and precipitated herself into the arms of a stately old gentleman who said i beg pardon and looked mortally offended somewhat daunted jo righted herself spread her handkerchief over the devoted ribbons and putting temptation behind her hurried on with increasing dampness about the ankles and much clashing of umbrellas overhead the fact that a somewhat dilapidated blue one remained stationary above the unprotected bonnet attracted her attention and looking up she saw mr bhaer looking down 
 
 i feel to know the lady who goes so bravely under many horse noses and so fast through much mus what do you down here my friend 
 
 shopping 
 mr bhaer smiled as he glanced from the pickle factory on one side to the wholesale hide and leather concern on the other but her only said politely you haf no umbrella may i go also and take for you the bundles 
 
 yes thank you 
 cheeks were as red as her ribbon and she wondered what he thought of her but she care for in a minute she found herself walking away arm in arm with her professor feeling as if the sun had suddenly burst out with uncommon brilliancy that the world was all right again and that one thoroughly happy woman was paddling through the wet that day 
 
 we thought you had gone said jo hastily for she knew he was looking at her her bonnet big enough to hide her face and she feared he might think the joy it betrayed unmaidenly 
 
 did you believe that i should go with no farewell to those who haf been so heavenly kind tome he asked so reproachfully that she felt as if she had insulted him by the suggestion and answered heartily 
 
 no i i knew you were busy about your own affairs but we rather missed you father and mother especially 
 
 and you 
 
 always glad to see you sir 
 
 in her anxiety to keep her voice quite calm jo made it rather cool and the frosty little monosyllable at the end seemed to chill the professor for his smile vanished as he said gravely 
 
 i thank you and come one more time before i go 
 
 you are going then 
 
 i haf no longer any business here it is done 
 
 successfully i hope said jo for the bitterness of disappointment was in that short reply of his 
 
 i ought to think so for i haf a way opened to me by which i can make my bread and gif my junglings much help 
 
 tell me please i like to know all about boys said jo eagerly 
 
 that is so kind i gladly tell you my friends find for mea place in a college where i teach as at home and earn enough to make the way smooth for franz and emil for this i should be grateful should i not 
 
 indeed you should how splendid it will be to have you doing what you like and be able to see you often and the boys cried jo clinging to the lads as an excuse for the satisfaction she could not help betraying 
 
 ah but we shall not meet often i fear this place is at the west 
 
 so far away and jo left her skirts to their fate as if it matter now what became of her clothes or herself 
 
 mr bhaer could read several languages but he had not learned to read women yet he flattered himself that he knew jo pretty well and was therefore much amazed by the contradictions of voice face and manner which she showed him in rapid succession that day for she was in half a dozen different moods in the course of half an hour when she met him she looked surprised though it was impossible to help suspecting that she had come for that express purpose when he offered her his arm she took it with a look that filled him with delight but when he asked if she missed him she gave such fell upon him on learning his good fortune she almost clappedherhands was the joy all for the boys then on hearing his destination she said so far away in a tone of despair that lifted him on to a pinnacle of hope but the next minute she tumbled him down again by observing like one entirely absorbed in the matter 
 
 the place for my errands will you come in it take long 
 
 jo rather prided herself upon her shopping capabilities and particularly wished to impress her escort with the neatness and dispatch with which she would accomplish the business but owing to the flutter she was in everything went amiss she upset the tray of needles forgot the silesia was to be twilled till it was cut off gave the wrong change and covered herself with confusion by asking for lavender ribbon at the calico counter mr bhaer stood by watching her blush and blunder and as he watched his own bewilderment seemed to subside for he was beginning to see that on some occasions women like dreams go by contraries 
 
 when they came out he put the parcel under his arm with a more cheerful aspect and splashed through the puddles as if he rather enjoyed it on the whole 
 
 should we no do a little what you call shopping for the babies and haf a farewell feast tonight if i go for my last call at your so pleasant home he asked stopping before a window full of fruit and flowers 
 
 what will we buy asked jo ignoring the latter part of his speech and sniffing the mingled odors with an affectation of delight as they went in 
 
 may they haf oranges and figs asked mr bhaer with a paternal air 
 
 they eat them when they can get them 
 do you care for nuts 
 
 like a squirrel 
 
 hamburg grapes yes we shall drink to the fatherland in those 
 
 jo frowned upon that piece of extravagance and asked why he buy a frail of dated a cask of raisins and a bag of almonds and be done with it whereat mr bhaer confiscated her purse produced his own and finished the marketing by buying several pounds of grapes a pot of rosy daisies and a pretty jar of honey to be regarded in the light of a demijohn then distorting his pockets with knobby bundles and giving her the flowers to hold he put up the old umbrella and they traveled on again 
 
 miss marsch i haf a great favor to ask of you began the professor after a moist promenade of half a block 
 
 yes sir and heart began to beat so hard she was afraid he would hear it 
 
 i am bold to say it in spite of the rain because so short a time remains to me 
 
 yes sir and jo nearly crushed the small flowerpot with the sudden squeeze she gave it 
 
 i wish to get a little dress for my tina and i am too stupid to go alone will you kindly gif me a word of taste and help 
 
 yes sir and jo felt as calm and cool all of a sudden as if she had stepped into a refrigerator 
 
 perhaps also a shawl for mother she is so poor and sick and the husband is such a care yes yes a thick warm shawl would be a friendly thing to take the little mother 
 
 do it with pleasure mr bhaer going very fast and getting dearer every minute added jo to herself then with a mental shake she entered into the business with an energy that was pleasant to behold mr bhaer left it all to her so she chose a pretty gown for tina and then ordered out the shawls the clerk being a married man condescended to take an interest in the couple who appeared to be shopping for their family 
 
 your lady may prefer this a superior article a most desirable color quite chaste and genteel he said shaking out a comfortable gray shawl and throwing it over shoulders 
 
 does this suit you mr bhaer she asked turning her back to him and feeling deeply grateful for the chance of hiding her face excellently well we will haf it answered the professor smiling to himself as he paid for it while jo continued to rummage the counters like a confirmed 
 
 now shall we go home he asked as if the words were very pleasant to him 
 
 yes late and so tired voice was more pathetic than she knew for now the sun seemed to have gone in as suddenly as it came out and the world grew muddy and miserable again and for the first time she discovered that her feet were cold her head ached and that her heart was colder than the former fuller of pain than the latter mr bhaer was going away he only cared for her as a friend it was all a mistake and the sooner it was over the better with this idea in her head she hailed an approaching omnibus with such a hasty gesture that the daisies flew out of the pot and were badly damaged 
 
 this is not our omniboos said the professor waving the loaded vehicle away and stopping to pick up the poor little flowers 
 
 i beg your pardon i see the name distinctly never mind i can walk used to plodding in the mud returned jo winking hard because she would have died rather than openly wipe her eyes mr bhaer saw the drops on her cheeks though she turned her head away the sight seemed to touch him very much for suddenly stooping down he asked in a tone that meant a great deal dearest why do you cry 
 
 now if jo had not been new to this sort of thing she would have said she crying had a cold in her head or told any other feminine fib proper to the occasion instead of which that undignified creature answered with an irrepressible sob because you are going away 
 
 ach mein gott that is so good cried mr bhaer managing to clasp his hands in spite of the umbrella and the bundles jo i haf nothing but much love to gif you i came to see if you could care for it and i waited to be sure that i was something more than a friend am i can you make a little place in your heart for old fritz he added all in one breath 
 
 oh yes said jo and he was quite satisfied for she folded both hands over his are and looked up at him with an expression that plainly showed how happy she would be to walk through life beside him even though she had no better shelter than the old umbrella if he carried it 
 
 it was certainly proposing under difficulties for even if he had desired to do so mr bhaer could not go down upon his knees on account of the mud neither could he offer jo his hand except figuratively for both were full much less could he indulge in tender remonstrations in the open street though he was near it so the only way in which he could express his rapture was to look at her with an expression which glorified his face to such a degree that there actually seemed to be little rainbows in the drops that sparkled on his beard if he had not loved jo very much i think he could have doneit then for she looked far from lovely with her skirts in a deplorable state her rubber boots splashed to the ankle and her bonnet a ruin fortunately mr bhaer considered her the most beautiful woman living and she found him more than ever though his hatbrim was quite limp with the little rills trickling thence upon his shoulders for he held the umbrella all over jo and every finger of his gloves needed mending 
 
 probably thought them a pair of harmless lunatics for they entirely forgot to hail a bus and strolledleisurely along oblivious of deepening dusk and fog little they cared what anybody thought for they were enjoying the happy hour that seldom comes but once in any life the magical moment which bestows youth on the old beauty on the plain wealth on the poor and gives human hearts a foretaste of heaven the professor looked as if he had conquered a kingdom and the world had nothing more to offer him in the way of bliss while jo trudged beside him feeling as if her place had always been there and wondering how she ever could have chosen any other lot of course she was the first to i mean for the emotional remarks which followed her impetuous 
 oh yes were not of a coherent or reportable character 
 
 friedrich why you 
 
 ah heaven she gifs me the name that no one speaks since minna died cried the professor pausing in a puddle to regard her with grateful delight 
 
 i always call you so to forgot but i unless you like it 
 
 like it it is more sweet to me than i can tell say thou also and i shall say your language is almost as beautiful as mine 
 
 thou a little sentimental asked jo privately thinking it a lovely monosyllable 
 
 sentimental yes thank gott we germans believe in sentiment and keep ourselves young mit it your english you is so cold say thou dearest it means so much to me pleaded mr bhaer more like a romantic student than a grave professor 
 
 well then why thou tell me all this sooner asked jo bashfully 
 
 now i shall haf to show thee all my heart and i so gladly will because thou must take care of it hereafter see then the dear funny little had a wish to tell something the day i said goodbye in new york but i thought the handsome friend was betrothed to thee and so i spoke not wouldst thou have said yes then if i had spoken 
 
 i know afraid not for i have any heart just then 
 
 prut that i do not believe it was asleep till the fairy prince came through the wood and waked it up ah well die erste liebe ist die beste but that i should not expect 
 
 yes the first love is the best but be so contented for i never had another teddy was only a boy and soon got over his little fancy said jo anxious to correct the mistake 
 
 good then i shall rest happy and be sure that thou givest me all i haf waited so long i am grown selfish as thou wiltfind professorin 
 
 i like that cried jo delighted with her new name now tell me what brought you at last just when i wanted you 
 
 this and mr bhaer took a little worn paper out of his waistcoat pocket 
 
 jo unfolded it and looked much abashed for it was one of her own contributions to a paper that paid for poetry which accounted for her sending it an occasional attempt 
 
 how could that bring you she asked wondering what he meant 
 
 i found it by chance i knew it by the names and the initials and in it there was one little verse that seemed to call me read and find him i will see that you go not in the wet 
 
 in the garret four little chests all in a row dim with dust and worn by time all fashioned and filled long ago by children now in their prime four little keys hung side by side with faded ribbons brave and gay when fastened there with childish pride long ago on a rainy day four little names one on each lid carved out by a boyish hand and underneath there lieth hid histories of the happpy band once playing here and pausing oft to hear the sweet refrain that came and went on the roof aloft in the falling summer rain 
 
 meg on the first lid smooth and fair i look in with loving eyes for folded here with care a goodly gathering lies the record of a peaceful life gifts to gentle child and girl a bridal gown lines to a wife a tiny shoe a baby curl no toys in this first chest remain for all are carried away in their old age to join again in another small play ah happy mother well i know you hear like a sweet refrain lullabies ever soft and low in the falling summer rain 
 
 jo on the next lid scratched and worn and within a motley store of headless dolls of schoolbooks torn birds and beasts that speak no more spoils brought home from the fairy ground only trod by youthful feet dreams of a future never found memories of a past still sweet poems stories wild april letters warm and cold diaries of a wilful child hints of a woman early old a woman in a lonely home hearing like a sad refrain be worthy love and love will come in the falling summer rain 
 
 my beth the dust is always swept from the lid that bears your name as if by loving eyes that wept by careful hands that often came death cannonized for us one saint ever less human than divine and still we lay with tender plaint relics in this household shrine the silver bell so seldom rung the little cap which last she wore the fair dead catherine that hung by angels borne above her door the songs she sang without lament in her of pain forever are they sweetly blent with the falling summer rain 
 
 upon the last polished field legend now both fair and true a gallant knight bears on his shield amy in letters gold and blue within lie snoods that bound her hair slippers that have danced their last faded flowers laid by with care fans whose airy toils are past gay valentines all ardent flames trifles that have borne their part in girlish hopes and fears and shames the record of a maiden heart now learning fairer truer spells hearing like a blithe refrain the silver sound of bridal bells in the falling summer rain 
 
 four little chests all in a row dim with dust and worn by time four women taught by weal and woe to love and labor in their prime four sisters parted for an hour none lost one only gone before made by immortal power nearest and dearest evermore oh when these hidden stores of ours lie open to the sight may they be rich in golden hours deeds that show fairer for the light lives whose brave music long shall ring like a strain souls that shall gladly soar and sing in the long sunshine after rain 
 
 very bad poetry but i felt it when i wrote it one day when i was very lonely and had a good cry on a rag bag i never thought it would go where it could tell tales said jo tearing up the verses the professor had treasured so long 
 
 let it go it has done duty and i will haf a fresh one when i read all the brown book in which she keeps her little secrets said mr bhaer with a smile as he watched the fragments fly away on the wind yes he added earnestly i read that and i think to myself she has a sorrow she is lonely she would find comfort in true love i haf a heart full full for her shall i not go and say if this is not too poor a thing to gif for what i shall hope to receive take it in name 
 
 and so you came to find that it was not too poor but the one precious thing i needed whispered jo 
 
 i had no courage to think that at first heavenly kind as was your welcome to me but soon i began to hope and then i said i will haf her if i die for it and so i will cried mr bhaer with a defiant nod as if the walls of mist closing round them were barriers which he was to surmount or valiantly knock down 
 
 jo thought that was splendid and resolved to be worthy of her knight though he did not come prancing on a charger in gorgeous array 
 
 what made you stay away so long she asked presently finding it so pleasant to ask confidential questions and get delightful answers that she could not keep silent 
 
 it was not easy but i could not find the heart to take you from that so happy home until i could haf a prospect of one to gif you after much time perhaps and hard work how could i ask you to gif up so much for a poor old fellow who has no fortune but a little learning 
 
 glad you are poor i bear a rich husband said jo decidedly adding in a softer tone fear poverty known it long enough to lose my dread and be happy working for those i love and call yourself is the prime of life i help loving you if you were seventy 
 
 the professor found that so touching that he would have been glad of his handkerchief if he could have got at it as her jo wiped his eyes for him and said laughing as she took away a bundle or two 
 
 i may be but no one can say out of my sphere now for special mission is supposed to be drying tears and bearing burdens to carry my share friedrich and help to earn the home make up your mind to that or never go she added resolutely as he tried to reclaim his load 
 
 we shall see haf you patience to wait a long time jo i must go away and do my work alone i must help my boys first because even for you i may not break my word to minna can you forgif that and be happy while we hope and wait 
 yes i know i can for we love one another and that makes all the rest easy to bear i have my duty also and my work i enjoy myself if i neglected them even for you so no need of hurry or impatience you can do your part out west i can do mine here and both be happy hoping for the best and leaving the future to be as god wills 
 ah thou gifest me such hope and courage and i haf nothing to gif back but a full heart and these empty hands cried the professor quite overcome 
 jo never never would learn to be proper for when he said that as they stood upon the steps she just put both hands into his whispering tenderly not empty now and stooping down kissed her friedrich under the umbrella it was dreadful but she would have done it if the flock of sparrows on the hedge had been human beings for she was very far gone indeed and quite regardless of everything but her own happiness though it came in such a very simple guise that was the crowning moment of both their lives when turning from the night and storm and loneliness to the household light and warmth and peace waiting to receive them with a glad welcome home jo led her lover in and shut the door

 chapter 
 
 while laurie and amy were taking conjugal strolls over velvet carpets as they set their house in order and planned a blissful future mr bhaer and jo were enjoying promenades of a different sort along muddy roads and sodden fields 
 
 i always do take a walk toward evening and i know why i should give it up just because i happen to meet the professor on his way out said jo to herself after two or three encounters for though there were two paths to whichever one she took she was sure to meet him either going or returning 
 he was always walking rapidly and never seemed to see her until quite close when he would look as if his eyes had failed to recognize the approaching lady till that moment then if she was going to he always had something for the babies if her face was turned homeward he had merely strolled down to see the river and was just returning unless they were tired of his frequent calls 
 
 under the circumstances what could jo do but greet him civilly and invite him in if she was tired of his visits she concealed her weariness with perfect skill and took care that there should be coffee for supper as mean mr like tea 
 
 by the second week everyone knew perfectly well what was going on yet everyone tried to look as if they were to the changes in face they never asked why she sang about her work did up her hair three times a day and got so blooming with her evening exercise and no one seemed to have the slightest suspicion that professor bhaer while talking philosophy with the father was giving the daughter lessons in love 
 
 jo even lose her heart in a decorous manner but sternly tried to quench her feelings and failing to do so led a somewhat agitated life she was mortally afraid of being laughed at for surrendering after her many and vehement declarations of independence laurie was her especial dread but thanks to the new manager he behaved with praiseworthy propriety never called mr bhaer a capital old fellow in public never alluded in the remotest manner to improved appearance or expressed the least surprise at seeing the hat on the marches table nearly every evening but he exulted in private and longed for the time to come when he could give jo a piece of plate with a bear and a ragged staff on it as an appropriate coat of arms 
 
 for a fortnight the professor came and went with regularity then he stayed away for three whole days and made no sign a proceeding which caused everybody to look sober and jo to become pensive at first and for cross 
 
 disgusted i dare say and gone home as suddenly as he came nothing tome of course but i should think he would have come and bid us goodbye like a gentleman she said to herself with a despairing look at the gate as she put on her things for the customary walk one dull afternoon 
 
 better take the little umbrella dear it looks like rain said her mother observing that she had on her new bonnet but not alluding to the fact 
 yes marmee do you want anything in town got to run in and get some paper returned jo pulling out the bow under her chin before the glass as an excuse for not looking at her mother 
 
 yes i want some twilled silesia a paper of number nine needles and two yards of narrow lavender ribbon have you got your thick boots on and something warm under your cloak 
 
 i believe so answered jo absently 
 
 if you happen to meet mr bhaer bring him home to tea i quite long to see the dear man added mrs march 
 
 jo heard that but made no answer except to kiss her mother and walk rapidly away thinking with a glow of gratitude in spite of her heartache how good she is to me what do girls do who any mothers to help them through their troubles 
 
 the stores were not down among the banks and wholesale warerooms where gentlemen most do congregate but jo found herself in that part of the city before she did a single errand loitering along as if waiting for someone examining engineering instruments in one window and samples of wool in another with most unfeminine interest tumbling over by descending bales and hustled unceremoniously by busy men who looked as if they wondered how the deuce she got there a drop of rain on her cheek recalled her thoughts from baffled hopes to ruined ribbons for the drops continued to fall and being a woman as well as a lover she felt that though it was too late to save her heart she might her bonnet now she remembered the little umbrella which she had forgotten to take in her hurry to be off but regret was unavailing and nothing could be done but borrow one or submit to to a drenching she looked up at the lowering sky down at the crimson bow already flecked with black forward along the muddy street then one long lingering look behind at a certain grimy warehouse with hoffmann swartz co over the door and said to herself with a sternly reproachful air 
 
 it serves me right what business had i to put on all my best things and come philandering down here hoping to see the professor jo ashamed of you no you shall not go there to borrow an umbrella or find out where he is from his friends you shall trudge away and do your errands in the rain and if you catch your death and ruin your bonnet no more than you deserve now then 
 
 with that she rushed across the street so impetuously that she narrowly escaped annihilation from a passing truck and precipitated herself into the arms of a stately old gentleman who said i beg pardon and looked mortally offended somewhat daunted jo righted herself spread her handkerchief over the devoted ribbons and putting temptation behind her hurried on with increasing dampness about the ankles and much clashing of umbrellas overhead the fact that a somewhat dilapidated blue one remained stationary above the unprotected bonnet attracted her attention and looking up she saw mr bhaer looking down 
 
 i feel to know the lady who goes so bravely under many horse noses and so fast through much mus what do you down here my friend 
 
 shopping 
 mr bhaer smiled as he glanced from the pickle factory on one side to the wholesale hide and leather concern on the other but her only said politely you haf no umbrella may i go also and take for you the bundles 
 
 yes thank you 
 cheeks were as red as her ribbon and she wondered what he thought of her but she care for in a minute she found herself walking away arm in arm with her professor feeling as if the sun had suddenly burst out with uncommon brilliancy that the world was all right again and that one thoroughly happy woman was paddling through the wet that day 
 
 we thought you had gone said jo hastily for she knew he was looking at her her bonnet big enough to hide her face and she feared he might think the joy it betrayed unmaidenly 
 
 did you believe that i should go with no farewell to those who haf been so heavenly kind tome he asked so reproachfully that she felt as if she had insulted him by the suggestion and answered heartily 
 
 no i i knew you were busy about your own affairs but we rather missed you father and mother especially 
 
 and you 
 
 always glad to see you sir 
 
 in her anxiety to keep her voice quite calm jo made it rather cool and the frosty little monosyllable at the end seemed to chill the professor for his smile vanished as he said gravely 
 
 i thank you and come one more time before i go 
 
 you are going then 
 
 i haf no longer any business here it is done 
 
 successfully i hope said jo for the bitterness of disappointment was in that short reply of his 
 
 i ought to think so for i haf a way opened to me by which i can make my bread and gif my junglings much help 
 
 tell me please i like to know all about boys said jo eagerly 
 
 that is so kind i gladly tell you my friends find for mea place in a college where i teach as at home and earn enough to make the way smooth for franz and emil for this i should be grateful should i not 
 
 indeed you should how splendid it will be to have you doing what you like and be able to see you often and the boys cried jo clinging to the lads as an excuse for the satisfaction she could not help betraying 
 
 ah but we shall not meet often i fear this place is at the west 
 
 so far away and jo left her skirts to their fate as if it matter now what became of her clothes or herself 
 
 mr bhaer could read several languages but he had not learned to read women yet he flattered himself that he knew jo pretty well and was therefore much amazed by the contradictions of voice face and manner which she showed him in rapid succession that day for she was in half a dozen different moods in the course of half an hour when she met him she looked surprised though it was impossible to help suspecting that she had come for that express purpose when he offered her his arm she took it with a look that filled him with delight but when he asked if she missed him she gave such fell upon him on learning his good fortune she almost clappedherhands was the joy all for the boys then on hearing his destination she said so far away in a tone of despair that lifted him on to a pinnacle of hope but the next minute she tumbled him down again by observing like one entirely absorbed in the matter 
 
 the place for my errands will you come in it take long 
 
 jo rather prided herself upon her shopping capabilities and particularly wished to impress her escort with the neatness and dispatch with which she would accomplish the business but owing to the flutter she was in everything went amiss she upset the tray of needles forgot the silesia was to be twilled till it was cut off gave the wrong change and covered herself with confusion by asking for lavender ribbon at the calico counter mr bhaer stood by watching her blush and blunder and as he watched his own bewilderment seemed to subside for he was beginning to see that on some occasions women like dreams go by contraries 
 
 when they came out he put the parcel under his arm with a more cheerful aspect and splashed through the puddles as if he rather enjoyed it on the whole 
 
 should we no do a little what you call shopping for the babies and haf a farewell feast tonight if i go for my last call at your so pleasant home he asked stopping before a window full of fruit and flowers 
 
 what will we buy asked jo ignoring the latter part of his speech and sniffing the mingled odors with an affectation of delight as they went in 
 
 may they haf oranges and figs asked mr bhaer with a paternal air 
 
 they eat them when they can get them 
 do you care for nuts 
 
 like a squirrel 
 
 hamburg grapes yes we shall drink to the fatherland in those 
 
 jo frowned upon that piece of extravagance and asked why he buy a frail of dated a cask of raisins and a bag of almonds and be done with it whereat mr bhaer confiscated her purse produced his own and finished the marketing by buying several pounds of grapes a pot of rosy daisies and a pretty jar of honey to be regarded in the light of a demijohn then distorting his pockets with knobby bundles and giving her the flowers to hold he put up the old umbrella and they traveled on again 
 
 miss marsch i haf a great favor to ask of you began the professor after a moist promenade of half a block 
 
 yes sir and heart began to beat so hard she was afraid he would hear it 
 
 i am bold to say it in spite of the rain because so short a time remains to me 
 
 yes sir and jo nearly crushed the small flowerpot with the sudden squeeze she gave it 
 
 i wish to get a little dress for my tina and i am too stupid to go alone will you kindly gif me a word of taste and help 
 
 yes sir and jo felt as calm and cool all of a sudden as if she had stepped into a refrigerator 
 
 perhaps also a shawl for mother she is so poor and sick and the husband is such a care yes yes a thick warm shawl would be a friendly thing to take the little mother 
 
 do it with pleasure mr bhaer going very fast and getting dearer every minute added jo to herself then with a mental shake she entered into the business with an energy that was pleasant to behold mr bhaer left it all to her so she chose a pretty gown for tina and then ordered out the shawls the clerk being a married man condescended to take an interest in the couple who appeared to be shopping for their family 
 
 your lady may prefer this a superior article a most desirable color quite chaste and genteel he said shaking out a comfortable gray shawl and throwing it over shoulders 
 
 does this suit you mr bhaer she asked turning her back to him and feeling deeply grateful for the chance of hiding her face excellently well we will haf it answered the professor smiling to himself as he paid for it while jo continued to rummage the counters like a confirmed 
 
 now shall we go home he asked as if the words were very pleasant to him 
 
 yes late and so tired voice was more pathetic than she knew for now the sun seemed to have gone in as suddenly as it came out and the world grew muddy and miserable again and for the first time she discovered that her feet were cold her head ached and that her heart was colder than the former fuller of pain than the latter mr bhaer was going away he only cared for her as a friend it was all a mistake and the sooner it was over the better with this idea in her head she hailed an approaching omnibus with such a hasty gesture that the daisies flew out of the pot and were badly damaged

 jo never never would learn to be proper for when he said that as they stood upon the steps she just put both hands into his whispering tenderly not empty now and stooping down kissed her friedrich under the umbrella it was dreadful but she would have done it if the flock of sparrows on the hedge had been human beings for she was very far gone indeed and quite regardless of everything but her own happiness though it came in such a very simple guise that was the crowning moment of both their lives when turning from the night and storm and loneliness to the household light and warmth and peace waiting to receive them with a glad welcome home jo led her lover in and shut the door

 fairy tales of hans christian andersen 
 the dryad 
 by hans christian andersen 
 
 we are travelling to paris to the exhibition 
 
 now we are there that was a journey a flight without magic we 
 flew on the wings of steam over the sea and across the land 
 
 yes our time is the time of fairy tales 
 
 we are in the midst of paris in a great hotel blooming flowers 
 ornament the staircases and soft carpets the floors 
 
 our room is a very cosy one and through the open balcony door 
 we have a view of a great square spring lives down there it has come to paris and arrived at the same time with us it has come in the 
 shape of a glorious young chestnut tree with delicate leaves newly 
 opened how the tree gleams dressed in its spring garb before all 
 the other trees in the place one of these latter had been struck 
 out of the list of living trees it lies on the ground with roots 
 exposed on the place where it stood the young chestnut tree is to be 
 planted and to flourish 
 
 it still stands towering aloft on the heavy wagon which has 
 brought it this morning a distance of several miles to paris for 
 years it had stood there in the protection of a mighty oak tree 
 under which the old venerable clergyman had often sat with children 
 listening to his stories 
 
 the young chestnut tree had also listened to the stories for 
 the dryad who lived in it was a child also she remembered the time 
 when the tree was so little that it only projected a short way above 
 the grass and ferns around these were as tall as they would ever 
 be but the tree grew every year and enjoyed the air and the 
 sunshine and drank the dew and the rain several times it was also 
 as it must be well shaken by the wind and the rain for that is a 
 part of education 
 
 the dryad rejoiced in her life and rejoiced in the sunshine 
 and the singing of the birds but she was most rejoiced at human 
 voices she understood the language of men as well as she understood that of animals 
 
 butterflies cockchafers everything that could 
 fly came to pay a visit they could all talk they told of the 
 village of the vineyard of the forest of the old castle with its 
 parks and canals and ponds down in the water dwelt also living 
 beings which in their way could fly under the water from one 
 place to another beings with knowledge and delineation they said 
 nothing at all they were so clever 
 
 and the swallow who had dived told about the pretty little 
 goldfish of the thick turbot the fat brill and the old carp the 
 swallow could describe all that very well but self is the man she 
 said one ought to see these things self but how was the 
 dryad ever to see such beings she was obliged to be satisfied with 
 being able to look over the beautiful country and see the busy 
 industry of men 
 
 it was glorious but most glorious of all when the old clergyman 
 sat under the oak tree and talked of france and of the great deeds of 
 her sons and daughters whose names will be mentioned with 
 admiration through all time 
 
 then the dryad heard of the shepherd girl joan of arc and of 
 charlotte corday she heard about henry the fourth and napoleon the first she heard names whose echo sounds in the hearts of the people 
 
 the village children listened attentively and the dryad no less 
 attentively she became a with the rest in the clouds 
 that went sailing by she saw picture by picture everything that 
 she heard talked about the cloudy sky was her 
 she felt so happy in beautiful france the fruitful land of 
 genius with the crater of freedom but in her heart the sting 
 remained that the bird that every animal that could fly was much 
 better off than she even the fly could look about more in the 
 world far beyond the horizon 
 
 france was so great and so glorious but she could only look 
 across a little piece of it the land stretched out 
 with vineyards forests and great cities of all these paris was the 
 most splendid and the mightiest the birds could get there but she 
 never 
 
 among the village children was a little ragged poor girl but a 
 pretty one to look at she was always laughing or singing and 
 twining red flowers in her black hair 
 
 go to paris the old clergyman warned her poor child if 
 you go there it will be your ruin 
 
 but she went for all that 
 
 the dryad often thought of her for she had the same wish and 
 felt the same longing for the great city 
 the tree was bearing its first chestnut blossoms the 
 birds were twittering round them in the most beautiful sunshine 
 then a stately carriage came rolling along that way and in it sat a 
 grand lady driving the spirited horses on the back seat 
 a little smart groom balanced himself the dryad knew the lady and 
 the old clergyman knew her also he shook his head gravely when he saw her and said 
 
 so you went there after all and it was your ruin poor mary 
 that one poor thought the dryad no she wears a dress fit for 
 a countess she had become one in the city of magic changes oh if i were only there amid all the splendor and pomp they shine up 
 into the very clouds at night when i look up i can tell in what 
 direction the town lies 
 
 towards that direction the dryad looked every evening she saw 
 in the dark night the gleaming cloud on the horizon in the clear 
 moonlight nights she missed the sailing clouds which showed her 
 pictures of the city and pictures from history 
 
 the child grasps at the the dryad grasped at the 
 her a sudden cloudless sky was for her a blank leaf and for several days she had only had such leaves before 
 her 
 
 it was in the warm not a breeze moved through the 
 glowing hot days every leaf every flower lay as if it were 
 torpid and the people seemed torpid too 
 
 then the clouds arose and covered the region round about where the 
 gleaming mist announced here lies paris 
 
 the clouds piled themselves up like a chain of mountains 
 hurried on through the air and spread themselves abroad over the 
 whole landscape as far as the eye could reach 
 
 like enormous blocks of rock the clouds lay piled over 
 one another gleams of lightning shot forth from them 
 
 these also are the servants of the lord god the old clergyman 
 had said and there came a bluish dazzling flash of lightning a 
 lighting up as if of the sun itself which could burst blocks of 
 rock asunder the lightning struck and split to the roots the old 
 venerable oak the crown fell asunder it seemed as if the tree were 
 stretching forth its arms to clasp the messengers of the light 
 
 no bronze cannon can sound over the land at the birth of a royal 
 child as the thunder sounded at the death of the old oak the rain 
 streamed down a refreshing wind was blowing the storm had gone by and there was quite a holiday glow on all things the old clergyman spoke a few words for honorable remembrance and a painter made a drawing as a lasting record of the tree 
 
 everything passes away said the dryad passes away like a 
 cloud and never comes back 
 
 the old clergyman too did not come back the green roof of his 
 school was gone and his had vanished the children did not come but autumn came and winter came and then spring also in all this change of seasons the dryad looked toward the region where at night paris gleamed with its bright mist far on the horizon 
 
 forth from the town rushed engine after engine train after train 
 whistling and screaming at all hours in the day in the evening 
 towards midnight at daybreak and all the day through came the 
 trains out of each one and into each one streamed people from the 
 country of every king a new wonder of the world had summoned them to paris 
 
 in what form did this wonder exhibit itself 
 a splendid blossom of art and industry said one has 
 unfolded itself in the champ de mars a gigantic sunflower from whose petals one can learn geography and statistics and can become as wise as a lord mayor and raise self to the level of art and 
 poetry and study the greatness and power of the various lands 
 a fairy tale flower said another a which spreads out its green leaves like a velvet carpet over the sand the opening spring has brought it forth the summer will see it in all its splendor the autumn winds will sweep it away so that not a leaf not a fragment of its root shall remain 
 in front of the military school extends in time of peace the arena 
 of war a field without a blade of grass a piece of sandy steppe 
 as if cut out of the desert of africa where fata morgana displays her 
 wondrous airy castles and hanging gardens in the champ de mars 
 however these were to be seen more splendid more wonderful than in the east for human art had converted the airy deceptive scenes into reality 
 
 the palace of the present has been built it was said 
 
 day by day hour by hour it unfolds more of its wonderful splendor 
 
 the endless halls shine in marble and many colors master 
 bloodless here moves his limbs of steel and iron in the great 
 circular hall of machinery works of art in metal in stone in 
 gobelins tapestry announce the vitality of mind that is stirring in 
 every land halls of paintings splendor of flowers everything that 
 mind and skill can create in the workshop of the artisan has been 
 placed here for show even the memorials of ancient days out of old 
 graves and have appeared at this general meeting 
 the overpowering great variegated whole must be divided into small 
 portions and pressed together like a plaything if it is to be 
 understood and described 
 
 like a great table on christmas eve the champ de mars carried a 
 of industry and art and around this knickknacks from 
 all countries had been ranged knickknacks on a grand scale for every nation found some remembrance of home 
 
 here stood the royal palace of egypt there the caravanserai of 
 the desert land the bedouin had quitted his sunny country and 
 hastened by on his camel here stood the russian stables with the 
 fiery glorious horses of the steppe here stood the simple 
 dwelling of the danish peasant with the dannebrog 
 flag next to gustavus wooden house from dalarne with its 
 wonderful carvings american huts english cottages french pavilions kiosks theatres churches all strewn around and between them the fresh green turf the clear springing water blooming bushes rare trees hothouses in which one might fancy self transported into the tropical forest whole gardens brought from damascus and blooming under one roof what colors what fragrance 
 
 artificial grottoes surrounded bodies of fresh or salt water 
 and gave a glimpse into the empire of the fishes the visitor seemed 
 to wander at the bottom of the sea among fishes and polypi 
 all this they said the champ de mars offers and around 
 the great table the crowd of human beings moves like a 
 busy swarm of ants on foot or in little carriages for not all feet 
 are equal to such a fatiguing journey 
 
 hither they swarm from morning till late in the evening steamer 
 after steamer crowded with people glides down the seine the 
 number of carriages is continually on the increase the swarm of 
 people on foot and on horseback grows more and more dense carriages and omnibuses are crowded stuffed and embroidered with people all these tributary streams flow in one direction towards the exhibition 
 
 on every entrance the flag of france is displayed around the 
 bazaar wave the flags of all nations there is a humming and a 
 murmuring from the hall of the machines from the towers the melody of the chimes is heard with the tones of the organs in the churches 
 mingle the hoarse nasal songs from the cafes of the east it is a 
 kingdom of babel a wonder of the world 
 
 in very truth it was what all the reports said and who 
 did not hear them the dryad knew everything that is told here of 
 the new wonder in the city of cities 
 
 fly away ye birds fly away to see and then come back and 
 tell me said the dryad 
 
 the wish became an intense desire became the one thought of a 
 life then in the quiet silent night while the full moon was 
 shining the dryad saw a spark fly out of the disc and fall 
 like a shooting star and before the tree whose leaves waved to and 
 fro as if they were stirred by a tempest stood a noble mighty and 
 grand figure in tones that were at once rich and strong like the 
 trumpet of the last judgment bidding farewell to life and summoning to the great account it said 
 
 thou shalt go to the city of magic thou shalt take root there 
 and enjoy the mighty rushing breezes the air and the sunshine 
 there but the time of thy life shall then be shortened the line of 
 years that awaited thee here amid the free nature shall shrink to 
 but a small tale poor dryad it shall be thy destruction thy 
 yearning and longing will increase thy desire will grow more 
 stormy the tree itself will be as a prison to thee thou wilt quit 
 thy cell and give up thy nature to fly out and mingle among men 
 then the years that would have belonged to thee will be contracted 
 to half the span of the ephemeral fly that lives but a day one 
 night and thy shall be blown out the leaves of the tree 
 will wither and be blown away to become green never again 
 thus the words sounded and the light vanished away but not the 
 longing of the dryad she trembled in the wild fever of expectation 
 i shall go there she cried rejoicingly life is beginning and 
 swells like a cloud nobody knows whither it is hastening 
 when the gray dawn arose and the moon turned pale and the clouds 
 were tinted red the hour struck the words of promise were fulfilled 
 
 people appeared with spades and poles they dug round the roots of 
 the tree deeper and deeper and beneath it a wagon was brought 
 out drawn by many horses and the tree was lifted up with its 
 roots and the lumps of earth that adhered to them matting was 
 placed around the roots as though the tree had its feet in a warm 
 bag and now the tree was lifted on the wagon and secured with chains 
 
 the journey began the journey to paris there the tree was to grow as an ornament to the city of french glory 
 
 the twigs and the leaves of the chestnut tree trembled in the 
 first moments of its being moved and the dryad trembled in the 
 pleasurable feeling of expectation 
 
 away away it sounded in every beat of her pulse away 
 away sounded in words that flew trembling along the dryad forgot 
 to bid farewell to the regions of home she thought not of the 
 waving grass and of the innocent daisies which had looked up to her 
 as to a great lady a young princess playing at being a shepherdess 
 out in the open air 
 
 the chestnut tree stood upon the wagon and nodded his branches 
 whether this meant farewell or forward the dryad knew not she 
 dreamed only of the marvellous new things that seemed yet so 
 familiar and that were to unfold themselves before her no 
 heart rejoicing in innocence no heart whose blood danced with 
 passion had set out on the journey to paris more full of 
 expectation than she 
 
 her farewell sounded in the words away away 
 the wheels turned the distant approached the present vanished 
 the region was changed even as the clouds change new vineyards 
 forests villages villas appeared came nearer vanished 
 
 the chestnut tree moved forward and the dryad went with it 
 after rushed past sending up into the air 
 vapory clouds that formed figures which told of paris whence they 
 came and whither the dryad was going 
 
 everything around knew it and must know whither she was bound it 
 seemed to her as if every tree she passed stretched out its leaves 
 towards her with the prayer take me with you take me with you 
 for every tree enclosed a longing dryad 
 
 what changes during this flight houses seemed to be rising out of 
 the earth more and more thicker and thicker the chimneys rose 
 like ranged side by side or in rows one above the 
 other on the roofs great inscriptions in letters a yard long and 
 figures in various colors covering the walls from cornice to 
 basement came brightly out 
 
 where does paris begin and when shall i be there asked the 
 dryad 
 
 the crowd of people grew the tumult and the bustle increased 
 carriage followed upon carriage people on foot and people on 
 horseback were mingled together all around were shops on shops music and song crying and talking 
 
 the dryad in her tree was now in the midst of paris the great 
 heavy wagon all at once stopped on a little square planted with trees 
 the high houses around had all of them balconies to the windows 
 from which the inhabitants looked down upon the young fresh chestnut tree which was coming to be planted here as a substitute for the dead tree that lay stretched on the ground 
 
 the stood still and smiled in admiration of its pure 
 vernal freshness the older trees whose buds were still closed 
 whispered with their waving branches welcome welcome the 
 fountain throwing its jet of water high up in the air to let it fall 
 again in the wide stone basin told the wind to sprinkle the 
 with pearly drops as if it wished to give him a refreshing draught to 
 welcome him 
 
 the dryad felt how her tree was being lifted from the wagon to 
 be placed in the spot where it was to stand the roots were covered 
 with earth and fresh turf was laid on top blooming shrubs and 
 flowers in pots were ranged around and thus a little garden arose 
 in the square 
 
 the tree that had been killed by the fumes of gas the steam of 
 kitchens and the bad air of the city was put upon the wagon and 
 driven away the looked on children and old men sat upon the bench and looked at the green tree and we who are telling this story stood upon a balcony and looked down upon the green spring sight that had been brought in from the fresh country air and said what the old clergyman would have said poor dryad 
 
 i am happy i am happy the dryad cried rejoicing and yet i 
 cannot realize cannot describe what i feel everything is as i 
 fancied it and yet as i did not fancy it 
 
 the houses stood there so lofty so close the sunlight shone 
 on only one of the walls and that one was stuck over with bills and 
 placards before which the people stood still and this made a crowd 
 carriages rushed past carriages rolled past light ones and heavy 
 ones mingled together omnibuses those moving houses came rattling by horsemen galloped among them even carts and wagons asserted their rights 
 
 the dryad asked herself if these houses which stood so 
 close around her would not remove and take other shapes like the 
 clouds in the sky and draw aside so that she might cast a glance 
 into paris and over it notre dame must show itself the vendome 
 column and the wondrous building which had called and was still 
 calling so many strangers to the city 
 
 but the houses did not stir from their places it was yet day when 
 the lamps were lit the gleamed from the shops and shone 
 even into the branches of the trees so that it was like sunlight in 
 summer the stars above made their appearance the same to which the dryad had looked up in her home she thought she felt a clear pure stream of air which went forth from them she felt herself lifted up and strengthened and felt an increased power of seeing through 
 every leaf and through every fibre of the root amid all the noise and 
 the turmoil the colors and the lights she knew herself watched by 
 mild eyes 
 
 from the side streets sounded the merry notes of fiddles and 
 wind instruments up to the dance to the dance to jollity and 
 pleasure that was their invitation such music it was that horses 
 carriages trees and houses would have danced if they had known how 
 
 the charm of intoxicating delight filled the bosom of the dryad 
 
 how glorious how splendid it is she cried rejoicingly now i 
 am in paris 
 
 the next day that dawned the next night that fell offered the 
 same spectacle similar bustle similar life changing indeed yet 
 always the same and thus it went on through the sequence of days 
 now i know every tree every flower on the square here i know 
 every house every balcony every shop in this narrow 
 corner where i am denied the sight of this great mighty city where 
 are the arches of triumph the boulevards the wondrous building of 
 the world i see nothing of all this as if shut up in a cage i stand 
 among the high houses which i now know by heart with their 
 inscriptions signs and placards all the painted confectionery that 
 is no longer to my taste where are all the things of which i heard 
 for which i longed and for whose sake i wanted to come hither what have i seized found won i feel the same longing i felt before i 
 feel that there is a life i should wish to grasp and to experience 
 i must go out into the ranks of living men and mingle among them i 
 must fly about like a bird i must see and feel and become human 
 altogether i must enjoy the one instead of vegetating for 
 years in sameness and weariness in which i become ill 
 and at last sink and disappear like the dew on the meadows i will 
 gleam like the cloud gleam in the sunshine of life look out over the 
 whole like the cloud and pass away like it no one knoweth whither 
 thus sighed the dryad and she prayed 
 
 take from me the years that were destined for me and give me but 
 half of the life of the ephemeral fly deliver me from my prison give 
 me human life human happiness only a short span only the one it cannot be otherwise and then punish me for my wish to live my longing for life strike me out of thy list let my shell the 
 fresh young tree wither or be hewn down and burnt to ashes and 
 scattered to all the winds 
 
 a rustling went through the leaves of the tree there was a 
 trembling in each of the leaves it seemed as if fire streamed through 
 it a gust of wind shook its green crown and from the midst of that 
 crown a female figure came forth in the same moment she was sitting 
 beneath the leafy branches young and beautiful 
 to behold like poor mary to whom the clergyman had said the 
 great city will be thy destruction 
 
 the dryad sat at the foot of the tree at her house door which 
 she had locked and whose key had thrown away so young so fair 
 the stars saw her and blinked at her the saw her and 
 gleamed and beckoned to her how delicate she was and yet how 
 blooming a child and yet a grown maiden her dress was fine as 
 silk green as the leaves on the crown of the tree 
 in her hair clung a chestnut blossom she looked like the goddess of spring 
 
 for one short minute she sat motionless then she sprang up 
 and light as a gazelle she hurried away she ran and sprang like the 
 reflection from the mirror that carried by the sunshine is cast now 
 here now there could any one have followed her with his eyes he 
 would have seen how marvellously her dress and her form changed 
 according to the nature of the house or the place whose light happened to shine upon her 
 
 she reached the boulevards here a sea of light streamed forth 
 from the of the lamps the shops and the cafes here 
 stood in a row young and slender trees each of which concealed its 
 dryad and gave shade from the artificial sunlight the whole vast 
 pavement was one great festive hall where covered tables stood 
 laden with refreshments of all kinds from champagne and chartreuse 
 down to coffee and beer here was an exhibition of flowers statues 
 books and colored stuffs 
 
 from the crowd close by the lofty houses she looked forth over the 
 terrific stream beyond the rows of trees yonder heaved a stream of 
 rolling carriages cabriolets coaches omnibuses cabs and among 
 them riding gentlemen and marching troops to cross to the opposite 
 shore was an undertaking fraught with danger to life and limb now 
 lanterns shed their radiance abroad now the gas had the upper hand 
 suddenly a rocket rises whence whither 
 
 here are sounds of soft italian melodies yonder spanish songs 
 are sung accompanied by the rattle of the castanets but strongest of 
 all and predominating over the rest the tunes of the 
 moment the exciting music which orpheus never knew and which was never heard by the belle helene even the barrow was tempted to hop upon one of its wheels 
 
 the dryad danced floated flew changing her color every 
 moment like a in the sunshine each house with the 
 world belonging to it gave her its own reflections 
 
 as the glowing torn from its stem is carried away 
 by the stream so the dryad drifted along whenever she paused she 
 was another being so that none was able to follow her to recognize 
 her or to look more closely at her 
 
 like all things flew by her she looked into a 
 thousand faces but not one was familiar to her she saw not a 
 single form from home two bright eyes had remained in her memory she thought of mary poor mary the ragged merry child who wore the red flowers in her black hair mary was now here in the rich and magnificent as in that day when she drove past the house of the old clergyman and past the tree of the dryad the old oak 
 
 here she was certainly living in the deafening tumult perhaps 
 she had just stepped out of one of the gorgeous carriages in 
 waiting handsome equipages with coachmen in gold braid and footmen in silken hose drove up the people who alighted from them were all ladies they went through the opened gate and ascended the broad staircase that led to a building resting on marble pillars was this building perhaps the wonder of the world 
 there mary would certainly be found 
 
 sancta maria resounded from the interior incense floated 
 through the lofty painted and gilded aisles where a solemn twilight 
 reigned 
 
 it was the church of the madeleine 
 
 clad in black garments of the most costly stuffs fashioned 
 according to the latest mode the rich feminine world of paris 
 glided across the shining pavement the crests of the proprietors were engraved on silver shields on the and embroidered in the corners of perfumed handkerchiefs bordered with brussels lace a few of the ladies were kneeling in silent prayer 
 before the altars others resorted to the confessionals 
 
 anxiety and fear took possession of the dryad she felt as if 
 she had entered a place where she had no right to be here was the 
 abode of silence the hall of secrets everything was said in 
 whispers every word was a mystery 
 
 the dryad saw herself enveloped in lace and silk like the women 
 of wealth and of high birth around her had perhaps every one of 
 them a longing in her breast like the dryad 
 
 a deep painful sigh was heard did it escape from some 
 confessional in a distant corner or from the bosom of the dryad 
 she drew the veil closer around her she breathed incense and not the 
 fresh air here was not the of her longing 
 
 away away a hastening without rest the ephemeral fly knows 
 not repose for her existence is flight 
 
 she was out again among the gas candelabra by a magnificent 
 fountain 
 
 all its streaming waters are not able to wash out the innocent 
 blood that was spilt here 
 
 such were the words spoken strangers stood around carrying on 
 a lively conversation such as no one would have dared to carry on 
 in the gorgeous hall of secrets whence the dryad came 
 
 a heavy stone slab was turned and then lifted she did not 
 understand why she saw an opening that led into the depths below 
 the strangers stepped down leaving the starlit air and the cheerful 
 life of the upper world behind them 
 
 i am afraid said one of the women who stood around to her 
 husband i cannot venture to go down nor do i care for the wonders down yonder you had better stay here with me 
 
 indeed and travel home said the man and quit paris without 
 having seen the most wonderful thing of all the real wonder of the 
 present period created by the power and resolution of one man 
 i will not go down for all that was the reply 
 
 the wonder of the present time it had been called the dryad 
 had heard and had understood it the goal of her ardent longing had 
 thus been reached and here was the entrance to it down into the 
 depths below paris she had not thought of such a thing but now she heard it said and saw the strangers descending and went after them 
 
 the staircase was of cast iron spiral broad and easy below 
 there burned a lamp and farther down another they stood in a 
 labyrinth of endless halls and arched passages all communicating with each other all the streets and lanes of paris were to be seen here 
 again as in a dim reflection the names were painted up and every 
 house above had its number down here also and struck its roots 
 under the macadamized quays of a broad canal in which the muddy water flowed onward over it the fresh streaming water was carried on arches and quite at the top hung the tangled net of and 
 
 
 in the distance lamps gleamed like a reflection from the 
 above every now and then a dull rumbling was heard this came from the heavy wagons rolling over the entrance bridges 
 
 whither had the dryad come 
 
 you have no doubt heard of the catacombs now they are vanishing points in that new underground world that wonder of the present day the sewers of paris the dryad was there and not in the 
 exhibition in the champ de mars 
 
 she heard exclamations of wonder and admiration 
 
 from here go forth health and life for thousands upon thousands 
 up yonder our time is the time of progress with its manifold 
 blessings 
 
 such was the opinion and the speech of men but not of those 
 creatures who had been born here and who built and dwelt here of the rats namely who were squeaking to one another in the clefts of a 
 crumbling wall quite plainly and in a way the dryad understood well 
 
 a big old with his tail bitten off was relieving 
 his feelings in loud squeaks and his family gave their tribute of 
 concurrence to every word he said 
 
 i am disgusted with this he cried with these 
 outbursts of ignorance a fine magnificence truly all made up of gas 
 and petroleum i eat such stuff as that everything here is so 
 fine and bright now that ashamed of self without exactly 
 knowing why ah if we only lived in the days of tallow candles and 
 it does not lie so very far behind us that was a romantic time as 
 one may say 
 
 what are you talking of there asked the dryad i have never 
 seen you before what is it you are talking about 
 
 of the glorious days that are gone said the rat of the 
 happy time of our and then it 
 was a great thing to get down here that was a nest quite 
 different from paris mother plague used to live here then she killed 
 people but never rats robbers and smugglers could breathe freely 
 here here was the of the most interesting personages 
 whom one now only gets to see in the theatres where they act 
 melodrama up above the time of romance is gone even in our 
 nest and here also fresh air and petroleum have broken in 
 
 thus squeaked the rat he squeaked in honor of the old time 
 when mother plague was still alive 
 
 a carriage stopped a kind of open omnibus drawn by swift horses 
 the company mounted and drove away along the boulevard de 
 sebastopol that is to say the underground boulevard over which 
 the crowded street of that name extended 
 
 the carriage disappeared in the twilight the dryad disappeared 
 lifted to the cheerful freshness above here and not below in the 
 vaulted passages filled with heavy air the wonder work must be found which she was to seek in her short lifetime it must gleam brighter than all the stronger than the moon that was just 
 gliding past 
 
 yes certainly she saw it yonder in the distance it gleamed 
 before her and twinkled and glittered like the evening star in the 
 sky 
 
 she saw a glittering portal open that led to a little garden 
 where all was brightness and dance music colored lamps surrounded 
 little lakes in which were of colored metal from 
 whose flowers jets of water spurted up beautiful weeping willows 
 real products of spring hung their fresh branches over these lakes 
 like a fresh green transparent and yet screening veil in the 
 bushes burnt an open fire throwing a red twilight over the quiet huts 
 of branches into which the sounds of music penetrated an ear 
 tickling intoxicating music that sent the blood coursing through the 
 veins 
 
 beautiful girls in festive attire with pleasant smiles on their 
 lips and the light spirit of youth in their hearts marys with 
 roses in their hair but without carriage and postilion flitted to 
 and fro in the wild dance 
 
 where were the heads where the feet as if stung by tarantulas 
 they sprang laughed rejoiced as if in their ecstacies they were 
 going to embrace all the world 
 
 the dryad felt herself torn with them into the whirl of the dance 
 round her delicate foot clung the silken boot chestnut brown in 
 color like the ribbon that floated from her hair down upon her bare 
 shoulders the green silk dress waved in large folds but did not 
 entirely hide the pretty foot and ankle 
 
 had she come to the enchanted garden of armida what was the 
 name of the place 
 
 the name glittered in over the entrance it was 
 mabille 
 
 the soaring upwards of rockets the splashing of fountains and 
 the popping of champagne corks accompanied the wild bacchantic 
 dance over the whole glided the moon through the air clear but with 
 a somewhat crooked face 
 
 a wild joviality seemed to rush through the dryad as though she 
 were intoxicated with opium her eyes spoke her lips spoke but the 
 sound of violins and of flutes drowned the sound of her voice her 
 partner whispered words to her which she did not understand nor do we understand them he stretched out his arms to draw her to him but he embraced only the empty air 
 
 the dryad had been carried away like a on the wind 
 before her she saw a flame in the air a flashing light high up on a 
 tower the beacon light shone from the goal of her longing shone from the red lighthouse tower of the fata morgana of the champ de mars 
 
 thither she was carried by the wind she circled round the tower 
 the workmen thought it was a butterfly that had come too early and 
 that now sank down dying 
 
 the moon shone bright spread light around through 
 the halls over the buildings scattered about over the 
 and the rocks produced by human ingenuity from which 
 waterfalls driven by the power of master bloodless fell down 
 the caverns of the sea the depths of the lakes the kingdom of the 
 fishes were opened here men walked as in the depths of the deep pond and held converse with the sea in the of glass the water pressed against the strong glass walls above and on every side 
 the polypi living creatures had fastened themselves to the 
 bottom and stretched out arms fathoms long for prey a big turbot 
 was making himself broad in front quietly enough but not without 
 casting some suspicious glances aside a crab clambered over him 
 looking like a gigantic spider while the shrimps wandered about in 
 restless haste like the butterflies and moths of the sea 
 
 in the fresh water grew nymphaea and reeds the 
 stood up below in rank and file all turning their heads 
 one way that the streaming water might flow into their mouths fat 
 carps stared at the glass wall with stupid eyes they knew that they 
 were here to be exhibited and that they had made the somewhat 
 toilsome journey hither in tubs filled with water and they thought 
 with dismay of the from which they had suffered so 
 cruelly on the railway 
 
 they had come to see the exhibition and now contemplated it 
 from their fresh or position they looked attentively at 
 the crowds of people who passed by them early and late all the 
 nations in the world they thought had made an exhibition of their 
 inhabitants for the edification of the soles and haddocks pike and 
 carp that they might give their opinions upon the different kinds 
 those are scaly animals said a little slimy whiting they put 
 on different scales two or three times a day and they emit sounds 
 which they call speaking we put on scales and we make 
 ourselves understood in an easier way simply by twitching the corners of our mouths and staring with our eyes we have a great many advantages over mankind 
 
 but they have learned swimming of us remarked a 
 codling you must know i come from the great sea outside in the 
 hot time of the year the people yonder go into the water first they 
 take off their scales and then they swim they have learnt from the 
 frogs to kick out with their hind legs and row with their fore 
 paws but they cannot hold out long they want to be like us but they cannot come up to us poor people 
 
 and the fishes stared they thought that the whole swarm of people 
 whom they had seen in the bright daylight were still moving around 
 them they were certain they still saw the same forms that had first 
 caught their attention 
 
 a pretty barbel with spotted skin and an enviably round back 
 declared that the human fry were still there 
 
 i can see a well human figure quite well said the 
 barbel she was called contumacious lady or something of that 
 kind she had a mouth and staring eyes like ours and a great balloon 
 at the back of her head and something like a umbrella in 
 front there were a lot of dangling bits of seaweed hanging about her 
 she ought to take all the rubbish off and go as we do then she would look something like a respectable barbel so far as it is possible for a person to look like one 
 
 become of that one whom they drew away with the hook he sat on a and had paper and pen and ink and wrote 
 down everything they called him a writer 
 
 going about with him still said a hoary old maid of a 
 carp who carried her misfortune about with her so that she was quite hoarse in her youth she had once swallowed a hook and still swam patiently about with it in her gullet a writer that means as we fishes describe it a kind of cuttle or among men 
 thus the fishes gossipped in their own way but in the artificial the laborers were busy who were obliged to take advantage of the hours of night to get their work done by daybreak they accompanied with blows of their hammers and with songs the parting words of the vanishing dryad 
 
 so at any rate i have seen you you pretty she 
 said yes i know you and she waved her hand to them i have known about you a long time in my home the swallow told me about you how beautiful you are how delicate and shining i should like to kiss every one of you you others also i know you all but you do not know me 
 
 the fishes stared out into the twilight they did not understand a 
 word of it 
 
 the dryad was there no longer she had been a long time in the 
 open air where the different countries the country of black bread 
 the codfish coast the kingdom of russia leather and the banks of 
 and the gardens of rose oil exhaled their perfumes 
 from the flower 
 
 when after a night at a ball we drive home half asleep and 
 half awake the melodies still sound plainly in our ears we hear 
 them and could sing them all from memory when the eye of the 
 murdered man closes the picture of what it saw last clings to it 
 for a time like a photographic picture 
 
 so it was likewise here the bustling life of day had not yet 
 disappeared in the quiet night the dryad had seen it she knew 
 thus it will be repeated tomorrow 
 
 the dryad stood among the fragrant roses and thought she knew 
 them and had seen them in her own home she also saw red 
 pomegranate flowers like those that little mary had worn in her 
 dark hair 
 
 remembrances from the home of her childhood flashed through her 
 thoughts her eyes eagerly drank in the prospect around and 
 feverish restlessness chased her through the halls 
 a weariness that increased continually took possession of her 
 she felt a longing to rest on the soft oriental carpets within or 
 to lean against the weeping willow without by the clear water but for 
 the ephemeral fly there was no rest in a few moments the day had 
 completed its circle 
 
 her thoughts trembled her limbs trembled she sank down on the 
 grass by the bubbling water 
 
 thou wilt ever spring living from the earth she said 
 mournfully moisten my tongue bring me a refreshing draught 
 
 i am no living water was the answer i only spring upward when 
 the machine wills it 
 
 give me something of thy freshness thou green grass implored 
 the dryad give me one of thy fragrant flowers 
 
 we must die if we are torn from our stalks replied the 
 flowers and the grass 
 
 give me a kiss thou fresh stream of air only a single 
 
 
 soon the sun will kiss the clouds red answered the wind 
 
 then thou wilt be among the dead blown away as all the splendor 
 here will be blown away before the year shall have ended then i can 
 play again with the light loose sand on the place here and whirl 
 the dust over the land and through the air all is dust 
 
 the dryad felt a terror like a woman who has cut asunder her 
 in the bath but is filled again with the love of life 
 even while she is bleeding to death she raised herself tottered 
 forward a few steps and sank down again at the entrance to a little 
 church the gate stood open lights were burning upon the altar and 
 the organ sounded 
 
 what music such notes the dryad had never yet heard and yet it 
 seemed to her as if she recognized a number of voices among them they came deep from the heart of all creation she thought she heard the stories of the old clergyman of great deeds and of the celebrated names and of the gifts that the creatures of god must bestow upon posterity if they would live on in the world 
 the tones of the organ swelled and in their song there sounded 
 these words 
 
 thy wishing and thy longing have torn thee with thy roots 
 from the place which god appointed for thee that was thy destruction thou poor dryad 
 
 the notes became soft and gentle and seemed to die away in a 
 wail 
 
 in the sky the clouds showed themselves with a ruddy gleam the 
 wind sighed pass away ye dead now the sun is going to rise 
 
 the first ray fell on the dryad her form was irradiated in 
 changing colors like the when it is bursting and 
 becomes a drop of water like a tear that falls and passes away like a 
 vapor 
 
 poor dryad only a only a tear poured upon the earth 
 and vanished away

 fairy tales of hans christian andersen 
 the dryad 
 by hans christian andersen 
 
 we are travelling to paris to the exhibition 
 
 now we are there that was a journey a flight without magic we 
 flew on the wings of steam over the sea and across the land 
 
 yes our time is the time of fairy tales 
 
 we are in the midst of paris in a great hotel blooming flowers 
 ornament the staircases and soft carpets the floors 
 
 our room is a very cosy one and through the open balcony door 
 we have a view of a great square spring lives down there it has come to paris and arrived at the same time with us it has come in the 
 shape of a glorious young chestnut tree with delicate leaves newly 
 opened how the tree gleams dressed in its spring garb before all 
 the other trees in the place one of these latter had been struck 
 out of the list of living trees it lies on the ground with roots 
 exposed on the place where it stood the young chestnut tree is to be 
 planted and to flourish 
 
 it still stands towering aloft on the heavy wagon which has 
 brought it this morning a distance of several miles to paris for 
 years it had stood there in the protection of a mighty oak tree 
 under which the old venerable clergyman had often sat with children 
 listening to his stories 
 
 the young chestnut tree had also listened to the stories for 
 the dryad who lived in it was a child also she remembered the time 
 when the tree was so little that it only projected a short way above 
 the grass and ferns around these were as tall as they would ever 
 be but the tree grew every year and enjoyed the air and the 
 sunshine and drank the dew and the rain several times it was also 
 as it must be well shaken by the wind and the rain for that is a 
 part of education 
 
 the dryad rejoiced in her life and rejoiced in the sunshine 
 and the singing of the birds but she was most rejoiced at human 
 voices she understood the language of men as well as she understood that of animals 
 
 butterflies cockchafers everything that could 
 fly came to pay a visit they could all talk they told of the 
 village of the vineyard of the forest of the old castle with its 
 parks and canals and ponds down in the water dwelt also living 
 beings which in their way could fly under the water from one 
 place to another beings with knowledge and delineation they said 
 nothing at all they were so clever 
 
 and the swallow who had dived told about the pretty little 
 goldfish of the thick turbot the fat brill and the old carp the 
 swallow could describe all that very well but self is the man she 
 said one ought to see these things self but how was the 
 dryad ever to see such beings she was obliged to be satisfied with 
 being able to look over the beautiful country and see the busy 
 industry of men 
 
 it was glorious but most glorious of all when the old clergyman 
 sat under the oak tree and talked of france and of the great deeds of 
 her sons and daughters whose names will be mentioned with 
 admiration through all time 
 
 then the dryad heard of the shepherd girl joan of arc and of 
 charlotte corday she heard about henry the fourth and napoleon the first she heard names whose echo sounds in the hearts of the people 
 
 the village children listened attentively and the dryad no less 
 attentively she became a with the rest in the clouds 
 that went sailing by she saw picture by picture everything that 
 she heard talked about the cloudy sky was her 
 she felt so happy in beautiful france the fruitful land of 
 genius with the crater of freedom but in her heart the sting 
 remained that the bird that every animal that could fly was much 
 better off than she even the fly could look about more in the 
 world far beyond the horizon 
 
 france was so great and so glorious but she could only look 
 across a little piece of it the land stretched out 
 with vineyards forests and great cities of all these paris was the 
 most splendid and the mightiest the birds could get there but she 
 never 
 
 among the village children was a little ragged poor girl but a 
 pretty one to look at she was always laughing or singing and 
 twining red flowers in her black hair 
 
 go to paris the old clergyman warned her poor child if 
 you go there it will be your ruin 
 
 but she went for all that 
 
 the dryad often thought of her for she had the same wish and 
 felt the same longing for the great city 
 the tree was bearing its first chestnut blossoms the 
 birds were twittering round them in the most beautiful sunshine 
 then a stately carriage came rolling along that way and in it sat a 
 grand lady driving the spirited horses on the back seat 
 a little smart groom balanced himself the dryad knew the lady and 
 the old clergyman knew her also he shook his head gravely when he saw her and said 
 
 so you went there after all and it was your ruin poor mary 
 that one poor thought the dryad no she wears a dress fit for 
 a countess she had become one in the city of magic changes oh if i were only there amid all the splendor and pomp they shine up 
 into the very clouds at night when i look up i can tell in what 
 direction the town lies 
 
 towards that direction the dryad looked every evening she saw 
 in the dark night the gleaming cloud on the horizon in the clear 
 moonlight nights she missed the sailing clouds which showed her 
 pictures of the city and pictures from history 
 
 the child grasps at the the dryad grasped at the 
 her a sudden cloudless sky was for her a blank leaf and for several days she had only had such leaves before 
 her 
 
 it was in the warm not a breeze moved through the 
 glowing hot days every leaf every flower lay as if it were 
 torpid and the people seemed torpid too 
 
 then the clouds arose and covered the region round about where the 
 gleaming mist announced here lies paris 
 
 the clouds piled themselves up like a chain of mountains 
 hurried on through the air and spread themselves abroad over the 
 whole landscape as far as the eye could reach 
 
 like enormous blocks of rock the clouds lay piled over 
 one another gleams of lightning shot forth from them 
 
 these also are the servants of the lord god the old clergyman 
 had said and there came a bluish dazzling flash of lightning a 
 lighting up as if of the sun itself which could burst blocks of 
 rock asunder the lightning struck and split to the roots the old 
 venerable oak the crown fell asunder it seemed as if the tree were 
 stretching forth its arms to clasp the messengers of the light 
 
 no bronze cannon can sound over the land at the birth of a royal 
 child as the thunder sounded at the death of the old oak the rain 
 streamed down a refreshing wind was blowing the storm had gone by and there was quite a holiday glow on all things the old clergyman spoke a few words for honorable remembrance and a painter made a drawing as a lasting record of the tree 
 
 everything passes away said the dryad passes away like a 
 cloud and never comes back 
 
 the old clergyman too did not come back the green roof of his 
 school was gone and his had vanished the children did not come but autumn came and winter came and then spring also in all this change of seasons the dryad looked toward the region where at night paris gleamed with its bright mist far on the horizon 
 
 forth from the town rushed engine after engine train after train 
 whistling and screaming at all hours in the day in the evening 
 towards midnight at daybreak and all the day through came the 
 trains out of each one and into each one streamed people from the 
 country of every king a new wonder of the world had summoned them to paris 
 
 in what form did this wonder exhibit itself 
 a splendid blossom of art and industry said one has 
 unfolded itself in the champ de mars a gigantic sunflower from whose petals one can learn geography and statistics and can become as wise as a lord mayor and raise self to the level of art and 
 poetry and study the greatness and power of the various lands 
 a fairy tale flower said another a which spreads out its green leaves like a velvet carpet over the sand the opening spring has brought it forth the summer will see it in all its splendor the autumn winds will sweep it away so that not a leaf not a fragment of its root shall remain 
 in front of the military school extends in time of peace the arena 
 of war a field without a blade of grass a piece of sandy steppe 
 as if cut out of the desert of africa where fata morgana displays her 
 wondrous airy castles and hanging gardens in the champ de mars 
 however these were to be seen more splendid more wonderful than in the east for human art had converted the airy deceptive scenes into reality 
 
 the palace of the present has been built it was said 
 
 day by day hour by hour it unfolds more of its wonderful splendor 
 
 the endless halls shine in marble and many colors master 
 bloodless here moves his limbs of steel and iron in the great 
 circular hall of machinery works of art in metal in stone in 
 gobelins tapestry announce the vitality of mind that is stirring in 
 every land halls of paintings splendor of flowers everything that 
 mind and skill can create in the workshop of the artisan has been 
 placed here for show even the memorials of ancient days out of old 
 graves and have appeared at this general meeting 
 the overpowering great variegated whole must be divided into small 
 portions and pressed together like a plaything if it is to be 
 understood and described 
 
 like a great table on christmas eve the champ de mars carried a 
 of industry and art and around this knickknacks from 
 all countries had been ranged knickknacks on a grand scale for every nation found some remembrance of home 
 
 here stood the royal palace of egypt there the caravanserai of 
 the desert land the bedouin had quitted his sunny country and 
 hastened by on his camel here stood the russian stables with the 
 fiery glorious horses of the steppe here stood the simple 
 dwelling of the danish peasant with the dannebrog 
 flag next to gustavus wooden house from dalarne with its 
 wonderful carvings american huts english cottages french pavilions kiosks theatres churches all strewn around and between them the fresh green turf the clear springing water blooming bushes rare trees hothouses in which one might fancy self transported into the tropical forest whole gardens brought from damascus and blooming under one roof what colors what fragrance 
 
 artificial grottoes surrounded bodies of fresh or salt water 
 and gave a glimpse into the empire of the fishes the visitor seemed 
 to wander at the bottom of the sea among fishes and polypi 
 all this they said the champ de mars offers and around 
 the great table the crowd of human beings moves like a 
 busy swarm of ants on foot or in little carriages for not all feet 
 are equal to such a fatiguing journey 
 
 hither they swarm from morning till late in the evening steamer 
 after steamer crowded with people glides down the seine the 
 number of carriages is continually on the increase the swarm of 
 people on foot and on horseback grows more and more dense carriages and omnibuses are crowded stuffed and embroidered with people all these tributary streams flow in one direction towards the exhibition 
 
 on every entrance the flag of france is displayed around the 
 bazaar wave the flags of all nations there is a humming and a 
 murmuring from the hall of the machines from the towers the melody of the chimes is heard with the tones of the organs in the churches 
 mingle the hoarse nasal songs from the cafes of the east it is a 
 kingdom of babel a wonder of the world 
 
 in very truth it was what all the reports said and who 
 did not hear them the dryad knew everything that is told here of 
 the new wonder in the city of cities 
 
 fly away ye birds fly away to see and then come back and 
 tell me said the dryad 
 
 the wish became an intense desire became the one thought of a 
 life then in the quiet silent night while the full moon was 
 shining the dryad saw a spark fly out of the disc and fall 
 like a shooting star and before the tree whose leaves waved to and 
 fro as if they were stirred by a tempest stood a noble mighty and 
 grand figure in tones that were at once rich and strong like the 
 trumpet of the last judgment bidding farewell to life and summoning to the great account it said 
 
 thou shalt go to the city of magic thou shalt take root there 
 and enjoy the mighty rushing breezes the air and the sunshine 
 there but the time of thy life shall then be shortened the line of 
 years that awaited thee here amid the free nature shall shrink to 
 but a small tale poor dryad it shall be thy destruction thy 
 yearning and longing will increase thy desire will grow more 
 stormy the tree itself will be as a prison to thee thou wilt quit 
 thy cell and give up thy nature to fly out and mingle among men 
 then the years that would have belonged to thee will be contracted 
 to half the span of the ephemeral fly that lives but a day one 
 night and thy shall be blown out the leaves of the tree 
 will wither and be blown away to become green never again 
 thus the words sounded and the light vanished away but not the 
 longing of the dryad she trembled in the wild fever of expectation 
 i shall go there she cried rejoicingly life is beginning and 
 swells like a cloud nobody knows whither it is hastening 
 when the gray dawn arose and the moon turned pale and the clouds 
 were tinted red the hour struck the words of promise were fulfilled 
 
 people appeared with spades and poles they dug round the roots of 
 the tree deeper and deeper and beneath it a wagon was brought 
 out drawn by many horses and the tree was lifted up with its 
 roots and the lumps of earth that adhered to them matting was 
 placed around the roots as though the tree had its feet in a warm 
 bag and now the tree was lifted on the wagon and secured with chains 
 
 the journey began the journey to paris there the tree was to grow as an ornament to the city of french glory 
 
 the twigs and the leaves of the chestnut tree trembled in the 
 first moments of its being moved and the dryad trembled in the 
 pleasurable feeling of expectation 
 
 away away it sounded in every beat of her pulse away 
 away sounded in words that flew trembling along the dryad forgot 
 to bid farewell to the regions of home she thought not of the 
 waving grass and of the innocent daisies which had looked up to her 
 as to a great lady a young princess playing at being a shepherdess 
 out in the open air 
 
 the chestnut tree stood upon the wagon and nodded his branches 
 whether this meant farewell or forward the dryad knew not she 
 dreamed only of the marvellous new things that seemed yet so 
 familiar and that were to unfold themselves before her no 
 heart rejoicing in innocence no heart whose blood danced with 
 passion had set out on the journey to paris more full of 
 expectation than she 
 
 her farewell sounded in the words away away 
 the wheels turned the distant approached the present vanished 
 the region was changed even as the clouds change new vineyards 
 forests villages villas appeared came nearer vanished 
 
 the chestnut tree moved forward and the dryad went with it 
 after rushed past sending up into the air 
 vapory clouds that formed figures which told of paris whence they 
 came and whither the dryad was going 
 
 everything around knew it and must know whither she was bound it 
 seemed to her as if every tree she passed stretched out its leaves 
 towards her with the prayer take me with you take me with you 
 for every tree enclosed a longing dryad 
 
 what changes during this flight houses seemed to be rising out of 
 the earth more and more thicker and thicker the chimneys rose 
 like ranged side by side or in rows one above the 
 other on the roofs great inscriptions in letters a yard long and 
 figures in various colors covering the walls from cornice to 
 basement came brightly out 
 
 where does paris begin and when shall i be there asked the 
 dryad 
 
 the crowd of people grew the tumult and the bustle increased 
 carriage followed upon carriage people on foot and people on 
 horseback were mingled together all around were shops on shops music and song crying and talking 
 
 the dryad in her tree was now in the midst of paris the great 
 heavy wagon all at once stopped on a little square planted with trees 
 the high houses around had all of them balconies to the windows 
 from which the inhabitants looked down upon the young fresh chestnut tree which was coming to be planted here as a substitute for the dead tree that lay stretched on the ground 
 
 the stood still and smiled in admiration of its pure 
 vernal freshness the older trees whose buds were still closed 
 whispered with their waving branches welcome welcome the 
 fountain throwing its jet of water high up in the air to let it fall 
 again in the wide stone basin told the wind to sprinkle the 
 with pearly drops as if it wished to give him a refreshing draught to 
 welcome him 
 
 the dryad felt how her tree was being lifted from the wagon to 
 be placed in the spot where it was to stand the roots were covered 
 with earth and fresh turf was laid on top blooming shrubs and 
 flowers in pots were ranged around and thus a little garden arose 
 in the square 
 
 the tree that had been killed by the fumes of gas the steam of 
 kitchens and the bad air of the city was put upon the wagon and 
 driven away the looked on children and old men sat upon the bench and looked at the green tree and we who are telling this story stood upon a balcony and looked down upon the green spring sight that had been brought in from the fresh country air and said what the old clergyman would have said poor dryad 
 
 i am happy i am happy the dryad cried rejoicing and yet i 
 cannot realize cannot describe what i feel everything is as i 
 fancied it and yet as i did not fancy it 
 
 the houses stood there so lofty so close the sunlight shone 
 on only one of the walls and that one was stuck over with bills and 
 placards before which the people stood still and this made a crowd 
 carriages rushed past carriages rolled past light ones and heavy 
 ones mingled together omnibuses those moving houses came rattling by horsemen galloped among them even carts and wagons asserted their rights 
 
 the dryad asked herself if these houses which stood so 
 close around her would not remove and take other shapes like the 
 clouds in the sky and draw aside so that she might cast a glance 
 into paris and over it notre dame must show itself the vendome 
 column and the wondrous building which had called and was still 
 calling so many strangers to the city 
 
 but the houses did not stir from their places it was yet day when 
 the lamps were lit the gleamed from the shops and shone 
 even into the branches of the trees so that it was like sunlight in 
 summer the stars above made their appearance the same to which the dryad had looked up in her home she thought she felt a clear pure stream of air which went forth from them she felt herself lifted up and strengthened and felt an increased power of seeing through 
 every leaf and through every fibre of the root amid all the noise and 
 the turmoil the colors and the lights she knew herself watched by 
 mild eyes 
 
 from the side streets sounded the merry notes of fiddles and 
 wind instruments up to the dance to the dance to jollity and 
 pleasure that was their invitation such music it was that horses 
 carriages trees and houses would have danced if they had known how 
 
 the charm of intoxicating delight filled the bosom of the dryad 
 
 how glorious how splendid it is she cried rejoicingly now i 
 am in paris 
 
 the next day that dawned the next night that fell offered the 
 same spectacle similar bustle similar life changing indeed yet 
 always the same and thus it went on through the sequence of days 
 now i know every tree every flower on the square here i know 
 every house every balcony every shop in this narrow 
 corner where i am denied the sight of this great mighty city where 
 are the arches of triumph the boulevards the wondrous building of 
 the world i see nothing of all this as if shut up in a cage i stand 
 among the high houses which i now know by heart with their 
 inscriptions signs and placards all the painted confectionery that 
 is no longer to my taste where are all the things of which i heard 
 for which i longed and for whose sake i wanted to come hither what have i seized found won i feel the same longing i felt before i 
 feel that there is a life i should wish to grasp and to experience 
 i must go out into the ranks of living men and mingle among them i 
 must fly about like a bird i must see and feel and become human 
 altogether i must enjoy the one instead of vegetating for 
 years in sameness and weariness in which i become ill 
 and at last sink and disappear like the dew on the meadows i will 
 gleam like the cloud gleam in the sunshine of life look out over the 
 whole like the cloud and pass away like it no one knoweth whither 
 thus sighed the dryad and she prayed 
 
 take from me the years that were destined for me and give me but 
 half of the life of the ephemeral fly deliver me from my prison give 
 me human life human happiness only a short span only the one it cannot be otherwise and then punish me for my wish to live my longing for life strike me out of thy list let my shell the 
 fresh young tree wither or be hewn down and burnt to ashes and 
 scattered to all the winds 
 
 a rustling went through the leaves of the tree there was a 
 trembling in each of the leaves it seemed as if fire streamed through 
 it a gust of wind shook its green crown and from the midst of that 
 crown a female figure came forth in the same moment she was sitting 
 beneath the leafy branches young and beautiful 
 to behold like poor mary to whom the clergyman had said the 
 great city will be thy destruction 
 
 the dryad sat at the foot of the tree at her house door which 
 she had locked and whose key had thrown away so young so fair 
 the stars saw her and blinked at her the saw her and 
 gleamed and beckoned to her how delicate she was and yet how 
 blooming a child and yet a grown maiden her dress was fine as 
 silk green as the leaves on the crown of the tree 
 in her hair clung a chestnut blossom she looked like the goddess of spring 
 
 for one short minute she sat motionless then she sprang up 
 and light as a gazelle she hurried away she ran and sprang like the 
 reflection from the mirror that carried by the sunshine is cast now 
 here now there could any one have followed her with his eyes he 
 would have seen how marvellously her dress and her form changed 
 according to the nature of the house or the place whose light happened to shine upon her 
 
 she reached the boulevards here a sea of light streamed forth 
 from the of the lamps the shops and the cafes here 
 stood in a row young and slender trees each of which concealed its 
 dryad and gave shade from the artificial sunlight the whole vast 
 pavement was one great festive hall where covered tables stood 
 laden with refreshments of all kinds from champagne and chartreuse 
 down to coffee and beer here was an exhibition of flowers statues 
 books and colored stuffs 
 
 from the crowd close by the lofty houses she looked forth over the 
 terrific stream beyond the rows of trees yonder heaved a stream of 
 rolling carriages cabriolets coaches omnibuses cabs and among 
 them riding gentlemen and marching troops to cross to the opposite 
 shore was an undertaking fraught with danger to life and limb now 
 lanterns shed their radiance abroad now the gas had the upper hand 
 suddenly a rocket rises whence whither 
 
 here are sounds of soft italian melodies yonder spanish songs 
 are sung accompanied by the rattle of the castanets but strongest of 
 all and predominating over the rest the tunes of the 
 moment the exciting music which orpheus never knew and which was never heard by the belle helene even the barrow was tempted to hop upon one of its wheels 
 
 the dryad danced floated flew changing her color every 
 moment like a in the sunshine each house with the 
 world belonging to it gave her its own reflections 
 
 as the glowing torn from its stem is carried away 
 by the stream so the dryad drifted along whenever she paused she 
 was another being so that none was able to follow her to recognize 
 her or to look more closely at her 
 
 like all things flew by her she looked into a 
 thousand faces but not one was familiar to her she saw not a 
 single form from home two bright eyes had remained in her memory she thought of mary poor mary the ragged merry child who wore the red flowers in her black hair mary was now here in the rich and magnificent as in that day when she drove past the house of the old clergyman and past the tree of the dryad the old oak 
 
 here she was certainly living in the deafening tumult perhaps 
 she had just stepped out of one of the gorgeous carriages in 
 waiting handsome equipages with coachmen in gold braid and footmen in silken hose drove up the people who alighted from them were all ladies they went through the opened gate and ascended the broad staircase that led to a building resting on marble pillars was this building perhaps the wonder of the world 
 there mary would certainly be found 
 
 sancta maria resounded from the interior incense floated 
 through the lofty painted and gilded aisles where a solemn twilight 
 reigned 
 
 it was the church of the madeleine 
 
 clad in black garments of the most costly stuffs fashioned 
 according to the latest mode the rich feminine world of paris 
 glided across the shining pavement the crests of the proprietors were engraved on silver shields on the and embroidered in the corners of perfumed handkerchiefs bordered with brussels lace a few of the ladies were kneeling in silent prayer 
 before the altars others resorted to the confessionals 
 
 anxiety and fear took possession of the dryad she felt as if 
 she had entered a place where she had no right to be here was the 
 abode of silence the hall of secrets everything was said in 
 whispers every word was a mystery 
 
 the dryad saw herself enveloped in lace and silk like the women 
 of wealth and of high birth around her had perhaps every one of 
 them a longing in her breast like the dryad 
 
 a deep painful sigh was heard did it escape from some 
 confessional in a distant corner or from the bosom of the dryad 
 she drew the veil closer around her she breathed incense and not the 
 fresh air here was not the of her longing 
 
 away away a hastening without rest the ephemeral fly knows 
 not repose for her existence is flight 
 
 she was out again among the gas candelabra by a magnificent 
 fountain 
 
 all its streaming waters are not able to wash out the innocent 
 blood that was spilt here 
 
 such were the words spoken strangers stood around carrying on 
 a lively conversation such as no one would have dared to carry on 
 in the gorgeous hall of secrets whence the dryad came 
 
 a heavy stone slab was turned and then lifted she did not 
 understand why she saw an opening that led into the depths below 
 the strangers stepped down leaving the starlit air and the cheerful 
 life of the upper world behind them 
 
 i am afraid said one of the women who stood around to her 
 husband i cannot venture to go down nor do i care for the wonders down yonder you had better stay here with me 
 
 indeed and travel home said the man and quit paris without 
 having seen the most wonderful thing of all the real wonder of the 
 present period created by the power and resolution of one man 
 i will not go down for all that was the reply 
 
 the wonder of the present time it had been called the dryad 
 had heard and had understood it the goal of her ardent longing had 
 thus been reached and here was the entrance to it down into the 
 depths below paris she had not thought of such a thing but now she heard it said and saw the strangers descending and went after them 
 
 the staircase was of cast iron spiral broad and easy below 
 there burned a lamp and farther down another they stood in a 
 labyrinth of endless halls and arched passages all communicating with each other all the streets and lanes of paris were to be seen here 
 again as in a dim reflection the names were painted up and every 
 house above had its number down here also and struck its roots 
 under the macadamized quays of a broad canal in which the muddy water flowed onward over it the fresh streaming water was carried on arches and quite at the top hung the tangled net of and 
 
 
 in the distance lamps gleamed like a reflection from the 
 above every now and then a dull rumbling was heard this came from the heavy wagons rolling over the entrance bridges 
 
 whither had the dryad come 
 
 you have no doubt heard of the catacombs now they are vanishing points in that new underground world that wonder of the present day the sewers of paris the dryad was there and not in the 
 exhibition in the champ de mars 
 
 she heard exclamations of wonder and admiration 
 
 from here go forth health and life for thousands upon thousands 
 up yonder our time is the time of progress with its manifold 
 blessings 
 
 such was the opinion and the speech of men but not of those 
 creatures who had been born here and who built and dwelt here of the rats namely who were squeaking to one another in the clefts of a 
 crumbling wall quite plainly and in a way the dryad understood well 
 
 a big old with his tail bitten off was relieving 
 his feelings in loud squeaks and his family gave their tribute of 
 concurrence to every word he said 
 
 i am disgusted with this he cried with these 
 outbursts of ignorance a fine magnificence truly all made up of gas 
 and petroleum i eat such stuff as that everything here is so 
 fine and bright now that ashamed of self without exactly 
 knowing why ah if we only lived in the days of tallow candles and 
 it does not lie so very far behind us that was a romantic time as 
 one may say 
 
 what are you talking of there asked the dryad i have never 
 seen you before what is it you are talking about 
 
 of the glorious days that are gone said the rat of the 
 happy time of our and then it 
 was a great thing to get down here that was a nest quite 
 different from paris mother plague used to live here then she killed 
 people but never rats robbers and smugglers could breathe freely 
 here here was the of the most interesting personages 
 whom one now only gets to see in the theatres where they act 
 melodrama up above the time of romance is gone even in our 
 nest and here also fresh air and petroleum have broken in 
 
 thus squeaked the rat he squeaked in honor of the old time 
 when mother plague was still alive 
 
 a carriage stopped a kind of open omnibus drawn by swift horses 
 the company mounted and drove away along the boulevard de 
 sebastopol that is to say the underground boulevard over which 
 the crowded street of that name extended 
 
 the carriage disappeared in the twilight the dryad disappeared 
 lifted to the cheerful freshness above here and not below in the 
 vaulted passages filled with heavy air the wonder work must be found which she was to seek in her short lifetime it must gleam brighter than all the stronger than the moon that was just 
 gliding past 
 
 yes certainly she saw it yonder in the distance it gleamed 
 before her and twinkled and glittered like the evening star in the 
 sky 
 
 she saw a glittering portal open that led to a little garden 
 where all was brightness and dance music colored lamps surrounded 
 little lakes in which were of colored metal from 
 whose flowers jets of water spurted up beautiful weeping willows 
 real products of spring hung their fresh branches over these lakes 
 like a fresh green transparent and yet screening veil in the 
 bushes burnt an open fire throwing a red twilight over the quiet huts 
 of branches into which the sounds of music penetrated an ear 
 tickling intoxicating music that sent the blood coursing through the 
 veins 
 
 beautiful girls in festive attire with pleasant smiles on their 
 lips and the light spirit of youth in their hearts marys with 
 roses in their hair but without carriage and postilion flitted to 
 and fro in the wild dance 
 
 where were the heads where the feet as if stung by tarantulas 
 they sprang laughed rejoiced as if in their ecstacies they were 
 going to embrace all the world 
 
 the dryad felt herself torn with them into the whirl of the dance 
 round her delicate foot clung the silken boot chestnut brown in 
 color like the ribbon that floated from her hair down upon her bare 
 shoulders the green silk dress waved in large folds but did not 
 entirely hide the pretty foot and ankle 
 
 had she come to the enchanted garden of armida what was the 
 name of the place 
 
 the name glittered in over the entrance it was 
 mabille 
 
 the soaring upwards of rockets the splashing of fountains and 
 the popping of champagne corks accompanied the wild bacchantic 
 dance over the whole glided the moon through the air clear but with 
 a somewhat crooked face 
 
 a wild joviality seemed to rush through the dryad as though she 
 were intoxicated with opium her eyes spoke her lips spoke but the 
 sound of violins and of flutes drowned the sound of her voice her 
 partner whispered words to her which she did not understand nor do we understand them he stretched out his arms to draw her to him but he embraced only the empty air 
 
 the dryad had been carried away like a on the wind 
 before her she saw a flame in the air a flashing light high up on a 
 tower the beacon light shone from the goal of her longing shone from the red lighthouse tower of the fata morgana of the champ de mars 
 
 thither she was carried by the wind she circled round the tower 
 the workmen thought it was a butterfly that had come too early and 
 that now sank down dying 
 
 the moon shone bright spread light around through 
 the halls over the buildings scattered about over the 
 and the rocks produced by human ingenuity from which 
 waterfalls driven by the power of master bloodless fell down 
 the caverns of the sea the depths of the lakes the kingdom of the 
 fishes were opened here men walked as in the depths of the deep pond and held converse with the sea in the of glass the water pressed against the strong glass walls above and on every side 
 the polypi living creatures had fastened themselves to the 
 bottom and stretched out arms fathoms long for prey a big turbot 
 was making himself broad in front quietly enough but not without 
 casting some suspicious glances aside a crab clambered over him 
 looking like a gigantic spider while the shrimps wandered about in 
 restless haste like the butterflies and moths of the sea 
 
 in the fresh water grew nymphaea and reeds the 
 stood up below in rank and file all turning their heads 
 one way that the streaming water might flow into their mouths fat 
 carps stared at the glass wall with stupid eyes they knew that they 
 were here to be exhibited and that they had made the somewhat 
 toilsome journey hither in tubs filled with water and they thought 
 with dismay of the from which they had suffered so 
 cruelly on the railway 
 
 they had come to see the exhibition and now contemplated it 
 from their fresh or position they looked attentively at 
 the crowds of people who passed by them early and late all the 
 nations in the world they thought had made an exhibition of their 
 inhabitants for the edification of the soles and haddocks pike and 
 carp that they might give their opinions upon the different kinds 
 those are scaly animals said a little slimy whiting they put 
 on different scales two or three times a day and they emit sounds 
 which they call speaking we put on scales and we make 
 ourselves understood in an easier way simply by twitching the corners of our mouths and staring with our eyes we have a great many advantages over mankind 
 
 but they have learned swimming of us remarked a 
 codling you must know i come from the great sea outside in the 
 hot time of the year the people yonder go into the water first they 
 take off their scales and then they swim they have learnt from the 
 frogs to kick out with their hind legs and row with their fore 
 paws but they cannot hold out long they want to be like us but they cannot come up to us poor people 
 
 and the fishes stared they thought that the whole swarm of people 
 whom they had seen in the bright daylight were still moving around 
 them they were certain they still saw the same forms that had first 
 caught their attention 
 
 a pretty barbel with spotted skin and an enviably round back 
 declared that the human fry were still there 
 
 i can see a well human figure quite well said the 
 barbel she was called contumacious lady or something of that 
 kind she had a mouth and staring eyes like ours and a great balloon 
 at the back of her head and something like a umbrella in 
 front there were a lot of dangling bits of seaweed hanging about her 
 she ought to take all the rubbish off and go as we do then she would look something like a respectable barbel so far as it is possible for a person to look like one 
 
 become of that one whom they drew away with the hook he sat on a and had paper and pen and ink and wrote 
 down everything they called him a writer 
 
 going about with him still said a hoary old maid of a 
 carp who carried her misfortune about with her so that she was quite hoarse in her youth she had once swallowed a hook and still swam patiently about with it in her gullet a writer that means as we fishes describe it a kind of cuttle or among men 
 thus the fishes gossipped in their own way but in the artificial the laborers were busy who were obliged to take advantage of the hours of night to get their work done by daybreak they accompanied with blows of their hammers and with songs the parting words of the vanishing dryad 
 
 so at any rate i have seen you you pretty she 
 said yes i know you and she waved her hand to them i have known about you a long time in my home the swallow told me about you how beautiful you are how delicate and shining i should like to kiss every one of you you others also i know you all but you do not know me 
 
 the fishes stared out into the twilight they did not understand a 
 word of it 
 
 the dryad was there no longer she had been a long time in the 
 open air where the different countries the country of black bread 
 the codfish coast the kingdom of russia leather and the banks of 
 and the gardens of rose oil exhaled their perfumes 
 from the flower 
 
 when after a night at a ball we drive home half asleep and 
 half awake the melodies still sound plainly in our ears we hear 
 them and could sing them all from memory when the eye of the 
 murdered man closes the picture of what it saw last clings to it 
 for a time like a photographic picture 
 
 so it was likewise here the bustling life of day had not yet 
 disappeared in the quiet night the dryad had seen it she knew 
 thus it will be repeated tomorrow 
 
 the dryad stood among the fragrant roses and thought she knew 
 them and had seen them in her own home she also saw red 
 pomegranate flowers like those that little mary had worn in her 
 dark hair 
 
 remembrances from the home of her childhood flashed through her 
 thoughts her eyes eagerly drank in the prospect around and 
 feverish restlessness chased her through the halls 
 a weariness that increased continually took possession of her 
 she felt a longing to rest on the soft oriental carpets within or 
 to lean against the weeping willow without by the clear water but for 
 the ephemeral fly there was no rest in a few moments the day had 
 completed its circle 
 
 her thoughts trembled her limbs trembled she sank down on the 
 grass by the bubbling water 
 
 thou wilt ever spring living from the earth she said 
 mournfully moisten my tongue bring me a refreshing draught 
 
 i am no living water was the answer i only spring upward when 
 the machine wills it 
 
 give me something of thy freshness thou green grass implored 
 the dryad give me one of thy fragrant flowers 
 
 we must die if we are torn from our stalks replied the 
 flowers and the grass 
 
 give me a kiss thou fresh stream of air only a single 
 
 
 soon the sun will kiss the clouds red answered the wind 
 
 then thou wilt be among the dead blown away as all the splendor 
 here will be blown away before the year shall have ended then i can 
 play again with the light loose sand on the place here and whirl 
 the dust over the land and through the air all is dust 
 
 the dryad felt a terror like a woman who has cut asunder her 
 in the bath but is filled again with the love of life 
 even while she is bleeding to death she raised herself tottered 
 forward a few steps and sank down again at the entrance to a little 
 church the gate stood open lights were burning upon the altar and 
 the organ sounded 
 
 what music such notes the dryad had never yet heard and yet it 
 seemed to her as if she recognized a number of voices among them they came deep from the heart of all creation she thought she heard the stories of the old clergyman of great deeds and of the celebrated names and of the gifts that the creatures of god must bestow upon posterity if they would live on in the world 
 the tones of the organ swelled and in their song there sounded 
 these words 
 
 thy wishing and thy longing have torn thee with thy roots 
 from the place which god appointed for thee that was thy destruction thou poor dryad 
 
 the notes became soft and gentle and seemed to die away in a 
 wail 
 
 in the sky the clouds showed themselves with a ruddy gleam the 
 wind sighed pass away ye dead now the sun is going to rise 
 
 the first ray fell on the dryad her form was irradiated in 
 changing colors like the when it is bursting and 
 becomes a drop of water like a tear that falls and passes away like a 
 vapor 
 
 poor dryad only a only a tear poured upon the earth 
 and vanished away

 book two 
 chapter xix 
 
 the attack of the sixth chasseurs secured the retreat of our right flank in the center forgotten battery which had managed to set fire to the schon grabern village delayed the french advance the french were putting out the fire which the wind was spreading and thus gave us time to retreat the retirement of the center to the other side of the dip in the ground at the rear was hurried and noisy but the different companies did not get mixed but our left which consisted of the azov and podolsk infantry and the pavlograd hussars was simultaneously attacked and outflanked by superior french forces under lannes and was thrown into confusion bagration had sent zherkov to the general commanding that left flank with orders to retreat immediately 
 zherkov not removing his hand from his cap turned his horse about and galloped off but no sooner had he left bagration than his courage failed him he was seized by panic and could not go where it was dangerous 
 having reached the left flank instead of going to the front where the firing was he began to look for the general and his staff where they could not possibly be and so did not deliver the order 
 the command of the left flank belonged by seniority to the commander of the regiment kutuzov had reviewed at braunau and in which dolokhov was serving as a private but the command of the extreme left flank had been assigned to the commander of the pavlograd regiment in which rostov was serving and a misunderstanding arose the two commanders were much exasperated with one another and long after the action had begun on the right flank and the french were already advancing were engaged in discussion with the sole object of offending one another but the regiments both cavalry and infantry were by no means ready for the impending action from privates to general they were not expecting a battle and were engaged in peaceful occupations the cavalry feeding the horses and the infantry collecting wood 
 he higher iss dan i in rank said the german colonel of the hussars flushing and addressing an adjutant who had ridden up so let him do what he vill but i cannot sacrifice my hussars bugler sount ze retreat 
 but haste was becoming imperative cannon and musketry mingling together thundered on the right and in the center while the capotes of lannes sharpshooters were already seen crossing the milldam and forming up within twice the range of a musket shot the general in command of the infantry went toward his horse with jerky steps and having mounted drew himself up very straight and tall and rode to the pavlograd commander the commanders met with polite bows but with secret malevolence in their hearts 
 once again colonel said the general i leave half my men in the wood i beg of you i beg of you he repeated to occupy the position and prepare for an attack 
 i peg of you yourself not to mix in vot is not your business suddenly replied the irate colonel if you vere in the cavalry 
 i am not in the cavalry colonel but i am a russian general and if you are not aware of the fact 
 quite avare your excellency suddenly shouted the colonel touching his horse and turning purple in the face vill you be so goot to come to ze front and see dat zis position iss no goot i vish to destroy my men for your pleasure 
 you forget yourself colonel i am not considering my own pleasure and i allow it to be said 
 taking the outburst as a challenge to his courage the general expanded his chest and rode frowning beside him to the front line as if their differences would be settled there amongst the bullets they reached the front several bullets sped over them and they halted in silence there was nothing fresh to be seen from the line for from where they had been before it had been evident that it was impossible for cavalry to act among the bushes and broken ground as well as that the french were outflanking our left the general and colonel looked sternly and significantly at one another like two fighting cocks preparing for battle each vainly trying to detect signs of cowardice in the other both passed the examination successfully as there was nothing to said and neither wished to give occasion for it to be alleged that he had been the first to leave the range of fire they would have remained there for a long time testing each courage had it not been that just then they heard the rattle of musketry and a muffled shout almost behind them in the wood the french had attacked the men collecting wood in the copse it was no longer possible for the hussars to retreat with the infantry they were cut off from the line of retreat on the left by the french however inconvenient the position it was now necessary to attack in order to cut away through for themselves 
 the squadron in which rostov was serving had scarcely time to mount before it was halted facing the enemy again as at the enns bridge there was nothing between the squadron and the enemy and again that terrible dividing line of uncertainty and fear resembling the line separating the living from the dead lay between them all were conscious of this unseen line and the question whether they would they would cross it or not and how they would cross it agitated them all 
 the colonel rode to the front angrily gave some reply to questions put to him by the officers and like a man desperately insisting on having his own way gave an order no one said anything definite but the rumor of an attack spread through the squadron the command to form up rang out and the sabers whizzed as they were drawn from their scabbards still no one moved the troops of the left flank infantry and hussars alike felt that the commander did not himself know what to do and this irresolution communicated itself to the men 
 if only they would be quick thought rostov feeling that at last the time had come to experience the joy of an attack of which he had so often heard from his fellow hussars 
 with god lads rang out voice at a twot 
 the horses croups began to sway in the front line rook pulled at the reins and started of his own accord 
 before him on the right rostov saw the front lines of his hussars and still farther ahead a dark line which he could not see distinctly but took to be the enemy shots could be heard but some way off 
 faster came the word of command and rostov felt flanks drooping as he broke into a gallop 
 rostov anticipated his movements and became more and more elated he had noticed a solitary tree ahead of him this tree had been in the middle of the line that had seemed so terrible and now he had crossed that line and not only was there nothing terrible but everything was becoming more and more happy and animated oh how i will slash at him thought rostov gripping the hilt of his saber 
 came a roar of voices let anyone come my way now thought rostov driving his spurs into rook and letting him go at a full gallop so that he outstripped the others ahead the enemy was already visible suddenly something like a birch broom seemed to sweep over the squadron rostov raised his saber ready to strike but at that instant the trooper nikitenko who was galloping ahead shot away from him and rostov felt as in a dream that he continued to be carried forward with unnatural speed but yet stayed on the same spot from behind him bondarchuk an hussar he knew jolted against him and looked angrily at him horse swerved and galloped past 
 how is it i am not moving i have fallen i am killed rostov asked and answered at the same instant he was alone in the middle of a field instead of the moving horses and hussars backs he saw nothing before him but the motionless earth and the stubble around him there was warm blood under his arm no i am wounded and the horse is killed rook tried to rise on his forelegs but fell back pinning his leg blood was flowing from his head he struggled but could not rise rostov also tried to rise but fell back his sabretache having become entangled in the saddle where our men were and where the french he did not know there was no one near

 book two 
 chapter xix 
 
 the attack of the sixth chasseurs secured the retreat of our right flank in the center forgotten battery which had managed to set fire to the schon grabern village delayed the french advance the french were putting out the fire which the wind was spreading and thus gave us time to retreat the retirement of the center to the other side of the dip in the ground at the rear was hurried and noisy but the different companies did not get mixed but our left which consisted of the azov and podolsk infantry and the pavlograd hussars was simultaneously attacked and outflanked by superior french forces under lannes and was thrown into confusion bagration had sent zherkov to the general commanding that left flank with orders to retreat immediately 
 zherkov not removing his hand from his cap turned his horse about and galloped off but no sooner had he left bagration than his courage failed him he was seized by panic and could not go where it was dangerous 
 having reached the left flank instead of going to the front where the firing was he began to look for the general and his staff where they could not possibly be and so did not deliver the order 
 the command of the left flank belonged by seniority to the commander of the regiment kutuzov had reviewed at braunau and in which dolokhov was serving as a private but the command of the extreme left flank had been assigned to the commander of the pavlograd regiment in which rostov was serving and a misunderstanding arose the two commanders were much exasperated with one another and long after the action had begun on the right flank and the french were already advancing were engaged in discussion with the sole object of offending one another but the regiments both cavalry and infantry were by no means ready for the impending action from privates to general they were not expecting a battle and were engaged in peaceful occupations the cavalry feeding the horses and the infantry collecting wood 
 he higher iss dan i in rank said the german colonel of the hussars flushing and addressing an adjutant who had ridden up so let him do what he vill but i cannot sacrifice my hussars bugler sount ze retreat 
 but haste was becoming imperative cannon and musketry mingling together thundered on the right and in the center while the capotes of lannes sharpshooters were already seen crossing the milldam and forming up within twice the range of a musket shot the general in command of the infantry went toward his horse with jerky steps and having mounted drew himself up very straight and tall and rode to the pavlograd commander the commanders met with polite bows but with secret malevolence in their hearts 
 once again colonel said the general i leave half my men in the wood i beg of you i beg of you he repeated to occupy the position and prepare for an attack 
 i peg of you yourself not to mix in vot is not your business suddenly replied the irate colonel if you vere in the cavalry 
 i am not in the cavalry colonel but i am a russian general and if you are not aware of the fact 
 quite avare your excellency suddenly shouted the colonel touching his horse and turning purple in the face vill you be so goot to come to ze front and see dat zis position iss no goot i vish to destroy my men for your pleasure 
 you forget yourself colonel i am not considering my own pleasure and i allow it to be said 
 taking the outburst as a challenge to his courage the general expanded his chest and rode frowning beside him to the front line as if their differences would be settled there amongst the bullets they reached the front several bullets sped over them and they halted in silence there was nothing fresh to be seen from the line for from where they had been before it had been evident that it was impossible for cavalry to act among the bushes and broken ground as well as that the french were outflanking our left the general and colonel looked sternly and significantly at one another like two fighting cocks preparing for battle each vainly trying to detect signs of cowardice in the other both passed the examination successfully as there was nothing to said and neither wished to give occasion for it to be alleged that he had been the first to leave the range of fire they would have remained there for a long time testing each courage had it not been that just then they heard the rattle of musketry and a muffled shout almost behind them in the wood the french had attacked the men collecting wood in the copse it was no longer possible for the hussars to retreat with the infantry they were cut off from the line of retreat on the left by the french however inconvenient the position it was now necessary to attack in order to cut away through for themselves

 chapter 
 
 for a year jo and her professor worked and waited hoped and loved met occasionally and wrote such voluminous letters that the rise in the price of paper was accounted for laurie said the second year began rather soberly for their prospects did not brighten and aunt march died suddenly but when their first sorrow was they loved the old lady in spite of her sharp found they had cause for rejoicing for she had left plumfield to jo which made all sorts of joyful things possible 
 a fine old place and will bring a handsome sum for of course you intend to sell it said laurie as they were all talking the matter over some weeks later 
 no i was decided answer as she petted the fat poodle whom she had adopted out of respect to his former mistress 
 you mean to live there 
 yes i do 
 but my dear girl an immense house and will take a power of money to keep it in order the garden and orchard alone need two or three men and farming in line i take it 
 try his hand at it there if i propose it 
 and you expect to live on the produce of the place well that sounds paradisiacal but find it desperate hard work 
 the crop we are going to raise is a profitable one and jo laughed 
 of what is this fine crop to consist 
 boys i want to open a school for little good happy homelike school with me to take care of them and fritz to teach them 
 a truly joian plan for you that just like her cried laurie appealing to the family who looked as much surprised as he 
 i like it said mrs march decidedly 
 so do i added her husband who welcomed the thought of a chance for trying the socratic method of education on modern youth 
 it will be an immense care for jo said meg stroking the head or her one son 
 jo can do it and be happy in it a splendid idea 
 tell us all about it cried mr laurence who had been longing to lend the lovers a hand but knew that they would refuse his help 
 i knew stand by me sir amy does see it in her eyes though she prudently waits to turn it over in her mind before she speaks now my dear people continued jo earnestly just understand that this a new idea of mine but a long cherished plan before my fritz came i used to think how when made my fortune and no one needed me at home hire a big house and pick up some poor forlorn little lads who any mothers and take care of them and make life jolly for them before it was too late i see so many going to ruin for want of help at the right minute i love so to do anything for them i seem to feel their wants and sympathize with their troubles an oh i should so like to be a mother to them 
 
 mrs march held out her hand to jo who took it smiling with tears in her eyes and went on in the old enthusiastic way which they had not seen for a long while 
 
 i told my plan to fritz once and he said it was just what he would like and agreed to try it when we got rich bless his dear heart been doing it all his poor boys i mean not getting rich that never be money stay in his pocket long enough to lay up any but now thanks to my good old aunt who loved me better than i ever deserved rich at least i feel so and we can live at plumfield perfectly well if we have a flourishing school just the place for boys the house is big and the furniture strong and plain plenty of room for dozens inside and splendid grounds outside 
 they could help in the garden and orchard such work is healthy it sir then fritz could train and teach in his own way and father will help him i can feed and nurse and pet and scold them and mother will be my always longed for lots of boys and never had enough now i can fill the house full and revel in the little dears to my content think what luxury 
 plumfield my own and a wilderness of boys to enjoy it with me 
 as jo waved her hands and gave a sigh of rapture the family went off into a gale of merriment and mr laurence laughed till they thought have an apoplectic fit 
 
 i see anything funny she said gravely when she could be heard nothing could be more natural and proper than for my professor to open a school and for me to prefer to reside in my own estate 
 
 she is putting on airs already said laurie who regarded the idea in the light of a capital joke but may i inquire how you intend to support the establishment if all the pupils are little ragamuffins afraid your crop be profitable in a worldly sense mr bhaer 
 
 now be a teddy of course i shall have rich pupils begin with such altogether then when got a start i can take in a ragamuffin or two just for a relish rich children often need care and comfort as well as poor seen unfortunate little creatures left to servants or backward ones pushed forward when real cruelty 
 some are naughty through mismanagment or neglect and some lose their mothers besides the best have to get through the hobbledehoy age and the very time they need most patience and kindness people laugh at them and hustle them about try to keep them out of sight and expect them to turn all at once from pretty children into fine young men they complain much 
 plucky little they feel it been through some thing of it and i know all about it a special interest in such young bears and like to show them that i see the warm honest boys hearts in spite of the clumsy arms and legs and the heads had experience too for i brought up one boy to be a pride and honor to his family 
 
 testify that you tried to do it said laurie with a grateful look 
 
 and succeeded beyond my hopes for here you are a steady sensible businessman doing heaps of good with your 
 money and laying up the blessings of the poor instead of dollars 
 but you are not merely a businessman you love good and beautiful things enjoy them yourself and let others go halves as you always did in the old times i am proud of you teddy for you get better every year and everyone feels it though you let them say so yes and when i have my flock just point to you and say your model my lads 
 
 poor laurie know where to look for man though he was something of the old bashfulness came over him as this burst of praise made all faces turn approvingly upon him 
 
 i say jo rather too much he began just in his old boyish way you have all done more for me than i can ever thank you for except by doing my best not to disapoint you you have rather cast me off lately jo but had the best of help nevertheless so if got on at all you may thank these two for it and he laid one hand gently on his head and the other on golden one for the three were never far apart 
 
 i do think that families are the most beautiful things in all the world burst out jo who was in an unusually frame of mind just then when i have one of my own i hope it will be as happy as the three i know and love the best if john and my fritz were only here it would be quite a little heaven on earth she added more quietly and that night when she went to her room after a blissful evening of family counsels hopes and plans her heart was so full of happiness that she could only calm it by kneeling beside the empty bed always near her own and thinking tender thoughts of beth 
 it was a very astonishing year altogether for things seemed to happen in an unusually rapid and delightful manner almost before she knew where she was jo found herself married and settled at plumfield then a family of six or seven boys sprung up like mushrooms and flourished surprisingly poor boys as well as rich for mr laurence was continually finding some touching case of destitution and begging the bhaers to take pity on the child and he would gladly pay a trifle for its support in this way the sly old gentleman got round proud jo and furnished her with the style of boy in which she most delighted 
 
 of course it was uphill work at first and jo made queer mistakes but the wise professor steered her safely into calmer waters and the most rampant ragamuffin was conquered in the end how jo did enjoy her wilderness of boys and how poor dear aunt march would have lamented had she been there to see the sacred precincts of prim plumfield overrun with toms dicks and harrys there was a sort of poetic justice about it after all for the old lady had been the terror of the boys for miles around and now the exiles feasted freely on forbidden plums kicked up the gravel with profane boots unreproved and played cricket in the big field where the irritable cow with a crumpled horn used to invite rash youths to come and be tossed it became a sort of boys paradise and laurie suggested that it should be called the as a compliment to its master and appropriate to its inhabitants 
 
 it never was a fashionable school and the professor did not lay up a fortune but it was just what jo intended it to be a happy homelike place for boys who needed teaching care and kindness every room in the big house was soon full every little plot in the garden soon had its owner a regular menagerie appeared in barn and shed for pet animals were allowed and three times a day jo smiled at her fritz from the head of a long table lined on either side with rows of happy young faces which all turned to her with affectionate eyes confiding words and grateful hearts full of love for mother bhaer she had boys enough now and did not tire of them though they were not angels by any means and some of them caused both professor and professorin much trouble and anxiety but her faith in the good spot which exists in the heart of the naughtiest sauciest most tantalizing little ragamuffin gave her patience skill and in time success for no mortal boy could hold out long with father bhaer shining on him as benevolently as the sun and mother bhaer forgiving him seventy times seven very precious to jo was the friendship of the lads their penitent sniffs and whispers after wrongdoing their droll or touching little confidences their pleasant enthusiasms hopes and plans even their misfortunes for they only endeared them to her all the more there were slow boys and bashful boys feeble boys and riotous boys boys that lisped and boys that stuttered one or two lame ones and a merry little quadroon who could not be taken in elsewhere but who was welcome to the though some people predicted that his admission would ruin the school 
 
 yes jo was a very happy woman there in spite of hard work much anxiety and a perpetual racket she enjoyed it heartily and found the applause of her boys more satisfying than any praise of the world for now she told no stories except to her flock of enthusiastic believers and admirers as the years went on two little lads of her own came to increase her named for grandpa and teddy a baby who seemed to have inherited his sunshiny temper as well as his lively spirit how they ever grew up alive in that whirlpool of boys was a mystery to their grandma and aunts but they flourished like dandelions in spring and their rough nurses loved and served them well 
 
 there were a great many holidays at plumfield and one of the most delightful was the yearly for then the marches laurences brookes and bhaers turned out in full force and made a day of it five years after wedding one of these fruitful festivals occurred a mellow october day when the air was full of an exhilarating freshness which made the spirits rise and the blood dance healthily in the veins the old orchard wore its holiday attire goldenrod and asters fringed the mossy walls grasshoppers skipped briskly in the sere grass and crickets chirped like fairy pipers at a feast squirrels were busy with their small harvesting birds twittered their adieux from the alders in the lane and every tree stood ready to send down its shower of red or yellow apples at the first shake everybody was there 
 everybody laughed and sang climbed up and tumbled down everybody declared that there never had been such a perfect day or such a jolly set to enjoy it and everyone gave themselves up to the simple pleasures of the hour as freely as if there were no such things as care or sorrow in the world 
 
 mr march strolled placidly about quoting tusser cowley and columella to mr laurence while enjoying 
 
 the gentle winey juice 
 
 the professor charged up and down the green aisles like a stout teutonic knight with a pole for a lance leading on the boys who made a hook and ladder company of themselves and performed wonders in the way of ground and lofty tumbling laurie devoted himself to the little ones rode his small daughter in a took daisy up among the nests and kept adventurous rob from breaking his neck mrs march and meg sat among the apple piles like a pair of pomonas sorting the contributions that kept pouring in while amy with a beautiful motherly expression in her face sketched the various groups and watched over one pale lad who sat adoring her with his little crutch beside him 
 
 jo was in her element that day and rushed about with her gown pinned up and her hat anywhere but on her head and her baby tucked under her arm ready for any lively adventure which might turn up little teddy bore a charmed life for nothing ever happened to him and jo never felt any anxiety when he was whisked up into a tree by one lad galloped off on the back of another or supplied with sour russets by his indulgent papa who labored under the germanic delusion that babies could digest anything from pickled cabbage to buttons nails and their own small shoes she knew that little ted would turn up again in time safe and rosy dirty and serene and she always received him back with a hearty welcome for jo loved her babies tenderly 
 
 at four a lull took place and baskets remained empty while the apple pickers rested and compared rents and bruises then jo and meg with a detachment of the bigger boys set forth the supper on the grass for an tea was always the crowning joy of the day the land literally flowed with milk and honey on such occasions for the lads were not required to sit at table but allowed to partake of refreshment as they being the sauce best beloved by the boyish soul they availed themselves of the rare privilege to the fullest extent for some tried the pleasing experiment of drinking mild while standing on their heads others lent a charm to leapfrog by eating pie in the pauses of the game cookies were sown broadcast over the field and apple turnovers roosted in the trees like a new style of bird the little girls had a private tea party and ted roved among the edibles at his own sweet will 
 
 when no one could eat any more the professor proposed the first regular toast which was always drunk at such march god bless her a toast heartily given by the good man who never forgot how much he owed her and quietly drunk by the boys who had been taught to keep her memory green 
 
 now sixtieth birthday long life to her with three times three 
 
 that was given with a will as you may well believe and the cheering once begun it was hard to stop it health was proposed form mr laurence who was considered their special patron to the astonished guinea pig who had strayed from its proper sphere in search of its young master demi as the oldest grandchild then presented the queen of the day with various gifts so numerous that they were transported to the festive scene in a wheelbarrow funny presents some of them but what would have been defects to other eyes were ornaments to the gifts were all their own every stitch patient little fingers had put into the handkerchiefs she hemmed was better than embroidery to mrs march miracle of mechanical skill though the cover shut footstool had a wiggle in its uneven legs that she declared was soothing and no page of the costly book child gave her was so fair as that on which appeared in tipsy capitals the words 
 to dear grandma from her little beth during the ceremony the boys had mysteriously disappeared and when mrs march had tried to thank her children and broken down while teddy wiped her eyes on his pinafore the professor suddenly began to sing then from above him voice after voice took up the words and from tree to tree echoed the music of the unseen choir as the boys sang with all their hearts the little song that jo had written laurie set to music and the professor trained his lads to give with the best effect this was something altogether new and it proved a grand success for mrs march get over her surprise and insisted on shaking hands with every one of the featherless birds from tall franz and emil to the little quadroon who had the sweetest voice of all 
 after this the boys dispersed for a final lark leaving mrs march and her daughters under the festival tree 
 i think i ever ought to call myself unlucky jo again when my greatest wish has been so beautifully gratified said mrs bhaer taking little fist out of the milk pitcher in which he was rapturously churning 
 and yet your life is very different from the one you pictured so long ago do you remember our castles in the air asked amy smiling as she watched laurie and john playing cricket with the boys 
 
 dear fellows it does my heart good to see them forget business and frolic for a day answered jo who now spoke in a maternal way of all mankind yes i remember but the life i wanted then seems selfish lonely and cold to me now i given up the hope that i may write a good book yet but i can wait and sure it will be all the better for such experiences and illustrations as these and jo pointed from the lively lads in the distance to her father leaning on the arm as they walked to and fro in the sunshine deep in one of the conversations which both enjoyed so much and then to her mother sitting enthroned among her daughters with their children in her lap and at her feet as if all found help and happiness in the face which never could grow old to them 
 my castle was the most nearly realized of all i asked for splendid things to be sure but in my heart i knew i should be satisfied if i had a little home and john and some dear children like these got them all thank god and am the happiest woman in the world and meg laid her hand on her tall head with a face full of tender and devout content 
 
 my castle is very different from what i planned but i would not alter it though like jo i relinquish all my artistic hopes or confine myself to helping others fulfill their dreams of beauty begun to model a figure of baby and laurie says it is the best thing ever done i think so myself and mean to do it in marble so that whatever happens i may at least keep the image of my little angel 
 
 as amy spoke a great tear dropped on the golden hair of the sleeping child in her arms for her one daughter was a frail little creature and the dread of losing her was the shadow over sunshine this cross was doing much for both father and mother for one love and sorrow bound them closely together nature was growing sweeter deeper and more tender laurie was growing more serious strong and firm and both were learning that beauty youth good fortune even love itself cannot keep care and pain loss and sorrow from the most blessed for 
 into each life some rain must fall some days must be dark and sad and dreary 
 she is growing better i am sure of it my dear despond but hope and keep happy said mrs march as tenderhearted daisy stooped from her knee to lay her rosy cheek against her little pale one 
 i never ought to while i have you to cheer me up marmee and laurie to take more than half of every burden replied amy warmly he never lets me see his anxiety but is so sweet and patient with me so devoted to beth and such a stay and comfort to me always that i love him enough so in spite of my one cross i can say with meg thank god a happy woman 
 no need for me to say it for everyone can see that far happier than i deserve added jo glancing from her good husband to her chubby children tumbling on the grass beside her fritz is getting gray and stout growing as thin as a shadow and am thirty we never shall be rich and plumfield may burn up any night for that incorrigible tommy bangs will smoke cigars under the though set himself afire three times already but in spite of these unromantic facts i have nothing to complain of and never was so jolly in my life excuse the remark but living among boys i help using their expressions now and then

 chapter 
 
 for a year jo and her professor worked and waited hoped and loved met occasionally and wrote such voluminous letters that the rise in the price of paper was accounted for laurie said the second year began rather soberly for their prospects did not brighten and aunt march died suddenly but when their first sorrow was they loved the old lady in spite of her sharp found they had cause for rejoicing for she had left plumfield to jo which made all sorts of joyful things possible 
 a fine old place and will bring a handsome sum for of course you intend to sell it said laurie as they were all talking the matter over some weeks later 
 no i was decided answer as she petted the fat poodle whom she had adopted out of respect to his former mistress 
 you mean to live there 
 yes i do 
 but my dear girl an immense house and will take a power of money to keep it in order the garden and orchard alone need two or three men and farming in line i take it 
 try his hand at it there if i propose it 
 and you expect to live on the produce of the place well that sounds paradisiacal but find it desperate hard work 
 the crop we are going to raise is a profitable one and jo laughed 
 of what is this fine crop to consist 
 boys i want to open a school for little good happy homelike school with me to take care of them and fritz to teach them 
 a truly joian plan for you that just like her cried laurie appealing to the family who looked as much surprised as he 
 i like it said mrs march decidedly 
 so do i added her husband who welcomed the thought of a chance for trying the socratic method of education on modern youth 
 it will be an immense care for jo said meg stroking the head or her one son 
 jo can do it and be happy in it a splendid idea 
 tell us all about it cried mr laurence who had been longing to lend the lovers a hand but knew that they would refuse his help 
 i knew stand by me sir amy does see it in her eyes though she prudently waits to turn it over in her mind before she speaks now my dear people continued jo earnestly just understand that this a new idea of mine but a long cherished plan before my fritz came i used to think how when made my fortune and no one needed me at home hire a big house and pick up some poor forlorn little lads who any mothers and take care of them and make life jolly for them before it was too late i see so many going to ruin for want of help at the right minute i love so to do anything for them i seem to feel their wants and sympathize with their troubles an oh i should so like to be a mother to them 
 
 mrs march held out her hand to jo who took it smiling with tears in her eyes and went on in the old enthusiastic way which they had not seen for a long while 
 
 i told my plan to fritz once and he said it was just what he would like and agreed to try it when we got rich bless his dear heart been doing it all his poor boys i mean not getting rich that never be money stay in his pocket long enough to lay up any but now thanks to my good old aunt who loved me better than i ever deserved rich at least i feel so and we can live at plumfield perfectly well if we have a flourishing school just the place for boys the house is big and the furniture strong and plain plenty of room for dozens inside and splendid grounds outside 
 they could help in the garden and orchard such work is healthy it sir then fritz could train and teach in his own way and father will help him i can feed and nurse and pet and scold them and mother will be my always longed for lots of boys and never had enough now i can fill the house full and revel in the little dears to my content think what luxury 
 plumfield my own and a wilderness of boys to enjoy it with me 
 as jo waved her hands and gave a sigh of rapture the family went off into a gale of merriment and mr laurence laughed till they thought have an apoplectic fit 
 
 i see anything funny she said gravely when she could be heard nothing could be more natural and proper than for my professor to open a school and for me to prefer to reside in my own estate 
 
 she is putting on airs already said laurie who regarded the idea in the light of a capital joke but may i inquire how you intend to support the establishment if all the pupils are little ragamuffins afraid your crop be profitable in a worldly sense mr bhaer 
 
 now be a teddy of course i shall have rich pupils begin with such altogether then when got a start i can take in a ragamuffin or two just for a relish rich children often need care and comfort as well as poor seen unfortunate little creatures left to servants or backward ones pushed forward when real cruelty 
 some are naughty through mismanagment or neglect and some lose their mothers besides the best have to get through the hobbledehoy age and the very time they need most patience and kindness people laugh at them and hustle them about try to keep them out of sight and expect them to turn all at once from pretty children into fine young men they complain much 
 plucky little they feel it been through some thing of it and i know all about it a special interest in such young bears and like to show them that i see the warm honest boys hearts in spite of the clumsy arms and legs and the heads had experience too for i brought up one boy to be a pride and honor to his family 
 
 testify that you tried to do it said laurie with a grateful look 
 
 and succeeded beyond my hopes for here you are a steady sensible businessman doing heaps of good with your 
 money and laying up the blessings of the poor instead of dollars 
 but you are not merely a businessman you love good and beautiful things enjoy them yourself and let others go halves as you always did in the old times i am proud of you teddy for you get better every year and everyone feels it though you let them say so yes and when i have my flock just point to you and say your model my lads 
 
 poor laurie know where to look for man though he was something of the old bashfulness came over him as this burst of praise made all faces turn approvingly upon him 
 
 i say jo rather too much he began just in his old boyish way you have all done more for me than i can ever thank you for except by doing my best not to disapoint you you have rather cast me off lately jo but had the best of help nevertheless so if got on at all you may thank these two for it and he laid one hand gently on his head and the other on golden one for the three were never far apart 
 
 i do think that families are the most beautiful things in all the world burst out jo who was in an unusually frame of mind just then when i have one of my own i hope it will be as happy as the three i know and love the best if john and my fritz were only here it would be quite a little heaven on earth she added more quietly and that night when she went to her room after a blissful evening of family counsels hopes and plans her heart was so full of happiness that she could only calm it by kneeling beside the empty bed always near her own and thinking tender thoughts of beth 
 it was a very astonishing year altogether for things seemed to happen in an unusually rapid and delightful manner almost before she knew where she was jo found herself married and settled at plumfield then a family of six or seven boys sprung up like mushrooms and flourished surprisingly poor boys as well as rich for mr laurence was continually finding some touching case of destitution and begging the bhaers to take pity on the child and he would gladly pay a trifle for its support in this way the sly old gentleman got round proud jo and furnished her with the style of boy in which she most delighted 
 
 of course it was uphill work at first and jo made queer mistakes but the wise professor steered her safely into calmer waters and the most rampant ragamuffin was conquered in the end how jo did enjoy her wilderness of boys and how poor dear aunt march would have lamented had she been there to see the sacred precincts of prim plumfield overrun with toms dicks and harrys there was a sort of poetic justice about it after all for the old lady had been the terror of the boys for miles around and now the exiles feasted freely on forbidden plums kicked up the gravel with profane boots unreproved and played cricket in the big field where the irritable cow with a crumpled horn used to invite rash youths to come and be tossed it became a sort of boys paradise and laurie suggested that it should be called the as a compliment to its master and appropriate to its inhabitants 
 
 it never was a fashionable school and the professor did not lay up a fortune but it was just what jo intended it to be a happy homelike place for boys who needed teaching care and kindness every room in the big house was soon full every little plot in the garden soon had its owner a regular menagerie appeared in barn and shed for pet animals were allowed and three times a day jo smiled at her fritz from the head of a long table lined on either side with rows of happy young faces which all turned to her with affectionate eyes confiding words and grateful hearts full of love for mother bhaer she had boys enough now and did not tire of them though they were not angels by any means and some of them caused both professor and professorin much trouble and anxiety but her faith in the good spot which exists in the heart of the naughtiest sauciest most tantalizing little ragamuffin gave her patience skill and in time success for no mortal boy could hold out long with father bhaer shining on him as benevolently as the sun and mother bhaer forgiving him seventy times seven very precious to jo was the friendship of the lads their penitent sniffs and whispers after wrongdoing their droll or touching little confidences their pleasant enthusiasms hopes and plans even their misfortunes for they only endeared them to her all the more there were slow boys and bashful boys feeble boys and riotous boys boys that lisped and boys that stuttered one or two lame ones and a merry little quadroon who could not be taken in elsewhere but who was welcome to the though some people predicted that his admission would ruin the school 
 
 yes jo was a very happy woman there in spite of hard work much anxiety and a perpetual racket she enjoyed it heartily and found the applause of her boys more satisfying than any praise of the world for now she told no stories except to her flock of enthusiastic believers and admirers as the years went on two little lads of her own came to increase her named for grandpa and teddy a baby who seemed to have inherited his sunshiny temper as well as his lively spirit how they ever grew up alive in that whirlpool of boys was a mystery to their grandma and aunts but they flourished like dandelions in spring and their rough nurses loved and served them well 
 
 there were a great many holidays at plumfield and one of the most delightful was the yearly for then the marches laurences brookes and bhaers turned out in full force and made a day of it five years after wedding one of these fruitful festivals occurred a mellow october day when the air was full of an exhilarating freshness which made the spirits rise and the blood dance healthily in the veins the old orchard wore its holiday attire goldenrod and asters fringed the mossy walls grasshoppers skipped briskly in the sere grass and crickets chirped like fairy pipers at a feast squirrels were busy with their small harvesting birds twittered their adieux from the alders in the lane and every tree stood ready to send down its shower of red or yellow apples at the first shake everybody was there 
 everybody laughed and sang climbed up and tumbled down everybody declared that there never had been such a perfect day or such a jolly set to enjoy it and everyone gave themselves up to the simple pleasures of the hour as freely as if there were no such things as care or sorrow in the world 
 
 mr march strolled placidly about quoting tusser cowley and columella to mr laurence while enjoying 
 
 the gentle winey juice 
 
 the professor charged up and down the green aisles like a stout teutonic knight with a pole for a lance leading on the boys who made a hook and ladder company of themselves and performed wonders in the way of ground and lofty tumbling laurie devoted himself to the little ones rode his small daughter in a took daisy up among the nests and kept adventurous rob from breaking his neck mrs march and meg sat among the apple piles like a pair of pomonas sorting the contributions that kept pouring in while amy with a beautiful motherly expression in her face sketched the various groups and watched over one pale lad who sat adoring her with his little crutch beside him 
 
 jo was in her element that day and rushed about with her gown pinned up and her hat anywhere but on her head and her baby tucked under her arm ready for any lively adventure which might turn up little teddy bore a charmed life for nothing ever happened to him and jo never felt any anxiety when he was whisked up into a tree by one lad galloped off on the back of another or supplied with sour russets by his indulgent papa who labored under the germanic delusion that babies could digest anything from pickled cabbage to buttons nails and their own small shoes she knew that little ted would turn up again in time safe and rosy dirty and serene and she always received him back with a hearty welcome for jo loved her babies tenderly 
 
 at four a lull took place and baskets remained empty while the apple pickers rested and compared rents and bruises then jo and meg with a detachment of the bigger boys set forth the supper on the grass for an tea was always the crowning joy of the day the land literally flowed with milk and honey on such occasions for the lads were not required to sit at table but allowed to partake of refreshment as they being the sauce best beloved by the boyish soul they availed themselves of the rare privilege to the fullest extent for some tried the pleasing experiment of drinking mild while standing on their heads others lent a charm to leapfrog by eating pie in the pauses of the game cookies were sown broadcast over the field and apple turnovers roosted in the trees like a new style of bird the little girls had a private tea party and ted roved among the edibles at his own sweet will 
 
 when no one could eat any more the professor proposed the first regular toast which was always drunk at such march god bless her a toast heartily given by the good man who never forgot how much he owed her and quietly drunk by the boys who had been taught to keep her memory green 
 
 now sixtieth birthday long life to her with three times three 
 
 that was given with a will as you may well believe and the cheering once begun it was hard to stop it health was proposed form mr laurence who was considered their special patron to the astonished guinea pig who had strayed from its proper sphere in search of its young master demi as the oldest grandchild then presented the queen of the day with various gifts so numerous that they were transported to the festive scene in a wheelbarrow funny presents some of them but what would have been defects to other eyes were ornaments to the gifts were all their own every stitch patient little fingers had put into the handkerchiefs she hemmed was better than embroidery to mrs march miracle of mechanical skill though the cover shut footstool had a wiggle in its uneven legs that she declared was soothing and no page of the costly book child gave her was so fair as that on which appeared in tipsy capitals the words 
 to dear grandma from her little beth during the ceremony the boys had mysteriously disappeared and when mrs march had tried to thank her children and broken down while teddy wiped her eyes on his pinafore the professor suddenly began to sing then from above him voice after voice took up the words and from tree to tree echoed the music of the unseen choir as the boys sang with all their hearts the little song that jo had written laurie set to music and the professor trained his lads to give with the best effect this was something altogether new and it proved a grand success for mrs march get over her surprise and insisted on shaking hands with every one of the featherless birds from tall franz and emil to the little quadroon who had the sweetest voice of all 
 after this the boys dispersed for a final lark leaving mrs march and her daughters under the festival tree 
 i think i ever ought to call myself unlucky jo again when my greatest wish has been so beautifully gratified said mrs bhaer taking little fist out of the milk pitcher in which he was rapturously churning 
 and yet your life is very different from the one you pictured so long ago do you remember our castles in the air asked amy smiling as she watched laurie and john playing cricket with the boys 
 
 dear fellows it does my heart good to see them forget business and frolic for a day answered jo who now spoke in a maternal way of all mankind yes i remember but the life i wanted then seems selfish lonely and cold to me now i given up the hope that i may write a good book yet but i can wait and sure it will be all the better for such experiences and illustrations as these and jo pointed from the lively lads in the distance to her father leaning on the arm as they walked to and fro in the sunshine deep in one of the conversations which both enjoyed so much and then to her mother sitting enthroned among her daughters with their children in her lap and at her feet as if all found help and happiness in the face which never could grow old to them 
 my castle was the most nearly realized of all i asked for splendid things to be sure but in my heart i knew i should be satisfied if i had a little home and john and some dear children like these got them all thank god and am the happiest woman in the world and meg laid her hand on her tall head with a face full of tender and devout content 
 
 my castle is very different from what i planned but i would not alter it though like jo i relinquish all my artistic hopes or confine myself to helping others fulfill their dreams of beauty begun to model a figure of baby and laurie says it is the best thing ever done i think so myself and mean to do it in marble so that whatever happens i may at least keep the image of my little angel 
 
 as amy spoke a great tear dropped on the golden hair of the sleeping child in her arms for her one daughter was a frail little creature and the dread of losing her was the shadow over sunshine this cross was doing much for both father and mother for one love and sorrow bound them closely together nature was growing sweeter deeper and more tender laurie was growing more serious strong and firm and both were learning that beauty youth good fortune even love itself cannot keep care and pain loss and sorrow from the most blessed for 
 into each life some rain must fall some days must be dark and sad and dreary 
 she is growing better i am sure of it my dear despond but hope and keep happy said mrs march as tenderhearted daisy stooped from her knee to lay her rosy cheek against her little pale one 
 i never ought to while i have you to cheer me up marmee and laurie to take more than half of every burden replied amy warmly he never lets me see his anxiety but is so sweet and patient with me so devoted to beth and such a stay and comfort to me always that i love him enough so in spite of my one cross i can say with meg thank god a happy woman 
 no need for me to say it for everyone can see that far happier than i deserve added jo glancing from her good husband to her chubby children tumbling on the grass beside her fritz is getting gray and stout growing as thin as a shadow and am thirty we never shall be rich and plumfield may burn up any night for that incorrigible tommy bangs will smoke cigars under the though set himself afire three times already but in spite of these unromantic facts i have nothing to complain of and never was so jolly in my life excuse the remark but living among boys i help using their expressions now and then 
 yes jo i think your harvest will be a good one beganmrs march frightening away a big black cricket that was staring teddy out of countenance 
 not half so good as yours mother here it is and we never can thank you enough for the patient sowing and reaping you have done cried jo with the loving impetuosity which she never would outgrow 
 i hope there will be more wheat and fewer tares every year said amy softly 
 a large sheaf but i know room in your heart for it marmee dear added tender voice 
 touched to the heart mrs march could only stretch out her arms as if to gather children and grandchildren to herself and say with face and voice full of motherly love gratitude and humility 
 oh my girls however long you may live i never can wish you a greater happiness than this

 fairy tales of hans christian andersen 
 the dumb book 
 by hans christian andersen 
 
 in the which led through a wood stood a solitary 
 the road in fact ran right through its yard the sun was 
 shining and all the windows were open within the house people were 
 very busy in the yard in an arbour formed by lilac bushes in full 
 bloom stood an open coffin thither they had carried a dead man 
 who was to be buried that very afternoon nobody shed a tear over him his face was covered over with a white cloth under his head they 
 had placed a large thick book the leaves of which consisted of folded sheets of and withered flowers lay between them it was the herbarium which he had gathered in various places and was to be buried with him according to his own wish every one of the flowers in it was connected with some chapter of his life 
 
 who is the dead man we asked 
 
 the old student was the reply they say that he was once an 
 energetic young man that he studied the dead languages and sang 
 and even composed many songs then something had happened to him and in consequence of this he gave himself up to drink body and mind 
 
 when at last he had ruined his health they brought him into the 
 country where someone paid for his board and residence he was gentle as a child as long as the sullen mood did not come over him but when it came he was fierce became as strong as a giant and ran about in the wood like a chased deer but when we succeeded in bringing him home and prevailed upon him to open the book with the plants in it he would sometimes sit for a whole day looking at this or that plant while frequently the tears rolled over his cheeks 
 god knows what was in his mind but he requested us to put the book into his coffin and now he lies there in a little while the lid will 
 be placed upon the coffin and he will have sweet rest in the grave 
 
 the cloth which covered his face was lifted up the dead 
 face expressed peace a sunbeam fell upon it a swallow flew with 
 the swiftness of an arrow into the arbour turning in its flight 
 and twittered over the dead head 
 
 what a strange feeling it is surely we all know it to look 
 through old letters of our young days a different life rises up out 
 of the past as it were with all its hopes and sorrows how many of 
 the people with whom in those days we used to be on intimate terms 
 appear to us as if dead and yet they are still alive only we have 
 not thought of them for such a long time whom we imagined we should retain in our memories for ever and share every joy and sorrow with them 
 
 the withered oak leaf in the book here recalled the friend the 
 schoolfellow who was to be his friend for life he fixed the leaf 
 to the cap in the green wood when they vowed eternal 
 friendship where does he dwell now the leaf is kept but the 
 friendship does no longer exist here is a foreign hothouse plant too 
 tender for the gardens of the north it is almost as if its leaves 
 still smelt sweet she gave it to him out of her own garden a 
 daughter 
 
 here is a that he had plucked himself and watered with 
 salt tears a lily of sweet water and here is a nettle what may 
 its leaves tell us what might he have thought when he plucked and 
 kept it here is a little snowdrop out of the solitary wood here is 
 an evergreen from the at the tavern and here is a simple 
 blade of grass 
 
 the lilac bends its fresh fragrant flowers over the dead 
 head the swallow passes again twit twit now the men come with

 in her youth in she had married a monk who had fled from his cloister in a red cap and passed from the bernardines to the jacobins she was dry rough peevish sharp captious almost venomous all this in memory of her monk whose widow she was and who had ruled over her masterfully and bent her to his will she was a nettle in which the rustle of the cassock was visible at the restoration she had turned bigot and that with so much energy that the priests had forgiven her her monk 
 she had a small property which she bequeathed with much ostentation to a religious community she was in high favor at the episcopal palace of arras 
 so this madame victurnien went to montfermeil and returned with the remark i have seen the child 
 all this took time 
 fantine had been at the factory for more than a year when one morning the superintendent of the workroom handed her fifty francs from the mayor told her that she was no longer employed in the shop and requested her in the name to leave the neighborhood 
 this was the very month when the thenardiers after having demanded twelve francs instead of six had just exacted fifteen francs instead of twelve 
 fantine was overwhelmed 
 she could not leave the neighborhood she was in debt for her rent and furniture 
 fifty francs was not sufficient to cancel this debt 
 she stammered a few supplicating words the superintendent ordered her to leave the shop on the instant besides fantine was only a moderately good workwoman overcome with shame even more than with despair she quitted the shop and returned to her room 
 so her fault was now known to every one 
 she no longer felt strong enough to say a word 
 she was advised to see the mayor she did not dare 
 the mayor had given her fifty francs because he was good and had dismissed her because he was just she bowed before the decision

 chapter xx 
 
 the infantry regiments that had been caught unawares in the outskirts of the wood ran out of it the different companies getting mixed and retreated as a disorderly crowd one soldier in his fear uttered the senseless cry cut off that is so terrible in battle and that word infected the whole crowd with a feeling of panic 
 surrounded cut off lost shouted the fugitives 
 the moment he heard the firing and the cry from behind the general realized that something dreadful had happened to his regiment and the thought that he an exemplary officer of many years service who had never been to blame might be held responsible at headquarters for negligence or inefficiency so staggered him that forgetting the recalcitrant cavalry colonel his own dignity as a general and above all quite forgetting the danger and all regard for he clutched the crupper of his saddle and spurring his horse galloped to the regiment under a hail of bullets which fell around but fortunately missed him his one desire was to know what was happening and at any cost correct or remedy the mistake if he had made one so that he an exemplary officer of years service who had never been censured should not be held to blame 
 having galloped safely through the french he reached a field behind the copse across which our men regardless of orders were running and descending the valley that moment of moral hesitation which decides the fate of battles had arrived would this disorderly crowd of soldiers attend to the voice of their commander or would they disregarding him continue their flight despite his desperate shouts that used to seem so terrible to the soldiers despite his furious purple countenance distorted out of all likeness to his former self and the flourishing of his saber the soldiers all continued to run talking firing into the air and disobeying orders the moral hesitation which decided the fate of battles was evidently culminating in a panic 
 the general had a fit of coughing as a result of shouting and of the powder smoke and stopped in despair everything seemed lost but at that moment the french who were attacking suddenly and without any apparent reason ran back and disappeared from the outskirts and russian sharpshooters showed themselves in the copse it was company which alone had maintained its order in the wood and having lain in ambush in a ditch now attacked the french unexpectedly timokhin armed only with a sword had rushed at the enemy with such a desperate cry and such mad drunken determination that taken by surprise the french had thrown down their muskets and run dolokhov running beside timokhin killed a frenchman at close quarters and was the first to seize the surrendering french officer by his collar our fugitives returned the battalions and the french who had nearly cut our left flank in half were for the moment repulsed our reserve units were able to join up and the fight was at an end the regimental commander and major ekonomov had stopped beside a bridge letting the retreating companies pass by them when a soldier came up and took hold of the stirrup almost leaning against him the man was wearing a bluish coat of broadcloth he had no knapsack or cap his head was bandaged and over his shoulder a french munition pouch was slung he had an sword in his hand the soldier was pale his blue eyes looked impudently into the face and his lips were smiling though the commander was occupied in giving instructions to major ekonomov he could not help taking notice of the soldier 
 your excellency here are two trophies said dolokhov pointing to the french sword and pouch i have taken an officer prisoner i stopped the company dolokhov breathed heavily from weariness and spoke in abrupt sentences the whole company can bear witness i beg you will remember this your excellency 
 all right all right replied the commander and turned to major ekonomov 
 but dolokhov did not go away he untied the handkerchief around his head pulled it off and showed the blood congealed on his hair 
 a bayonet wound i remained at the front remember your excellency 
 battery had been forgotten and only at the very end of the action did prince bagration still hearing the cannonade in the center send his orderly staff officer and later prince andrew also to order the battery to retire as quickly as possible when the supports attached to battery had been moved away in the middle of the action by order the battery had continued firing and was only not captured by the french because the enemy could not surmise that anyone could have the effrontery to continue firing from four quite undefended guns on the contrary the energetic action of that battery led the french to suppose that here in the center the main russian forces were concentrated twice they had attempted to attack this point but on each occasion had been driven back by grapeshot from the four isolated guns on the hillock 
 soon after prince bagration had left him tushin had succeeded in setting fire to schon grabern 
 look at them scurrying burning just see the smoke fine grand look at the smoke the smoke exclaimed the artillerymen brightening up 
 all the guns without waiting for orders were being fired in the direction of the conflagration as if urging each other on the soldiers cried at each shot fine good look at it grand the fire fanned by the breeze was rapidly spreading the french columns that had advanced beyond the village went back but as though in revenge for this failure the enemy placed ten guns to the right of the village and began firing them at battery 
 in their childlike glee aroused by the fire and their luck in successfully cannonading the french our artillerymen only noticed this battery when two balls and then four more fell among our guns one knocking over two horses and another tearing off a leg their spirits once roused were however not diminished but only changed character the horses were replaced by others from a reserve gun carriage the wounded were carried away and the four guns were turned against the battery companion officer had been killed at the beginning of the engagement and within an hour seventeen of the forty men of the guns crews had been disabled but the artillerymen were still as merry and lively as ever twice they noticed the french appearing below them and then they fired grapeshot at them 
 little tushin moving feebly and awkwardly kept telling his orderly to refill my pipe for that one and then scattering sparks from it ran forward shading his eyes with his small hand to look at the french 
 smack at em lads he kept saying seizing the guns by the wheels and working the screws himself 
 amid the smoke deafened by the incessant reports which always made him jump tushin not taking his pipe from his mouth ran from gun to gun now aiming now counting the charges now giving orders about replacing dead or wounded horses and harnessing fresh ones and shouting in his feeble voice so high pitched and irresolute his face grew more and more animated only when a man was killed or wounded did he frown and turn away from the sight shouting angrily at the men who as is always the case hesitated about lifting the injured or dead the soldiers for the most part handsome fellows and as is always the case in an artillery company a head and shoulders taller and twice as broad as their officer all looked at their commander like children in an embarrassing situation and the expression on his face was invariably reflected on theirs 
 owing to the terrible uproar and the necessity for concentration and activity tushin did not experience the slightest unpleasant sense of fear and the thought that he might be killed or badly wounded never occurred to him on the contrary he became more and more elated it seemed to him that it was a very long time ago almost a day since he had first seen the enemy and fired the first shot and that the corner of the field he stood on was and familiar ground though he thought of everything considered everything and did everything the best of officers could do in his position he was in a state akin to feverish delirium or drunkenness 
 from the deafening sounds of his own guns around him the whistle and thud of the cannon balls from the flushed and perspiring faces of the crew bustling round the guns from the sight of the blood of men and horses from the little puffs of smoke on the side always followed by a ball flying past and striking the earth a man a gun a horse from the sight of all these things a fantastic world of his own had taken possession of his brain and at that moment afforded him pleasure the guns were in his fancy not guns but pipes from which occasional puffs were blown by an invisible smoker 
 there puffing again muttered tushin to himself as a small cloud rose from the hill and was borne in a streak to the left by the wind 
 now look out for the ball throw it back 
 what do you want your honor asked an artilleryman standing close by who heard him muttering 
 nothing only a shell he answered 
 come along our matvevna he said to himself matvevna was the name his fancy gave to the farthest gun of the battery which was large and of an old pattern the french swarming round their guns seemed to him like ants in that world the handsome drunkard number one of the second crew was uncle tushin looked at him more often than at anyone else and took delight in his every movement the sound of musketry at the foot of the hill now diminishing now increasing seemed like breathing he listened intently to the ebb and flow of these sounds 
 daughter of matthew 
 ah breathing again breathing he muttered to himself 
 he imagined himself as an enormously tall powerful man who was throwing cannon balls at the french with both hands 
 now then matvevna dear old lady let me down he was saying as he moved from the gun when a strange unfamiliar voice called above his head captain tushin captain 
 tushin turned round in dismay it was the staff officer who had turned him out of the booth at grunth he was shouting in a gasping voice 
 are you mad you have twice been ordered to retreat and you 
 why are they down on me thought tushin looking in alarm at his superior 
 i he muttered holding up two fingers to his cap i 
 but the staff officer did not finish what he wanted to say a cannon ball flying close to him caused him to duck and bend over his horse he paused and just as he was about to say something more another ball stopped him he turned his horse and galloped off 
 retire all to retire he shouted from a distance 
 the soldiers laughed a moment later an adjutant arrived with the same order 
 it was prince andrew the first thing he saw on riding up to the space where guns were stationed was an unharnessed horse with a broken leg that lay screaming piteously beside the harnessed horses blood was gushing from its leg as from a spring among the limbers lay several dead men one ball after another passed over as he approached and he felt a nervous shudder run down his spine but the mere thought of being afraid roused him again i cannot be afraid thought he and dismounted slowly among the guns he delivered the order and did not leave the battery he decided to have the guns removed from their positions and withdrawn in his presence together with tushin stepping across the bodies and under a terrible fire from the french he attended to the removal of the guns 
 a staff officer was here a minute ago but skipped off said an artilleryman to prince andrew not like your honor 
 prince andrew said nothing to tushin they were both so busy as to seem not to notice one another when having limbered up the only two cannon that remained uninjured out of the four they began moving down the hill one shattered gun and one unicorn were left behind prince andrew rode up to tushin 
 well till we meet again he said holding out his hand to tushin 
 my dear fellow said tushin dear soul my dear fellow and for some unknown reason tears suddenly filled his eyes

 fairy tales of hans christian andersen 
 the elf of the rose 
 by hans christian andersen 
 
 in the midst of a garden grew a in full blossom and in 
 the prettiest of all the roses lived an elf he was such a little 
 wee thing that no human eye could see him behind each leaf of the 
 rose he had a sleeping chamber he was as well formed and as beautiful as a little child could be and had wings that reached from his shoulders to his feet oh what sweet fragrance there was in his 
 chambers and how clean and beautiful were the walls for they were 
 the blushing leaves of the rose 
 
 during the whole day he enjoyed himself in the warm sunshine flew 
 from flower to flower and danced on the wings of the flying 
 butterflies then he took it into his head to measure how many steps 
 he would have to go through the roads and that are on 
 the leaf of a what we call the veins on a leaf he took 
 for roads ay and very long roads they were for him for before he 
 had half finished his task the sun went down he had commenced his 
 work too late it became very cold the dew fell and the wind blew 
 so he thought the best thing he could do would be to return home he 
 hurried himself as much as he could but he found the roses all closed 
 up and he could not get in not a single rose stood open the poor 
 little elf was very much frightened he had never before been out at 
 night but had always slumbered secretly behind the warm 
 oh this would certainly be his death at the other end 
 of the garden he knew there was an arbor overgrown with beautiful 
 the blossoms looked like large painted horns and he 
 thought to himself he would go and sleep in one of these till the 
 morning he flew thither but hush two people were in the arbor a 
 handsome young man and a beautiful lady they sat side by side and 
 wished that they might never be obliged to part they loved each other much more than the best child can love its father and mother 
 
 but we must part said the young man your brother does not 
 like our engagement and therefore he sends me so far away on 
 business over mountains and seas farewell my sweet bride for so 
 you are to me 
 
 and then they kissed each other and the girl wept and gave him a 
 rose but before she did so she pressed a kiss upon it so fervently 
 that the flower opened then the little elf flew in and leaned his 
 head on the delicate fragrant walls here he could plainly hear 
 them say farewell farewell and he felt that the rose had been 
 placed on the young breast oh how his heart did beat the 
 little elf could not go to sleep it thumped so loudly the young 
 man took it out as he walked through the dark wood alone and kissed the flower so often and so violently that the little elf was almost crushed he could feel through the leaf how hot the lips of the 
 young man were and the rose had opened as if from the heat of the 
 noonday sun 
 
 there came another man who looked gloomy and wicked he was the wicked brother of the beautiful maiden he drew out a sharp knife and while the other was kissing the rose the wicked man stabbed him to death then he cut off his head and buried it with the body in the 
 soft earth under the 
 
 now he is gone and will soon be forgotten thought the wicked 
 brother he will never come back again he was going on a long 
 journey over mountains and seas it is easy for a man to lose his life 
 in such a journey my sister will suppose he is dead for he cannot 
 come back and she will not dare to question me about him 
 then he scattered the dry leaves over the light earth with his 
 foot and went home through the darkness but he went not alone as he thought the little elf accompanied him he sat in a dry 
 which had fallen from the tree on to the wicked 
 head as he was digging the grave the hat was on the head now 
 which made it very dark and the little elf shuddered with fright 
 and indignation at the wicked deed 
 
 it was the dawn of morning before the wicked man reached home 
 he took off his hat and went into his room there lay the 
 beautiful blooming girl dreaming of him whom she loved so and who was now she supposed travelling far away over mountain and sea 
 
 her wicked brother stopped over her and laughed hideously as 
 fiends only can laugh the dry leaf fell out of his hair upon the 
 counterpane but he did not notice it and went to get a little 
 sleep during the early morning hours but the elf slipped out of the 
 withered leaf placed himself by the ear of the sleeping girl and 
 told her as in a dream of the horrid murder described the place 
 where her brother had slain her lover and buried his body and told 
 her of the in full blossom that stood close by 
 
 that you may not think this is only a dream that i have told 
 you he said you will find on your bed a withered leaf 
 
 then she awoke and found it there oh what bitter tears she 
 shed and she could not open her heart to any one for relief 
 
 the window stood open the whole day and the little elf could 
 easily have reached the roses or any of the flowers but he could not 
 find it in his heart to leave one so afflicted in the window stood 
 a bush bearing monthly roses he seated himself in one of the flowers and gazed on the poor girl her brother often came into the room and would be quite cheerful in spite of his base conduct so she dare not say a word to him of her grief 
 
 as soon as night came on she slipped out of the house and went 
 into the wood to the spot where the stood and after 
 removing the leaves from the earth she turned it up and there 
 found him who had been murdered oh how she wept and prayed that she also might die gladly would she have taken the body home with her but that was impossible so she took up the poor head with the closed eyes kissed the cold lips and shook the mould out of the 
 beautiful hair 
 
 i will keep this said she and as soon as she had covered the 
 body again with the earth and leaves she took the head and a little 
 sprig of jasmine that bloomed in the wood near the spot where he 
 was buried and carried them home with her as soon as she was in 
 her room she took the largest she could find and in 
 this she placed the head of the dead man covered it up with earth 
 and planted the twig of jasmine in it 
 
 farewell farewell whispered the little elf he could not any 
 longer endure to witness all this agony of grief he therefore flew 
 away to his own rose in the garden but the rose was faded only a few dry leaves still clung to the green hedge behind it 
 
 alas how soon all that is good and beautiful passes away 
 sighed the elf 
 
 after a while he found another rose which became his home for 
 among its delicate fragrant leaves he could dwell in safety every 
 morning he flew to the window of the poor girl and always found her 
 weeping by the flower pot the bitter tears fell upon the jasmine 
 twig and each day as she became paler and paler the sprig 
 appeared to grow greener and fresher one shoot after another sprouted forth and little white buds blossomed which the poor girl fondly kissed but her wicked brother scolded her and asked her if she was going mad he could not imagine why she was weeping over that and it annoyed him he did not know whose closed eyes were there nor what red lips were fading beneath the earth and one day she sat and leaned her head against the and the little elf of the rose found her asleep then he seated himself by her ear talked to her of that evening in the arbor of the sweet perfume of 
 the rose and the loves of the elves sweetly she dreamed and while 
 she dreamt her life passed away calmly and gently and her spirit was 
 with him whom she loved in heaven and the jasmine opened its large 
 white bells and spread forth its sweet fragrance it had no other way 
 of showing its grief for the dead but the wicked brother considered 
 the beautiful blooming plant as his own property left to him by his 
 sister and he placed it in his sleeping room close by his bed for 
 it was very lovely in appearance and the fragrance sweet and 
 delightful the little elf of the rose followed it and flew from 
 flower to flower telling each little spirit that dwelt in them the 
 story of the murdered young man whose head now formed part of the earth beneath them and of the wicked brother and the poor sister we know it said each little spirit in the flowers we know it for 
 have we not sprung from the eyes and lips of the murdered one we know it we know it and the flowers nodded with their heads in a peculiar manner the elf of the rose could not understand how they could rest so quietly in the matter so he flew to the bees who were gathering honey and told them of the wicked brother and the bees told it to their queen who commanded that the next morning they should go and kill the murderer but during the night the first after the 
 death while the brother was sleeping in his bed close to 
 where he had placed the fragrant jasmine every flower cup opened and invisibly the little spirits stole out armed with poisonous spears 
 
 they placed themselves by the ear of the sleeper told him dreadful 
 dreams and then flew across his lips and pricked his tongue with 
 their poisoned spears now have we revenged the dead said they and flew back into the white bells of the jasmine flowers when the 
 morning came and as soon as the window was opened the rose elf with the queen bee and the whole swarm of bees rushed in to kill him but he was already dead people were standing round the bed and saying that the scent of the jasmine had killed him then the elf of the rose understood the revenge of the flowers and explained it to the queen bee and she with the whole swarm buzzed about the the bees could not be driven away then a man took it up to remove it and one of the bees stung him in the hand so that he let the fall and it was broken to pieces then every one saw the whitened skull and they knew the dead man in the bed was a murderer and the queen bee hummed in the air and sang of the revenge of the flowers and of the elf of the rose and said that behind the smallest leaf dwells one who can discover evil deeds and punish them also

 fairy tales of hans christian andersen 
 the elf of the rose 
 by hans christian andersen 
 
 in the midst of a garden grew a in full blossom and in 
 the prettiest of all the roses lived an elf he was such a little 
 wee thing that no human eye could see him behind each leaf of the 
 rose he had a sleeping chamber he was as well formed and as beautiful as a little child could be and had wings that reached from his shoulders to his feet oh what sweet fragrance there was in his 
 chambers and how clean and beautiful were the walls for they were 
 the blushing leaves of the rose 
 
 during the whole day he enjoyed himself in the warm sunshine flew 
 from flower to flower and danced on the wings of the flying 
 butterflies then he took it into his head to measure how many steps 
 he would have to go through the roads and that are on 
 the leaf of a what we call the veins on a leaf he took 
 for roads ay and very long roads they were for him for before he 
 had half finished his task the sun went down he had commenced his 
 work too late it became very cold the dew fell and the wind blew 
 so he thought the best thing he could do would be to return home he 
 hurried himself as much as he could but he found the roses all closed 
 up and he could not get in not a single rose stood open the poor 
 little elf was very much frightened he had never before been out at 
 night but had always slumbered secretly behind the warm 
 oh this would certainly be his death at the other end 
 of the garden he knew there was an arbor overgrown with beautiful 
 the blossoms looked like large painted horns and he 
 thought to himself he would go and sleep in one of these till the 
 morning he flew thither but hush two people were in the arbor a 
 handsome young man and a beautiful lady they sat side by side and 
 wished that they might never be obliged to part they loved each other much more than the best child can love its father and mother 
 
 but we must part said the young man your brother does not 
 like our engagement and therefore he sends me so far away on 
 business over mountains and seas farewell my sweet bride for so 
 you are to me 
 
 and then they kissed each other and the girl wept and gave him a 
 rose but before she did so she pressed a kiss upon it so fervently 
 that the flower opened then the little elf flew in and leaned his 
 head on the delicate fragrant walls here he could plainly hear 
 them say farewell farewell and he felt that the rose had been 
 placed on the young breast oh how his heart did beat the 
 little elf could not go to sleep it thumped so loudly the young 
 man took it out as he walked through the dark wood alone and kissed the flower so often and so violently that the little elf was almost crushed he could feel through the leaf how hot the lips of the 
 young man were and the rose had opened as if from the heat of the 
 noonday sun 
 
 there came another man who looked gloomy and wicked he was the wicked brother of the beautiful maiden he drew out a sharp knife and while the other was kissing the rose the wicked man stabbed him to death then he cut off his head and buried it with the body in the 
 soft earth under the

 of suitors 
 many ill matters and projects are undertaken and private suits do putrefy the public 
 good many good matters are undertaken with bad minds i mean not only corrupt minds but crafty minds that intend not performance some embrace suits which never mean to deal effectually in them but if they see there may be life in the matter by some other mean they will be content to win a thank or take a second reward or at least to make use in the mean time of the hopes 
 some take hold of suits only for an occasion to cross some other or to make an information whereof they could not otherwise have apt pretext without care what become of the suit when that turn is served or generally to make other business a kind of entertainment to bring in their own nay some undertake suits with a full purpose to let them fall to the end to gratify the adverse party or competitor 
 surely there is in some sort a right in every suit either a right of equity if it be a suit of controversy or a right of desert if it be a suit of petition if affection lead a man to favour the wrong side in justice let him rather use his countenance to compound the matter than to carry it if affection lead a man to favour the less worthy in desert let him do it without depraving or disabling the better deserver in suits which a man doth not well understand it is good to refer them to some friend of trust and judgement that may report whethe he may deal in them with honour but let him choose well his referendaries for else he may be led by the nose 
 suitors are so distasted with delays and abuses that plain dealing in denying to deal in suits at first and reporting the success barely and in challenging no more thanks than one hath deserved is grown not only honourable but also gracious in suits of favour the first coming ought to take little place so far forth consideration may be had of his trust that if intelligence of the matter could not otherwise have been had but by him advantage be not taken of the note but the party left to his other means and in some sort recompensed for his discovery to be ignorant of the value of a suit is simplicity as well as to be ignorant of the right thereof is want of conscience 
 secrecy in suits is a great mean of obtaining for voicing them to be in forwardness may discourage some kind of suitors but doth quicken and awake others but timing of the suit is the principal timing i say not only in respect of the person that should grant it but in respect of those which are like to cross it let a man in the choice of his mean rather choose the fittest mean man the greatest mean and rather them that deal in certain things than those that are general the reparation of a denial is sometimes equal to the first grant if a man show himself neither dejected nor discontented imqwsmpetas utaeqwmferas is a good rule where a man haul strength of favour but otherwise a man were better rise in his suit for he that would have ventured at first to have lost the suitor will not in the conclusion lose both the suitor and his own former favour nothing is thought so basic a request to a great person as his letter and yet if it be not in a good cause it is so much out of his reputation there are no worse instruments than these general contrivers of suits for they are but a kind of poison and infection to public proceedings

 the wind had fallen and black clouds merging with the powder smoke hung low over the field of battle on the horizon it was growing dark and the glow of two conflagrations was the more conspicuous the cannonade was dying down but the rattle of musketry behind and on the right sounded oftener and nearer as soon as tushin with his guns continually driving round or coming upon wounded men was out of range of fire and had descended into the dip he was met by some of the staff among them the staff officer and zherkov who had been twice sent to battery but had never reached it interrupting one another they all gave and transmitted orders as to how to proceed reprimanding and reproaching him tushin gave no orders and silently fearing to speak because at every word he felt ready to weep without knowing why rode behind on his artillery nag though the orders were to abandon the wounded many of them dragged themselves after troops and begged for seats on the gun carriages the jaunty infantry officer who just before the battle had rushed out of wattle shed was laid with a bullet in his stomach on carriage at the foot of the hill a pale hussar cadet supporting one hand with the other came up to tushin and asked for a seat 
 captain for sake hurt my arm he said timidly for sake i walk for sake 
 it was plain that this cadet had already repeatedly asked for a lift and been refused he asked in a hesitating piteous voice 
 tell them to give me a seat for sake 
 give him a seat said tushin lay a cloak for him to sit on lad he said addressing his favorite soldier and where is the wounded officer 
 he has been set down he died replied someone 
 help him up sit down dear fellow sit down spread out the cloak antonov 
 the cadet was rostov with one hand he supported the other he was pale and his jaw trembled shivering feverishly he was placed on matvevna the gun from which they had removed the dead officer the cloak they spread under him was wet with blood which stained his breeches and arm 
 what are you wounded my lad said tushin approaching the gun on which rostov sat 
 no a sprain 
 then what is this blood on the gun carriage inquired tushin 
 it was the officer your honor stained it answered the artilleryman wiping away the blood with his coat sleeve as if apologizing for the state of his gun 
 it was all that they could do to get the guns up the rise aided by the infantry and having reached the village of gruntersdorf they halted it had grown so dark that one could not distinguish the uniforms ten paces off and the firing had begun to subside suddenly near by on the right shouting and firing were again heard flashes of shot gleamed in the darkness this was the last french attack and was met by soldiers who had sheltered in the village houses they all rushed out of the village again but guns could not move and the artillerymen tushin and the cadet exchanged silent glances as they awaited their fate the firing died down and soldiers talking eagerly streamed out of a side street 
 not hurt petrov asked one 
 given it em hot mate they make another push now said another 
 you see a thing how they shot at their own fellows nothing could be seen brother there something to drink 
 the french had been repulsed for the last time and again and again in the complete darkness guns moved forward surrounded by the humming infantry as by a frame 
 in the darkness it seemed as though a gloomy unseen river was flowing always in one direction humming with whispers and talk and the sound of hoofs and wheels amid the general rumble the groans and voices of the wounded were more distinctly heard than any other sound in the darkness of the night the gloom that enveloped the army was filled with their groans which seemed to melt into one with the darkness of the night after a while the moving mass became agitated someone rode past on a white horse followed by his suite and said something in passing what did he say where to now halt is it did he thank us came eager questions from all sides the whole moving mass began pressing closer together and a report spread that they were ordered to halt evidently those in front had halted all remained where they were in the middle of the muddy road 
 fires were lighted and the talk became more audible captain tushin having given orders to his company sent a soldier to find a dressing station or a doctor for the cadet and sat down by a bonfire the soldiers had kindled on the road rostov too dragged himself to the fire from pain cold and damp a feverish shivering shook his whole body drowsiness was irresistibly mastering him but he kept awake kept awake by an excruciating pain in his arm for which he could find no satisfactory position he kept closing his eyes and then again looking at the fire which seemed to him dazzlingly red and at the feeble figure of tushin who was sitting like a turk beside him large kind intelligent eyes were fixed with sympathy and commiseration on rostov who saw that tushin with his whole heart wished to help him but could not 
 from all sides were heard the footsteps and talk of the infantry who were walking driving past and settling down all around the sound of voices the tramping feet the horses hoofs moving in mud the crackling of wood fires near and afar merged into one tremulous rumble 
 it was no longer as before a dark unseen river flowing through the gloom but a dark sea swelling and gradually subsiding after a storm rostov looked at and listened listlessly to what passed before and around him an infantryman came to the fire squatted on his heels held his hands to the blaze and turned away his face 
 you mind your honor he asked tushin lost my company your honor i know where such bad luck 
 with the soldier an infantry officer with a bandaged cheek came up to the bonfire and addressing tushin asked him to have the guns moved a trifle to let a wagon go past after he had gone two soldiers rushed to the campfire they were quarreling and fighting desperately each trying to snatch from the other a boot they were both holding on to 
 you picked it up i dare say very smart one of them shouted hoarsely 
 then a thin pale soldier his neck bandaged with a bloodstained leg band came up and in angry tones asked the artillerymen for water 
 must one die like a dog said he 
 tushin told them to give the man some water then a cheerful soldier ran up begging a little fire for the infantry 
 a nice little hot torch for the infantry good luck to you fellow countrymen thanks for the fire return it with interest said he carrying away into the darkness a glowing stick 
 next came four soldiers carrying something heavy on a cloak and passed by the fire one of them stumbled 
 who the devil has put the logs on the road snarled he 
 dead why carry him said another 
 shut up 
 and they disappeared into the darkness with with their load 
 still aching tushin asked rostov in a whisper 
 yes 
 your honor wanted by the general he is in the hut here said a gunner coming up to tushin 
 coming friend 
 tushin rose and buttoning his greatcoat and pulling it straight walked away from the fire 
 not far from the artillery campfire in a hut that had been prepared for him prince bagration sat at dinner talking with some commanding officers who had gathered at his quarters the little old man with the eyes was there greedily gnawing a mutton bone and the general who had served blamelessly for years flushed by a glass of vodka and the dinner and the staff officer with the signet ring and zherkov uneasily glancing at them all and prince andrew pale with compressed lips and feverishly glittering eyes 
 in a corner of the hut stood a standard captured from the french and the accountant with the naive face was feeling its texture shaking his head in perplexity perhaps because the banner really interested him perhaps because it was hard for him hungry as he was to look on at a dinner where there was no place for him in the next hut there was a french colonel who had been taken prisoner by our dragoons our officers were flocking in to look at him prince bagration was thanking the individual commanders and inquiring into details of the action and our losses the general whose regiment had been inspected at braunau was informing the prince that as soon as the action began he had withdrawn from the wood mustered the men who were woodcutting and allowing the french to pass him had made a bayonet charge with two battalions and had broken up the french troops 
 when i saw your excellency that their first battalion was disorganized i stopped in the road and thought let them come on and will meet them with the fire of the whole battalion and what i did 
 the general had so wished to do this and was so sorry he had not managed to do it that it seemed to him as if it had really happened perhaps it might really have been so could one possibly make out amid all that confusion what did or did not happen 
 by the way your excellency i should inform you he continued remembering conversation with kutuzov and his last interview with the that private dolokhov who was reduced to the ranks took a french officer prisoner in my presence and particularly distinguished himself 
 i saw the pavlograd hussars attack there your excellency chimed in zherkov looking uneasily around he had not seen the hussars all that day but had heard about them from an infantry officer they broke up two squares your excellency 
 several of those present smiled at words expecting one of his usual jokes but noticing that what he was saying redounded to the glory of our arms and of the work they assumed a serious expression though many of them knew that what he was saying was a lie devoid of any foundation prince bagration turned to the old colonel 
 gentlemen i thank you all all arms have behaved heroically infantry cavalry and artillery how was it that two guns were abandoned in the center he inquired searching with his eyes for someone prince bagration did not ask about the guns on the left flank he knew that all the guns there had been abandoned at the very beginning of the action i think i sent you he added turning to the staff officer on duty 
 one was damaged answered the staff officer and the other i understand i was there all the time giving orders and had only just left it is true that it was hot there he added modestly 
 someone mentioned that captain tushin was bivouacking close to the village and had already been sent for 
 oh but you were there said prince bagration addressing prince andrew 
 of course we only just missed one another said the staff officer with a smile to bolkonski 
 i had not the pleasure of seeing you said prince andrew coldly and abruptly 
 all were silent tushin appeared at the threshold and made his way timidly from behind the backs of the generals as he stepped past the generals in the crowded hut feeling embarrassed as he always was by the sight of his superiors he did not notice the staff of the banner and stumbled over it several of those present laughed 
 how was it a gun was abandoned asked bagration frowning not so much at the captain as at those who were laughing among whom zherkov laughed loudest 
 only now when he was confronted by the stern authorities did his guilt and the disgrace of having lost two guns and yet remaining alive present themselves to tushin in all their horror he had been so excited that he had not thought about it until that moment the officers laughter confused him still more he stood before bagration with his lower jaw trembling and was hardly able to mutter i know your excellency i had no men your excellency 
 you might have taken some from the covering troops 
 tushin did not say that there were no covering troops though that was perfectly true he was afraid of getting some other officer into trouble and silently fixed his eyes on bagration as a schoolboy who has blundered looks at an examiner 
 the silence lasted some time prince bagration apparently not wishing to be severe found nothing to say the others did not venture to intervene prince andrew looked at tushin from under his brows and his fingers twitched nervously 
 your excellency prince andrew broke the silence with his abrupt voice you were pleased to send me to captain battery i went there and found two thirds of the men and horses knocked out two guns smashed and no supports at all 
 prince bagration and tushin looked with equal intentness at bolkonski who spoke with suppressed agitation 
 and if your excellency will allow me to express my opinion he continued we owe success chiefly to the action of that battery and the heroic endurance of captain tushin and his company and without awaiting a reply prince andrew rose and left the table 
 prince bagration looked at tushin evidently reluctant to show distrust in emphatic opinion yet not feeling able fully to credit it bent his head and told tushin that he could go prince andrew went out with him 
 thank you you saved me my dear fellow said tushin 
 prince andrew gave him a look but said nothing and went away he felt sad and depressed it was all so strange so unlike what he had hoped 
 who are they why are they here what do they want and when will all this end thought rostov looking at the changing shadows before him the pain in his arm became more and more intense irresistible drowsiness overpowered him red rings danced before his eyes and the impression of those voices and faces and a sense of loneliness merged with the physical pain it was they these soldiers wounded and unwounded it was they who were crushing weighing down and twisting the sinews and scorching the flesh of his sprained arm and shoulder to rid himself of them he closed his eyes 
 for a moment he dozed but in that short interval innumerable things appeared to him in a dream his mother and her large white hand thin little shoulders eyes and laughter denisov with his voice and mustache and telyanin and all that affair with telyanin and bogdanich that affair was the same thing as this soldier with the harsh voice and it was that affair and this soldier that were so agonizingly incessantly pulling and pressing his arm and always dragging it in one direction he tried to get away from them but they would not for an instant let his shoulder move a breadth it would not ache it would be well if only they did not pull it but it was immpossible to get rid of them 
 he opened his eyes and looked up the black canopy of night hung less than a yard above the glow of the charcoal flakes of falling snow were fluttering in that light tushin had not returned the doctor had not come he was alone now except for a soldier who was sitting naked at the other side of the fire warming his thin yellow body 
 nobody wants me thought rostov there is no one to help me or pity me yet i was once at home strong happy and loved he sighed and doing so groaned involuntarily 
 eh is anything hurting you asked the soldier shaking his shirt out over the fire and not waiting for an answer he gave a grunt and added what a lot of men have been crippled today frightful 
 rostov did not listen to the soldier he looked at the snowflakes fluttering above the fire and remembered a russian winter at his warm bright home his fluffy fur coat his quickly gliding sleigh his healthy body and all the affection and care of his family and why did i come here he wondered 
 next day the french army did not renew their attack and the remnant of detachment was reunited to army

 fairy tales of hans christian andersen 
 the elfin hill 
 by hans christian andersen 
 
 a few large lizards were running nimbly about in the clefts of 
 an old tree they could understand one another very well for they 
 spoke the lizard language 
 
 what a buzzing and a rumbling there is in the elfin hill said 
 one of the lizards i have not been able to close my eyes for two 
 nights on account of the noise i might just as well have had the 
 toothache for that always keeps me awake 
 
 there is something going on within there said the other lizard 
 
 they propped up the top of the hill with four red posts till 
 this morning so that it is thoroughly aired and the 
 elfin girls have learnt new dances there is something 
 
 i spoke about it to an of my acquaintance said a 
 third lizard the had just come from the elfin hill where 
 he has been groping about in the earth day and night he has heard a 
 great deal although he cannot see poor miserable creature yet he 
 understands very well how to wriggle and lurk about they expect 
 friends in the elfin hill grand company too but who they are the 
 would not say or perhaps he really did not know all the are ordered to be there to hold a torch dance as it is called the silver and gold which is plentiful in the hill will 
 be polished and placed out in the moonlight 
 
 who can the strangers be asked the lizards what can the 
 matter be hark what a buzzing and humming there is 
 
 just at this moment the elfin hill opened and an old elfin 
 maiden hollow behind came tripping out she was the old elf 
 housekeeper and a distant relative of the family therefore she 
 wore an amber heart on the middle of her forehead her feet moved very fast trip trip good gracious how she could trip right down to the sea to the 
 
 you are invited to the elf hill for this evening said she but 
 will you do me a great favor and undertake the invitations you 
 ought to do something for you have no housekeeping to attend to as 
 i have we are going to have some very grand people conjurors who 
 have always something to say and therefore the old elf king wishes to 
 make a great display 
 
 who is to be invited asked the raven 
 
 all the world may come to the great ball even human beings if 
 they can only talk in their sleep or do something after our 
 fashion but for the feast the company must be carefully selected 
 we can only admit persons of high rank i have had a dispute myself 
 with the elf king as he thought we could not admit ghosts the merman and his daughter must be invited first although it may not be 
 agreeable to them to remain so long on dry land but they shall have a 
 wet stone to sit on or perhaps something better so i think they will 
 not refuse this time we must have all the old demons of the first 
 class with tails and the hobgoblins and imps and then i think we 
 ought not to leave out the or the or even 
 the church dwarf although they do belong to the clergy and are not 
 reckoned among our people but that is merely their office they are 
 nearly related to us and visit us very frequently 
 
 croak said the as he flew away with the invitations 
 
 the elfin maidens already dancing on the elf hill and 
 they danced in shawls woven from moonshine and mist which look very pretty to those who like such things the large hall within the elf 
 hill was splendidly decorated the floor had been washed with 
 moonshine and the walls had been rubbed with magic ointment so 
 that they glowed like in the light in the kitchen were 
 frogs roasting on the spit and dishes preparing of snail skins 
 with fingers in them salad of mushroom seed hemlock 
 noses and marrow of mice beer from the marsh brewery and sparkling wine from the grave cellars these were all 
 substantial food rusty nails and glass formed the 
 dessert the old elf king had his gold crown polished up with powdered it was like that used by the first form and very 
 difficult for an elf king to obtain in the bedrooms curtains were 
 hung up and fastened with the slime of snails there was indeed a 
 buzzing and humming everywhere 
 
 now we must fumigate the place with burnt and 
 bristles and then i think i shall have done my part said the elf 
 
 
 father dear said the youngest daughter may i now hear who 
 our visitors are 
 
 well i suppose i must tell you now he replied two of my 
 daughters must prepare themselves to be married for the marriages 
 certainly will take place the old goblin from norway who lives in 
 the ancient dovre mountains and who possesses many castles built of rock and freestone besides a gold mine which is better than all 
 so it is thought is coming with his two sons who are both seeking 
 a wife the old goblin is a honest old norwegian 
 graybeard cheerful and straightforward i knew him formerly when 
 we used to drink together to our good fellowship he came here once to fetch his wife she is dead now she was the daughter of the king of the at moen they say he took his wife from chalk i shall be delighted to see him again it is said that the boys are 
 forward lads but perhaps that is not quite correct and 
 they will become better as they grow older let me see that you know 
 how to teach them good manners 
 
 and when are they coming asked the daughter 
 
 that depends upon wind and weather said the elf king they 
 travel economically they will come when there is the chance of a 
 ship i wanted them to come over to sweden but the old man was not inclined to take my advice he does not go forward with the times and that i do not like 
 
 two came jumping in one quicker than the other 
 so of course one arrived first they are coming they are coming 
 he cried 
 
 give me my crown said the elf king and let me stand in the 
 moonshine 
 
 the daughters drew on their shawls and bowed down to the ground 
 there stood the old goblin from the dovre mountains with his crown of hardened ice and polished besides this he wore a 
 and great warm boots while his sons went with their 
 throats bare and wore no braces for they were strong men 
 
 is that a hill said the youngest of the boys pointing to the 
 elf hill we should call it a hole in norway 
 
 boys said the old man a hole goes in and a hill stands 
 out have you no eyes in your heads 
 
 another thing they wondered at was that they were able without 
 trouble to understand the language 
 
 take care said the old man or people will think you have 
 not been well brought up 
 
 then they entered the elfin hill where the select and grand 
 company were assembled and so quickly had they appeared that they 
 seemed to have been blown together but for each guest the neatest and pleasantest arrangement had been made the sea folks sat at table in great and they said it was just like being at home all 
 behaved themselves properly excepting the two young northern goblins they put their legs on the table and thought they were all right 
 feet off the said the old goblin they obeyed 
 but not immediately then they tickled the ladies who waited at table 
 with the which they carried in their pockets they took off 
 their boots that they might be more at ease and gave them to the 
 ladies to hold but their father the old goblin was very 
 different he talked pleasantly about the stately norwegian rocks and 
 told fine tales of the waterfalls which dashed over them with a 
 clattering noise like thunder or the sound of an organ spreading 
 their white foam on every side he told of the salmon that leaps in 
 the rushing waters while the plays on his golden harp he 
 spoke of the bright winter nights when the sledge bells are 
 ringing and the boys run with burning torches across the smooth 
 ice which is so transparent that they can see the fishes dart forward 
 beneath their feet he described everything so clearly that those who 
 listened could see it all they could see the going the 
 and the maidens singing songs and dancing a rattling 
 dance when all at once the old goblin gave the old elfin maiden a 
 kiss such a tremendous kiss and yet they were almost strangers to 
 each other 
 
 then the elfin girls had to dance first in the usual way and 
 then with stamping feet which they performed very well then followed the artistic and solo dance dear me how they did throw their legs about no one could tell where the dance begun or where it ended nor indeed which were legs and which were arms for they were all flying about together like the shavings in a and then they spun round so quickly that the and the became sick and giddy and were obliged to leave the table 
 
 stop cried the old goblin is that the only they 
 can perform can they do anything more than dance and throw about 
 their legs and make a whirlwind 
 
 you shall soon see what they can do said the elf king and then 
 he called his youngest daughter to him she was slender and fair as 
 moonlight and the most graceful of all the sisters she took a 
 white chip in her mouth and vanished instantly this was her 
 accomplishment but the old goblin said he should not like his wife to 
 have such an accomplishment and thought his boys would have the 
 same objection another daughter could make a figure like herself 
 follow her as if she had a shadow which none of the goblin folk ever 
 had the third was of quite a different sort she had learnt in the 
 of the moor witch how to lard elfin puddings with 
 
 
 she will make a good housewife said the old goblin and then 
 saluted her with his eyes instead of drinking her health for he did 
 not drink much 
 
 now came the fourth daughter with a large harp to play upon 
 and when she struck the first chord every one lifted up the left 
 leg for the goblins are and at the second chord they 
 found they must all do just what she wanted 
 
 that is a dangerous woman said the old goblin and the two sons 
 walked out of the hill they had had enough of it and what can the 
 next daughter do asked the old goblin 
 
 i have learnt everything that is norwegian said she and i 
 will never marry unless i can go to norway 
 
 then her youngest sister whispered to the old goblin that is 
 only because she has heard in a norwegian song that when the world shall decay the cliffs of norway will remain standing like monuments and she wants to get there that she may be safe for she is so afraid of sinking 
 
 ho ho said the old goblin is that what she means well what 
 can the seventh and last do 
 
 the sixth comes before the seventh said the elf king for he 
 could reckon but the sixth would not come forward 
 
 i can only tell people the truth said she no one cares for 
 me nor troubles himself about me and i have enough to do to sew my grave clothes 
 
 so the seventh and last came and what could she do why she 
 could tell stories as many as you liked on any subject 
 
 here are my five fingers said the old goblin now tell me a 
 story for each of them 
 
 so she took him by the wrist and he laughed till he nearly 
 choked and when she came to the fourth finger there was a gold 
 ring on it as if it knew there was to be a betrothal then the old 
 goblin said hold fast what you have this hand is yours for i 
 will have you for a wife myself 
 
 then the elfin girl said that the stories about the 
 and little peter playman had not yet been told 
 
 we will hear them in the winter said the old goblin and 
 also about the fir and the and the ghost stories and 
 of the tingling frost you shall tell your tales for no one over 
 there can do it so well and we will sit in the stone rooms where the 
 pine logs are burning and drink mead out of the golden of the old norwegian kings the has given me two and when we sit there nix comes to pay us a visit and will sing you all the songs of the mountain shepherdesses how merry we shall be 
 the salmon will be leaping in the waterfalls and dashing against the stone walls but he will not be able to come in it is indeed very pleasant to live in old norway but where are the lads 
 
 where indeed were they why running about the fields and blowing 
 out the who so came and brought 
 their torches 
 
 what tricks have you been playing said the old goblin i 
 have taken a mother for you and now you may take one of your aunts 
 
 but the youngsters said they would rather make a speech and 
 drink to their good fellowship they had no wish to marry then they 
 made speeches and drank toasts and tipped their glasses to show that they were empty then they took off their coats and lay down on the table to sleep for they made themselves quite at home but the old goblin danced about the room with his young bride and exchanged boots with her which is more fashionable than exchanging rings 
 
 the cock is crowing said the old elfin maiden who acted as 
 housekeeper now we must close the shutters that the sun may not 
 scorch us 
 
 then the hill closed up but the lizards continued to run up and 
 down the riven tree and one said to the other oh how much i was 
 pleased with the old goblin 
 
 the boys pleased me better said the but then the 
 poor miserable creature could not see

 fairy tales of hans christian andersen 
 the elfin hill 
 by hans christian andersen 
 
 a few large lizards were running nimbly about in the clefts of 
 an old tree they could understand one another very well for they 
 spoke the lizard language 
 
 what a buzzing and a rumbling there is in the elfin hill said 
 one of the lizards i have not been able to close my eyes for two 
 nights on account of the noise i might just as well have had the 
 toothache for that always keeps me awake 
 
 there is something going on within there said the other lizard 
 
 they propped up the top of the hill with four red posts till 
 this morning so that it is thoroughly aired and the 
 elfin girls have learnt new dances there is something 
 
 i spoke about it to an of my acquaintance said a 
 third lizard the had just come from the elfin hill where 
 he has been groping about in the earth day and night he has heard a 
 great deal although he cannot see poor miserable creature yet he 
 understands very well how to wriggle and lurk about they expect 
 friends in the elfin hill grand company too but who they are the 
 would not say or perhaps he really did not know all the are ordered to be there to hold a torch dance as it is called the silver and gold which is plentiful in the hill will 
 be polished and placed out in the moonlight 
 
 who can the strangers be asked the lizards what can the 
 matter be hark what a buzzing and humming there is 
 
 just at this moment the elfin hill opened and an old elfin 
 maiden hollow behind came tripping out she was the old elf 
 housekeeper and a distant relative of the family therefore she 
 wore an amber heart on the middle of her forehead her feet moved very fast trip trip good gracious how she could trip right down to the sea to the 
 
 you are invited to the elf hill for this evening said she but 
 will you do me a great favor and undertake the invitations you 
 ought to do something for you have no housekeeping to attend to as 
 i have we are going to have some very grand people conjurors who 
 have always something to say and therefore the old elf king wishes to 
 make a great display 
 
 who is to be invited asked the raven 
 
 all the world may come to the great ball even human beings if 
 they can only talk in their sleep or do something after our 
 fashion but for the feast the company must be carefully selected 
 we can only admit persons of high rank i have had a dispute myself 
 with the elf king as he thought we could not admit ghosts the merman and his daughter must be invited first although it may not be 
 agreeable to them to remain so long on dry land but they shall have a 
 wet stone to sit on or perhaps something better so i think they will 
 not refuse this time we must have all the old demons of the first 
 class with tails and the hobgoblins and imps and then i think we 
 ought not to leave out the or the or even 
 the church dwarf although they do belong to the clergy and are not 
 reckoned among our people but that is merely their office they are 
 nearly related to us and visit us very frequently 
 
 croak said the as he flew away with the invitations 
 
 the elfin maidens already dancing on the elf hill and 
 they danced in shawls woven from moonshine and mist which look very pretty to those who like such things the large hall within the elf 
 hill was splendidly decorated the floor had been washed with 
 moonshine and the walls had been rubbed with magic ointment so 
 that they glowed like in the light in the kitchen were 
 frogs roasting on the spit and dishes preparing of snail skins 
 with fingers in them salad of mushroom seed hemlock 
 noses and marrow of mice beer from the marsh brewery and sparkling wine from the grave cellars these were all 
 substantial food rusty nails and glass formed the 
 dessert the old elf king had his gold crown polished up with powdered it was like that used by the first form and very 
 difficult for an elf king to obtain in the bedrooms curtains were 
 hung up and fastened with the slime of snails there was indeed a 
 buzzing and humming everywhere 
 
 now we must fumigate the place with burnt and 
 bristles and then i think i shall have done my part said the elf 
 
 
 father dear said the youngest daughter may i now hear who 
 our visitors are 
 
 well i suppose i must tell you now he replied two of my 
 daughters must prepare themselves to be married for the marriages 
 certainly will take place the old goblin from norway who lives in 
 the ancient dovre mountains and who possesses many castles built of rock and freestone besides a gold mine which is better than all 
 so it is thought is coming with his two sons who are both seeking 
 a wife the old goblin is a honest old norwegian 
 graybeard cheerful and straightforward i knew him formerly when 
 we used to drink together to our good fellowship he came here once to fetch his wife she is dead now she was the daughter of the king of the at moen they say he took his wife from chalk i shall be delighted to see him again it is said that the boys are 
 forward lads but perhaps that is not quite correct and 
 they will become better as they grow older let me see that you know 
 how to teach them good manners 
 
 and when are they coming asked the daughter 
 
 that depends upon wind and weather said the elf king they 
 travel economically they will come when there is the chance of a 
 ship i wanted them to come over to sweden but the old man was not inclined to take my advice he does not go forward with the times and that i do not like 
 
 two came jumping in one quicker than the other 
 so of course one arrived first they are coming they are coming 
 he cried 
 
 give me my crown said the elf king and let me stand in the 
 moonshine 
 
 the daughters drew on their shawls and bowed down to the ground 
 there stood the old goblin from the dovre mountains with his crown of hardened ice and polished besides this he wore a 
 and great warm boots while his sons went with their 
 throats bare and wore no braces for they were strong men 
 
 is that a hill said the youngest of the boys pointing to the 
 elf hill we should call it a hole in norway 
 
 boys said the old man a hole goes in and a hill stands 
 out have you no eyes in your heads 
 
 another thing they wondered at was that they were able without 
 trouble to understand the language 
 
 take care said the old man or people will think you have 
 not been well brought up 
 
 then they entered the elfin hill where the select and grand 
 company were assembled and so quickly had they appeared that they 
 seemed to have been blown together but for each guest the neatest and pleasantest arrangement had been made the sea folks sat at table in great and they said it was just like being at home all 
 behaved themselves properly excepting the two young northern goblins they put their legs on the table and thought they were all right

the space shuttle challenger tragedy address 
 ronald reagan 
 delivered january 
 ladies and gentlemen planned to speak to you tonight to report on the state of the union but the events of earlier today have led me to change those plans today is a day for mourning and remembering nancy and i are pained to the core by the tragedy of the shuttle challenger we know we share this pain with all of the people of our country this is truly a national loss 
 nineteen years ago almost to the day we lost three astronauts in a terrible accident on the ground but never lost an astronaut in flight never had a tragedy like this and perhaps forgotten the courage it took for the crew of the shuttle but they the challenger seven were aware of the dangers but overcame them and did their jobs brilliantly we mourn seven heroes michael smith dick scobee judith resnik ronald mcnair ellison onizuka gregory jarvis and christa mcauliffe we mourn their loss as a nation together 
 for the families of the seven we cannot bear as you do the full impact of this tragedy but we feel the loss and thinking about you so very much your loved ones were daring and brave and they had that special grace that special spirit that says give me a challenge and meet it with joy they had a hunger to explore the universe and discover its truths they wished to serve and they did they served all of us 
 grown used to wonders in this century hard to dazzle us but for years the united states space program has been doing just that grown used to the idea of space and perhaps we forget that only just begun still pioneers they the members of the challenger crew were pioneers 
 and i want to say something to the schoolchildren of america who were watching the live coverage of the i know hard to understand but sometimes painful things like this happen all part of the process of exploration and discovery all part of taking a chance and expanding horizons the future belong to the fainthearted it belongs to the brave the challenger crew was pulling us into the future and continue to follow them 
 always had great faith in and respect for our space program and what happened today does nothing to diminish it we hide our space program we keep secrets and cover things up we do it all up front and in public the way freedom is and we change it for a minute 
 continue our quest in space there will be more shuttle flights and more shuttle crews and yes more volunteers more civilians more teachers in space nothing ends here our hopes and our journeys continue 
 i want to add that i wish i could talk to every man and woman who works for nasa or who worked on this mission and tell them your dedication and professionalism have moved and impressed us for decades and we know of your anguish we share it 
 a coincidence today on this day three hundred and ninety years ago the great explorer sir francis drake died aboard ship off the coast of panama in his lifetime the great frontiers were the oceans and a historian later said he lived by the sea died on it and was buried in it well today we can say of the challenger crew their dedication was like complete 
 the crew of the space shuttle challenger honored us by the manner in which they lived their lives we will never forget them nor the last time we saw them this morning as they prepared for their journey and waved goodbye and slipped the surly bonds of earth to touch the face of god 
 thank you 
 address to the greater houston ministerial association 
 john f kennedy 
 delivered september at the rice hotel in houston tx 
 reverend meza reverend reck grateful for your generous invitation to state my views 
 while the religious issue is necessarily and properly the chief topic here tonight i want to emphasize from the outset that i believe that we have far more critical issues in the campaign the spread of communist influence until it now festers only miles from the coast of florida the humiliating treatment of our president and vice president by those who no longer respect our power the hungry children i saw in west virginia the old people who cannot pay their doctors bills the families forced to give up their farms an america with too many slums with too few schools and too late to the moon and outer space these are the real issues which should decide this campaign and they are not religious issues for war and hunger and ignorance and despair know no religious barrier 
 but because i am a catholic and no catholic has ever been elected president the real issues in this campaign have been obscured perhaps deliberately in some quarters less responsible than this so it is apparently necessary for me to state once again not what kind of church i believe in for that should be important only to me but what kind of america i believe in 
 i believe in an america where the separation of church and state is absolute where no catholic prelate would tell the president should he be catholic how to act and no protestant minister would tell his parishioners for whom to vote where no church or church school is granted any public funds or political preference and where no man is denied public office merely because his religion differs from the president who might appoint him or the people who might elect him 
 i believe in an america that is officially neither catholic protestant nor jewish where no public official either requests or accept instructions on public policy from the pope the national council of churches or any other ecclesiastical source where no religious body seeks to impose its will directly or indirectly upon the general populace or the public acts of its officials and where religious liberty is so indivisible that an act against one church is treated as an act against all 
 for while this year it may be a catholic against whom the finger of suspicion is pointed in other years it has been and may someday be again a jew or a quaker or a unitarian or a baptist it was harassment of baptist preachers for example that led to statute of religious freedom today i may be the victim but tomorrow it may be you until the whole fabric of our harmonious society is ripped apart at a time of great national peril 
 finally i believe in an america where religious intolerance will someday end where all men and all churches are treated as equals where every man has the same right to attend or not to attend the church of his choice where there is no catholic vote no vote no bloc voting of any kind and where catholics protestants and jews at both the lay and the pastoral levels will refrain from those attitudes of disdain and division which have so often marred their works in the past and promote instead the american ideal of brotherhood 
 that is the kind of america in which i believe and it represents the kind of presidency in which i believe a great office that must be neither humbled by making it the instrument of any religious group nor tarnished by arbitrarily withholding its occupancy from the members of any one religious group i believe in a president whose views on religion are his own private affair neither imposed upon him by the nation nor imposed by the nation upon him sic as a condition to holding that office 
 i would not look with favor upon a president working to subvert the first guarantees of religious liberty nor would our system of checks and balances permit him to do so and neither do i look with favor upon those who would work to subvert article vi of the constitution by requiring a religious test even by indirection for if they disagree with that safeguard they should be out openly working to repeal it 
 i want a chief executive whose public acts are responsible to all and obligated to none who can attend any ceremony service or dinner his office may appropriately require of him to fulfill and whose fulfillment of his presidential office is not limited or conditioned by any religious oath ritual or obligation 
 this is the kind of america i believe in and this is the kind of america i fought for in the south pacific and the kind my brother died for in europe no one suggested then that we might have a divided loyalty that we did not believe in liberty or that we belonged to a disloyal group that threatened the freedoms for which our forefathers died 
 and in fact this is the kind of america for which our forefathers did when they fled here to escape religious test oaths that denied office to members of less favored churches when they fought for the constitution the bill of rights the virginia statute of religious freedom and when they fought at the shrine i visited today the alamo for side by side with bowie and crockett died fuentes and mccafferty and bailey and badillo and carey but no one knows whether they were catholics or not for there was no religious test there 
 i ask you tonight to follow in that tradition to judge me on the basis of years in the congress on my declared stands against an ambassador to the vatican against unconstitutional aid to parochial schools and against any boycott of the public schools which i attended myself and instead of doing this do not judge me on the basis of these pamphlets and publications we all have seen that carefully select quotations out of context from the statements of catholic church leaders usually in other countries frequently in other centuries and rarely relevant to any situation here and always omitting of course the statement of the american bishops in which strongly endorsed separation and which more nearly reflects the views of almost every american catholic 
 i do not consider these other quotations binding upon my public acts why should you 
 but let me say with respect to other countries that i am wholly opposed to the state being used by any religious group catholic or protestant to compel prohibit or prosecute the free exercise of any other religion and that goes for any persecution at any time by anyone in any country and i hope that you and i condemn with equal fervor those nations which deny their presidency to protestants and those which deny it to catholics and rather than cite the misdeeds of those who differ i would also cite the record of the catholic church in such nations as france and ireland and the independence of such statesmen as de gaulle and adenauer 
 but let me stress again that these are my views 
 for contrary to common newspaper usage i am not the catholic candidate for president 
 i am the democratic candidate for president who happens also to be a catholic 
 i do not speak for my church on public matters and the church does not speak for me whatever issue may come before me as president if i should be elected on birth control divorce censorship gambling or any other subject i will make my decision in accordance with these views in accordance with what my conscience tells me to be in the national interest and without regard to outside religious pressure or dictates and no power or threat of punishment could cause me to decide otherwise 
 but if the time should ever come and i do not concede any conflict to be remotely possible when my office would require me to either violate my conscience or violate the national interest then i would resign the office and i hope any conscientious public servant would do likewise 
 but i do not intend to apologize for these views to my critics of either catholic or protestant faith nor do i intend to disavow either my views or my church in order to win this election 
 if i should lose on the real issues i shall return to my seat in the senate satisfied that tried my best and was fairly judged 
 but if this election is decided on the basis that million americans lost their chance of being president on the day they were baptized then it is the whole nation that will be the loser in the eyes of catholics and around the world in the eyes of history and in the eyes of our own people 
 but if on the other hand i should win this election then i shall devote every effort of mind and spirit to fulfilling the oath of the presidency practically identical i might add with the oath i have taken for years in the congress for without reservation i can solemnly swear that i will faithfully execute the office of president of the united states and will to the best of my ability preserve protect and defend the constitution so help me god 
 
 an redundancy antimetabole kennedy probably meant to say neither imposed by him upon the nation nor imposed by the nation upon him 
 
 we shall overcome 
 lyndon baines johnson 
 delivered march 
 mr speaker mr president members of the congress 
 i speak tonight for the dignity of man and the destiny of democracy i urge every member of both parties americans of all religions and of all colors from every section of this country to join me in that cause 
 at times history and fate meet at a single time in a single place to shape a turning point in unending search for freedom so it was at lexington and concord so it was a century ago at appomattox so it was last week in selma alabama there men and women peacefully protested the denial of their rights as americans many were brutally assaulted one good man a man of god was killed 
 there is no cause for pride in what has happened in selma there is no cause for in the long denial of equal rights of millions of americans but there is cause for hope and for faith in our democracy in what is happening here tonight for the cries of pain and the hymns and protests of oppressed people have summoned into convocation all the majesty of this great government the government of the greatest nation on earth our mission is at once the oldest and the most basic of this country to right wrong to do justice to serve man 
 in our time we have come to live with the moments of great crisis our lives have been marked with debate about great issues issues of war and peace issues of prosperity and depression but rarely in any time does an issue lay bare the secret heart of america itself rarely are we met with a challenge not to our growth or abundance or our welfare or our security but rather to the values and the purposes and the meaning of our beloved nation 
 the issue of equal rights for american negroes is such an issue 
 and should we defeat every enemy and should we double our wealth and conquer the stars and still be unequal to this issue then we will have failed as a people and as a nation for with a country as with a person what is a man profited if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul 
 there is no negro problem there is no southern problem there is no northern problem there is only an american problem and we are met here tonight as americans not as democrats or republicans we are met here as americans to solve that problem 
 this was the first nation in the history of the world to be founded with a purpose the great phrases of that purpose still sound in every american heart north and south all men are created equal government by consent of the governed give me liberty or give me death well those are not just clever words or those are not just empty theories in their name americans have fought and died for two centuries and tonight around the world they stand there as guardians of our liberty risking their lives 
 those words are a promise to every citizen that he shall share in the dignity of man this dignity cannot be found in a possessions it cannot be found in his power or in his position it really rests on his right to be treated as a man equal in opportunity to all others it says that he shall share in freedom he shall choose his leaders educate his children provide for his family according to his ability and his merits as a human being to apply any other test to deny a man his hopes because of his color or race or his religion or the place of his birth is not only to do injustice it is to deny america and to dishonor the dead who gave their lives for american freedom 
 our fathers believed that if this noble view of the rights of man was to flourish it must be rooted in democracy the most basic right of all was the right to choose your own leaders the history of this country in large measure is the history of the expansion of that right to all of our people many of the issues of civil rights are very complex and most difficult but about this there can and should be no argument 
 every american citizen must have an equal right to vote 
 there is no reason which can excuse the denial of that right there is no duty which weighs more heavily on us than the duty we have to ensure that right 
 yet the harsh fact is that in many places in this country men and women are kept from voting simply because they are negroes every device of which human ingenuity is capable has been used to deny this right the negro citizen may go to register only to be told that the day is wrong or the hour is late or the official in charge is absent and if he persists and if he manages to present himself to the registrar he may be disqualified because he did not spell out his middle name or because he abbreviated a word on the application and if he manages to fill out an application he is given a test the registrar is the sole judge of whether he passes this test he may be asked to recite the entire constitution or explain the most complex provisions of state law and even a college degree cannot be used to prove that he can read and write 
 for the fact is that the only way to pass these barriers is to show a white skin experience has clearly shown that the existing process of law cannot overcome systematic and ingenious discrimination no law that we now have on the books and i have helped to put three of them there can ensure the right to vote when local officials are determined to deny it in such a case our duty must be clear to all of us the constitution says that no person shall be kept from voting because of his race or his color we have all sworn an oath before god to support and to defend that constitution we must now act in obedience to that oath 
 wednesday i will send to congress a law designed to eliminate illegal barriers to the right to vote 
 the broad principles of that bill will be in the hands of the democratic and republican leaders tomorrow after they have reviewed it it will come here formally as a bill i am grateful for this opportunity to come here tonight at the invitation of the leadership to reason with my friends to give them my views and to visit with my former colleagues had prepared a more comprehensive analysis of the legislation which i had intended to transmit to the clerk tomorrow but which i will submit to the clerks tonight but i want to really discuss with you now briefly the main proposals of this legislation 
 this bill will strike down restrictions to voting in all elections federal state and local which have been used to deny negroes the right to vote this bill will establish a simple uniform standard which cannot be used however ingenious the effort to flout our constitution it will provide for citizens to be registered by officials of the united states government if the state officials refuse to register them it will eliminate tedious unnecessary lawsuits which delay the right to vote finally this legislation will ensure that properly registered individuals are not prohibited from voting 
 i will welcome the suggestions from all of the members of congress i have no doubt that i will get some on ways and means to strengthen this law and to make it effective but experience has plainly shown that this is the only path to carry out the command of the constitution 
 to those who seek to avoid action by their national government in their own communities who want to and who seek to maintain purely local control over elections the answer is simple open your polling places to all your people 
 allow men and women to register and vote whatever the color of their skin 
 extend the rights of citizenship to every citizen of this land 
 there is no constitutional issue here the command of the constitution is plain there is no moral issue it is wrong deadly wrong to deny any of your fellow americans the right to vote in this country there is no issue of states rights or national rights there is only the struggle for human rights i have not the slightest doubt what will be your answer 
 but the last time a president sent a civil rights bill to the congress it contained a provision to protect voting rights in federal elections that civil rights bill was passed after eight long months of debate and when that bill came to my desk from the congress for my signature the heart of the voting provision had been eliminated this time on this issue there must be no delay or no hesitation or no compromise with our purpose 
 we cannot we must not refuse to protect the right of every american to vote in every election that he may desire to participate in and we ought not and we cannot and we must not wait another eight months before we get a bill we have already waited a hundred years and more and the time for waiting is gone 
 so i ask you to join me in working long hours nights and weekends if necessary to pass this bill and i make that request lightly for from the window where i sit with the problems of our country i recognize that from outside this chamber is the outraged conscience of a nation the grave concern of many nations and the harsh judgment of history on our acts 
 but even if we pass this bill the battle will not be over what happened in selma is part of a far larger movement which reaches into every section and state of america it is the effort of american negroes to secure for themselves the full blessings of american life their cause must be our cause too because not just negroes but really all of us who must overcome the crippling legacy of bigotry and injustice 
 and we shall overcome 
 as a man whose roots go deeply into southern soil i know how agonizing racial feelings are i know how difficult it is to reshape the attitudes and the structure of our society but a century has passed more than a hundred years since the negro was freed and he is not fully free tonight 
 it was more than a hundred years ago that abraham lincoln a great president of another party signed the emancipation proclamation but emancipation is a proclamation and not a fact a century has passed more than a hundred years since equality was promised and yet the negro is not equal a century has passed since the day of promise and the promise is 
 the time of justice has now come i tell you that i believe sincerely that no force can hold it back it is right in the eyes of man and god that it should come and when it does i think that day will brighten the lives of every american for negroes are not the only victims how many white children have gone uneducated how many white families have lived in stark poverty how many white lives have been scarred by fear because wasted our energy and our substance to maintain the barriers of hatred and terror 
 and so i say to all of you here and to all in the nation tonight that those who appeal to you to hold on to the past do so at the cost of denying you your future 
 this great rich restless country can offer opportunity and education and hope to all all black and white all north and south sharecropper and city dweller these are the enemies poverty ignorance disease our enemies not our fellow man not our neighbor and these enemies too poverty disease and ignorance we shall overcome 
 now let none of us in any section look with prideful righteousness on the troubles in another section or the problems of our neighbors really no part of america where the promise of equality has been fully kept in buffalo as well as in birmingham in philadelphia as well as selma americans are struggling for the fruits of freedom this is one nation what happens in selma or in cincinnati is a matter of legitimate concern to every american but let each of us look within our own hearts and our own communities and let each of us put our shoulder to the wheel to root out injustice wherever it exists 
 as we meet here in this peaceful historic chamber tonight men from the south some of whom were at iwo jima men from the north who have carried old glory to far corners of the world and brought it back without a stain on it men from the east and from the west are all fighting together without regard to religion or color or region in vietnam men from every region fought for us across the world twenty years ago 
 and now in these common dangers and these common sacrifices the south made its contribution of honor and gallantry no less than any other region in the great republic and in some instances a great many of them more 
 and i have not the slightest doubt that good men from everywhere in this country from the great lakes to the gulf of mexico from the golden gate to the harbors along the atlantic will rally now together in this cause to vindicate the freedom of all americans 
 for all of us owe this duty and i believe that all of us will respond to it your president makes that request of every american 
 the real hero of this struggle is the american negro his actions and protests his courage to risk safety and even to risk his life have awakened the conscience of this nation his demonstrations have been designed to call attention to injustice designed to provoke change designed to stir reform he has called upon us to make good the promise of america and who among us can say that we would have made the same progress were it not for his persistent bravery and his faith in american democracy 
 for at the real heart of battle for equality is a deep seated belief in the democratic process equality depends not on the force of arms or tear gas but depends upon the force of moral right not on recourse to violence but on respect for law and order 
 and there have been many pressures upon your president and there will be others as the days come and go but i pledge you tonight that we intend to fight this battle where it should be fought in the courts and in the congress and in the hearts of men 
 we must preserve the right of free speech and the right of free assembly but the right of free speech does not carry with it as has been said the right to holler fire in a crowded theater we must preserve the right to free assembly but free assembly does not carry with it the right to block public thoroughfares to traffic 
 we do have a right to protest and a right to march under conditions that do not infringe the constitutional rights of our neighbors and i intend to protect all those rights as long as i am permitted to serve in this office 
 we will guard against violence knowing it strikes from our hands the very weapons which we seek progress obedience to law and belief in american values 
 in selma as elsewhere we seek and pray for peace we seek order we seek unity but we will not accept the peace of stifled rights or the order imposed by fear or the unity that stifles protest for peace cannot be purchased at the cost of liberty 
 in selma tonight and we had a good day there as in every city we are working for a just and peaceful settlement and we must all remember that after this speech i am making tonight after the police and the fbi and the marshals have all gone and after you have promptly passed this bill the people of selma and the other cities of the nation must still live and work together and when the attention of the nation has gone elsewhere they must try to heal the wounds and to build a new community 
 this cannot be easily done on a battleground of violence as the history of the south itself shows it is in recognition of this that men of both races have shown such an outstandingly impressive responsibility in recent days last tuesday again today 
 the bill that i am presenting to you will be known as a civil rights bill but in a larger sense most of the program i am recommending is a civil rights program its object is to open the city of hope to all people of all races 
 because all americans just must have the right to vote and we are going to give them that right all americans must have the privileges of citizenship regardless of race and they are going to have those privileges of citizenship regardless of race 
 but i would like to caution you and remind you that to exercise these privileges takes much more than just legal right it requires a trained mind and a healthy body it requires a decent home and the chance to find a job and the opportunity to escape from the clutches of poverty 
 of course people cannot contribute to the nation if they are never taught to read or write if their bodies are stunted from hunger if their sickness goes untended if their life is spent in hopeless poverty just drawing a welfare check so we want to open the gates to opportunity but also going to give all our people black and white the help that they need to walk through those gates 
 my first job after college was as a teacher in cotulla texas in a small school few of them could speak english and i speak much spanish my students were poor and they often came to class without breakfast hungry and they knew even in their youth the pain of prejudice they never seemed to know why people disliked them but they knew it was so because i saw it in their eyes i often walked home late in the afternoon after the classes were finished wishing there was more that i could do but all i knew was to teach them the little that i knew hoping that it might help them against the hardships that lay ahead 
 and somehow you never forget what poverty and hatred can do when you see its scars on the hopeful face of a young child i never thought then in that i would be standing here in it never even occurred to me in my fondest dreams that i might have the chance to help the sons and daughters of those students and to help people like them all over this country 
 but now i do have that chance and let you in on a secret i mean to use it 
 and i hope that you will use it with me 
 this is the richest and the most powerful country which ever occupied this globe the might of past empires is little compared to ours but i do not want to be the president who built empires or sought grandeur or extended dominion 
 i want to be the president who educated young children to the wonders of their world 
 i want to be the president who helped to feed the hungry and to prepare them to be instead of 
 i want to be the president who helped the poor to find their own way and who protected the right of every citizen to vote in every election 
 i want to be the president who helped to end hatred among his fellow men and who promoted love among the people of all races and all regions and all parties 
 i want to be the president who helped to end war among the brothers of this earth 
 and so at the request of your beloved speaker and the senator from montana the majority leader the senator from illinois the minority leader mr mcculloch and other members of both parties i came here tonight not as president roosevelt came down one time in person to veto a bonus bill not as president truman came down one time to urge the passage of a railroad bill but i came down here to ask you to share this task with me and to share it with the people that we both work for i want this to be the congress republicans and democrats alike which did all these things for all these people 
 beyond this great chamber out yonder in fifty states are the people that we serve who can tell what deep and unspoken hopes are in their hearts tonight as they sit there and listen we all can guess from our own lives how difficult they often find their own pursuit of happiness how many problems each little family has they look most of all to themselves for their futures but i think that they also look to each of us 
 above the pyramid on the great seal of the united states it says in latin god has favored our undertaking god will not favor everything that we do it is rather our duty to divine his will 
 but i cannot help believing that he truly understands and that he really favors the undertaking that we begin here tonight 
 
 
 a tale of two cities 
 mario cuomo 
 delivered july to at democratic national convention san francisco 
 on behalf of the empire state and the family of new york i thank you for the great privilege of being able to address this convention please allow me to skip the stories and the poetry and the temptation to deal in nice but vague rhetoric let me instead use this valuable opportunity to deal immediately with questions that should determine this election and that we all know are vital to the american people 
 ten days ago president reagan admitted that although some people in this country seemed to be doing well nowadays others were unhappy even worried about themselves their families and their futures the president said that he understand that fear he said why this country is a shining city on a hill and the president is right in many ways we are a shining city on a hill 
 but the hard truth is that not everyone is sharing in this splendor and glory a shining city is perhaps all the president sees from the portico of the white house and the veranda of his ranch where everyone seems to be doing well but another city another part to the shining the city the part where some people pay their mortgages and most young people afford one where students afford the education they need and parents watch the dreams they hold for their children evaporate 
 in this part of the city there are more poor than ever more families in trouble more and more people who need help but find it even worse there are elderly people who tremble in the basements of the houses there and there are people who sleep in the city streets in the gutter where the glitter show there are ghettos where thousands of young people without a job or an education give their lives away to drug dealers every day there is despair mr president in the faces that you see in the places that you visit in your shining city 
 in fact mr president this is a nation mr president you ought to know that this nation is more a tale of two cities than it is just a shining city on a hill 
 maybe maybe mr president if you visited some more places maybe if you went to appalachia where some people still live in sheds maybe if you went to lackawanna where thousands of unemployed steel workers wonder why we subsidized foreign steel maybe maybe mr president if you stopped in at a shelter in chicago and spoke to the homeless there maybe mr president if you asked a woman who had been denied the help she needed to feed her children because you said you needed the money for a tax break for a millionaire or for a missile we afford to use 
 maybe maybe mr president but afraid not 
 because the truth is ladies and gentlemen that this is how we were warned it would be president reagan told us from very the beginning that he believed in a kind of social darwinism survival of the fittest government do everything we were told so it should settle for taking care of the strong and hope that economic ambition and charity will do the rest make the rich richer and what falls from their table will be enough for the middle class and those who are trying desperately to work their way into the middle class 
 you know the republicans called it when hoover tried it now they call it supply side but the same shining city for those relative few who are lucky enough to live in its good neighborhoods but for the people who are excluded for the people who are locked out all they can do is to stare from a distance at that glimmering towers 
 an old story as old as our history the difference between democrats and republicans has always been measured in courage and confidence the republicans believe that the wagon train will not make it to the frontier unless some of the old some of the young some of the weak are left behind by the side of the trail the strong the strong they tell us will inherit the land 
 we democrats believe in something else we democrats believe that we can make it all the way with the whole family intact and we have more than once ever since franklin roosevelt lifted himself from his wheelchair to lift this nation from its knees wagon train after wagon train to new frontiers of education housing peace the whole family aboard constantly reaching out to extend and enlarge that family lifting them up into the wagon on the way blacks and hispanics and people of every ethnic group and native americans all those struggling to build their families and claim some small share of america 
 for nearly years we carried them all to new levels of comfort and security and dignity even affluence and remember this some of us in this room today are here only because this nation had that kind of confidence and it would be wrong to forget that 
 so here we are at this convention to remind ourselves where we come from and to claim the future for ourselves and for our children today our great democratic party which has saved this nation from depression from fascism from racism from corruption is called upon to do it again this time to save the nation from confusion and division from the threat of eventual fiscal disaster and most of all from the fear of a nuclear holocaust 
 not going to be easy mo udall is exactly right not going to be easy in order to succeed we must answer our polished and appealing rhetoric with a more telling reasonableness and rationality 
 we must win this case on the merits we must get the american public to look past the glitter beyond the showmanship to reality to the hard substance of things and we will do that not so much with speeches that sound good as with speeches that are good and sound not so much with speeches that will bring people to their feet as with speeches that bring people to their senses we must make the american people hear our tale of two cities we must convince them that we have to settle for two cities that we can have one city indivisible shining for all of its people 
 now we will have no chance to do that if what comes out of this convention is a babel of arguing voices if heard throughout the campaign dissident voices from all sides we will have no chance to tell our message to succeed we will have to surrender small parts of our individual interests to build a platform we can all stand on at once comfortably proudly singing out the truth for the nation to hear in chorus its logic so clear and commanding that no slick commercial no amount of geniality no martial music will be able to muffle the sound of the truth we democrats must unite 
 we democrats must unite so that the entire nation can unite because surely the republicans bring this country together their policies divide the nation into the lucky and the into the royalty and the rabble the republicans are willing to treat that division as victory they would cut this nation in half into those temporarily better off and those worse off than before and they would call that division recovery 
 we should not we should not be embarrassed or dismayed or chagrined if the process of unifying is difficult even wrenching at times remember that unlike any other party we embrace men and women of every color every creed every orientation every economic class in our family are gathered everyone from the abject poor of essex county in new york to the enlightened affluent of the gold coasts at both ends of the nation and in between is the heart of our constituency the middle class the people not rich enough to be but not poor enough to be on welfare the middle class those people who work for a living because they have to not because some psychiatrist told them it was a convenient way to fill the interval between birth and eternity white collar and blue collar young professionals men and women in small business desperate for the capital and contracts that they need to prove their worth 
 we speak for the minorities who have not yet entered the mainstream we speak for ethnics who want to add their culture to the magnificent mosaic that is america we speak we speak for women who are indignant that this nation refuses to etch into its governmental commandments the simple rule thou shalt not sin against equality a rule so simple i was going to say and i perhaps dare not but i will a commandment so simple it can be spelled in three letters 
 we speak for young people demanding an education and a future we speak for senior citizens who are terrorized by the idea that their only security their social security is being threatened we speak for millions of reasoning people fighting to preserve our environment from greed and from stupidity and we speak for reasonable people who are fighting to preserve our very existence from a macho intransigence that refuses to make intelligent attempts to discuss the possibility of nuclear holocaust with our enemy they refuse they refuse because they believe we can pile missiles so high that they will pierce the clouds and the sight of them will frighten our enemies into submission 
 now proud of this diversity as democrats grateful for it we have to manufacture it the way the republicans will next month in dallas by propping up mannequin delegates on the convention floor but while proud of this diversity as democrats we pay a price for it the different people that we represent have different points of view and sometimes they compete and even debate and even argue what our primaries were all about but now the primaries are over and it is time when we pick our candidates and our platform here to lock arms and move into this campaign together if you need any more inspiration to put some small part of your own differences aside to create this consensus all you need to do is to reflect on what the republican policy of divide and cajole has done to this land since 
 now the president has asked us to judge him on whether or not fulfilled the promise he made four years ago i believe that as democrats we ought to accept that challenge and just for a moment let us consider what he has said and what done inflation is down since but not because of the supply side miracle promised to us by the president inflation was reduced the way with a recession the worst since we could have brought inflation down that way how did he do it thousand bankruptcies two years of massive unemployment two hundred thousand farmers and ranchers forced off the land more homeless than at any time since the great depression in more hungry in this nation of enormous affluence the united states of america more hungry more poor most of them women and he paid one more thing a nearly billion deficit threatening our future 
 now we must make the american people understand this deficit because they the deficit is a direct and dramatic repudiation of his promise to balance our budget by how large is it the deficit is the largest in the history of this universe president last budget had a deficit of less than of this deficit it is a deficit that according to the own fiscal adviser may grow as high as billion a year for as far as the eye can see 
 and ladies and gentlemen it is a debt so large that as much as of our revenue from the income tax goes just to pay the interest it is a mortgage on our future that can be paid only in pain and that could bring this nation to its knees 
 now take my word for it a democrat 
 ask the republican investment bankers on wall street what they think the chances of this recovery being permanent are you see if not too embarrassed to tell you the truth say that they are appalled and frightened by the deficit ask them what they think of our economy now that it has been driven by the distorted value of the dollar back to its colonial condition now exporting agricultural products and importing manufactured ones ask those republican investment bankers what they expect the rate of interest to be a year from now and ask them if they dare tell you the truth you will hear from them what they predict for the inflation rate a year from now because of the deficit 
 now how important is this question of the deficit 
 think about it practically what chance would the republican candidate have had in if he had told the american people that he intended to pay for his economic recovery with bankruptcies unemployment more homeless more hungry and the largest government debt known to humankind would american voters have signed the loan certificate for him on election day of course not that was an election won under false pretenses it was won with smoke and mirrors and illusions and the kind of recovery we have now as well 
 and what about foreign policy they said that they would make us and the whole world safer they say they have by creating the largest defense budget in history one that even they now admit is excessive by escalating to a frenzy the nuclear arms race by incendiary rhetoric by refusing to discuss peace with our enemies by the loss of young americans in lebanon in pursuit of a plan and a policy that no one can find or describe 
 we give money to latin american governments that murder nuns and then we lie about it we have been less than zealous in support of our only real friend it seems to me we have in the middle east the one democracy there our flesh and blood ally the state of israel our foreign policy drifts with no real direction other than an hysterical commitment to an arms race that leads nowhere if lucky and if not it could lead us into bankruptcy or war 
 of course we must have a strong defense 
 of course democrats are for a strong defense of course democrats believe that there are times when we must stand and fight and we have thousands of us have paid for freedom with our lives but always when this country has been at its best our purposes were clear now not now our allies are as confused as our enemies now we have no real commitment to our friends or to our ideals not to human rights not to the refuseniks not to sakharov not to bishop tutu and the others struggling for freedom in south africa 
 we have in the last few years spent more than we can afford we have pounded our chests and made bold speeches but we lost young americans in lebanon and we live behind sand bags in washington how can anyone say that we are stronger safer or better 
 that is the republican record 
 that its disastrous quality is not more fully understood by the american people i can only attribute to the amiability and the failure by some to separate the salesman from the product 
 and now up to us now now up to you and me to make the case to america and to remind americans that if they are not happy with all the president has done so far they should consider how much worse it will be if he is left to his radical proclivities for another four years unrestrained unrestrained 
 if july brings back ann gorsuch burford what can we expect of december where would another four years take us where would four years more take us how much larger will the deficit be how much deeper the cuts in programs for the struggling middle class and the poor to limit that deficit how high will the interest rates be how much more acid rain killing our forests and fouling our lakes and ladies and gentlemen the nation must think of this what kind of supreme court will we have we must ask ourselves what kind of court and country will be fashioned by the man who believes in having government mandate religion and morality 
 the man who believes that trees pollute the environment the man that believes that the laws against discrimination against people go too far the man who threatens social security and medicaid and help for the disabled how high will we pile the missiles how much deeper will the gulf be between us and our enemies and ladies and gentlemen will four years more make meaner the spirit of the american people 
 this election will measure the record of the past four years but more than that it will answer the question of what kind of people we want to be 
 we democrats still have a dream we still believe in this future and this is our answer to the question this is our credo 
 we believe in only the government we need but we insist on all the government we need we believe in a government that is characterized by fairness and reasonableness a reasonableness that goes beyond labels that distort or promise things that we know we believe in a government strong enough to use the words love and compassion and smart enough to convert our noblest aspirations into practical realities we believe in encouraging the talented but we believe that while survival of the fittest may be a good working description of the process of evolution a government of humans should elevate itself to a higher order 
 our government should be able to rise to the level to where it can fill the gaps left by chance or a wisdom we fully understand we would rather have laws written by the patron of this great city the man called the most sincere democrat st francis of assisi than laws written by darwin 
 we believe we believe as democrats that a society as blessed as ours the most affluent democracy in the history one that can spend trillions on instruments of destruction ought to be able to help the middle class in its struggle ought to be able to find work for all who can do it room at the table shelter for the homeless care for the elderly and infirm and hope for the destitute and we proclaim as loudly as we can the utter insanity of nuclear proliferation and the need for a nuclear freeze if only to affirm the simple truth that peace is better than war because life is better than death 
 we believe in firm but fair law and order we believe proudly in the union movement we believe in privacy for people openness by government we believe in civil rights and we believe in human rights we believe in a single fundamental idea that describes better than most textbooks and any speech that i could write what a proper government should be the idea of family mutuality the sharing of benefits and burdens for the good of all feeling one pain sharing one blessings reasonably honestly fairly without respect to race or sex or geography or political affiliation 
 we believe we must be the family of america recognizing that at the heart of the matter we are bound one to another that the problems of a retired school teacher in duluth are our problems that the future of the child in buffalo is our future that the struggle of a disabled man in boston to survive and live decently is our struggle that the hunger of a woman in little rock is our hunger that the failure anywhere to provide what reasonably we might to avoid pain is our failure 
 now for years for years we democrats created a better future for our children using traditional democratic principles as a fixed beacon giving us direction and purpose but constantly innovating adapting to new realities alphabet programs nato and the gi bill of rights intelligent tax incentives and the alliance for progress civil rights human rights and the nearly miraculous camp david peace accord 
 democrats did it democrats did it and democrats can do it again we can build a future that deals with our deficit remember this that years of progress under our principles never cost us what the last four years of stagnation have and we can deal with the deficit intelligently by shared sacrifice with all parts of the family contributing building partnerships with the private sector providing a sound defense without depriving ourselves of what we need to feed our children and care for our people 
 we can have a future that provides for all the young of the present by marrying common sense and compassion we know we can because we did it for nearly years before 
 and we can do it again if we do not forget if we do not forget that this entire nation has profited by these progressive principles that they helped lift up generations to the middle class and higher gave us a chance to work to go to college to raise a family to own a house to be secure in our old age and before that to reach heights that our own parents would not have dared dream of 
 that struggle to live with dignity is the real story of the shining city and a story ladies and gentlemen that i read in a book or learn in a classroom i saw it and lived it like many of you i watched a small man with thick calluses on both hands work and hours a day i saw him once literally bleed from the bottoms of his feet a man who came here uneducated alone unable to speak the language who taught me all i needed to know about faith and hard work by the simple eloquence of his example i learned about our kind of democracy from my father and i learned about our obligation to each other from him and from my mother they asked only for a chance to work and to make the world better for their children and they asked to be protected in those moments when they would not be able to protect themselves this nation and this government did that for them 
 and that they were able to build a family and live in dignity and see one of their children go from behind their little grocery store in south jamaica on the other side of the tracks where he was born to occupy the highest seat in the greatest state of the greatest nation in the only world we know is an ineffably beautiful tribute to the democratic process 
 and ladies and gentlemen on january it will happen again only on a much much grander scale we will have a new president of the united states a democrat born not to the blood of kings but to the blood of pioneers and immigrants and we will have first woman vice president the child of immigrants and she she she will open with one magnificent stroke a whole new frontier for the united states now it will happen 
 it will happen if we make it happen if you and i can make it happen 
 and i ask you now ladies and gentlemen brothers and sisters for the good of all of us for the love of this great nation for the family of america for the love of god please make this nation remember how futures are built 
 thank you and god bless you 

the space shuttle challenger tragedy address 
 ronald reagan 
 delivered january 
 ladies and gentlemen planned to speak to you tonight to report on the state of the union but the events of earlier today have led me to change those plans today is a day for mourning and remembering nancy and i are pained to the core by the tragedy of the shuttle challenger we know we share this pain with all of the people of our country this is truly a national loss 
 nineteen years ago almost to the day we lost three astronauts in a terrible accident on the ground but never lost an astronaut in flight never had a tragedy like this and perhaps forgotten the courage it took for the crew of the shuttle but they the challenger seven were aware of the dangers but overcame them and did their jobs brilliantly we mourn seven heroes michael smith dick scobee judith resnik ronald mcnair ellison onizuka gregory jarvis and christa mcauliffe we mourn their loss as a nation together 
 for the families of the seven we cannot bear as you do the full impact of this tragedy but we feel the loss and thinking about you so very much your loved ones were daring and brave and they had that special grace that special spirit that says give me a challenge and meet it with joy they had a hunger to explore the universe and discover its truths they wished to serve and they did they served all of us 
 grown used to wonders in this century hard to dazzle us but for years the united states space program has been doing just that grown used to the idea of space and perhaps we forget that only just begun still pioneers they the members of the challenger crew were pioneers 
 and i want to say something to the schoolchildren of america who were watching the live coverage of the i know hard to understand but sometimes painful things like this happen all part of the process of exploration and discovery all part of taking a chance and expanding horizons the future belong to the fainthearted it belongs to the brave the challenger crew was pulling us into the future and continue to follow them 
 always had great faith in and respect for our space program and what happened today does nothing to diminish it we hide our space program we keep secrets and cover things up we do it all up front and in public the way freedom is and we change it for a minute 
 continue our quest in space there will be more shuttle flights and more shuttle crews and yes more volunteers more civilians more teachers in space nothing ends here our hopes and our journeys continue 
 i want to add that i wish i could talk to every man and woman who works for nasa or who worked on this mission and tell them your dedication and professionalism have moved and impressed us for decades and we know of your anguish we share it 
 a coincidence today on this day three hundred and ninety years ago the great explorer sir francis drake died aboard ship off the coast of panama in his lifetime the great frontiers were the oceans and a historian later said he lived by the sea died on it and was buried in it well today we can say of the challenger crew their dedication was like complete 
 the crew of the space shuttle challenger honored us by the manner in which they lived their lives we will never forget them nor the last time we saw them this morning as they prepared for their journey and waved goodbye and slipped the surly bonds of earth to touch the face of god 
 thank you

 delivered september at the rice hotel in houston tx 
 reverend meza reverend reck grateful for your generous invitation to state my views 
 while the religious issue is necessarily and properly the chief topic here tonight i want to emphasize from the outset that i believe that we have far more critical issues in the campaign the spread of communist influence until it now festers only miles from the coast of florida the humiliating treatment of our president and vice president by those who no longer respect our power the hungry children i saw in west virginia the old people who cannot pay their doctors bills the families forced to give up their farms an america with too many slums with too few schools and too late to the moon and outer space these are the real issues which should decide this campaign and they are not religious issues for war and hunger and ignorance and despair know no religious barrier 
 but because i am a catholic and no catholic has ever been elected president the real issues in this campaign have been obscured perhaps deliberately in some quarters less responsible than this so it is apparently necessary for me to state once again not what kind of church i believe in for that should be important only to me but what kind of america i believe in 
 i believe in an america where the separation of church and state is absolute where no catholic prelate would tell the president should he be catholic how to act and no protestant minister would tell his parishioners for whom to vote where no church or church school is granted any public funds or political preference and where no man is denied public office merely because his religion differs from the president who might appoint him or the people who might elect him 
 i believe in an america that is officially neither catholic protestant nor jewish where no public official either requests or accept instructions on public policy from the pope the national council of churches or any other ecclesiastical source where no religious body seeks to impose its will directly or indirectly upon the general populace or the public acts of its officials and where religious liberty is so indivisible that an act against one church is treated as an act against all 
 for while this year it may be a catholic against whom the finger of suspicion is pointed in other years it has been and may someday be again a jew or a quaker or a unitarian or a baptist it was harassment of baptist preachers for example that led to statute of religious freedom today i may be the victim but tomorrow it may be you until the whole fabric of our harmonious society is ripped apart at a time of great national peril 
 finally i believe in an america where religious intolerance will someday end where all men and all churches are treated as equals where every man has the same right to attend or not to attend the church of his choice where there is no catholic vote no vote no bloc voting of any kind and where catholics protestants and jews at both the lay and the pastoral levels will refrain from those attitudes of disdain and division which have so often marred their works in the past and promote instead the american ideal of brotherhood 
 that is the kind of america in which i believe and it represents the kind of presidency in which i believe a great office that must be neither humbled by making it the instrument of any religious group nor tarnished by arbitrarily withholding its occupancy from the members of any one religious group i believe in a president whose views on religion are his own private affair neither imposed upon him by the nation nor imposed by the nation upon him sic as a condition to holding that office 
 i would not look with favor upon a president working to subvert the first guarantees of religious liberty nor would our system of checks and balances permit him to do so and neither do i look with favor upon those who would work to subvert article vi of the constitution by requiring a religious test even by indirection for if they disagree with that safeguard they should be out openly working to repeal it 
 i want a chief executive whose public acts are responsible to all and obligated to none who can attend any ceremony service or dinner his office may appropriately require of him to fulfill and whose fulfillment of his presidential office is not limited or conditioned by any religious oath ritual or obligation 
 this is the kind of america i believe in and this is the kind of america i fought for in the south pacific and the kind my brother died for in europe no one suggested then that we might have a divided loyalty that we did not believe in liberty or that we belonged to a disloyal group that threatened the freedoms for which our forefathers died 
 and in fact this is the kind of america for which our forefathers did when they fled here to escape religious test oaths that denied office to members of less favored churches when they fought for the constitution the bill of rights the virginia statute of religious freedom and when they fought at the shrine i visited today the alamo for side by side with bowie and crockett died fuentes and mccafferty and bailey and badillo and carey but no one knows whether they were catholics or not for there was no religious test there 
 i ask you tonight to follow in that tradition to judge me on the basis of years in the congress on my declared stands against an ambassador to the vatican against unconstitutional aid to parochial schools and against any boycott of the public schools which i attended myself and instead of doing this do not judge me on the basis of these pamphlets and publications we all have seen that carefully select quotations out of context from the statements of catholic church leaders usually in other countries frequently in other centuries and rarely relevant to any situation here and always omitting of course the statement of the american bishops in which strongly endorsed separation and which more nearly reflects the views of almost every american catholic 
 i do not consider these other quotations binding upon my public acts why should you 
 but let me say with respect to other countries that i am wholly opposed to the state being used by any religious group catholic or protestant to compel prohibit or prosecute the free exercise of any other religion and that goes for any persecution at any time by anyone in any country and i hope that you and i condemn with equal fervor those nations which deny their presidency to protestants and those which deny it to catholics and rather than cite the misdeeds of those who differ i would also cite the record of the catholic church in such nations as france and ireland and the independence of such statesmen as de gaulle and adenauer 
 but let me stress again that these are my views 
 for contrary to common newspaper usage i am not the catholic candidate for president 
 i am the democratic candidate for president who happens also to be a catholic 
 i do not speak for my church on public matters and the church does not speak for me whatever issue may come before me as president if i should be elected on birth control divorce censorship gambling or any other subject i will make my decision in accordance with these views in accordance with what my conscience tells me to be in the national interest and without regard to outside religious pressure or dictates and no power or threat of punishment could cause me to decide otherwise 
 but if the time should ever come and i do not concede any conflict to be remotely possible when my office would require me to either violate my conscience or violate the national interest then i would resign the office and i hope any conscientious public servant would do likewise 
 but i do not intend to apologize for these views to my critics of either catholic or protestant faith nor do i intend to disavow either my views or my church in order to win this election 
 if i should lose on the real issues i shall return to my seat in the senate satisfied that tried my best and was fairly judged 
 but if this election is decided on the basis that million americans lost their chance of being president on the day they were baptized then it is the whole nation that will be the loser in the eyes of catholics and around the world in the eyes of history and in the eyes of our own people 
 but if on the other hand i should win this election then i shall devote every effort of mind and spirit to fulfilling the oath of the presidency practically identical i might add with the oath i have taken for years in the congress for without reservation i can solemnly swear that i will faithfully execute the office of president of the united states and will to the best of my ability preserve protect and defend the constitution so help me god 
 
 an redundancy antimetabole kennedy probably meant to say neither imposed by him upon the nation nor imposed by the nation upon him 
 
 we shall overcome 
 lyndon baines johnson 
 delivered march 
 mr speaker mr president members of the congress 
 i speak tonight for the dignity of man and the destiny of democracy i urge every member of both parties americans of all religions and of all colors from every section of this country to join me in that cause 
 at times history and fate meet at a single time in a single place to shape a turning point in unending search for freedom so it was at lexington and concord so it was a century ago at appomattox so it was last week in selma alabama there men and women peacefully protested the denial of their rights as americans many were brutally assaulted one good man a man of god was killed 
 there is no cause for pride in what has happened in selma there is no cause for in the long denial of equal rights of millions of americans but there is cause for hope and for faith in our democracy in what is happening here tonight for the cries of pain and the hymns and protests of oppressed people have summoned into convocation all the majesty of this great government the government of the greatest nation on earth our mission is at once the oldest and the most basic of this country to right wrong to do justice to serve man 
 in our time we have come to live with the moments of great crisis our lives have been marked with debate about great issues issues of war and peace issues of prosperity and depression but rarely in any time does an issue lay bare the secret heart of america itself rarely are we met with a challenge not to our growth or abundance or our welfare or our security but rather to the values and the purposes and the meaning of our beloved nation 
 the issue of equal rights for american negroes is such an issue 
 and should we defeat every enemy and should we double our wealth and conquer the stars and still be unequal to this issue then we will have failed as a people and as a nation for with a country as with a person what is a man profited if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul 
 there is no negro problem there is no southern problem there is no northern problem there is only an american problem and we are met here tonight as americans not as democrats or republicans we are met here as americans to solve that problem 
 this was the first nation in the history of the world to be founded with a purpose the great phrases of that purpose still sound in every american heart north and south all men are created equal government by consent of the governed give me liberty or give me death well those are not just clever words or those are not just empty theories in their name americans have fought and died for two centuries and tonight around the world they stand there as guardians of our liberty risking their lives 
 those words are a promise to every citizen that he shall share in the dignity of man this dignity cannot be found in a possessions it cannot be found in his power or in his position it really rests on his right to be treated as a man equal in opportunity to all others it says that he shall share in freedom he shall choose his leaders educate his children provide for his family according to his ability and his merits as a human being to apply any other test to deny a man his hopes because of his color or race or his religion or the place of his birth is not only to do injustice it is to deny america and to dishonor the dead who gave their lives for american freedom 
 our fathers believed that if this noble view of the rights of man was to flourish it must be rooted in democracy the most basic right of all was the right to choose your own leaders the history of this country in large measure is the history of the expansion of that right to all of our people many of the issues of civil rights are very complex and most difficult but about this there can and should be no argument 
 every american citizen must have an equal right to vote 
 there is no reason which can excuse the denial of that right there is no duty which weighs more heavily on us than the duty we have to ensure that right 
 yet the harsh fact is that in many places in this country men and women are kept from voting simply because they are negroes every device of which human ingenuity is capable has been used to deny this right the negro citizen may go to register only to be told that the day is wrong or the hour is late or the official in charge is absent and if he persists and if he manages to present himself to the registrar he may be disqualified because he did not spell out his middle name or because he abbreviated a word on the application and if he manages to fill out an application he is given a test the registrar is the sole judge of whether he passes this test he may be asked to recite the entire constitution or explain the most complex provisions of state law and even a college degree cannot be used to prove that he can read and write 
 for the fact is that the only way to pass these barriers is to show a white skin experience has clearly shown that the existing process of law cannot overcome systematic and ingenious discrimination no law that we now have on the books and i have helped to put three of them there can ensure the right to vote when local officials are determined to deny it in such a case our duty must be clear to all of us the constitution says that no person shall be kept from voting because of his race or his color we have all sworn an oath before god to support and to defend that constitution we must now act in obedience to that oath 
 wednesday i will send to congress a law designed to eliminate illegal barriers to the right to vote 
 the broad principles of that bill will be in the hands of the democratic and republican leaders tomorrow after they have reviewed it it will come here formally as a bill i am grateful for this opportunity to come here tonight at the invitation of the leadership to reason with my friends to give them my views and to visit with my former colleagues had prepared a more comprehensive analysis of the legislation which i had intended to transmit to the clerk tomorrow but which i will submit to the clerks tonight but i want to really discuss with you now briefly the main proposals of this legislation 
 this bill will strike down restrictions to voting in all elections federal state and local which have been used to deny negroes the right to vote this bill will establish a simple uniform standard which cannot be used however ingenious the effort to flout our constitution it will provide for citizens to be registered by officials of the united states government if the state officials refuse to register them it will eliminate tedious unnecessary lawsuits which delay the right to vote finally this legislation will ensure that properly registered individuals are not prohibited from voting 
 i will welcome the suggestions from all of the members of congress i have no doubt that i will get some on ways and means to strengthen this law and to make it effective but experience has plainly shown that this is the only path to carry out the command of the constitution 
 to those who seek to avoid action by their national government in their own communities who want to and who seek to maintain purely local control over elections the answer is simple open your polling places to all your people 
 allow men and women to register and vote whatever the color of their skin 
 extend the rights of citizenship to every citizen of this land 
 there is no constitutional issue here the command of the constitution is plain there is no moral issue it is wrong deadly wrong to deny any of your fellow americans the right to vote in this country there is no issue of states rights or national rights there is only the struggle for human rights i have not the slightest doubt what will be your answer 
 but the last time a president sent a civil rights bill to the congress it contained a provision to protect voting rights in federal elections that civil rights bill was passed after eight long months of debate and when that bill came to my desk from the congress for my signature the heart of the voting provision had been eliminated this time on this issue there must be no delay or no hesitation or no compromise with our purpose 
 we cannot we must not refuse to protect the right of every american to vote in every election that he may desire to participate in and we ought not and we cannot and we must not wait another eight months before we get a bill we have already waited a hundred years and more and the time for waiting is gone 
 so i ask you to join me in working long hours nights and weekends if necessary to pass this bill and i make that request lightly for from the window where i sit with the problems of our country i recognize that from outside this chamber is the outraged conscience of a nation the grave concern of many nations and the harsh judgment of history on our acts 
 but even if we pass this bill the battle will not be over what happened in selma is part of a far larger movement which reaches into every section and state of america it is the effort of american negroes to secure for themselves the full blessings of american life their cause must be our cause too because not just negroes but really all of us who must overcome the crippling legacy of bigotry and injustice 
 and we shall overcome 
 as a man whose roots go deeply into southern soil i know how agonizing racial feelings are i know how difficult it is to reshape the attitudes and the structure of our society but a century has passed more than a hundred years since the negro was freed and he is not fully free tonight 
 it was more than a hundred years ago that abraham lincoln a great president of another party signed the emancipation proclamation but emancipation is a proclamation and not a fact a century has passed more than a hundred years since equality was promised and yet the negro is not equal a century has passed since the day of promise and the promise is 
 the time of justice has now come i tell you that i believe sincerely that no force can hold it back it is right in the eyes of man and god that it should come and when it does i think that day will brighten the lives of every american for negroes are not the only victims how many white children have gone uneducated how many white families have lived in stark poverty how many white lives have been scarred by fear because wasted our energy and our substance to maintain the barriers of hatred and terror 
 and so i say to all of you here and to all in the nation tonight that those who appeal to you to hold on to the past do so at the cost of denying you your future 
 this great rich restless country can offer opportunity and education and hope to all all black and white all north and south sharecropper and city dweller these are the enemies poverty ignorance disease our enemies not our fellow man not our neighbor and these enemies too poverty disease and ignorance we shall overcome 
 now let none of us in any section look with prideful righteousness on the troubles in another section or the problems of our neighbors really no part of america where the promise of equality has been fully kept in buffalo as well as in birmingham in philadelphia as well as selma americans are struggling for the fruits of freedom this is one nation what happens in selma or in cincinnati is a matter of legitimate concern to every american but let each of us look within our own hearts and our own communities and let each of us put our shoulder to the wheel to root out injustice wherever it exists 
 as we meet here in this peaceful historic chamber tonight men from the south some of whom were at iwo jima men from the north who have carried old glory to far corners of the world and brought it back without a stain on it men from the east and from the west are all fighting together without regard to religion or color or region in vietnam men from every region fought for us across the world twenty years ago 
 and now in these common dangers and these common sacrifices the south made its contribution of honor and gallantry no less than any other region in the great republic and in some instances a great many of them more 
 and i have not the slightest doubt that good men from everywhere in this country from the great lakes to the gulf of mexico from the golden gate to the harbors along the atlantic will rally now together in this cause to vindicate the freedom of all americans 
 for all of us owe this duty and i believe that all of us will respond to it your president makes that request of every american 
 the real hero of this struggle is the american negro his actions and protests his courage to risk safety and even to risk his life have awakened the conscience of this nation his demonstrations have been designed to call attention to injustice designed to provoke change designed to stir reform he has called upon us to make good the promise of america and who among us can say that we would have made the same progress were it not for his persistent bravery and his faith in american democracy 
 for at the real heart of battle for equality is a deep seated belief in the democratic process equality depends not on the force of arms or tear gas but depends upon the force of moral right not on recourse to violence but on respect for law and order 
 and there have been many pressures upon your president and there will be others as the days come and go but i pledge you tonight that we intend to fight this battle where it should be fought in the courts and in the congress and in the hearts of men 
 we must preserve the right of free speech and the right of free assembly but the right of free speech does not carry with it as has been said the right to holler fire in a crowded theater we must preserve the right to free assembly but free assembly does not carry with it the right to block public thoroughfares to traffic 
 we do have a right to protest and a right to march under conditions that do not infringe the constitutional rights of our neighbors and i intend to protect all those rights as long as i am permitted to serve in this office 
 we will guard against violence knowing it strikes from our hands the very weapons which we seek progress obedience to law and belief in american values 
 in selma as elsewhere we seek and pray for peace we seek order we seek unity but we will not accept the peace of stifled rights or the order imposed by fear or the unity that stifles protest for peace cannot be purchased at the cost of liberty 
 in selma tonight and we had a good day there as in every city we are working for a just and peaceful settlement and we must all remember that after this speech i am making tonight after the police and the fbi and the marshals have all gone and after you have promptly passed this bill the people of selma and the other cities of the nation must still live and work together and when the attention of the nation has gone elsewhere they must try to heal the wounds and to build a new community 
 this cannot be easily done on a battleground of violence as the history of the south itself shows it is in recognition of this that men of both races have shown such an outstandingly impressive responsibility in recent days last tuesday again today 
 the bill that i am presenting to you will be known as a civil rights bill but in a larger sense most of the program i am recommending is a civil rights program its object is to open the city of hope to all people of all races 
 because all americans just must have the right to vote and we are going to give them that right all americans must have the privileges of citizenship regardless of race and they are going to have those privileges of citizenship regardless of race 
 but i would like to caution you and remind you that to exercise these privileges takes much more than just legal right it requires a trained mind and a healthy body it requires a decent home and the chance to find a job and the opportunity to escape from the clutches of poverty 
 of course people cannot contribute to the nation if they are never taught to read or write if their bodies are stunted from hunger if their sickness goes untended if their life is spent in hopeless poverty just drawing a welfare check so we want to open the gates to opportunity but also going to give all our people black and white the help that they need to walk through those gates 
 my first job after college was as a teacher in cotulla texas in a small school few of them could speak english and i speak much spanish my students were poor and they often came to class without breakfast hungry and they knew even in their youth the pain of prejudice they never seemed to know why people disliked them but they knew it was so because i saw it in their eyes i often walked home late in the afternoon after the classes were finished wishing there was more that i could do but all i knew was to teach them the little that i knew hoping that it might help them against the hardships that lay ahead 
 and somehow you never forget what poverty and hatred can do when you see its scars on the hopeful face of a young child i never thought then in that i would be standing here in it never even occurred to me in my fondest dreams that i might have the chance to help the sons and daughters of those students and to help people like them all over this country 
 but now i do have that chance and let you in on a secret i mean to use it 
 and i hope that you will use it with me 
 this is the richest and the most powerful country which ever occupied this globe the might of past empires is little compared to ours but i do not want to be the president who built empires or sought grandeur or extended dominion 
 i want to be the president who educated young children to the wonders of their world 
 i want to be the president who helped to feed the hungry and to prepare them to be instead of 
 i want to be the president who helped the poor to find their own way and who protected the right of every citizen to vote in every election 
 i want to be the president who helped to end hatred among his fellow men and who promoted love among the people of all races and all regions and all parties 
 i want to be the president who helped to end war among the brothers of this earth 
 and so at the request of your beloved speaker and the senator from montana the majority leader the senator from illinois the minority leader mr mcculloch and other members of both parties i came here tonight not as president roosevelt came down one time in person to veto a bonus bill not as president truman came down one time to urge the passage of a railroad bill but i came down here to ask you to share this task with me and to share it with the people that we both work for i want this to be the congress republicans and democrats alike which did all these things for all these people 
 beyond this great chamber out yonder in fifty states are the people that we serve who can tell what deep and unspoken hopes are in their hearts tonight as they sit there and listen we all can guess from our own lives how difficult they often find their own pursuit of happiness how many problems each little family has they look most of all to themselves for their futures but i think that they also look to each of us 
 above the pyramid on the great seal of the united states it says in latin god has favored our undertaking god will not favor everything that we do it is rather our duty to divine his will 
 but i cannot help believing that he truly understands and that he really favors the undertaking that we begin here tonight 
 
 
 a tale of two cities 
 mario cuomo 
 delivered july to at democratic national convention san francisco 
 on behalf of the empire state and the family of new york i thank you for the great privilege of being able to address this convention please allow me to skip the stories and the poetry and the temptation to deal in nice but vague rhetoric let me instead use this valuable opportunity to deal immediately with questions that should determine this election and that we all know are vital to the american people 
 ten days ago president reagan admitted that although some people in this country seemed to be doing well nowadays others were unhappy even worried about themselves their families and their futures the president said that he understand that fear he said why this country is a shining city on a hill and the president is right in many ways we are a shining city on a hill 
 but the hard truth is that not everyone is sharing in this splendor and glory a shining city is perhaps all the president sees from the portico of the white house and the veranda of his ranch where everyone seems to be doing well but another city another part to the shining the city the part where some people pay their mortgages and most young people afford one where students afford the education they need and parents watch the dreams they hold for their children evaporate 
 in this part of the city there are more poor than ever more families in trouble more and more people who need help but find it even worse there are elderly people who tremble in the basements of the houses there and there are people who sleep in the city streets in the gutter where the glitter show there are ghettos where thousands of young people without a job or an education give their lives away to drug dealers every day there is despair mr president in the faces that you see in the places that you visit in your shining city 
 in fact mr president this is a nation mr president you ought to know that this nation is more a tale of two cities than it is just a shining city on a hill 
 maybe maybe mr president if you visited some more places maybe if you went to appalachia where some people still live in sheds maybe if you went to lackawanna where thousands of unemployed steel workers wonder why we subsidized foreign steel maybe maybe mr president if you stopped in at a shelter in chicago and spoke to the homeless there maybe mr president if you asked a woman who had been denied the help she needed to feed her children because you said you needed the money for a tax break for a millionaire or for a missile we afford to use 
 maybe maybe mr president but afraid not 
 because the truth is ladies and gentlemen that this is how we were warned it would be president reagan told us from very the beginning that he believed in a kind of social darwinism survival of the fittest government do everything we were told so it should settle for taking care of the strong and hope that economic ambition and charity will do the rest make the rich richer and what falls from their table will be enough for the middle class and those who are trying desperately to work their way into the middle class 
 you know the republicans called it when hoover tried it now they call it supply side but the same shining city for those relative few who are lucky enough to live in its good neighborhoods but for the people who are excluded for the people who are locked out all they can do is to stare from a distance at that glimmering towers 
 an old story as old as our history the difference between democrats and republicans has always been measured in courage and confidence the republicans believe that the wagon train will not make it to the frontier unless some of the old some of the young some of the weak are left behind by the side of the trail the strong the strong they tell us will inherit the land 
 we democrats believe in something else we democrats believe that we can make it all the way with the whole family intact and we have more than once ever since franklin roosevelt lifted himself from his wheelchair to lift this nation from its knees wagon train after wagon train to new frontiers of education housing peace the whole family aboard constantly reaching out to extend and enlarge that family lifting them up into the wagon on the way blacks and hispanics and people of every ethnic group and native americans all those struggling to build their families and claim some small share of america 
 for nearly years we carried them all to new levels of comfort and security and dignity even affluence and remember this some of us in this room today are here only because this nation had that kind of confidence and it would be wrong to forget that 
 so here we are at this convention to remind ourselves where we come from and to claim the future for ourselves and for our children today our great democratic party which has saved this nation from depression from fascism from racism from corruption is called upon to do it again this time to save the nation from confusion and division from the threat of eventual fiscal disaster and most of all from the fear of a nuclear holocaust 
 not going to be easy mo udall is exactly right not going to be easy in order to succeed we must answer our polished and appealing rhetoric with a more telling reasonableness and rationality 
 we must win this case on the merits we must get the american public to look past the glitter beyond the showmanship to reality to the hard substance of things and we will do that not so much with speeches that sound good as with speeches that are good and sound not so much with speeches that will bring people to their feet as with speeches that bring people to their senses we must make the american people hear our tale of two cities we must convince them that we have to settle for two cities that we can have one city indivisible shining for all of its people 
 now we will have no chance to do that if what comes out of this convention is a babel of arguing voices if heard throughout the campaign dissident voices from all sides we will have no chance to tell our message to succeed we will have to surrender small parts of our individual interests to build a platform we can all stand on at once comfortably proudly singing out the truth for the nation to hear in chorus its logic so clear and commanding that no slick commercial no amount of geniality no martial music will be able to muffle the sound of the truth we democrats must unite 
 we democrats must unite so that the entire nation can unite because surely the republicans bring this country together their policies divide the nation into the lucky and the into the royalty and the rabble the republicans are willing to treat that division as victory they would cut this nation in half into those temporarily better off and those worse off than before and they would call that division recovery 
 we should not we should not be embarrassed or dismayed or chagrined if the process of unifying is difficult even wrenching at times remember that unlike any other party we embrace men and women of every color every creed every orientation every economic class in our family are gathered everyone from the abject poor of essex county in new york to the enlightened affluent of the gold coasts at both ends of the nation and in between is the heart of our constituency the middle class the people not rich enough to be but not poor enough to be on welfare the middle class those people who work for a living because they have to not because some psychiatrist told them it was a convenient way to fill the interval between birth and eternity white collar and blue collar young professionals men and women in small business desperate for the capital and contracts that they need to prove their worth 
 we speak for the minorities who have not yet entered the mainstream we speak for ethnics who want to add their culture to the magnificent mosaic that is america we speak we speak for women who are indignant that this nation refuses to etch into its governmental commandments the simple rule thou shalt not sin against equality a rule so simple i was going to say and i perhaps dare not but i will a commandment so simple it can be spelled in three letters 
 we speak for young people demanding an education and a future we speak for senior citizens who are terrorized by the idea that their only security their social security is being threatened we speak for millions of reasoning people fighting to preserve our environment from greed and from stupidity and we speak for reasonable people who are fighting to preserve our very existence from a macho intransigence that refuses to make intelligent attempts to discuss the possibility of nuclear holocaust with our enemy they refuse they refuse because they believe we can pile missiles so high that they will pierce the clouds and the sight of them will frighten our enemies into submission 
 now proud of this diversity as democrats grateful for it we have to manufacture it the way the republicans will next month in dallas by propping up mannequin delegates on the convention floor but while proud of this diversity as democrats we pay a price for it the different people that we represent have different points of view and sometimes they compete and even debate and even argue what our primaries were all about but now the primaries are over and it is time when we pick our candidates and our platform here to lock arms and move into this campaign together if you need any more inspiration to put some small part of your own differences aside to create this consensus all you need to do is to reflect on what the republican policy of divide and cajole has done to this land since 
 now the president has asked us to judge him on whether or not fulfilled the promise he made four years ago i believe that as democrats we ought to accept that challenge and just for a moment let us consider what he has said and what done inflation is down since but not because of the supply side miracle promised to us by the president inflation was reduced the way with a recession the worst since we could have brought inflation down that way how did he do it thousand bankruptcies two years of massive unemployment two hundred thousand farmers and ranchers forced off the land more homeless than at any time since the great depression in more hungry in this nation of enormous affluence the united states of america more hungry more poor most of them women and he paid one more thing a nearly billion deficit threatening our future 
 now we must make the american people understand this deficit because they the deficit is a direct and dramatic repudiation of his promise to balance our budget by how large is it the deficit is the largest in the history of this universe president last budget had a deficit of less than of this deficit it is a deficit that according to the own fiscal adviser may grow as high as billion a year for as far as the eye can see 
 and ladies and gentlemen it is a debt so large that as much as of our revenue from the income tax goes just to pay the interest it is a mortgage on our future that can be paid only in pain and that could bring this nation to its knees 
 now take my word for it a democrat 
 ask the republican investment bankers on wall street what they think the chances of this recovery being permanent are you see if not too embarrassed to tell you the truth say that they are appalled and frightened by the deficit ask them what they think of our economy now that it has been driven by the distorted value of the dollar back to its colonial condition now exporting agricultural products and importing manufactured ones ask those republican investment bankers what they expect the rate of interest to be a year from now and ask them if they dare tell you the truth you will hear from them what they predict for the inflation rate a year from now because of the deficit 
 now how important is this question of the deficit 
 think about it practically what chance would the republican candidate have had in if he had told the american people that he intended to pay for his economic recovery with bankruptcies unemployment more homeless more hungry and the largest government debt known to humankind would american voters have signed the loan certificate for him on election day of course not that was an election won under false pretenses it was won with smoke and mirrors and illusions and the kind of recovery we have now as well 
 and what about foreign policy they said that they would make us and the whole world safer they say they have by creating the largest defense budget in history one that even they now admit is excessive by escalating to a frenzy the nuclear arms race by incendiary rhetoric by refusing to discuss peace with our enemies by the loss of young americans in lebanon in pursuit of a plan and a policy that no one can find or describe 
 we give money to latin american governments that murder nuns and then we lie about it we have been less than zealous in support of our only real friend it seems to me we have in the middle east the one democracy there our flesh and blood ally the state of israel our foreign policy drifts with no real direction other than an hysterical commitment to an arms race that leads nowhere if lucky and if not it could lead us into bankruptcy or war 
 of course we must have a strong defense 
 of course democrats are for a strong defense of course democrats believe that there are times when we must stand and fight and we have thousands of us have paid for freedom with our lives but always when this country has been at its best our purposes were clear now not now our allies are as confused as our enemies now we have no real commitment to our friends or to our ideals not to human rights not to the refuseniks not to sakharov not to bishop tutu and the others struggling for freedom in south africa 
 we have in the last few years spent more than we can afford we have pounded our chests and made bold speeches but we lost young americans in lebanon and we live behind sand bags in washington how can anyone say that we are stronger safer or better 
 that is the republican record 
 that its disastrous quality is not more fully understood by the american people i can only attribute to the amiability and the failure by some to separate the salesman from the product 
 and now up to us now now up to you and me to make the case to america and to remind americans that if they are not happy with all the president has done so far they should consider how much worse it will be if he is left to his radical proclivities for another four years unrestrained unrestrained 
 if july brings back ann gorsuch burford what can we expect of december where would another four years take us where would four years more take us how much larger will the deficit be how much deeper the cuts in programs for the struggling middle class and the poor to limit that deficit how high will the interest rates be how much more acid rain killing our forests and fouling our lakes and ladies and gentlemen the nation must think of this what kind of supreme court will we have we must ask ourselves what kind of court and country will be fashioned by the man who believes in having government mandate religion and morality 
 the man who believes that trees pollute the environment the man that believes that the laws against discrimination against people go too far the man who threatens social security and medicaid and help for the disabled how high will we pile the missiles how much deeper will the gulf be between us and our enemies and ladies and gentlemen will four years more make meaner the spirit of the american people 
 this election will measure the record of the past four years but more than that it will answer the question of what kind of people we want to be 
 we democrats still have a dream we still believe in this future and this is our answer to the question this is our credo 
 we believe in only the government we need but we insist on all the government we need we believe in a government that is characterized by fairness and reasonableness a reasonableness that goes beyond labels that distort or promise things that we know we believe in a government strong enough to use the words love and compassion and smart enough to convert our noblest aspirations into practical realities we believe in encouraging the talented but we believe that while survival of the fittest may be a good working description of the process of evolution a government of humans should elevate itself to a higher order 
 our government should be able to rise to the level to where it can fill the gaps left by chance or a wisdom we fully understand we would rather have laws written by the patron of this great city the man called the most sincere democrat st francis of assisi than laws written by darwin 
 we believe we believe as democrats that a society as blessed as ours the most affluent democracy in the history one that can spend trillions on instruments of destruction ought to be able to help the middle class in its struggle ought to be able to find work for all who can do it room at the table shelter for the homeless care for the elderly and infirm and hope for the destitute and we proclaim as loudly as we can the utter insanity of nuclear proliferation and the need for a nuclear freeze if only to affirm the simple truth that peace is better than war because life is better than death 
 we believe in firm but fair law and order we believe proudly in the union movement we believe in privacy for people openness by government we believe in civil rights and we believe in human rights we believe in a single fundamental idea that describes better than most textbooks and any speech that i could write what a proper government should be the idea of family mutuality the sharing of benefits and burdens for the good of all feeling one pain sharing one blessings reasonably honestly fairly without respect to race or sex or geography or political affiliation 
 we believe we must be the family of america recognizing that at the heart of the matter we are bound one to another that the problems of a retired school teacher in duluth are our problems that the future of the child in buffalo is our future that the struggle of a disabled man in boston to survive and live decently is our struggle that the hunger of a woman in little rock is our hunger that the failure anywhere to provide what reasonably we might to avoid pain is our failure 
 now for years for years we democrats created a better future for our children using traditional democratic principles as a fixed beacon giving us direction and purpose but constantly innovating adapting to new realities alphabet programs nato and the gi bill of rights intelligent tax incentives and the alliance for progress civil rights human rights and the nearly miraculous camp david peace accord 
 democrats did it democrats did it and democrats can do it again we can build a future that deals with our deficit remember this that years of progress under our principles never cost us what the last four years of stagnation have and we can deal with the deficit intelligently by shared sacrifice with all parts of the family contributing building partnerships with the private sector providing a sound defense without depriving ourselves of what we need to feed our children and care for our people 
 we can have a future that provides for all the young of the present by marrying common sense and compassion we know we can because we did it for nearly years before 
 and we can do it again if we do not forget if we do not forget that this entire nation has profited by these progressive principles that they helped lift up generations to the middle class and higher gave us a chance to work to go to college to raise a family to own a house to be secure in our old age and before that to reach heights that our own parents would not have dared dream of 
 that struggle to live with dignity is the real story of the shining city and a story ladies and gentlemen that i read in a book or learn in a classroom i saw it and lived it like many of you i watched a small man with thick calluses on both hands work and hours a day i saw him once literally bleed from the bottoms of his feet a man who came here uneducated alone unable to speak the language who taught me all i needed to know about faith and hard work by the simple eloquence of his example i learned about our kind of democracy from my father and i learned about our obligation to each other from him and from my mother they asked only for a chance to work and to make the world better for their children and they asked to be protected in those moments when they would not be able to protect themselves this nation and this government did that for them 
 and that they were able to build a family and live in dignity and see one of their children go from behind their little grocery store in south jamaica on the other side of the tracks where he was born to occupy the highest seat in the greatest state of the greatest nation in the only world we know is an ineffably beautiful tribute to the democratic process 
 and ladies and gentlemen on january it will happen again only on a much much grander scale we will have a new president of the united states a democrat born not to the blood of kings but to the blood of pioneers and immigrants and we will have first woman vice president the child of immigrants and she she she will open with one magnificent stroke a whole new frontier for the united states now it will happen 
 it will happen if we make it happen if you and i can make it happen 
 and i ask you now ladies and gentlemen brothers and sisters for the good of all of us for the love of this great nation for the family of america for the love of god please make this nation remember how futures are built 
 thank you and god bless you
