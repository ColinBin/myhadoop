 the greatest trust between man and man is the trust of giving counsel for in other confidences men commit the parts of life their lands their goods their children their credit some particular affair but to such as they make their counsellors they commit the whole by how much the more they are obliged to all faith and integrity 
 
 the wisest princes need not think it any diminution to their greatness or derogation to their sufficiency to rely upon counsel god himself is not without but hath made it one of the great names of his blessed son the counsellor solomon hath pronounced that in counsel is stability things will have their first or second agitation if they be not tossed upon the arguments of counsel they will be tossed upon the waves of fortune and be full of inconstancy doing and undoing like the reeling of a drunken man son found the force of counsel as his father saw the necessity of it

 conjunction of counsel with kings and the wise and politic use of counsel by kings the one in that they say jupiter did many metis which signifieth counsel whereby they intend that sovereignty is married to counsel the other in that which followeth which was thus they say after jupiter was married to metis she conceived by him and was with child but jupiter suffered her not to stay till she brought forth but ate her up whereby he became himself with child and was delivered of pallas armed out of his head which monstrous fable contained a secret of empire how kings are to make use of their counsel of state

 tranquillity 
 after bidding his sister good night monseigneur bienvenu took one of the two silver candlesticks from the table handed the other to his guest and said to him 
 monsieur i will conduct you to your room 
 the man followed him 
 as might have been observed from what has been said above the house was so arranged that in order to pass into the oratory where the alcove was situated or to get out of it it was necessary to traverse the bedroom 
 at the moment when he was crossing this apartment madame magloire was putting away the silverware in the cupboard near the head of the bed this was her last care every evening before she went to bed 
 the bishop installed his guest in the alcove 
 a fresh white bed had been prepared there 
 the man set the candle down on a small table 
 well said the bishop may you pass a good night 
 morning before you set out you shall drink a cup of warm milk from our cows 
 thanks monsieur said the man 
 hardly had he pronounced these words full of peace when all of a sudden and without transition he made a strange movement which would have frozen the two sainted women with horror had they witnessed it 
 even at this day it is difficult for us to explain what inspired him at that moment 
 did he intend to convey a warning or to throw out a menace 
 was he simply obeying a sort of instinctive impulse which was obscure even to himself he turned abruptly to the old man folded his arms and bending upon his host a savage gaze he exclaimed in a hoarse voice 
 ah really 
 you lodge me in your house close to yourself like this 
 he broke off and added with a laugh in which there lurked something monstrous 
 have you really reflected well 
 how do you know that i have not been an assassin 
 the bishop replied 
 that is the concern of the good god 
 then gravely and moving his lips like one who is praying or talking to himself he raised two fingers of his right hand and bestowed his benediction on the man who did not bow and without turning his head or looking behind him he returned to his bedroom 
 when the alcove was in use a large serge curtain drawn from wall to wall concealed the altar 
 the bishop knelt before this curtain as he passed and said a brief prayer 
 a moment later he was in his garden walking meditating conteplating his heart and soul wholly absorbed in those grand and mysterious things which god shows at night to the eyes which remain open 
 as for the man he was actually so fatigued that he did not even profit by the nice white sheets 
 snuffing out his candle with his nostrils after the manner of convicts he dropped all dressed as he was upon the bed where he immediately fell into a profound sleep 
 midnight struck as the bishop returned from his garden to his apartment 
 a few minutes later all were asleep in the little house

 the empire strikes back 
 vi 
 
 the rebel command center its walls and ceiling still shaking and cracking under theforce of the battle on the surface was attempting to operate amid the torn apart by the blasting belched sprays of scalding stem the white floorwere littered with broken pieces of machinery and chunks of ice were scatteredeverywhere except for the distant rumbling of laser fire the command center wasforebodingly quiet 
 there were still rebel personnel on duty including princess leia who watchedthe images on the few console screens she wanted to be certainthat the last of the transport ships had slipped past the imperial armada and wereapproaching their rendezvous point in space 
 han solo rushed into the command center dodging great sections of the iceceiling that came plunging down at him one great chunk was followed by anavalanche of ice that poured onto the floor near the entrance to the han hurried to the control board where leia stood beside 
 i heard the command center was hit han appeared concerned are you allright 
 the princess nodded she was surprised to see him there where the danger wasseverest 
 come on he urged before she could reply got to get to your ship 
 leia looked exhausted she had been standing at the console viewscreens forhours and had participated in dispatching rebel personnel to their posts taking herhand han led her from the chamber with the protocol droid clacking after them 
 as they left leia gave one final order to the controller give the evacuationcode signaland get to the transport 
 then as leia han and threepio made their hasty exit from the command voice blared from the public address speakers echoing in the nearby deserted icecorridors disengage disengage begin retreat action 
 come on han urged grimacing if you get there fast your be able to take off 
 the walls quaked even more violently than before ice chunks continued to fallthroughout the underground base as the three hurried toward the transport had nearly reached the hangar where transport ship was waiting ready fordeparture but as they neared the corner they found the entrance to the hangarcompletely blocked by ice and snow 
 han knew they would have to find some other route to escape he began to lead them back down the corridor careful to avoid falling snapped on his comlink as they hurried toward the ship transport c oneseven he yelled into the small microphone coming hold on 
 they were close enough to the hangar to hear escape vessel preparing from the rebel ice base if he could lead them safely just a few meters princess would be safe and 
 the chamber suddenly quaked with a terrible noise that thundered through theunderground base in an instant the entire ceiling had crashed down in front of a solid barrier of ice between them and the hangar docks they stared inshock at the dense white mass 
 cut off han yelled into his comlink knowing that if the transport wereto make good its escape there could be no time wasted in melting down or blastingthrough the barricade have to take off without princess organa heturned to her if lucky we can still make it to the falcon 
 the princess and followed as han dashed toward another that the millennium falcon and his wookiee copilot had not already beenburied under an avalanche of ice 
 looking out across the white battlefield the rebel officer watched the remainingsnowspeeders whisking through the air and the last of the imperial vehicles as theypassed the wreckage of the exploded walker he flipped on his comlink and heardthe order to retreat disengage disengage begin retreat action as he signaledhis men to move back inside the ice cavern he noticed that the lead walker was stilltreading heavily in the direction of the power generators 
 in the cockpit of that assault machine general veers stepped close to the this position he could clearly see the target below he studied the cracklingpower generators and observed the rebel troops defending them 
 within range sir reported hispilot 
 the general turned to his assault officer all troops will debark for groundassault veers said prepare to target the main generator 
 the lead walker flanked by two of the hulking machines lurched forward itsguns blazing to scatter the retreating rebel troops 
 as more laser fire came from the oncoming walkers rebel bodies and parts ofrebel bodies were flung through the air many of the soldiers who had managed toavoid the obliterating laser beams were crushed into unrecognizable pulp beneath thewalkers stomping feet the air was charged with the stink of blood and burningflesh and thundering with the explosive noises of battle 
 as they fled the few surviving rebel soldiers glimpsed a long snowspeeder as itretreated in the distance a black trail of smoke escaping its burning hull 
 although the smoke rising from his crippled speeder obstructed his view hobbiecould still see some of the carnage that raged on the ground his wounds from laser fire made it torture even to move let alone operate the controls of hiscraft but if he could mange to work them just long enough to return to the base hemight be able to find a medical robot and 
 no he doubted he would survive even that long he was that he wasnow the men in the trench would soon be dead too unless somethingwere done to save them 
 general veers proudly transmitting his report to imperial headquarters wastotally unaware of rogue approach yes lord vader reached the mainpower generators the shield will be down in moments you may commence yourlanding 
 as he ended his transmission general veers reached for the electrorangefinderand looked through the eyepiece to line up the main power generators electroniccrosshairs aligned according to the information from the computer thensuddenly the readouts on the small monitor screens mysteriously vanished 
 confounded general veers moved away from the eyepiece of theelectrorangefinder and turned instinctively toward a cockpit window he flinched interror at seeing a smoking projectile heading on the direct course toward his 
 the other pilots also saw the hurtling speeder and knew that there was no timeto turn the massive assault machine going to one of the pilots began 
 at that instant burning ship crashed through the walker cockpit like amanned bomb its fuel igniting into a cascade of flame and debris for a secondthere were human screams then fragments and the entire machine crashed to theground 
 perhaps it was the sound of this nearby blast that jarred luke skywalker back toconsciousness dazed he slowly lifted his head from the snow he felt very weakand was achingly stiff with cold the thought crossed his mind that frostbite mightalready have damaged his tissues he hoped not he had no desire to spend any moretime in that sticky bacta fluid 
 he tried to stand but fell back against the snow hoping he would not be spottedby any of the walker pilots his comlink whistled and somehow he found thestrength to flick on its receiver 
 forward units withdrawal complete the broadcast voice reported 
 withdrawal luke thought a moment then leia and the others must haveescaped luke suddenly felt that all the fighting and the deaths of loyal rebelpersonnel had not been for nothing a warmth rushed through his body and hegathered his strength to rise and begin making the long trek back toward a distantformation of ice 
 another explosion rocked the rebel hangar deck cracking the ceiling and almostburying the docked millennium falcon in a mound of ice at any moment the entireceiling might cave in the only safe place in the hangar seemed to be underneath theship itself where chewbacca was impatiently awaiting the return of his captain thewookiee had begun to worry if han did not return soon the falcon would surelybe buried in a tomb of ice but loyalty to his partner kept chewie from taking off inthe freighter alone 
 as the hangar started to tremble more violently chewbacca detected movementin the adjoining chamber throwing back his head the shaggy giant filled thehangar with his loudest roar as he saw han solo climb over hills of ice and snow andenter the chamber followed closely by princess leia and an obviously 
 not far from the hangar imperial stormtroopers their faces shielded by whitehelmets and white snowscreens had begun moving down deserted corridors withthem strode their leader the figure who surveyed the shambles that hadbeen the rebel base at hoth darth black image stood out starkly against thewhite walls ceiling and floor as he moved through the white catacombs heregally stepped aside to avoid a falling section of ice ceiling then he continued onhis way with such quick strides that his troops had to hurry to keep up 
 a low whine rising in pitch began to issue from the solo stood at the controls in the millennium cockpit at last feeling athome he quickly flipped one switch after another expecting to see the board flashits familiar mosaic of light but only some of the lights were working 
 chewbacca had also noticed something amiss and barked with concern as leiaexamined a gauge that seemed to be malfunctioning 
 that chewie asked han anxiously 
 the bark was distinctly negative 
 would it help if i got out and pushed snapped princess leia who wasbeginning to wonder if it were the spit that held the ship together 
 worry your holiness get it started 
 clanked into the hold and gesturing tried to get the robot volunteered i was wondering if i might but his scanners readthe scowl on the face staring at him it can wait he concluded 
 imperial stormtroopers accompanied by the rapidly moving darth through the ice corridors of the rebel base their pace quickened as theyrushed in the direction of the low whine coming from the ion engines bodytensed slightly as entering the hangar he perceived the familiar formof the millennium falcon 
 within the battered freighter ship han solo and chewbacca were tryingdesperately to get the craft moving 
 this bucket of bolts is never going to get us past that blockade princess leiacomplained 
 han pretended that he hear her instead he checked the and struggled to keep his patience even though his companion had soobviously lost hers he flipped switches on the control console ignoring look of disdain clearly she doubted that this assemblage of spare partsand welded hunks of scrap metal would hold together even if they did manage to getbeyond the blockade 
 han pushed a button on the intercom chewiecome on then winking atleia he said this still got a few surprise left in her 
 be surprised if we start moving 
 before han could make a carefully honed retort the falcon was jolted by a blastof imperial laser fire that flashed outside the cockpit window they could all see thesquad of imperial stormtroopers rushing with drawn weapons into the far end of theice hangar han knew that the dented hull might resist the force of thosehand weapons but would be destroyed by the more powerful weaponthat two of the imperial troopers were hurriedly setting up 
 chewie han yelled as he quickly strapped himself into his a somewhat subdued young woman seated herself in the 
 outside the millennium falcon stormtroopers worked with military efficiency toset up their enormous gun behind them the hangar doors began to open one ofthe powerful laser weapons appeared from the hull and swung about aimingdirectly at the stormtroopers 
 han moved urgently to block the imperial efforts without hesitationhe released a deadly blast from the powerful laser weapon he had aimed at thestormtroopers the explosion scattered their armored bodies all over the hangar 
 chewbacca dashed into the cockpit 
 just have to switch over han announced and hope for the best 
 the wookiee hurled his hairy bulk into the seat as yet another laserblast erupted outside the window next to him he yelled indignantly then yankedback on the controls to bring the welcome roar of engine fire from deep inside thefalcon 
 the corellian grinned at the princess a gleeful gleam in his eyes 
 someday she said with mild disgust going to be wrong and i justhope there to see it 
 han just smiled then turned to his copilot punch it he shouted 
 the huge engines roared and everything behind the craft instantlymelted in the fiery exhaust billowing from its tailpiece chewbacca furiously workedthe controls watching out of the corner of his eyes the ice walls rushing past as thefreighter blasted away 
 at the last moment just before takeoff han caught a glimpse of additionalstormtroopers running into the hangar in their wake strode a foreboding giant cladentirely in black then there was only the blur and the beckoning of billions of stars 
 as the millennium falcon soared from the hangar its flight was detected bycommander luke skywalker who turned to smile at wedge and his gunner atleast han got away the three then trudged along to their waiting fighterships when they finally reached them they shook hands and moved off towardtheir separate vehicles 
 good luck luke wedge said as they parted see you at the rendezvous 
 luke waved and began to walk toward his standing there amid themountains of ice and snow he was overcome by a surge of loneliness he feltdesperately alone now that even han was gone worse than that princess leia wasalso somewhere else she might just as well be an entire universe away 
 then out of nowhere a familiar whistle greeted luke 
 artoo he exclaimed is that you 
 sitting snugly in the socket that had been installed for these helpful r units wasthe little droid his head peeking from the top of the ship artoo hadscanned the approaching figure and had whistled with relief when his computersinformed him it was luke the young commander was equally relieved toreencounter the robot that had accompanied him on so many of his previousadventures 
 as he climbed into the cockpit and seated himself behind the controls lukecould hear the sound of fighter roaring into the sky toward the rebelrendezvous point activate the power and stop worrying soon beairborne luke said in response to nervous beeping 
 his was the last rebel ship to abandon what had for a very brief time been asecret outpost in the revolution against the tyranny of the empire 
 darth vader a raven specter quickly strode through the ruins of the rebel icefortress forcing his accompanying men into a brisk jog to keep up as they movedthrough the corridors admiral piett rushed up to overtake his master 
 seventeen ships destroyed he reported to the dark lord we knowhow many got away 
 without turning his head vader snarled through his mask the millenniumfalcon 
 piett paused a moment before replying he would have preferred to avoid thatissue our tracking scanners are on it now he responded a bit fearfully 
 vader turned to face the admiral his towering figure looming over the frightenedofficer piett felt a chill course through his veins and when the dark lord spokeagain his voice conveyed an image of the dreadful fate that would be inflicted if hiscommands were not executed 
 i want that ship he hissed 
 the ice planet was rapidly shrinking to a point of dim light as the millenniumfalcon sped into space soon that planet seemed nothing more than one of thebillions of light specks scattered throughout the black void 
 but the falcon was not alone in its escape into deep space rather it wasfollowed by an imperial fleet that included the avenger star destroyer and tie fighter the fighters moved ahead of the huge and closed in on the fleeing millennium falcon 
 chewbacca howled over the roar of the engines the ship wasbeginning to lurch with the buffeting flak blasted at it by the fighters 
 i know i know i see them han shouted it was taking everything he had tomaintain control of the ship 
 see what leia asked 
 han pointed out the window at two very bright objects 
 two more star destroyers and heading right at us 
 glad you said there was going to be no problem she commented withmore than a touch of sarcasm or be worried 
 the ship rocked under the steady fire from the tie fighters making it difficult forthreepio to maintain his balance as he returned to the cockpit his metal skinbumped and banged against the walls as he approached han sir he begantentatively i was wondering 
 han solo shot him a threatening glance either shut up or shut down hanwarned the robot who immediately did the former 
 still struggling with the controls to keep the millennium falcon on course thepilot turned to wookiee chewie the deflector shield holding up 
 the cockpit adjusted an overhead switch and barked a reply that solo interpretedas positive 
 good said han at sublight they may be faster but we can them hold on suddenly the corellian shifted his course 
 the two imperial star destroyers had com almost within firing range of thefalcon as they loomed ahead the pursuing tie fighters and the avenger were alsodangerously close han felt he had no choice but to take the falcon into dive 
 leia and chewbacca felt their stomachs leap into their throats as the falconexecuted its steep dive poor threepio quickly had to alter his inner mechanism if hewanted to remain on his metallic fee 
 han realized that his crew might think he was some kind of lunatic star his ship on this course but he had a strategy in mind with thefalcon no longer between them the two star destroyers were now on a directcollision course with the avenger all he had to do was sit back and watch 
 alarms blared through the interiors of all three star destroyers theseponderously massive ships could not respond quickly enough to such one of the destroyers began to move to the left in its effort to avoidcollision with the avenger unfortunately as it veered it brushed its companion shaking up both spaceborne fortresses the damaged destroyers began todrift through space while the avenger continued in pursuit of the millennium falconand its obviously insane pilot 
 two down han thought but there was still a quartet of tie fighters tailing thefalcon blasting at its stern with full laser fire but han thought he could outstrip ship was buffeted violently by the fighters laser blasts forcing leia to hold on ina desperate attempt to keep her seat 
 that slowed them down a bit han exulted chewie stand by to make thejump to there was not a moment to laser attack wasintense now and the tie fighters were almost on top of them 
 very close leia warned finally able to speak 
 han looked at her with a wicked glint in his eyes oh yeah watch this 
 he threw the hyperspace throttle forward desperate to escape but also eager toimpress the princess with both his own cleverness and his fantastic happened the stars that should by then have been mere blurs of light werestill something was definitely wrong 
 watch what leia asked impatiently 
 instead of responding han worked the controls a second nothing i think in trouble he muttered his throat tightened heknew trouble was a gross understatement 
 if i may say so sir threepio volunteered i noticed earlier that the entiremain system seemed to have been damaged 
 chewbacca threw back his head and let out a loud and miserable wail 
 in trouble han repeated 
 all around them the laser attack had increased violently the millenniumfalcon could only continue at its maximum sublight velocity as it moved deeper intospace closely followed by a swarm of tie fighters and one gigantic imperial stardestroyer

 the empire strikes back 
 vi 
 
 the rebel command center its walls and ceiling still shaking and cracking under theforce of the battle on the surface was attempting to operate amid the torn apart by the blasting belched sprays of scalding stem the white floorwere littered with broken pieces of machinery and chunks of ice were scatteredeverywhere except for the distant rumbling of laser fire the command center wasforebodingly quiet 
 there were still rebel personnel on duty including princess leia who watchedthe images on the few console screens she wanted to be certainthat the last of the transport ships had slipped past the imperial armada and wereapproaching their rendezvous point in space 
 han solo rushed into the command center dodging great sections of the iceceiling that came plunging down at him one great chunk was followed by anavalanche of ice that poured onto the floor near the entrance to the han hurried to the control board where leia stood beside 
 i heard the command center was hit han appeared concerned are you allright 
 the princess nodded she was surprised to see him there where the danger wasseverest 
 come on he urged before she could reply got to get to your ship 
 leia looked exhausted she had been standing at the console viewscreens forhours and had participated in dispatching rebel personnel to their posts taking herhand han led her from the chamber with the protocol droid clacking after them 
 as they left leia gave one final order to the controller give the evacuationcode signaland get to the transport 
 then as leia han and threepio made their hasty exit from the command voice blared from the public address speakers echoing in the nearby deserted icecorridors disengage disengage begin retreat action 
 come on han urged grimacing if you get there fast your be able to take off 
 the walls quaked even more violently than before ice chunks continued to fallthroughout the underground base as the three hurried toward the transport had nearly reached the hangar where transport ship was waiting ready fordeparture but as they neared the corner they found the entrance to the hangarcompletely blocked by ice and snow 
 han knew they would have to find some other route to escape he began to lead them back down the corridor careful to avoid falling snapped on his comlink as they hurried toward the ship transport c oneseven he yelled into the small microphone coming hold on 
 they were close enough to the hangar to hear escape vessel preparing from the rebel ice base if he could lead them safely just a few meters princess would be safe and 
 the chamber suddenly quaked with a terrible noise that thundered through theunderground base in an instant the entire ceiling had crashed down in front of a solid barrier of ice between them and the hangar docks they stared inshock at the dense white mass 
 cut off han yelled into his comlink knowing that if the transport wereto make good its escape there could be no time wasted in melting down or blastingthrough the barricade have to take off without princess organa heturned to her if lucky we can still make it to the falcon 
 the princess and followed as han dashed toward another that the millennium falcon and his wookiee copilot had not already beenburied under an avalanche of ice 
 looking out across the white battlefield the rebel officer watched the remainingsnowspeeders whisking through the air and the last of the imperial vehicles as theypassed the wreckage of the exploded walker he flipped on his comlink and heardthe order to retreat disengage disengage begin retreat action as he signaledhis men to move back inside the ice cavern he noticed that the lead walker was stilltreading heavily in the direction of the power generators 
 in the cockpit of that assault machine general veers stepped close to the this position he could clearly see the target below he studied the cracklingpower generators and observed the rebel troops defending them 
 within range sir reported hispilot 
 the general turned to his assault officer all troops will debark for groundassault veers said prepare to target the main generator 
 the lead walker flanked by two of the hulking machines lurched forward itsguns blazing to scatter the retreating rebel troops 
 as more laser fire came from the oncoming walkers rebel bodies and parts ofrebel bodies were flung through the air many of the soldiers who had managed toavoid the obliterating laser beams were crushed into unrecognizable pulp beneath thewalkers stomping feet the air was charged with the stink of blood and burningflesh and thundering with the explosive noises of battle 
 as they fled the few surviving rebel soldiers glimpsed a long snowspeeder as itretreated in the distance a black trail of smoke escaping its burning hull 
 although the smoke rising from his crippled speeder obstructed his view hobbiecould still see some of the carnage that raged on the ground his wounds from laser fire made it torture even to move let alone operate the controls of hiscraft but if he could mange to work them just long enough to return to the base hemight be able to find a medical robot and 
 no he doubted he would survive even that long he was that he wasnow the men in the trench would soon be dead too unless somethingwere done to save them 
 general veers proudly transmitting his report to imperial headquarters wastotally unaware of rogue approach yes lord vader reached the mainpower generators the shield will be down in moments you may commence yourlanding 
 as he ended his transmission general veers reached for the electrorangefinderand looked through the eyepiece to line up the main power generators electroniccrosshairs aligned according to the information from the computer thensuddenly the readouts on the small monitor screens mysteriously vanished 
 confounded general veers moved away from the eyepiece of theelectrorangefinder and turned instinctively toward a cockpit window he flinched interror at seeing a smoking projectile heading on the direct course toward his 
 the other pilots also saw the hurtling speeder and knew that there was no timeto turn the massive assault machine going to one of the pilots began 
 at that instant burning ship crashed through the walker cockpit like amanned bomb its fuel igniting into a cascade of flame and debris for a secondthere were human screams then fragments and the entire machine crashed to theground 
 perhaps it was the sound of this nearby blast that jarred luke skywalker back toconsciousness dazed he slowly lifted his head from the snow he felt very weakand was achingly stiff with cold the thought crossed his mind that frostbite mightalready have damaged his tissues he hoped not he had no desire to spend any moretime in that sticky bacta fluid 
 he tried to stand but fell back against the snow hoping he would not be spottedby any of the walker pilots his comlink whistled and somehow he found thestrength to flick on its receiver 
 forward units withdrawal complete the broadcast voice reported 
 withdrawal luke thought a moment then leia and the others must haveescaped luke suddenly felt that all the fighting and the deaths of loyal rebelpersonnel had not been for nothing a warmth rushed through his body and hegathered his strength to rise and begin making the long trek back toward a distantformation of ice 
 another explosion rocked the rebel hangar deck cracking the ceiling and almostburying the docked millennium falcon in a mound of ice at any moment the entireceiling might cave in the only safe place in the hangar seemed to be underneath theship itself where chewbacca was impatiently awaiting the return of his captain thewookiee had begun to worry if han did not return soon the falcon would surelybe buried in a tomb of ice but loyalty to his partner kept chewie from taking off inthe freighter alone 
 as the hangar started to tremble more violently chewbacca detected movementin the adjoining chamber throwing back his head the shaggy giant filled thehangar with his loudest roar as he saw han solo climb over hills of ice and snow andenter the chamber followed closely by princess leia and an obviously 
 not far from the hangar imperial stormtroopers their faces shielded by whitehelmets and white snowscreens had begun moving down deserted corridors withthem strode their leader the figure who surveyed the shambles that hadbeen the rebel base at hoth darth black image stood out starkly against thewhite walls ceiling and floor as he moved through the white catacombs heregally stepped aside to avoid a falling section of ice ceiling then he continued onhis way with such quick strides that his troops had to hurry to keep up 
 a low whine rising in pitch began to issue from the solo stood at the controls in the millennium cockpit at last feeling athome he quickly flipped one switch after another expecting to see the board flashits familiar mosaic of light but only some of the lights were working 
 chewbacca had also noticed something amiss and barked with concern as leiaexamined a gauge that seemed to be malfunctioning 
 that chewie asked han anxiously 
 the bark was distinctly negative 
 would it help if i got out and pushed snapped princess leia who wasbeginning to wonder if it were the spit that held the ship together 
 worry your holiness get it started 
 clanked into the hold and gesturing tried to get the robot volunteered i was wondering if i might but his scanners readthe scowl on the face staring at him it can wait he concluded 
 imperial stormtroopers accompanied by the rapidly moving darth through the ice corridors of the rebel base their pace quickened as theyrushed in the direction of the low whine coming from the ion engines bodytensed slightly as entering the hangar he perceived the familiar formof the millennium falcon 
 within the battered freighter ship han solo and chewbacca were tryingdesperately to get the craft moving 
 this bucket of bolts is never going to get us past that blockade princess leiacomplained 
 han pretended that he hear her instead he checked the and struggled to keep his patience even though his companion had soobviously lost hers he flipped switches on the control console ignoring look of disdain clearly she doubted that this assemblage of spare partsand welded hunks of scrap metal would hold together even if they did manage to getbeyond the blockade 
 han pushed a button on the intercom chewiecome on then winking atleia he said this still got a few surprise left in her 
 be surprised if we start moving 
 before han could make a carefully honed retort the falcon was jolted by a blastof imperial laser fire that flashed outside the cockpit window they could all see thesquad of imperial stormtroopers rushing with drawn weapons into the far end of theice hangar han knew that the dented hull might resist the force of thosehand weapons but would be destroyed by the more powerful weaponthat two of the imperial troopers were hurriedly setting up 
 chewie han yelled as he quickly strapped himself into his a somewhat subdued young woman seated herself in the 
 outside the millennium falcon stormtroopers worked with military efficiency toset up their enormous gun behind them the hangar doors began to open one ofthe powerful laser weapons appeared from the hull and swung about aimingdirectly at the stormtroopers 
 han moved urgently to block the imperial efforts without hesitationhe released a deadly blast from the powerful laser weapon he had aimed at thestormtroopers the explosion scattered their armored bodies all over the hangar 
 chewbacca dashed into the cockpit 
 just have to switch over han announced and hope for the best 
 the wookiee hurled his hairy bulk into the seat as yet another laserblast erupted outside the window next to him he yelled indignantly then yankedback on the controls to bring the welcome roar of engine fire from deep inside thefalcon 
 the corellian grinned at the princess a gleeful gleam in his eyes 
 someday she said with mild disgust going to be wrong and i justhope there to see it 
 han just smiled then turned to his copilot punch it he shouted 
 the huge engines roared and everything behind the craft instantlymelted in the fiery exhaust billowing from its tailpiece chewbacca furiously workedthe controls watching out of the corner of his eyes the ice walls rushing past as thefreighter blasted away 
 at the last moment just before takeoff han caught a glimpse of additionalstormtroopers running into the hangar in their wake strode a foreboding giant cladentirely in black then there was only the blur and the beckoning of billions of stars 
 as the millennium falcon soared from the hangar its flight was detected bycommander luke skywalker who turned to smile at wedge and his gunner atleast han got away the three then trudged along to their waiting fighterships when they finally reached them they shook hands and moved off towardtheir separate vehicles 
 good luck luke wedge said as they parted see you at the rendezvous 
 luke waved and began to walk toward his standing there amid themountains of ice and snow he was overcome by a surge of loneliness he feltdesperately alone now that even han was gone worse than that princess leia wasalso somewhere else she might just as well be an entire universe away 
 then out of nowhere a familiar whistle greeted luke 
 artoo he exclaimed is that you 
 sitting snugly in the socket that had been installed for these helpful r units wasthe little droid his head peeking from the top of the ship artoo hadscanned the approaching figure and had whistled with relief when his computersinformed him it was luke the young commander was equally relieved toreencounter the robot that had accompanied him on so many of his previousadventures 
 as he climbed into the cockpit and seated himself behind the controls lukecould hear the sound of fighter roaring into the sky toward the rebelrendezvous point activate the power and stop worrying soon beairborne luke said in response to nervous beeping 
 his was the last rebel ship to abandon what had for a very brief time been asecret outpost in the revolution against the tyranny of the empire 
 darth vader a raven specter quickly strode through the ruins of the rebel icefortress forcing his accompanying men into a brisk jog to keep up as they movedthrough the corridors admiral piett rushed up to overtake his master 
 seventeen ships destroyed he reported to the dark lord we knowhow many got away 
 without turning his head vader snarled through his mask the millenniumfalcon 
 piett paused a moment before replying he would have preferred to avoid thatissue our tracking scanners are on it now he responded a bit fearfully 
 vader turned to face the admiral his towering figure looming over the frightenedofficer piett felt a chill course through his veins and when the dark lord spokeagain his voice conveyed an image of the dreadful fate that would be inflicted if hiscommands were not executed 
 i want that ship he hissed 
 the ice planet was rapidly shrinking to a point of dim light as the millenniumfalcon sped into space soon that planet seemed nothing more than one of thebillions of light specks scattered throughout the black void 
 but the falcon was not alone in its escape into deep space rather it wasfollowed by an imperial fleet that included the avenger star destroyer and tie fighter the fighters moved ahead of the huge and closed in on the fleeing millennium falcon 
 chewbacca howled over the roar of the engines the ship wasbeginning to lurch with the buffeting flak blasted at it by the fighters 
 i know i know i see them han shouted it was taking everything he had tomaintain control of the ship 
 see what leia asked 
 han pointed out the window at two very bright objects 
 two more star destroyers and heading right at us 
 glad you said there was going to be no problem she commented withmore than a touch of sarcasm or be worried 
 the ship rocked under the steady fire from the tie fighters making it difficult forthreepio to maintain his balance as he returned to the cockpit his metal skinbumped and banged against the walls as he approached han sir he begantentatively i was wondering

 the card tables were drawn out sets made up for boston and the visitors settled themselves some in the two drawing rooms some in the sitting room some in the library 
 the count holding his cards fanwise kept himself with difficulty from dropping into his usual nap and laughed at everything the young people at the countess instigation gathered round the clavichord and harp julie by general request played first after she had played a little air with variations on the harp she joined the other young ladies in begging natasha and 
 nicholas who were noted for their musical talent to sing something natasha who was treated as though she were grown up was evidently very proud of this but at the same time felt shy 
 what shall we sing she said 
 the brook suggested nicholas 
 well be quick boris come here said natasha but where is sonya 
 she looked round and seeing that her friend was not in the room ran to look for her 
 running into room and not finding her there natasha ran to the nursery but sonya was not there either natasha concluded that she must be on the chest in the passage the chest in the passage was the place of mourning for the younger female generation in the rostov household and there in fact was sonya lying face downward on dirty feather bed on the top of the chest crumpling her gauzy pink dress under her hiding her face with her slender fingers and sobbing so convulsively that her bare little shoulders shook face which had been so radiantly happy all that day suddenly changed her eyes became fixed and then a shiver passed down her broad neck and the corners of her mouth drooped 
 sonya what is it what is the matter oo oo oo and large mouth widened making her look quite ugly and she began to wail like a baby without knowing why except that sonya was crying sonya tried to lift her head to answer but could not and hid her face still deeper in the bed natasha wept sitting on the feather bed and hugging her friend with an effort sonya sat up and began wiping her eyes and explaining 
 nicholas is going away in a time his papers have come he told me himself but still i should not cry and she showed a paper she held in her hand with the verses nicholas had written still i should not cry but you no one can understand what a soul he has 
 and she began to cry again because he had such a noble soul 
 all very well for you i am not envious i love you and boris also she went on gaining a little strength he is nice there are no difficulties in your way but nicholas is my cousin one would have to the metropolitan himself and even then it be done and besides if she tells mamma sonya looked upon the countess as her mother and called her so that i am spoiling nicholas career and am heartless and ungrateful while truly god is my witness and she made the sign of the cross i love her so much and all of you only vera and what for what have i done to her i am so grateful to you that i would willingly sacrifice everything only i have nothing 
 sonya could not continue and again hid her face in her hands and in the feather bed natasha began consoling her but her face showed that she understood all the gravity of her trouble 
 sonya she suddenly exclaimed as if she had guessed the true reason of her sorrow sure vera has said something to you since dinner she 
 yes these verses nicholas wrote himself and i copied some others and she found them on my table and said show them to mamma and that i was ungrateful and that mamma would never allow him to marry me but that marry julie you see how been with her all day natasha what have i done to deserve it 
 and again she began to sob more bitterly than before natasha lifted her up hugged her and smiling through her tears began comforting her 
 sonya believe her darling believe her do you remember how we and nicholas all three of us talked in the sitting room after supper why we settled how everything was to be i quite remember how but you remember that it could all be arranged and how nice it all was uncle brother has married his first cousin and we are only second cousins you know and boris says it is quite possible you know i have told him all about it and he is so clever and so good said natasha you cry sonya dear love darling sonya and she kissed her and laughed spiteful never mind her and all will come right and she say anything to mamma nicholas will tell her himself and he care at all for julie 
 natasha kissed her on the hair 
 sonya sat up the little kitten brightened its eyes shone and it seemed ready to lift its tail jump down on its soft paws and begin playing with the ball of worsted as a kitten should 
 do you think so really truly she said quickly smoothing her frock and hair 
 really truly answered natasha pushing in a crisp lock that had strayed from under her plaits 
 both laughed 
 well go and sing the brook 
 come along 
 do you know that fat pierre who sat opposite me is so funny said natasha stopping suddenly i feel so happy 
 and she set off at a run along the passage 
 sonya shaking off some down which clung to her and tucking away the verses in the bosom of her dress close to her bony little chest ran after natasha down the passage into the sitting room with flushed face and light joyous steps at the visitors request the young people sang the quartette the brook with which everyone was delighted then nicholas sang a song he had just learned 
 at nighttime in the fair glow 
 how sweet as fancies wander free 
 to feel that in this world one 
 who still is thinking but of thee 
 that while her fingers touch the harp 
 wafting sweet music music the lea 
 it is for thee thus swells her heart 
 sighing its message out to thee 
 a day or two then bliss unspoilt 
 but oh till then i cannot live 
 he had not finished the last verse before the young people began to get ready to dance in the large hall and the sound of the feet and the coughing of the musicians were heard from the gallery 
 pierre was sitting in the where shinshin had engaged him as a man recently returned from abroad in a political conversation in which several others joined but which bored pierre when the music began natasha came in and walking straight up to pierre said laughing and blushing 
 mamma told me to ask you to join the dancers 
 i am afraid of mixing the figures pierre replied but if you will be my teacher and lowering his big arm he offered it to the slender little girl 
 while the couples were arranging themselves and the musicians tuning up pierre sat down with his little partner natasha was perfectly happy she was dancing with a man who had been abroad she was sitting in a conspicuous place and talking to him like a lady she had a fan in her hand that one of the ladies had given her to hold assuming quite the pose of a society woman heaven knows when and where she had learned it she talked with her partner fanning herself and smiling over the fan 
 dear dear just look at her exclaimed the countess as she crossed the ballroom pointing to natasha 
 natasha blushed and laughed 
 well really mamma why should you what is there to be surprised at 
 in the midst of the third ecossaise there was a clatter of chairs being pushed back in the sitting room where the count and marya dmitrievna had been playing cards with the majority of the more distinguished and older visitors they now stretching themselves after sitting so long and replacing their purses and pocketbooks entered the ballroom first came marya dmitrievna and the count both with merry countenances the count with playful ceremony somewhat in ballet style offered his bent arm to marya dmitrievna he drew himself up a smile of debonair gallantry lit up his face and as soon as the last figure of the ecossaise was ended he clapped his hands to the musicians and shouted up to their gallery addressing the first violin 
 semen do you know the daniel cooper 
 this was the favorite dance which he had danced in his youth strictly speaking daniel cooper was one figure of the anglaise 
 look at papa shouted natasha to the whole company and quite forgetting that she was dancing with a partner she bent her curly head to her knees and made the whole room ring with her laughter 
 and indeed everybody in the room looked with a smile of pleasure at the jovial old gentleman who standing beside his tall and stout partner marya dmitrievna curved his arms beat time straightened his shoulders turned out his toes tapped gently with his foot and by a smile that broadened his round face more and more prepared the onlookers for what was to follow as soon as the provocatively gay strains of daniel cooper somewhat resembling those of a merry peasant dance began to sound all the doorways of the ballroom were suddenly filled by the domestic serfs the men on one side and the women on the other who with beaming faces had come to see their master making merry 
 just look at the master a regular eagle he is loudly remarked the nurse as she stood in one of the doorways 
 the count danced well and knew it but his partner could not and did not want to dance well her enormous figure stood erect her powerful arms hanging down she had handed her reticule to the countess and only her stern but handsome face really joined in the dance what was expressed by the whole of the plump figure in marya dmitrievna found expression only in her more and more beaming face and quivering nose but if the count getting more and more into the swing of it charmed the spectators by the unexpectedness of his adroit maneuvers and the agility with which he capered about on his light feet marya dmitrievna produced no less impression by slight exertions the least effort to move her shoulders or bend her arms when turning or stamp her foot which everyone appreciated in view of her size and habitual severity the dance grew livelier and livelier the other couples could not attract a attention to their own evolutions and did not even try to do so all were watching the count and marya dmitrievna natasha kept pulling everyone by sleeve or dress urging them to look at papa though as it was they never took their eyes off the couple in the intervals of the dance the count breathing deeply waved and shouted to the musicians to play faster faster faster and faster lightly more lightly and yet more lightly whirled the count flying round marya dmitrievna now on his toes now on his heels until turning his partner round to her seat he executed the final pas raising his soft foot backwards bowing his perspiring head smiling and making a wide sweep with his arm amid a thunder of applause and laughter led by natasha both partners stood still breathing heavily and wiping their faces with their cambric handkerchiefs 
 how we used to dance in our time ma chere said the count 
 that was a daniel cooper exclaimed marya dmitrievna tucking up her sleeves and puffing heavily

 sonya shaking off some down which clung to her and tucking away the verses in the bosom of her dress close to her bony little chest ran after natasha down the passage into the sitting room with flushed face and light joyous steps at the visitors request the young people sang the quartette the brook with which everyone was delighted then nicholas sang a song he had just learned 
 at nighttime in the fair glow 
 how sweet as fancies wander free 
 to feel that in this world one 
 who still is thinking but of thee 
 that while her fingers touch the harp 
 wafting sweet music music the lea 
 it is for thee thus swells her heart 
 sighing its message out to thee 
 a day or two then bliss unspoilt 
 but oh till then i cannot live 
 he had not finished the last verse before the young people began to get ready to dance in the large hall and the sound of the feet and the coughing of the musicians were heard from the gallery 
 pierre was sitting in the where shinshin had engaged him as a man recently returned from abroad in a political conversation in which several others joined but which bored pierre when the music began natasha came in and walking straight up to pierre said laughing and blushing 
 mamma told me to ask you to join the dancers 
 i am afraid of mixing the figures pierre replied but if you will be my teacher and lowering his big arm he offered it to the slender little girl 
 while the couples were arranging themselves and the musicians tuning up pierre sat down with his little partner natasha was perfectly happy she was dancing with a man who had been abroad she was sitting in a conspicuous place and talking to him like a lady she had a fan in her hand that one of the ladies had given her to hold assuming quite the pose of a society woman heaven knows when and where she had learned it she talked with her partner fanning herself and smiling over the fan 
 dear dear just look at her exclaimed the countess as she crossed the ballroom pointing to natasha 
 natasha blushed and laughed 
 well really mamma why should you what is there to be surprised at 
 in the midst of the third ecossaise there was a clatter of chairs being pushed back in the sitting room where the count and marya dmitrievna had been playing cards with the majority of the more distinguished and older visitors they now stretching themselves after sitting so long and replacing their purses and pocketbooks entered the ballroom first came marya dmitrievna and the count both with merry countenances the count with playful ceremony somewhat in ballet style offered his bent arm to marya dmitrievna he drew himself up a smile of debonair gallantry lit up his face and as soon as the last figure of the ecossaise was ended he clapped his hands to the musicians and shouted up to their gallery addressing the first violin 
 semen do you know the daniel cooper 
 this was the favorite dance which he had danced in his youth strictly speaking daniel cooper was one figure of the anglaise 
 look at papa shouted natasha to the whole company and quite forgetting that she was dancing with a partner she bent her curly head to her knees and made the whole room ring with her laughter 
 and indeed everybody in the room looked with a smile of pleasure at the jovial old gentleman who standing beside his tall and stout partner marya dmitrievna curved his arms beat time straightened his shoulders turned out his toes tapped gently with his foot and by a smile that broadened his round face more and more prepared the onlookers for what was to follow as soon as the provocatively gay strains of daniel cooper somewhat resembling those of a merry peasant dance began to sound all the doorways of the ballroom were suddenly filled by the domestic serfs the men on one side and the women on the other who with beaming faces had come to see their master making merry 
 just look at the master a regular eagle he is loudly remarked the nurse as she stood in one of the doorways 
 the count danced well and knew it but his partner could not and did not want to dance well her enormous figure stood erect her powerful arms hanging down she had handed her reticule to the countess and only her stern but handsome face really joined in the dance what was expressed by the whole of the plump figure in marya dmitrievna found expression only in her more and more beaming face and quivering nose but if the count getting more and more into the swing of it charmed the spectators by the unexpectedness of his adroit maneuvers and the agility with which he capered about on his light feet marya dmitrievna produced no less impression by slight exertions the least effort to move her shoulders or bend her arms when turning or stamp her foot which everyone appreciated in view of her size and habitual severity the dance grew livelier and livelier the other couples could not attract a attention to their own evolutions and did not even try to do so all were watching the count and marya dmitrievna natasha kept pulling everyone by sleeve or dress urging them to look at papa though as it was they never took their eyes off the couple in the intervals of the dance the count breathing deeply waved and shouted to the musicians to play faster faster faster and faster lightly more lightly and yet more lightly whirled the count flying round marya dmitrievna now on his toes now on his heels until turning his partner round to her seat he executed the final pas raising his soft foot backwards bowing his perspiring head smiling and making a wide sweep with his arm amid a thunder of applause and laughter led by natasha both partners stood still breathing heavily and wiping their faces with their cambric handkerchiefs 
 how we used to dance in our time ma chere said the count 
 that was a daniel cooper exclaimed marya dmitrievna tucking up her sleeves and puffing heavily

 chapter 
 
 to obviate the danger of this threat being fulfilled mr linton commissioned me to take the boy home early on pony and said he as we shall now have no influence over his destiny good or bad you must say nothing of where he is gone to my daughter she cannot associate with him hereafter and it is better for her to remain in ignorance of his proximity lest she should be restless and anxious to visit the heights merely tell her his father sent for him suddenly and he has been obliged to leave us 
 linton was very reluctant to be roused from his bed at five and astonished to be informed that he must prepare for further travelling but i softened off the matter by stating that he was going to spend some time with his father mr heathcliff who wished to see him so much he did not like to defer the pleasure till he should recover from his late journey 
 my father he cried in strange perplexity mamma never told me i had a father where does he live rather stay with uncle 
 he lives a little distance from the grange i replied just beyond those hills not so far but you may walk over here when you get hearty and you should be glad to go home and to see him you must try to love him as you did your mother and then he will love you 
 but why have i not heard of him before asked linton why mamma and he live together as other people do 
 he had business to keep him in the north i answered and your health required her to reside in the south 
 and why mamma speak to me about him persevered the child she often talked of uncle and i learnt to love him long ago how am i to love papa i know him 
 oh all children love their parents i said your mother perhaps thought you would want to be with him if she mentioned him often to you let us make haste an early ride on such a beautiful morning is much preferable to an more sleep 
 is she to go with us he demanded the little girl i saw yesterday replied i 
 is uncle he continued 
 no i shall be your companion there i said 
 linton sank back on his pillow and fell into a brown study 
 i go without uncle he cried at length i tell where you mean to take me 
 i attempted to persuade him of the naughtiness of showing reluctance to meet his father still he obstinately resisted any progress towards dressing and i had to call for my assistance in coaxing him out of bed the poor thing was finally got off with several delusive assurances that his absence should be short that mr edgar and cathy would visit him and other promises equally which i invented and reiterated at intervals throughout the way the pure air and the bright sunshine and the gentle canter of minny relieved his despondency after a while he began to put questions concerning his new home and its inhabitants with greater interest and liveliness 
 is wuthering heights as pleasant a place as thrushcross grange he inquired turning to take a last glance into the valley whence a light mist mounted and formed a fleecy cloud on the skirts of the blue 
 it is not so buried in trees i replied and it is not quite so large but you can see the country beautifully all round and the air is healthier for and dryer you will perhaps think the building old and dark at first though it is a respectable house the next best in the neighbourhood and you will have such nice rambles on the moors hareton is miss other cousin and so yours in a show you all the sweetest spots and you can bring a book in fine weather and make a green hollow your study and now and then your uncle may join you in a walk he does frequently walk out on the hills 
 and what is my father like he asked is he as young and handsome as uncle 
 as young said i but he has black hair and eyes and looks sterner and he is taller and bigger altogether not seem to you so gentle and kind at first perhaps because it is not his way still mind you be frank and cordial with him and naturally be fonder of you than any uncle for you are his own 
 black hair and eyes mused linton i fancy him then i am not like him am i 
 not much i answered not a morsel i thought surveying with regret the white complexion and slim frame of my companion and his large languid eyes save that unless a morbid touchiness kindled them a moment they had not a vestige of her sparkling spirit 
 how strange that he should never come to see mamma and me he murmured has he ever seen me if he have i must have been a baby i remember not a single thing about him 
 why master linton said i three hundred miles is a great distance and ten years seem very different in length to a person compared with what they do to you it is probable mr heathcliff proposed going from summer to summer but never found a convenient opportunity and now it is too late trouble him with questions on the subject it will disturb him for no good 
 the boy was fully occupied with his own cogitations for the remainder of the ride till we halted before the farmhouse garden gate i watched to catch his impressions in his countenance he surveyed the carved front and lattices the straggling gooseberry bushes and crooked firs with solemn intentness and then shook his head his private feelings entirely disapproved of the exterior of his new abode but he had sense to postpone complaining there might be compensation within before he dismounted i went and opened the door it was half past six the family had just finished breakfast the servant was clearing and wiping down the table joseph stood by his chair telling some tale concerning a lame horse and hareton was preparing for the hay field 
 hallo nelly cried mr heathcliff when he saw me i feared i should have to come down and fetch my property myself brought it have you let us see what we can make of it 
 he got up and strode to the door hareton and joseph followed in gaping curiosity poor linton ran a frightened eye over the faces of the three 
 said joseph after a grave inspection swopped wi ye maister an his lass 
 heathcliff having stared his son into an ague of confusion uttered a scornful laugh 
 god what a beauty what a lovely charming thing he exclaimed they reared it on snails and sour milk nelly oh damn my soul but worse than i the devil knows i was not sanguine 
 i bid the trembling and bewildered child get down and enter he did not thoroughly comprehend the meaning of his speech or whether it were intended for him indeed he was not yet certain that the grim sneering stranger was his father but he clung to me with growing trepidation and on mr taking a seat and bidding him come hither he hid his face on my shoulder and wept 
 tut tut said heathcliff stretching out a hand and dragging him roughly between his knees and then holding up his head by the chin none of that nonsense not going to hurt thee that thy name thou art thy child entirely where is my share in thee puling chicken 
 he took off the cap and pushed back his thick flaxen curls felt his slender arms and his small fingers during which examination linton ceased crying and lifted his great blue eyes to inspect the inspector 
 do you know me asked heathcliff having satisfied himself that the limbs were all equally frail and feeble 
 no said linton with a gaze of vacant fear 
 heard of me i dare say 
 no he replied again 
 no what a shame of your mother never to waken your filial regard for me you are my son then tell you and your mother was a wicked slut to leave you in ignorance of the sort of father you possessed now wince and colour up though it is something to see you have not white blood be a good lad and do for you nelly if you be tired you may sit down if not get home again i guess report what you hear and see to the cipher at the grange and this thing be settled while you linger about it 
 well replied i i hope be kind to the boy mr heathcliff or not keep him long and all you have akin in the wide world that you will ever 
 be very kind to him you fear he said laughing only nobody else must be kind to him jealous of monopolizing his affection and to begin my kindness joseph bring the lad some breakfast hareton you infernal calf begone to your work yes nell he added when they had departed my son is prospective owner of your place and i should not wish him to die till i was certain of being his successor besides mine and i want the triumph of seeing my descendant fairly lord of their estates my child hiring their children to till their lands for wages that is the sole consideration which can make me endure the whelp i despise him for himself and hate him for the memories he revives but that consideration is sufficient as safe with me and shall be tended as carefully as your master tends his own i have a room upstairs furnished for him in handsome style engaged a tutor also to come three times a week from twenty miles distance to teach him what he pleases to learn ordered hareton to obey him and in fact arranged everything with a view to preserve the superior and the gentleman in him above his associates i do regret however that he so little deserves the trouble if i wished any blessing in the world it was to find him a worthy object of pride and bitterly disappointed with the whining wretch 
 while he was speaking joseph returned bearing a basin of milk porridge and placed it before linton he stirred round the homely mess with a look of aversion and affirmed he could not eat it i saw the old manservant shared largely in his scorn of the child though he was compelled to retain the sentiment in his heart because heathcliff plainly meant his underlings to hold him in honour 
 cannot ate it repeated he peering in face and subduing his voice to a whisper for fear of being overheard but maister hareton nivir ate naught else when he wer a little un and what were gooid eneugh for gooid eneugh for ye rayther think

 what should ail them he said 
 wah answered joseph yon dainty chap says he cannut ate em but aw guess raight his mother wer just wer too mucky to sow t corn for makking her breead

 then the latch was raised and fell they did not suffer him to come forth i mounted minny and urged her to a trot and so my brief guardianship ended

 chapter twenty 
 
 i think i have any words in which to tell the meeting of the mother and daughters such hours are beautiful to live but very hard to describe so i will leave it to the imagination of my readers merely saying that the house was full of genuine happiness and that tender hope was realized for when beth woke from that long healing sleep the first objects on which her eyes fell were the little rose and face too weak to wonder at anything she only smiled and nestled close in the loving arms about her feeling that the hungry longing was satisfied at last then she slept again and the girls waited upon their mother for she would not unclasp the thin hand which clung to hers even in sleep 
 hannah had dished up and astonishing breakfast for the traveler finding it impossible to vent her excitement in any other way and meg and jo fed their mother like dutiful young storks while they listened to her whispered account of state mr promise to stay and nurse him the delays which the storm occasioned on the homeward journey and the unspeakable comfort hopeful face had given her when she arrived worn out with fatigue anxiety and cold 
 
 what a strange yet pleasant day that was so brilliant and gay without for all the world seemed abroad to welcome the first snow so quiet and reposeful within for everyone slept spent with watching and a sabbath stillness reigned through the house while nodding hannah mounted guard at the door with a blissful sense of burdens lifted off meg and jo closed their weary eyes and lay at rest like boats safe at anchor in a quiet harbor mrs march would not leave side but rested in the big chair waking often to look at touch and brood over her child like a miser over some recovered treasure laurie meanwhile posted off to comfort amy and told his story so well that aunt march actually sniffed herself and never once said i told you so amy came out so strong on this occasion that i think the good thoughts in the little chapel really began to bear fruit she dried her tears quickly restrained her impatience to see her mother and never even thought of the turquoise ring when the old lady heartily agreed in opinion that she behaved like a capital little woman even polly seemed impressed for he called her a good girl blessed her buttons and begged her to come and take a walk dear in his most affable tone she would very gladly have gone out to enjoy the bright wintry weather but discovering that laurie was dropping with sleep in spite of manful efforts to conceal the fact she persuaded him to rest on the sofa while she wrote a note to her mother she was a long time about it and when she returned he was stretched out with both arms under his head sound asleep while aunt march had pulled down the curtains and sat doing nothing in an unusual fit of benignity 
 after a while they began to think he was not going to wake up till night and not sure that he would had he not been effectually roused by cry of joy at sight of her mother 
 there probably were a good many happy little girls in and about the city that day but it is my private opinion that amy was the happiest of all when she sat in her lap and told her trials receiving consolation and compensation in the shape of approving smiles and fond caresses they were alone together in the chapel to which her mother did not object when its purpose was explained to her 
 
 on the contrary i like it very much dear looking from the dusty rosary to the little book and the lovely picture with its garland of evergreen it is an excellent plan to have some place where we can go to be quiet when things vex or grieve us there are a good many hard times in this life of ours but we can always bear them if we ask help in the right way i think my little girl is learning this 
 
 yes mother and when i go home i mean to have a corner in the big closet to put my books and the copy of that picture which tried to make the face is not good too beautiful for me to draw but the baby is done better and i love it very much i like to think he was a little child once for then i seem so far away and that helps me 
 as amy pointed to the smiling christ child on his knee mrs march saw something on the lifted hand that made her smile she said nothing but amy understood the look and after a pause she added gravely i wanted to speak to you about this but i forgot it aunt gave me the ring today she called me to her and kissed me and put it on my finger and said i was a credit to her and like to keep me always she gave that funny guard to keep the turquoise on as too big like to wear them mother can i 
 they are very pretty but i think rather too young for such ornaments amy said mrs march looking at the plump little hand with the band of stones on the forefinger and the quaint guard formed of two tiny golden hands clasped together 
 try not to be vain said amy i think i like it only because so pretty but i want to wear it as the girl in the story wore her bracelet to remind me of something 
 do you mean aunt march asked her mother laughing 
 no to remind me not to be selfish amy looked so earnest and sincere about it that her mother stopped laughing and listened respectfully to the little plan 
 thought a great deal lately about my bundle of naughties and being selfish is the largest one in it so going to try hard to cure it if i can beth selfish and the reason everyone loves her and feels so bad at the thoughts of losing her people feel so bat about me if i was sick and i deserve to have them but like to be loved and missed by a great many friends so going to try and be like beth all i can apt to forget my resolutions but if i had something always about me to remind me i guess i should do better may we try this way 
 yes but i have more faith in the corner of the big closet wear your ring dear and do your best i think you will prosper for the sincere wish to be good is half the battle now i must go back to beth keep up your heart little daughter and we will soon have you home again 
 that evening while meg was writing to her father to report the safe arrival jo slipped upstairs into room and finding her mother in her usual place stood a minute twisting her fingers in her hair with a worried gesture and an undecided look 
 what is it deary asked mrs march holding out her hand with a face which invited confidence 
 i want to tell you something mother 
 about meg 
 how quickly you guessed yes about her and though a little thing it fidgets me 
 beth is asleep speak low and tell me all about it that moffat been here i hope asked mrs march rather sharply 
 no i should have shut the door in his face if he had said jo settling herself on the floor at her feet last summer meg left a pair of gloves over at the laurences and only one was returned we forgot about it till teddy told me that mr brooke owned that he liked meg but dare say so she was so young and he so poor now it a dreadful state of things 
 do you think meg cares for him asked mrs march with an anxious look 
 mercy me i know anything about love and such nonsense cried jo with a funny mixture of interest and contempt in novels the girls show it by starting and blushing faintingaway growing thin and acting like fools now meg does not doanything of the sort she eats and drinks and sleeps like a sensible creature she looks straight in my face when i talk about that man and only blushes a little bit when teddy jokes about lovers i forbid him to do it but he mind me as he ought 
 then you fancy that meg is not interested in john 
 who cried jo staring 
 mr brooke i call him john now we fell into the way of doing so at the hospital and he likes it 
 oh dear i know take his part been good to father and you send him away but let meg marry him if she wants to mean thing to go petting papa and helping you just to wheedle you into liking him and jo pulled her hair again with a wrathful tweak 
 my dear get angry about it and i will tell you how it happened john went with me at mr request and was so devoted to poor father that we help getting fond of him he was perfectly open and honorable about meg for he told us he loved her but would earn a comfortable home before he asked her to marry him he only wanted our leave to love her and work for her and the right to make her love him if he could he is a truly excellent young man and we could not refuse to listen to him but i will not consent to engaging herself so young 
 of course not it would be idiotic i knew there was mischief brewing i felt it and now worse than i imagined i just wish i could marry meg myself and keep her safe in the family 
 this odd arrangement made mrs march smile but she said gravely jo i confide in you and wish you to say anything to meg yet when john comes back and i see them together i can judge better of her feelings toward him 
 see those handsome eyes that she talks about and then it will be all up with her got such a soft heart it will melt like butter in the sun if anyone looks sentimentlly at her she read the short reports he sent more than she did your letters and pinched me when i spoke of it and likes brown eyes and think john an ugly name and go and fall in love and an end of peace and fun and cozy times together i see it all go lovering around the house and we shall have to dodge meg will be absorbed and no good to me any more brooke will scratch up a fortune somehow carry her off and make a hole in the family and i shall break my heart and everything will be abominably uncomfortable oh dear me why we all boys then there be any bother 
 jo leaned her chin on her knees in a disconsolate attitude and shook her fist at the reprehensible john mrs march sighed and jo looked up with an air of relief 
 you like it mother glad of it send him about his business and not tell meg a word of it but all be happy together as we always have been 
 i did wrong to sigh jo it is natural and right you should all go to homes of your own in time but i do want to keep my girls as long as i can and i am sorry that this happened so soon for meg is only seventeen and it will be some years before john can make a home for her your father and i have agreed that she shall not bind herself in any way nor be married before twenty if she and john love one another they can wait and test the love by doing so she is conscientious and i have no fear of her treating him unkindly my pretty tender hearted girl i hope things will go happily with her 
 you rather have her marry a rich man asked jo as her voice faltered a little over the last words 
 money is a good and useful thing jo and i hope my girls will never feel the need of it too bitterly not be tempted by too much i should like to know that john was firmly established in some good business which gave him an income large enough to keep free from debt and make meg comfortable not ambitious for a splendid fortune a fashionable position or a great name for my girls if rank and money come with love and virtue also i should accept them gratefully and enjoy your good fortune but i know by experience how much genuine happiness can be had in a plain little house where the daily bread is earned and some privations give sweetness to the few pleasures i am content to see meg begin humbly for if i am not mistaken she will be rich in the possession of a good heart and that is better than a fortune 
 i understand mother and quite agree but disappointed about meg for planned to have her marry teddy and sit in the lap of luxury all her days it be nice asked jo looking up with a brighter face 
 he is younger than she you know began mrs march but jo broke in 
 only a little old for his age and tall and can be quite in his manners if he likes then rich and generous and good and loves us all and i say a pity my plan is spoiled

 well i but i hate to see things going all crisscross and getting snarled up when a pull her and a snip there would straighten it out i wish wearing flatirons on our heads would keep us from growing up but buds will be roses and kittens cats the pity 
 that about flatirons and cats asked meg as she crept into the room with the finished letter in her hand 
 only one of my stupid speeches going to bed come peggy said jo unfolding herself like an animated puzzle 
 quite right and beautifully written please add that i send my love to john said mrs march as she glanced over the letter and gave it back

 chapter twenty 
 
 i think i have any words in which to tell the meeting of the mother and daughters such hours are beautiful to live but very hard to describe so i will leave it to the imagination of my readers merely saying that the house was full of genuine happiness and that tender hope was realized for when beth woke from that long healing sleep the first objects on which her eyes fell were the little rose and face too weak to wonder at anything she only smiled and nestled close in the loving arms about her feeling that the hungry longing was satisfied at last then she slept again and the girls waited upon their mother for she would not unclasp the thin hand which clung to hers even in sleep 
 hannah had dished up and astonishing breakfast for the traveler finding it impossible to vent her excitement in any other way and meg and jo fed their mother like dutiful young storks while they listened to her whispered account of state mr promise to stay and nurse him the delays which the storm occasioned on the homeward journey and the unspeakable comfort hopeful face had given her when she arrived worn out with fatigue anxiety and cold 
 
 what a strange yet pleasant day that was so brilliant and gay without for all the world seemed abroad to welcome the first snow so quiet and reposeful within for everyone slept spent with watching and a sabbath stillness reigned through the house while nodding hannah mounted guard at the door with a blissful sense of burdens lifted off meg and jo closed their weary eyes and lay at rest like boats safe at anchor in a quiet harbor mrs march would not leave side but rested in the big chair waking often to look at touch and brood over her child like a miser over some recovered treasure laurie meanwhile posted off to comfort amy and told his story so well that aunt march actually sniffed herself and never once said i told you so amy came out so strong on this occasion that i think the good thoughts in the little chapel really began to bear fruit she dried her tears quickly restrained her impatience to see her mother and never even thought of the turquoise ring when the old lady heartily agreed in opinion that she behaved like a capital little woman even polly seemed impressed for he called her a good girl blessed her buttons and begged her to come and take a walk dear in his most affable tone she would very gladly have gone out to enjoy the bright wintry weather but discovering that laurie was dropping with sleep in spite of manful efforts to conceal the fact she persuaded him to rest on the sofa while she wrote a note to her mother she was a long time about it and when she returned he was stretched out with both arms under his head sound asleep while aunt march had pulled down the curtains and sat doing nothing in an unusual fit of benignity 
 after a while they began to think he was not going to wake up till night and not sure that he would had he not been effectually roused by cry of joy at sight of her mother 
 there probably were a good many happy little girls in and about the city that day but it is my private opinion that amy was the happiest of all when she sat in her lap and told her trials receiving consolation and compensation in the shape of approving smiles and fond caresses they were alone together in the chapel to which her mother did not object when its purpose was explained to her 
 
 on the contrary i like it very much dear looking from the dusty rosary to the little book and the lovely picture with its garland of evergreen it is an excellent plan to have some place where we can go to be quiet when things vex or grieve us there are a good many hard times in this life of ours but we can always bear them if we ask help in the right way i think my little girl is learning this 
 
 yes mother and when i go home i mean to have a corner in the big closet to put my books and the copy of that picture which tried to make the face is not good too beautiful for me to draw but the baby is done better and i love it very much i like to think he was a little child once for then i seem so far away and that helps me 
 as amy pointed to the smiling christ child on his knee mrs march saw something on the lifted hand that made her smile she said nothing but amy understood the look and after a pause she added gravely i wanted to speak to you about this but i forgot it aunt gave me the ring today she called me to her and kissed me and put it on my finger and said i was a credit to her and like to keep me always she gave that funny guard to keep the turquoise on as too big like to wear them mother can i 
 they are very pretty but i think rather too young for such ornaments amy said mrs march looking at the plump little hand with the band of stones on the forefinger and the quaint guard formed of two tiny golden hands clasped together 
 try not to be vain said amy i think i like it only because so pretty but i want to wear it as the girl in the story wore her bracelet to remind me of something 
 do you mean aunt march asked her mother laughing 
 no to remind me not to be selfish amy looked so earnest and sincere about it that her mother stopped laughing and listened respectfully to the little plan 
 thought a great deal lately about my bundle of naughties and being selfish is the largest one in it so going to try hard to cure it if i can beth selfish and the reason everyone loves her and feels so bad at the thoughts of losing her people feel so bat about me if i was sick and i deserve to have them but like to be loved and missed by a great many friends so going to try and be like beth all i can apt to forget my resolutions but if i had something always about me to remind me i guess i should do better may we try this way 
 yes but i have more faith in the corner of the big closet wear your ring dear and do your best i think you will prosper for the sincere wish to be good is half the battle now i must go back to beth keep up your heart little daughter and we will soon have you home again 
 that evening while meg was writing to her father to report the safe arrival jo slipped upstairs into room and finding her mother in her usual place stood a minute twisting her fingers in her hair with a worried gesture and an undecided look 
 what is it deary asked mrs march holding out her hand with a face which invited confidence 
 i want to tell you something mother 
 about meg 
 how quickly you guessed yes about her and though a little thing it fidgets me 
 beth is asleep speak low and tell me all about it that moffat been here i hope asked mrs march rather sharply 
 no i should have shut the door in his face if he had said jo settling herself on the floor at her feet last summer meg left a pair of gloves over at the laurences and only one was returned we forgot about it till teddy told me that mr brooke owned that he liked meg but dare say so she was so young and he so poor now it a dreadful state of things 
 do you think meg cares for him asked mrs march with an anxious look 
 mercy me i know anything about love and such nonsense cried jo with a funny mixture of interest and contempt in novels the girls show it by starting and blushing faintingaway growing thin and acting like fools now meg does not doanything of the sort she eats and drinks and sleeps like a sensible creature she looks straight in my face when i talk about that man and only blushes a little bit when teddy jokes about lovers i forbid him to do it but he mind me as he ought 
 then you fancy that meg is not interested in john 
 who cried jo staring 
 mr brooke i call him john now we fell into the way of doing so at the hospital and he likes it 
 oh dear i know take his part been good to father and you send him away but let meg marry him if she wants to mean thing to go petting papa and helping you just to wheedle you into liking him and jo pulled her hair again with a wrathful tweak 
 my dear get angry about it and i will tell you how it happened john went with me at mr request and was so devoted to poor father that we help getting fond of him he was perfectly open and honorable about meg for he told us he loved her but would earn a comfortable home before he asked her to marry him he only wanted our leave to love her and work for her and the right to make her love him if he could he is a truly excellent young man and we could not refuse to listen to him but i will not consent to engaging herself so young 
 of course not it would be idiotic i knew there was mischief brewing i felt it and now worse than i imagined i just wish i could marry meg myself and keep her safe in the family 
 this odd arrangement made mrs march smile but she said gravely jo i confide in you and wish you to say anything to meg yet when john comes back and i see them together i can judge better of her feelings toward him 
 see those handsome eyes that she talks about and then it will be all up with her got such a soft heart it will melt like butter in the sun if anyone looks sentimentlly at her she read the short reports he sent more than she did your letters and pinched me when i spoke of it and likes brown eyes and think john an ugly name and go and fall in love and an end of peace and fun and cozy times together i see it all go lovering around the house and we shall have to dodge meg will be absorbed and no good to me any more brooke will scratch up a fortune somehow carry her off and make a hole in the family and i shall break my heart and everything will be abominably uncomfortable oh dear me why we all boys then there be any bother 
 jo leaned her chin on her knees in a disconsolate attitude and shook her fist at the reprehensible john mrs march sighed and jo looked up with an air of relief 
 you like it mother glad of it send him about his business and not tell meg a word of it but all be happy together as we always have been

 yes said black but also i know if anyone ever told you your godfather 
 
 yeah i knew that said harry 
 
 well your parents appointed me your guardian said black stiffly if anything happened to them 
 
 harry waited did black mean what he thought he meant 
 
 understand of course if you want to stay with your aunt and uncle said black but well think about it once my cleared if you wanted a a different home 
 
 some sort of explosion took place in the pit of stomach 
 
 what live with you he said accidentally cracking his head on a bit of rock protruding from the ceiling leave the dursleys 
 
 of course i thought you want to said black quickly i understand i just thought 
 
 are you insane said harry his voice easily as croaky as of course i want to leave the dursleys have you got a house when can i move in 
 
 black turned right around to look at him head was scraping the ceiling but black seem to care 
 
 you want to he said you mean it 
 
 yeah i mean it said harry 
 
 gaunt face broke into the first true smile harry had seen upon it the difference it made was startling as though a person ten years younger were shining through the starved mask for a moment he was recognizable as the man who had laughed at parents wedding 
 
 they did not speak again until they had reached the end of the tunnel crookshanks darted up first he had evidently pressed his paw to the knot on the trunk because lupin pettigrew and ron clambered upward without any sound of savaging branches 
 
 black saw snape up through the hole then stood back for harry and hermione to pass at last all of them were out 
 
 the grounds were very dark now the only light came from the distant windows of the castle without a word they set off pettigrew was still wheezing and occasionally whimpering mind was buzzing he was going to leave the dursleys he was going to live with sirius black his parents best friend he felt dazed what would happen when he told the dursleys he was going to live with the convict seen on television 
 
 one wrong move peter said lupin threateningly ahead his wand was still pointed sideways at chest 
 
 silently they tramped through the grounds the castle lights growing slowly larger snape was still drifting weirdly ahead of black his chin bumping on his chest and then 
 
 a cloud shifted there were suddenly dim shadows on the ground their party was bathed in moonlight 
 
 snape collided with lupin pettigrew and ron who had stopped abruptly black froze he flung out one arm to make harry and hermione stop 
 
 harry could see silhouette he had gone rigid then his limbs began to shake 
 
 oh my hermione gasped he take his potion tonight not safe 
 
 run black whispered run now 
 
 but harry run ron was chained to pettigrew and lupin he leapt forward but black caught him around the chest and threw him back 
 
 leave it to me run 
 
 there was a terrible snarling noise head was lengthening so was his body his shoulders were hunching hair was sprouting visibly on his face and hands which were curling into clawed paws hair was on end again he was backing away 
 
 as the werewolf reared snapping its long jaws sirius disappeared from side he had transformed the enormous bearlike dog bounded forward as the werewolf wrenched itself free of the manacle binding it the dog seized it about the neck and pulled it backward away from ron and pettigrew they were locked jaw to jaw claws ripping at each other 
 
 harry stood transfixed by the sight too intent upon the battle to notice anything else it was scream that alerted him 
 
 pettigrew had dived for dropped wand ron unsteady on his bandaged leg fell there was a bang a burst of light and ron lay motionless on the ground another bang crookshanks flew into the air and back to the earth in a heap 
 
 expelliarmus harry yelled pointing his own wand at pettigrew wand flew high into the air and out of sight stay where you are harry shouted running forward 
 
 too late pettigrew had transformed harry saw his bald tail whip through the manacle on outstretched arm and heard a scurrying through the grass 
 
 there was a howl and a rumbling growl harry turned to see the werewolf taking flight it was galloping into the forest 
 
 sirius gone pettigrew transformed harry yelled 
 
 black was bleeding there were gashes across his muzzle and back but at words he scrambled up again and in an instant the sound of his paws faded to silence as he pounded away across the grounds 
 
 harry and hermione dashed over to ron 
 
 what did he do to him hermione whispered eyes were only his mouth hung open he was definitely alive they could hear him breathing but he seem to recognize them 
 
 i know 
 
 harry looked desperately around black and lupin both gone they had no one but snape for company still hanging unconscious in midair 
 
 better get them up to the castle and tell someone said harry pushing his hair out of his eyes trying to think straight come 
 
 but then from beyond the range of their vision they heard a yelping a whining a dog in pain 
 
 sirius harry muttered staring into the darkness 
 
 he had a indecision but there was nothing they could do for ron at the moment and by the sound of it black was in trouble 
 
 harry set off at a run hermione right behind him the yelping seemed to be coming from the ground near the edge of the lake they pelted toward it and harry running flat out felt the cold without realizing what it must mean 
 
 the yelping stopped abruptly as they reached the lakeshore they saw why sirius had turned back into a man he was crouched on all fours his hands over his head 
 
 nooo he moaned nooo please 
 
 and then harry saw them dementors at least a hundred of them gliding in a black mass around the lake toward them he spun around the familiar icy cold penetrating his insides fog starting to obscure his vision more were appearing out of the darkness on every side they were encircling them 
 
 hermione think of something happy harry yelled raising his wand blinking furiously to try and clear his vision shaking his head to rid it of the faint screaming that had started inside it 
 
 going to live with my godfather leaving the dursleys 
 
 he forced himself to think of black and only black and began to chant expecto patronum expecto patronum 
 
 black gave a shudder rolled over and lay motionless on the ground pale as death 
 
 be all right going to go and live with him 
 
 expecto patronum hermione help me expecto patronum 
 
 expecto hermione whispered expecto expecto 
 
 but she do it the dementors were closing in barely ten feet from them they formed a solid wall around harry and hermione and were getting closer 
 
 expecto patronum harry yelled trying to blot the screaming from his ears expecto patronum 
 
 a thin wisp of silver escaped his wand and hovered like mist before him at the same moment harry felt hermione collapse next to him he was alone completely alone 
 
 expecto expecto patronum 
 
 harry felt his knees hit the cold grass fog was clouding his eyes with a huge effort he fought to remember sirius was innocent innocent be okay going to live with him 
 
 expecto patronum he gasped 
 
 by the feeble light of his formless patronus he saw a dementor halt very close to him it walk through the cloud of silver mist harry had conjured a dead slimy hand slid out from under the cloak it made a gesture as though to sweep the patronus aside 
 
 no no harry gasped innocent expecto expecto patronum 
 
 he could feet them watching him hear their rattling breath like an evil wind around him the nearest dementor seemed to be considering him then it raised both its rotting hands and lowered its hood 
 
 where there should have been eyes there was only thin gray scabbed skin stretched blankly over empty sockets but there was a mouth a gaping shapeless hole sucking the air with the sound of a death rattle 
 
 a paralyzing terror filled harry so that he move or speak his patronus flickered and died 
 
 white fog was blinding him he had to fight expecto patronum he see and in the distance he heard the familiar screaming expecto patronum he groped in the mist for sirius and found his arm they going to take him 
 
 but a pair of strong clammy hands suddenly attached themselves around neck they were forcing his face upward he could feel its breath it was going to get rid of him first he could feel its putrid breath his mother was screaming in his ears she was going to be the last thing he ever heard 
 
 and then through the fog that was drowning him he thought he saw a silvery light growing brighter and brighter he felt himself fall forward onto the grass facedown too weak to move sick and shaking harry opened his eyes the dementor must have released him the blinding light was illuminating the grass around himthe screaming had stopped the cold was ebbing away 
 
 something was driving the dementors back it was circling around him and black and hermione they were leaving 
 
 the air was warm again 
 
 with every ounce of strength he could muster harry raised his head a few inches and saw an animal amid the light galloping away across the lake eyes blurred with sweat harry tried to make out what it was it was as bright as a unicorn fighting to stay conscious harry watched it to a halt as it reached the opposite shore for a moment harry saw by its brightness somebody welcoming it back raising his hand to pat it someone who looked strangely familiar but it be 
 
 harry understand he think anymore he felt the last of his strength leave him and his head hit the ground as he fainted

 harry had never been part of a stranger group crookshanks led the way down the stairs lupin pettigrew and ron went next looking like entrants in a race next came professor snape drifting creepily along his toes hitting each stair as they descended held up by his own wand which was being pointed at him by sirius harry and hermione brought up the rear 
 
 getting back into the tunnel was difficult lupin pettigrew and ron had to turn sideways to manage it lupin still had pettigrew covered with his wand harry could see them edging awkwardly along the tunnel in single file crookshanks was still in the lead harry went right after black who was still making snape drift along ahead of them he kept bumping his lolling head on the low ceiling harry had the impression black was making no effort to prevent this

lionfish nov chapter twenty the first taskcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 harry got up on sunday morning and dressed so inattentively that it was a while before he realized he was trying to pull his hat onto his foot instead of his sock when finally got all his clothes on the right parts of his body he hurried off to find hermione locating her at the gryffindor table in the great hall where she was eating breakfast with ginny feeling too queasy to eat harry waited until hermione had swallowed her last spoonful of porridge then dragged her out onto the grounds there he told her all about the dragons and about everything sirius had said while they took another long walk around the lake 
 
 alarmed as she was by warnings about karkaroff hermione still thought that the dragons were the more pressing problem 
 
 just try and keep you alive until tuesday evening she said desperately and then we can worry about karkaroff 
 
 they walked three times around the lake trying all the way to think of a simple spell that would subdue a dragon nothing whatsoever occurred to them so they retired to the library instead here harry pulled down every book he could find on dragons and both of them set to work searching through the large pile 
 
 by charmstreating this is no good this is for nutters like hagrid who want to keep them healthy 
 
 dragons are extremely difficult to slay owing to the ancient magic that imbues their thick hides which none but the most powerful spells can penetrate but sirius said a simple one would do it 
 
 try some simple spellbooks then said harry throwing aside men who love dragons too much 
 
 he returned to the table with a pile of spellbooks set them down and began to flick through each in turn hermione whispering nonstop at his elbow 
 
 well there are switching spellsbut the point of switching it unless you swapped its fangs for or something that would make it less trouble is like that book said not much is going to get through a say transfigure it but something that big you really got a hope i doubt even professor mcgonagallunless supposed to put the spell on yourself maybe to give yourself extra powers but not simple spells i mean we done any of those in class i only know about them because been doing practice papers 
 
 hermione harry said through gritted teeth will you shut up for a bit please i m trying to concentrate 
 
 but all that happened when hermione fell silent was that brain filled with a sort of blank buzzing which seem to allow room for concentration he stared hopelessly down the index of basic hexes for the busy and vexed instant scalpingbut dragons had no hairpepper breaththat would probably increase a firepowerhorn tonguejust what he needed to give it an extra weapon 
 
 oh no back again why he read on his stupid ship said hermione irritably as viktor krum slouched in cast a surly look over at the pair of them and settled himself in a distant corner with a pile of books come on harry go back to the common roomhis fan be here in a moment twittering away 
 
 and sure enough as they left the library a gang of girls tiptoed past them one of them wearing a bulgaria scarf tied around her waist 
 
 
 
 harry barely slept that night when he awoke on monday morning he seriously considered for the first time ever just running away from hogwarts but as he looked around the great hall at breakfast time and thought about what leaving the castle would mean he knew he do it it was the only place he had ever been happywell he supposed he must have been happy with his parents too but he remember that 
 
 somehow the knowledge that he would rather be here and facing a dragon than back on privet drive with dudley was good to know it made him feel slightly calmer he finished his bacon with difficulty his throat working too well and as he and hermione got up he saw cedric diggory leaving the hufflepuff table 
 
 cedric still know about the dragonsthe only champion who if harry was right in thinking that maxime and karkaroff would have told fleur and krum 
 
 hermione see you in the greenhouses harry said coming to his decision as he watched cedric leaving the hall go on catch you up 
 
 harry be late the about to ring 
 
 catch you up okay 
 
 by the time harry reached the bottom of the marble staircase cedric was at the top he was with a load of friends harry want to talk to cedric in front of them they were among those who had been quoting rita article at him every time he went near them he followed cedric at a distance and saw that he was heading toward the charms corridor this gave harry an idea pausing at a distance from them he pulled out his wand and took careful aim 
 
 diffindo 
 
 bag split parchment quills and books spilled out of it onto the floor several bottles of ink smashed 
 
 bother said cedric in an exasperated voice as his friends bent down to help him tell flitwick coming go on 
 
 this was exactly what harry had been hoping for he slipped his wand back into his robes waited until friends had disappeared into their classroom and hurried up the corridor which was now empty of everyone but himself and cedric 
 
 hi said cedric picking up a copy of a guide to advanced transfiguration that was now splattered with ink my bag just and all 
 
 cedric said harry the first task is dragons 
 
 what said cedric looking up 
 
 dragons said harry speaking quickly in case professor flitwick came out to see where cedric had got to got four one for each of us and got to get past them 
 
 cedric stared at him harry saw some of the panic been feeling since saturday night flickering in gray eyes 
 
 are you sure cedric said in a hushed voice 
 
 dead sure said harry seen them 
 
 but how did you find out not supposed to know 
 
 never mind said harry quickly he knew hagrid would be in trouble if he told the truth but not the only one who knows fleur and krum will know by now maxime and karkaroff both saw the dragons too 
 
 cedric straightened up his arms full of inky quills parchment and books his ripped bag dangling off one shoulder he stared at harry and there was a puzzled almost suspicious look in his eyes 
 
 why are you telling me he asked 
 
 harry looked at him in disbelief he was sure cedric have asked that if he had seen the dragons himself harry have let his worst enemy face those monsters unprepared well perhaps malfoy or snape 
 
 justfair it he said to cedric we all know on an even footing we 
 
 cedric was still hooking at him in a slightly suspicious way when harry heard a familiar clunking noise behind him he turned around and saw moody emerging from a nearby classroom 
 
 come with me potter he growled diggory off you go 
 
 harry stared apprehensively at moody had he overheard them 
 
 er professor supposed to be in herbology 
 
 never mind that potter in my office please 
 
 harry followed him wondering what was going to happen to him now what if moody wanted to know how found out about the dragons would moody go to dumbledore and tell on hagrid or just turn harry into a ferret well it might be easier to get past a dragon if he were a ferret harry thought dully be smaller much less easy to see from a height of fifty feet 
 
 he followed moody into his office moody closed the door behind them and turned to look at harry his magical eye fixed upon him as well as the normal one 
 
 that was a very decent thing you just did potter moody said quietly 
 
 harry know what to say this the reaction he had expected at all 
 
 sit down said moody and harry sat looking around 
 
 he had visited this office under two of its previous occupants in professor day the walls had been plastered with beaming winking pictures of professor lockhart himself when lupin had lived here you were more likely to come across a specimen of some fascinating new dark creature he had procured for them to study in class now however the office was full of a number of exceptionally odd objects that harry supposed moody had used in the days when he had been an auror 
 
 on his desk stood what looked hike a large cracked glass spinning top harry recognized it at once as a sneakoscope because he owned one himself though it was much smaller than in the corner on a small table stood an object that looked something like an golden television aerial it was humming slightly what appeared to be a mirror hung opposite harry on the wall but it was not reflecting the room shadowy figures were moving around inside it none of them clearly in focus 
 
 like my dark detectors do you said moody who was watching harry closely 
 
 that harry asked pointing at the squiggly golden aerial 
 
 secrecy sensor vibrates when it detects concealment and liesno use here of course too much interference students in every direction lying about why they done their homework been humming ever since i got here i had to disable my sneakoscope because it stop whistling picks up stuff about a mile around of course it could be picking up more than kid stuff he added in a growl 
 
 and the mirror for 
 
 oh my see them out there skulking around not really in trouble until i see the whites of their eyes when i open my trunk 
 
 he let out a short harsh laugh and pointed to the large trunk under the window it had seven keyholes in a row harry wondered what was in there until next question brought him sharply back to earth 
 
 sofound out about the dragons have you 
 
 harry hesitated been afraid of this but he told cedric and he certainly going to tell moody that hagrid had broken the rules 
 
 all right said moody sitting down and stretching out his wooden leg with a groan a traditional part of the triwizard tournament and always has been 
 
 i cheat said harry sharply it was a sort of accident that i found out 
 
 moody grinned i accusing you laddie been telling dumbledore from the start he can be as as he likes but you can bet old karkaroff and maxime be have told their champions everything they can they want to win they want to beat dumbledore like to prove only human 
 
 moody gave another harsh laugh and his magical eye swiveled around so fast it made harry feel queasy to watch it 
 
 sogot any ideas how going to get past your dragon yet said moody 
 
 no said harry 
 
 well not going to tell you said moody gruffly i show favoritism me just going to give you some good general advice and the first bit is play to your strengths 
 
 i got any said harry before he could stop himself 
 
 excuse me growled moody got strengths if i say got them think now what are you best at 
 
 harry tried to concentrate what was he best at well that was easy really 
 
 quidditch he said dully and a fat lot of help 
 
 right said moody staring at him very hard his magical eye barely moving at all a damn good flier from what heard 
 
 yeah but harry stared at him not allowed a broom only got my wand 
 
 my second piece of general advice said moody loudly interrupting him is to use a nice simple spell that will enable you to get what you need 
 
 harry looked at him blankly what did he need 
 
 come on boy whispered moody put them not that difficult 
 
 and it clicked he was best at flying he needed to pass the dragon in the air for that he needed his firebolt and for his he needed 
 
 
 
 hermione harry whispered when he had sped into greenhouse three minutes later uttering a hurried apology to professor sprout as he passed her hermione i need you to help me 
 
 what think been trying to do harry she whispered back her eyes round with anxiety over the top of the quivering flutterby bush she was pruning 
 
 hermione i need to learn how to do a summoning charm properly by tomorrow afternoon 
 
 and so they practiced they have lunch but headed for a free classroom where harry tried with all his might to make various objects fly across the room toward him he was still having problems the books and quills kept losing heart halfway across the room and dropping hike stones to the floor 
 
 concentrate harry concentrate 
 
 what think trying to do said harry angrily a great big dragon keeps popping up in my head for some reasonokay try again 
 
 he wanted to skip divination to keep practicing but hermione refused to skive off arithmancy and there was no point in staying without her he therefore had to endure over an hour of professor trelawney who spent half the lesson telling everyone that the position of mars with relation to saturn at that moment meant that people born in july were in great danger of sudden violent deaths 
 
 well good said harry loudly his temper getting the better of him just as long as not i want to suffer 
 
 ron looked for a moment as though he was going to laugh he certainly caught eye for the first time in days but harry was still feeling too resentful toward ron to care he spent the rest of the lesson trying to attract small objects toward him under the table with his wand he managed to make a fly zoom straight into his hand though he entirely sure that was his prowess at summoning charms perhaps the fly was just stupid 
 
 he forced down some dinner after divination then returned to the empty classroom with hermione using the invisibility cloak to avoid the teachers they kept practicing until past midnight they would have stayed longer but peeves turned up and pretending to think that harry wanted things thrown at him started chucking chairs across the room harry and hermione left in a hurry before the noise attracted filch and went back to the gryffindor common room which was now mercifully empty 
 
 at two in the morning harry stood near the fireplace surrounded by heaps of objects books quills several upturned chairs an old set of gobstones and toad trevor only in the last hour had harry really got the hang of the summoning charm 
 
 better harry loads better hermione said looking exhausted but very pleased 
 
 well now we know what to do next time i manage a spell harry said throwing a rune dictionary back to hermione so he could try again threaten me with a dragon right he raised his wand once more accio dictionary 
 
 the heavy book soared out of hand flew across the room and harry caught it 
 
 harry i really think got it said hermione delightedly 
 
 just as long as it works tomorrow harry said the going to be much farther away than the stuff in here going to be in the castle and going to be out there on the grounds 
 
 that matter said hermione firmly just as long as concentrating really really hard on it come harry better get some going to need it 
 
 
 
 harry had been focusing so hard on learning the summoning charm that evening that some of his blind panic had heft him it returned in full measure however on the following morning the atmosphere in the school was one of great tension and excitement lessons were to stop at midday giving all the students time to get down to the dragons enclosure though of course they yet know what they would find there 
 
 harry felt oddly separate from everyone around him whether they were wishing him good luck or hissing have a box of tissues ready potter as he passed it was a state of nervousness so advanced that he wondered whether he just lose his head when they tried to lead him out to his dragon and start trying to curse everyone in sight time was behaving in a more peculiar fashion than ever rushing past in great dollops so that one moment he seemed to be sitting down in his first lesson history of magic and the next walking into lunchand then where had the morning gone the last of the hours professor mcgonagall was hurrying over to him in the great hall lots of people were watching 
 
 potter the champions have to come down onto the grounds have to get ready for your first task 
 
 okay said harry standing up his fork falling onto his plate with a clatter 
 
 good luck harry hermione whispered be fine 
 
 yeah said harry in a voice that was most unlike his own 
 
 he heft the great hall with professor mcgonagall she seem herself either in fact she looked nearly as anxious as hermione as she walked him down the stone steps and out into the cold november afternoon she put her hand on his shoulder 
 
 now panic she said just keep a cool got wizards standing by to control the situation if it gets out of main thing is just to do your best and nobody will think any the worse of you all right 
 
 yes harry heard himself say yes fine 
 
 she was leading him toward the place where the dragons were around the edge of the forest but when they approached the clump of trees behind which the enclosure would be clearly visible harry saw that a tent had been erected its entrance facing them screening the dragons from view 
 
 to go in here with the other champions said professor mcgonagall in a rather shaky sort of voice and wait for your turn potter mr bagman is in be telling you the the procedure good luck 
 
 thanks said harry in a flat distant voice she left him at the entrance of the tent harry went inside 
 
 fleur delacour was sitting in a corner on a how wooden stool she look nearly as composed as usual but rather pale and clammy viktor krum looked even surlier than usual which harry supposed was his way of showing nerves cedric was pacing up and down when harry entered cedric gave him a small smile which harry returned feeling the muscles in his face working rather hard as though they had forgotten how to do it 
 
 harry said bagman happily looking around at him come in come in make yourself at home 
 
 bagman looked somehow like a slightly overblown cartoon figure standing amid all the champions he was wearing his old wasp robes again 
 
 well now all here time to fill you in said bagman brightly when the audience has assembled going to be offering each of you this bag he held up a small sack of purple silk and shook it at them from which you will each select a small model of the thing you are about to face there are different er varieties you see and i have to tell you something else tooah yesyour task is to collect the golden egg 
 
 harry glanced around cedric had nodded once to show that he understood words and then started pacing around the tent again he looked slightly green fleur delacour and krum reacted at all perhaps they thought they might be sick if they opened their mouths that was certainly how harry felt but they at least had volunteered for this 
 
 and in no time at all hundreds upon hundreds of pairs of feet could be heard passing the tent their owners talking excitedly laughing felt as separate from the crowd as though they were a different species and then it seemed like about a second later to harry bagman was opening the neck of the purple silk sack 
 
 ladies first he said offering it to fleur delacour 
 
 she put a shaking hand inside the bag and drew out a tiny perfect model of a dragon a welsh green it had the number two around its neck and harry knew by the fact that fleur showed no sign of surprise but rather a determined resignation that he had been right madame maxime had told her what was coming 
 
 the same held true for krum he pulled out the scarlet chinese fireball it had a number three around its neck he even blink just sat back down and stared at the ground 
 
 cedric put his hand into the bag and out came the swedish the number one tied around its neck knowing what was left harry put his hand into the silk bag and pulled out the hungarian horntail and the number four it stretched its wings as he looked down at it and bared its minuscule fangs 
 
 well there you are said bagman you have each pulled out the dragon you will face and the numbers refer to the order in which you are to take on the dragons do you see now going to have to leave you in a moment because commentating mr diggory first just go out into the enclosure when you hear a whistle all right nowharrycould i have a quick word outside 
 
 eryes said harry blankly and he got up and went out of the tent with bagman who walked him a short distance away into the trees and then turned to him with a fatherly expression on his face 
 
 feeling all right harry anything i can get you 
 
 what said harry i no nothing 
 
 got a plan said bagman lowering his voice conspiratorially because i mind sharing a few pointers if like them you know i mean bagman continued lowering his voice still further the underdog here i can do to help 
 
 no said harry so quickly he knew he had sounded rude no i i know what going to do thanks 
 
 nobody would know harry said bagman winking at him 
 
 no fine said harry wondering why he kept telling people this and wondering whether he had ever been less fine got a plan worked out i 
 
 a whistle had blown somewhere 
 
 good lord got to run said bagman in alarm and he hurried off 
 
 harry walked back to the tent and saw cedric emerging from it greener than ever harry tried to wish him luck as he walked past but all that came out of his mouth was a sort of hoarse grunt 
 
 harry went back inside to fleur and krum seconds hater they heard the roar of the crowd which meant cedric had entered the enclosure and was now with the living counterpart of his model 
 
 it was worse than harry could ever have imagined sitting there and listening the crowd screamedyelledgasped like a single entity as cedric did whatever he was doing to get past the swedish krum was still staring at the ground fleur had now taken to retracing steps around and around the tent and commentary made everything much much pictures formed in mind as he heard oooh narrow miss there very narrow taking risks this move pity it work 
 
 and then after about fifteen minutes harry heard the deafening roar that could mean only one thing cedric had gotten past his dragon and captured the golden egg 
 
 very good indeed bagman was shouting and now the marks from the judges 
 
 but he shout out the marks harry supposed the judges were holding them up and showing them to the crowd 
 
 one down three to go bagman yelled as the whistle blew again miss delacour if you please 
 
 fleur was trembling from head to foot harry felt more warmly toward her than he had done so far as she heft the tent with her head held high and her hand clutching her wand he and krum were left alone at opposite sides of the tent avoiding each gaze 
 
 the same process started not sure that was wise they could hear bagman shouting gleefully ohnearly careful nowgood lord i thought had it then 
 
 ten minutes later harry heard the crowd erupt into applause once must have been successful too a pause while marks were being shownmore clappingthen for the third time the whistle 
 
 and here comes mr krum cried bagman and krum slouched out leaving harry quite alone 
 
 he felt much more aware of his body than usual very aware of the way his heart was pumping fast and his fingers tingling with fearyet at the same time he seemed to be outside himself seeing the walls of the tent and hearing the crowd as though from far away 
 
 very daring bagman was yelling and harry heard the chinese fireball emit a horrible roaring shriek while the crowd drew its collective breath some nerve showing and yes got the egg 
 
 applause shattered the wintery air like breaking glass krum had finished it would be turn any moment 
 
 he stood up noticing dimly that his legs seemed to be made of marshmallow he waited and then he heard the whistle blow he walked out through the entrance of the tent the panic rising into a crescendo inside him and now he was walking past the trees through a gap in the enclosure fence 
 
 he saw everything in front of him as though it was a very highly colored dream there were hundreds and hundreds of faces staring down at him from stands that had been magicked there since last stood on this spot and there was the horntail at the other end of the enclosure crouched low over her clutch of eggs her wings her evil yellow eyes upon him a monstrous scaly black lizard thrashing her spiked tail heaving gouge marks in the hard ground the crowd was making a great deal of noise but whether friendly or not harry know or care it was time to do what he had to doto focus his mind entirely and absolutely upon the thing that was his only chance 
 
 he raised his wand 
 
 accio firebolt he shouted 
 
 harry waited every fiber of him hoping it workedif it cominghe seemed to be looking at everything around him through some sort of shimmering transparent barrier like a heat haze which made the enclosure and the hundreds of faces around him swim strangely 
 
 and then he heard it speeding through the air behind him he turned and saw his firebolt hurtling toward him around the edge of the woods soaring into the enclosure and stopping dead in midair beside him waiting for him to mount the crowd was making even more was shouting somethingbut ears were not working properly anymorelistening important 
 
 he swung his leg over the broom and kicked off from the ground and a second later something miraculous happened 
 
 as he soared upward as the wind rushed through his hair as the faces became mere pinpnicks below and the horntail shrank to the size of a dog he realized that he had left not only the ground behind but also his was back where he belonged 
 
 this was just another quidditch match that was alljust another quidditch match and that horntail was just another ugly opposing team 
 
 he looked down at the clutch of eggs and spotted the gold one gleaming against its fellows residing safely between the front legs okay harry told himself diversionary go 
 
 he dived the head followed him he knew what it was going to do and pulled out of the dive just in time a jet of fire had been released exactly where he would have been had he not swerved awaybut harry carethat was no more than dodging a bludger 
 
 great scott he can fly yelled bagman as the crowd shrieked and gasped are you watching this mr krum 
 
 harry soared higher in a circle the horntail was still following his progress its head revolving on its long neck if he kept this up it would be nicely dizzy but better not push it too long or it would be breathing fire again 
 
 harry plummeted just as the horntail opened its mouth but this time he was less lucky he missed the flames but the tail came whipping up to meet him instead and as he swerved to the left one of the long spikes grazed his shoulder ripping his robes 
 
 he could feel it stinging he could hear screaming and groans from the crowd but the cut seem to be he zoomed around the back of the horntail and a possibility occurred to him 
 
 the horntail seem to want to take off she was too protective of her eggs though she writhed and twisted furling and unfurling her wings and keeping those fearsome yellow eyes on harry she was afraid to move too far from thembut he had to persuade her to do it or never get near trick was to do it carefully gradually 
 
 he began to fly first this way then the other not near enough to make her breathe fire to stave him off but still posing a sufficient threat to ensure she kept her eyes on him her head swayed this way and that watching him out of those vertical pupils her fangs bared 
 
 he flew higher the head rose with him her neck now stretched to its fullest extent still swaying hike a snake before its charmer 
 
 harry rose a few more feet and she let out a roar of exasperation he was like a fly to her a fly she was longing to swat her tail thrashed again but he was too high to reach shot fire into the air which he jaws opened wide 
 
 come on harry hissed swerving tantalizingly above her come on come and get meup you get now 
 
 and then she reared spreading her great black leathery wings at last as wide as those of a small airplane and harry dived before the dragon knew what he had done or where he had disappeared to he was speeding toward the ground as fast as he could go toward the eggs now unprotected by her clawed front legs he had taken his hands off his firebolt he had seized the golden egg 
 
 and with a huge spurt of speed he was off he was soaring out over the stands the heavy egg safely under his uninjured arm and it was as though somebody had just turned the volume back up for the first time he became properly aware of the noise of the crowd which was screaming and applauding as loudly as the irish supporters at the world cup 
 
 look at that bagman was yelling will you look at that our youngest champion is quickest to get his egg well this is going to shorten the odds on mr potter 
 
 harry saw the dragon keepers rushing forward to subdue the horntail and over at the entrance to the enclosure professor mcgonagall professor moody and hagrid hurrying to meet him all of them waving him toward them their smiles evident even from this distance he flew back over the stands the noise of the crowd pounding his eardrums and came in smoothly to land his heart lighter than it had been in had got through the first task he had survived 
 
 that was excellent potter cried professor mcgonagall as he got off the firebolt which from her was extravagant praise he noticed that her hand shook as she pointed at his shoulder need to see madam pomfrey before the judges give out your there had to mop up diggory already 
 
 yeh did it harry said hagrid hoarsely yeh did it an agains the horntail an all an yeh know charlie said that was the wors 
 
 thanks hagrid said harry loudly so that hagrid blunder on and reveal that he had shown harry the dragons beforehand 
 
 professor moody looked very pleased too his magical eye was dancing in its socket 
 
 nice and easy does the trick potter he growled 
 
 right then potter the first aid tent please said professor mcgonagall 
 
 harry walked out of the enclosure still panting and saw madam pomfrey standing at the mouth of a second tent looking worried 
 
 dragons she said in a disgusted tone pulling harry inside the tent was divided into cubicles he could make out shadow through the canvas but cedric seem to be badly injured he was sitting up at least madam pomfrey examined shoulder talking furiously all the while last year dementors this year dragons what are they going to bring into this school next very luckythis is quite need cleaning before i heal it up though 
 
 she cleaned the cut with a dab of some purple liquid that smoked and stung but then poked his shoulder with her wand and he felt it heal instantly 
 
 now just sit quietly for a minute sit and then you can go and get your score 
 
 she bustled out of the tent and he heard her go next door and say how does it feel now diggory 
 
 harry want to sit still he was too full of adrenaline he got to his feet wanting to see what was going on outside but before reached the mouth of the tent two people had come darting inside hermione followed closely by ron 
 
 harry you were brilliant hermione said squeakily there were fingernail marks on her face where she had been clutching it in fear you were amazing you really were 
 
 but harry was looking at ron who was very white and staring at harry as though he were a ghost 
 
 harry he said very seriously whoever put your name in that goblet i i reckon trying to do you in 
 
 it was as though the last few weeks had never happened as though harry were meeting ron for the first time right after been made champion 
 
 caught on have you said harry coldly took you long enough 
 
 hermione stood nervously between them looking from one to the other ron opened his mouth uncertainly harry knew ron was about to apologize and suddenly he found he need to hear it 
 
 okay he said before ron could get the words out forget it 
 
 no said ron i 
 
 forget it harry said 
 
 ron grinned nervously at him and harry grinned back 
 
 hermione burst into tears 
 
 nothing to cry about harry told her bewildered 
 
 you two are so stupid she shouted stamping her foot on the ground tears splashing down her front then before either of them could stop her she had given both of them a hug and dashed away now positively howling 
 
 barking mad said ron shaking his head harry be putting up your scores 
 
 picking up the golden egg and his firebolt feeling more elated than he would have believed possible an hour ago harry ducked out of the tent ron by his side talking fast 
 
 you were the best you know no competition cedric did this weird thing where he transfigured a rock on the groundturned it into a doghe was trying to make the dragon go for the dog instead of him well it was a pretty cool bit of transfiguration and it sort of worked because he did get the egg but he got burned as well the dragon changed its mind halfway through and decided it would rather have him than the labrador he only just got away and that fleur girl tried this sort of charm i think she was trying to put it into a trance well that kind of worked too it went all sleepy but then it snored and this great jet of flame shot out and her skirt caught fire she put it out with a bit of water out of her wand and krum you believe this but he even think of flying he was probably the best after you though hit it with some sort of spell right in the eye only thing is it went trampling around in agony and squashed half the real eggs they took marks off for that he supposed to do any damage to them 
 
 ron drew breath as he and harry reached the edge of the enclosure now that the horntail had been taken away harry could see where the five judges were sitting right at the other end in raised seats draped in gold 
 
 marks out of ten from each one ron said and harry squinting up the field saw the first judge madame maxime raise her wand in the air what hooked like a long silver ribbon shot out of it which twisted itself into a large figure eight 
 
 not bad said ron as the crowd applauded i suppose she took marks off for your shoulder 
 
 mr crouch came next he shot a number nine into the air 
 
 looking good ron yelled thumping harry on the back 
 
 next dumbledore he too put up a nine the crowd was cheering harder than ever 
 
 ludo bagman ten 
 
 ten said harry in disbelief buti got he playing at 
 
 harry complain ron yelled excitedly 
 
 and now karkaroff raised his wand he paused for a moment and then a number shot out of his wand too four 
 
 what ron bellowed furiously four you lousy biased you gave krum ten 
 
 but harry care he have cared if karkaroff had given him zero indignation on his behalf was worth about a hundred points to him he tell ron this of course but his heart felt lighter than air as he turned to leave the enclosure and it just ronthose only gryffindors cheering in the crowd when it had come to it when they had seen what he was facing most of the school had been on his side as well as care about the slytherins he could stand whatever they threw at him now 
 
 tied in first place harry you and krum said charlie weasley hurrying to meet them as they set off back toward the school listen got to run got to go and send mum an owl i swore tell her what happened but that was unbelievable oh yeah and they told me to tell you got to hang around for a few more wants a word back in the champions tent 
 
 ron said he would wait so harry reentered the tent which somehow looked quite different now friendly and welcoming he thought back to how felt while dodging the horntail and compared it to the long wait before walked out to face was no comparison the wait had been immeasurably worse 
 
 fleur cedric and krum all came in together one side of face was covered in a thick orange paste which was presumably mending his burn he grinned at harry when he saw him 
 
 good one harry 
 
 and you said harry grinning back 
 
 well done all of you said ludo bagman bouncing into the tent and looking as pleased as though he personally had just got past a dragon now just a quick few words got a nice long break before the second task which will take place at half past nine on the morning of february the but giving you something to think about in the meantime if you look down at those golden eggs all holding you will see that they opensee the hinges there you need to solve the clue inside the egg because it will tell you what the second task is and enable you to prepare for it all clear sure well off you go then 
 
 harry left the tent rejoined ron and they started to walk back around the edge of the forest talking hard harry wanted to hear what the other champions had done in more detail then as they rounded the clump of trees behind which harry had first heard the dragons roar a witch leapt out from behind them 
 
 it was rita skeeter she was wearing robes today the quill in her hand blended perfectly against them 
 
 congratulations harry she said beaming at him i wonder if you could give me a quick word how you felt facing that dragon how you feel now about the fairness of the scoring 
 
 yeah you can have a word said harry savagely 
 
 and he set off back to the castle with ron 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the goblet of fire 
 

lionfish nov chapter twenty the first taskcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 harry got up on sunday morning and dressed so inattentively that it was a while before he realized he was trying to pull his hat onto his foot instead of his sock when finally got all his clothes on the right parts of his body he hurried off to find hermione locating her at the gryffindor table in the great hall where she was eating breakfast with ginny feeling too queasy to eat harry waited until hermione had swallowed her last spoonful of porridge then dragged her out onto the grounds there he told her all about the dragons and about everything sirius had said while they took another long walk around the lake 
 
 alarmed as she was by warnings about karkaroff hermione still thought that the dragons were the more pressing problem 
 
 just try and keep you alive until tuesday evening she said desperately and then we can worry about karkaroff 
 
 they walked three times around the lake trying all the way to think of a simple spell that would subdue a dragon nothing whatsoever occurred to them so they retired to the library instead here harry pulled down every book he could find on dragons and both of them set to work searching through the large pile 
 
 by charmstreating this is no good this is for nutters like hagrid who want to keep them healthy 
 
 dragons are extremely difficult to slay owing to the ancient magic that imbues their thick hides which none but the most powerful spells can penetrate but sirius said a simple one would do it 
 
 try some simple spellbooks then said harry throwing aside men who love dragons too much 
 
 he returned to the table with a pile of spellbooks set them down and began to flick through each in turn hermione whispering nonstop at his elbow 
 
 well there are switching spellsbut the point of switching it unless you swapped its fangs for or something that would make it less trouble is like that book said not much is going to get through a say transfigure it but something that big you really got a hope i doubt even professor mcgonagallunless supposed to put the spell on yourself maybe to give yourself extra powers but not simple spells i mean we done any of those in class i only know about them because been doing practice papers 
 
 hermione harry said through gritted teeth will you shut up for a bit please i m trying to concentrate 
 
 but all that happened when hermione fell silent was that brain filled with a sort of blank buzzing which seem to allow room for concentration he stared hopelessly down the index of basic hexes for the busy and vexed instant scalpingbut dragons had no hairpepper breaththat would probably increase a firepowerhorn tonguejust what he needed to give it an extra weapon 
 
 oh no back again why he read on his stupid ship said hermione irritably as viktor krum slouched in cast a surly look over at the pair of them and settled himself in a distant corner with a pile of books come on harry go back to the common roomhis fan be here in a moment twittering away 
 
 and sure enough as they left the library a gang of girls tiptoed past them one of them wearing a bulgaria scarf tied around her waist 
 
 
 
 harry barely slept that night when he awoke on monday morning he seriously considered for the first time ever just running away from hogwarts but as he looked around the great hall at breakfast time and thought about what leaving the castle would mean he knew he do it it was the only place he had ever been happywell he supposed he must have been happy with his parents too but he remember that 
 
 somehow the knowledge that he would rather be here and facing a dragon than back on privet drive with dudley was good to know it made him feel slightly calmer he finished his bacon with difficulty his throat working too well and as he and hermione got up he saw cedric diggory leaving the hufflepuff table 
 
 cedric still know about the dragonsthe only champion who if harry was right in thinking that maxime and karkaroff would have told fleur and krum 
 
 hermione see you in the greenhouses harry said coming to his decision as he watched cedric leaving the hall go on catch you up 
 
 harry be late the about to ring 
 
 catch you up okay 
 
 by the time harry reached the bottom of the marble staircase cedric was at the top he was with a load of friends harry want to talk to cedric in front of them they were among those who had been quoting rita article at him every time he went near them he followed cedric at a distance and saw that he was heading toward the charms corridor this gave harry an idea pausing at a distance from them he pulled out his wand and took careful aim 
 
 diffindo 
 
 bag split parchment quills and books spilled out of it onto the floor several bottles of ink smashed 
 
 bother said cedric in an exasperated voice as his friends bent down to help him tell flitwick coming go on 
 
 this was exactly what harry had been hoping for he slipped his wand back into his robes waited until friends had disappeared into their classroom and hurried up the corridor which was now empty of everyone but himself and cedric 
 
 hi said cedric picking up a copy of a guide to advanced transfiguration that was now splattered with ink my bag just and all 
 
 cedric said harry the first task is dragons 
 
 what said cedric looking up 
 
 dragons said harry speaking quickly in case professor flitwick came out to see where cedric had got to got four one for each of us and got to get past them 
 
 cedric stared at him harry saw some of the panic been feeling since saturday night flickering in gray eyes 
 
 are you sure cedric said in a hushed voice 
 
 dead sure said harry seen them 
 
 but how did you find out not supposed to know 
 
 never mind said harry quickly he knew hagrid would be in trouble if he told the truth but not the only one who knows fleur and krum will know by now maxime and karkaroff both saw the dragons too 
 
 cedric straightened up his arms full of inky quills parchment and books his ripped bag dangling off one shoulder he stared at harry and there was a puzzled almost suspicious look in his eyes 
 
 why are you telling me he asked 
 
 harry looked at him in disbelief he was sure cedric have asked that if he had seen the dragons himself harry have let his worst enemy face those monsters unprepared well perhaps malfoy or snape 
 
 justfair it he said to cedric we all know on an even footing we 
 
 cedric was still hooking at him in a slightly suspicious way when harry heard a familiar clunking noise behind him he turned around and saw moody emerging from a nearby classroom 
 
 come with me potter he growled diggory off you go 
 
 harry stared apprehensively at moody had he overheard them 
 
 er professor supposed to be in herbology 
 
 never mind that potter in my office please 
 
 harry followed him wondering what was going to happen to him now what if moody wanted to know how found out about the dragons would moody go to dumbledore and tell on hagrid or just turn harry into a ferret well it might be easier to get past a dragon if he were a ferret harry thought dully be smaller much less easy to see from a height of fifty feet 
 
 he followed moody into his office moody closed the door behind them and turned to look at harry his magical eye fixed upon him as well as the normal one 
 
 that was a very decent thing you just did potter moody said quietly 
 
 harry know what to say this the reaction he had expected at all 
 
 sit down said moody and harry sat looking around 
 
 he had visited this office under two of its previous occupants in professor day the walls had been plastered with beaming winking pictures of professor lockhart himself when lupin had lived here you were more likely to come across a specimen of some fascinating new dark creature he had procured for them to study in class now however the office was full of a number of exceptionally odd objects that harry supposed moody had used in the days when he had been an auror 
 
 on his desk stood what looked hike a large cracked glass spinning top harry recognized it at once as a sneakoscope because he owned one himself though it was much smaller than in the corner on a small table stood an object that looked something like an golden television aerial it was humming slightly what appeared to be a mirror hung opposite harry on the wall but it was not reflecting the room shadowy figures were moving around inside it none of them clearly in focus 
 
 like my dark detectors do you said moody who was watching harry closely 
 
 that harry asked pointing at the squiggly golden aerial 
 
 secrecy sensor vibrates when it detects concealment and liesno use here of course too much interference students in every direction lying about why they done their homework been humming ever since i got here i had to disable my sneakoscope because it stop whistling picks up stuff about a mile around of course it could be picking up more than kid stuff he added in a growl 
 
 and the mirror for 
 
 oh my see them out there skulking around not really in trouble until i see the whites of their eyes when i open my trunk 
 
 he let out a short harsh laugh and pointed to the large trunk under the window it had seven keyholes in a row harry wondered what was in there until next question brought him sharply back to earth 
 
 sofound out about the dragons have you 
 
 harry hesitated been afraid of this but he told cedric and he certainly going to tell moody that hagrid had broken the rules 
 
 all right said moody sitting down and stretching out his wooden leg with a groan a traditional part of the triwizard tournament and always has been 
 
 i cheat said harry sharply it was a sort of accident that i found out 
 
 moody grinned i accusing you laddie been telling dumbledore from the start he can be as as he likes but you can bet old karkaroff and maxime be have told their champions everything they can they want to win they want to beat dumbledore like to prove only human 
 
 moody gave another harsh laugh and his magical eye swiveled around so fast it made harry feel queasy to watch it 
 
 sogot any ideas how going to get past your dragon yet said moody 
 
 no said harry 
 
 well not going to tell you said moody gruffly i show favoritism me just going to give you some good general advice and the first bit is play to your strengths 
 
 i got any said harry before he could stop himself 
 
 excuse me growled moody got strengths if i say got them think now what are you best at 
 
 harry tried to concentrate what was he best at well that was easy really 
 
 quidditch he said dully and a fat lot of help 
 
 right said moody staring at him very hard his magical eye barely moving at all a damn good flier from what heard 
 
 yeah but harry stared at him not allowed a broom only got my wand 
 
 my second piece of general advice said moody loudly interrupting him is to use a nice simple spell that will enable you to get what you need 
 
 harry looked at him blankly what did he need 
 
 come on boy whispered moody put them not that difficult 
 
 and it clicked he was best at flying he needed to pass the dragon in the air for that he needed his firebolt and for his he needed 
 
 
 
 hermione harry whispered when he had sped into greenhouse three minutes later uttering a hurried apology to professor sprout as he passed her hermione i need you to help me 
 
 what think been trying to do harry she whispered back her eyes round with anxiety over the top of the quivering flutterby bush she was pruning 
 
 hermione i need to learn how to do a summoning charm properly by tomorrow afternoon 
 
 and so they practiced they have lunch but headed for a free classroom where harry tried with all his might to make various objects fly across the room toward him he was still having problems the books and quills kept losing heart halfway across the room and dropping hike stones to the floor 
 
 concentrate harry concentrate 
 
 what think trying to do said harry angrily a great big dragon keeps popping up in my head for some reasonokay try again 
 
 he wanted to skip divination to keep practicing but hermione refused to skive off arithmancy and there was no point in staying without her he therefore had to endure over an hour of professor trelawney who spent half the lesson telling everyone that the position of mars with relation to saturn at that moment meant that people born in july were in great danger of sudden violent deaths 
 
 well good said harry loudly his temper getting the better of him just as long as not i want to suffer 
 
 ron looked for a moment as though he was going to laugh he certainly caught eye for the first time in days but harry was still feeling too resentful toward ron to care he spent the rest of the lesson trying to attract small objects toward him under the table with his wand he managed to make a fly zoom straight into his hand though he entirely sure that was his prowess at summoning charms perhaps the fly was just stupid 
 
 he forced down some dinner after divination then returned to the empty classroom with hermione using the invisibility cloak to avoid the teachers they kept practicing until past midnight they would have stayed longer but peeves turned up and pretending to think that harry wanted things thrown at him started chucking chairs across the room harry and hermione left in a hurry before the noise attracted filch and went back to the gryffindor common room which was now mercifully empty 
 
 at two in the morning harry stood near the fireplace surrounded by heaps of objects books quills several upturned chairs an old set of gobstones and toad trevor only in the last hour had harry really got the hang of the summoning charm 
 
 better harry loads better hermione said looking exhausted but very pleased 
 
 well now we know what to do next time i manage a spell harry said throwing a rune dictionary back to hermione so he could try again threaten me with a dragon right he raised his wand once more accio dictionary 
 
 the heavy book soared out of hand flew across the room and harry caught it 
 
 harry i really think got it said hermione delightedly 
 
 just as long as it works tomorrow harry said the going to be much farther away than the stuff in here going to be in the castle and going to be out there on the grounds 
 
 that matter said hermione firmly just as long as concentrating really really hard on it come harry better get some going to need it 
 
 
 
 harry had been focusing so hard on learning the summoning charm that evening that some of his blind panic had heft him it returned in full measure however on the following morning the atmosphere in the school was one of great tension and excitement lessons were to stop at midday giving all the students time to get down to the dragons enclosure though of course they yet know what they would find there 
 
 harry felt oddly separate from everyone around him whether they were wishing him good luck or hissing have a box of tissues ready potter as he passed it was a state of nervousness so advanced that he wondered whether he just lose his head when they tried to lead him out to his dragon and start trying to curse everyone in sight time was behaving in a more peculiar fashion than ever rushing past in great dollops so that one moment he seemed to be sitting down in his first lesson history of magic and the next walking into lunchand then where had the morning gone the last of the hours professor mcgonagall was hurrying over to him in the great hall lots of people were watching 
 
 potter the champions have to come down onto the grounds have to get ready for your first task 
 
 okay said harry standing up his fork falling onto his plate with a clatter 
 
 good luck harry hermione whispered be fine 
 
 yeah said harry in a voice that was most unlike his own 
 
 he heft the great hall with professor mcgonagall she seem herself either in fact she looked nearly as anxious as hermione as she walked him down the stone steps and out into the cold november afternoon she put her hand on his shoulder 
 
 now panic she said just keep a cool got wizards standing by to control the situation if it gets out of main thing is just to do your best and nobody will think any the worse of you all right 
 
 yes harry heard himself say yes fine 
 
 she was leading him toward the place where the dragons were around the edge of the forest but when they approached the clump of trees behind which the enclosure would be clearly visible harry saw that a tent had been erected its entrance facing them screening the dragons from view 
 
 to go in here with the other champions said professor mcgonagall in a rather shaky sort of voice and wait for your turn potter mr bagman is in be telling you the the procedure good luck 
 
 thanks said harry in a flat distant voice she left him at the entrance of the tent harry went inside 
 
 fleur delacour was sitting in a corner on a how wooden stool she look nearly as composed as usual but rather pale and clammy viktor krum looked even surlier than usual which harry supposed was his way of showing nerves cedric was pacing up and down when harry entered cedric gave him a small smile which harry returned feeling the muscles in his face working rather hard as though they had forgotten how to do it 
 
 harry said bagman happily looking around at him come in come in make yourself at home 
 
 bagman looked somehow like a slightly overblown cartoon figure standing amid all the champions he was wearing his old wasp robes again 
 
 well now all here time to fill you in said bagman brightly when the audience has assembled going to be offering each of you this bag he held up a small sack of purple silk and shook it at them from which you will each select a small model of the thing you are about to face there are different er varieties you see and i have to tell you something else tooah yesyour task is to collect the golden egg 
 
 harry glanced around cedric had nodded once to show that he understood words and then started pacing around the tent again he looked slightly green fleur delacour and krum reacted at all perhaps they thought they might be sick if they opened their mouths that was certainly how harry felt but they at least had volunteered for this 
 
 and in no time at all hundreds upon hundreds of pairs of feet could be heard passing the tent their owners talking excitedly laughing felt as separate from the crowd as though they were a different species and then it seemed like about a second later to harry bagman was opening the neck of the purple silk sack 
 
 ladies first he said offering it to fleur delacour 
 
 she put a shaking hand inside the bag and drew out a tiny perfect model of a dragon a welsh green it had the number two around its neck and harry knew by the fact that fleur showed no sign of surprise but rather a determined resignation that he had been right madame maxime had told her what was coming 
 
 the same held true for krum he pulled out the scarlet chinese fireball it had a number three around its neck he even blink just sat back down and stared at the ground 
 
 cedric put his hand into the bag and out came the swedish the number one tied around its neck knowing what was left harry put his hand into the silk bag and pulled out the hungarian horntail and the number four it stretched its wings as he looked down at it and bared its minuscule fangs 
 
 well there you are said bagman you have each pulled out the dragon you will face and the numbers refer to the order in which you are to take on the dragons do you see now going to have to leave you in a moment because commentating mr diggory first just go out into the enclosure when you hear a whistle all right nowharrycould i have a quick word outside 
 
 eryes said harry blankly and he got up and went out of the tent with bagman who walked him a short distance away into the trees and then turned to him with a fatherly expression on his face 
 
 feeling all right harry anything i can get you 
 
 what said harry i no nothing 
 
 got a plan said bagman lowering his voice conspiratorially because i mind sharing a few pointers if like them you know i mean bagman continued lowering his voice still further the underdog here i can do to help 
 
 no said harry so quickly he knew he had sounded rude no i i know what going to do thanks 
 
 nobody would know harry said bagman winking at him 
 
 no fine said harry wondering why he kept telling people this and wondering whether he had ever been less fine got a plan worked out i 
 
 a whistle had blown somewhere 
 
 good lord got to run said bagman in alarm and he hurried off 
 
 harry walked back to the tent and saw cedric emerging from it greener than ever harry tried to wish him luck as he walked past but all that came out of his mouth was a sort of hoarse grunt 
 
 harry went back inside to fleur and krum seconds hater they heard the roar of the crowd which meant cedric had entered the enclosure and was now with the living counterpart of his model 
 
 it was worse than harry could ever have imagined sitting there and listening the crowd screamedyelledgasped like a single entity as cedric did whatever he was doing to get past the swedish krum was still staring at the ground fleur had now taken to retracing steps around and around the tent and commentary made everything much much pictures formed in mind as he heard oooh narrow miss there very narrow taking risks this move pity it work 
 
 and then after about fifteen minutes harry heard the deafening roar that could mean only one thing cedric had gotten past his dragon and captured the golden egg 
 
 very good indeed bagman was shouting and now the marks from the judges 
 
 but he shout out the marks harry supposed the judges were holding them up and showing them to the crowd 
 
 one down three to go bagman yelled as the whistle blew again miss delacour if you please 
 
 fleur was trembling from head to foot harry felt more warmly toward her than he had done so far as she heft the tent with her head held high and her hand clutching her wand he and krum were left alone at opposite sides of the tent avoiding each gaze 
 
 the same process started not sure that was wise they could hear bagman shouting gleefully ohnearly careful nowgood lord i thought had it then 
 
 ten minutes later harry heard the crowd erupt into applause once must have been successful too a pause while marks were being shownmore clappingthen for the third time the whistle 
 
 and here comes mr krum cried bagman and krum slouched out leaving harry quite alone 
 
 he felt much more aware of his body than usual very aware of the way his heart was pumping fast and his fingers tingling with fearyet at the same time he seemed to be outside himself seeing the walls of the tent and hearing the crowd as though from far away 
 
 very daring bagman was yelling and harry heard the chinese fireball emit a horrible roaring shriek while the crowd drew its collective breath some nerve showing and yes got the egg 
 
 applause shattered the wintery air like breaking glass krum had finished it would be turn any moment 
 
 he stood up noticing dimly that his legs seemed to be made of marshmallow he waited and then he heard the whistle blow he walked out through the entrance of the tent the panic rising into a crescendo inside him and now he was walking past the trees through a gap in the enclosure fence 
 
 he saw everything in front of him as though it was a very highly colored dream there were hundreds and hundreds of faces staring down at him from stands that had been magicked there since last stood on this spot and there was the horntail at the other end of the enclosure crouched low over her clutch of eggs her wings her evil yellow eyes upon him a monstrous scaly black lizard thrashing her spiked tail heaving gouge marks in the hard ground the crowd was making a great deal of noise but whether friendly or not harry know or care it was time to do what he had to doto focus his mind entirely and absolutely upon the thing that was his only chance 
 
 he raised his wand 
 
 accio firebolt he shouted 
 
 harry waited every fiber of him hoping it workedif it cominghe seemed to be looking at everything around him through some sort of shimmering transparent barrier like a heat haze which made the enclosure and the hundreds of faces around him swim strangely 
 
 and then he heard it speeding through the air behind him he turned and saw his firebolt hurtling toward him around the edge of the woods soaring into the enclosure and stopping dead in midair beside him waiting for him to mount the crowd was making even more was shouting somethingbut ears were not working properly anymorelistening important 
 
 he swung his leg over the broom and kicked off from the ground and a second later something miraculous happened 
 
 as he soared upward as the wind rushed through his hair as the faces became mere pinpnicks below and the horntail shrank to the size of a dog he realized that he had left not only the ground behind but also his was back where he belonged 
 
 this was just another quidditch match that was alljust another quidditch match and that horntail was just another ugly opposing team 
 
 he looked down at the clutch of eggs and spotted the gold one gleaming against its fellows residing safely between the front legs okay harry told himself diversionary go 
 
 he dived the head followed him he knew what it was going to do and pulled out of the dive just in time a jet of fire had been released exactly where he would have been had he not swerved awaybut harry carethat was no more than dodging a bludger 
 
 great scott he can fly yelled bagman as the crowd shrieked and gasped are you watching this mr krum 
 
 harry soared higher in a circle the horntail was still following his progress its head revolving on its long neck if he kept this up it would be nicely dizzy but better not push it too long or it would be breathing fire again 
 
 harry plummeted just as the horntail opened its mouth but this time he was less lucky he missed the flames but the tail came whipping up to meet him instead and as he swerved to the left one of the long spikes grazed his shoulder ripping his robes 
 
 he could feel it stinging he could hear screaming and groans from the crowd but the cut seem to be he zoomed around the back of the horntail and a possibility occurred to him 
 
 the horntail seem to want to take off she was too protective of her eggs though she writhed and twisted furling and unfurling her wings and keeping those fearsome yellow eyes on harry she was afraid to move too far from thembut he had to persuade her to do it or never get near trick was to do it carefully gradually 
 
 he began to fly first this way then the other not near enough to make her breathe fire to stave him off but still posing a sufficient threat to ensure she kept her eyes on him her head swayed this way and that watching him out of those vertical pupils her fangs bared 
 
 he flew higher the head rose with him her neck now stretched to its fullest extent still swaying hike a snake before its charmer 
 
 harry rose a few more feet and she let out a roar of exasperation he was like a fly to her a fly she was longing to swat her tail thrashed again but he was too high to reach shot fire into the air which he jaws opened wide 
 
 come on harry hissed swerving tantalizingly above her come on come and get meup you get now 
 
 and then she reared spreading her great black leathery wings at last as wide as those of a small airplane and harry dived before the dragon knew what he had done or where he had disappeared to he was speeding toward the ground as fast as he could go toward the eggs now unprotected by her clawed front legs he had taken his hands off his firebolt he had seized the golden egg 
 
 and with a huge spurt of speed he was off he was soaring out over the stands the heavy egg safely under his uninjured arm and it was as though somebody had just turned the volume back up for the first time he became properly aware of the noise of the crowd which was screaming and applauding as loudly as the irish supporters at the world cup 
 
 look at that bagman was yelling will you look at that our youngest champion is quickest to get his egg well this is going to shorten the odds on mr potter 
 
 harry saw the dragon keepers rushing forward to subdue the horntail and over at the entrance to the enclosure professor mcgonagall professor moody and hagrid hurrying to meet him all of them waving him toward them their smiles evident even from this distance he flew back over the stands the noise of the crowd pounding his eardrums and came in smoothly to land his heart lighter than it had been in had got through the first task he had survived 
 
 that was excellent potter cried professor mcgonagall as he got off the firebolt which from her was extravagant praise he noticed that her hand shook as she pointed at his shoulder need to see madam pomfrey before the judges give out your there had to mop up diggory already 
 
 yeh did it harry said hagrid hoarsely yeh did it an agains the horntail an all an yeh know charlie said that was the wors 
 
 thanks hagrid said harry loudly so that hagrid blunder on and reveal that he had shown harry the dragons beforehand 
 
 professor moody looked very pleased too his magical eye was dancing in its socket 
 
 nice and easy does the trick potter he growled 
 
 right then potter the first aid tent please said professor mcgonagall 
 
 harry walked out of the enclosure still panting and saw madam pomfrey standing at the mouth of a second tent looking worried 
 
 dragons she said in a disgusted tone pulling harry inside the tent was divided into cubicles he could make out shadow through the canvas but cedric seem to be badly injured he was sitting up at least madam pomfrey examined shoulder talking furiously all the while last year dementors this year dragons what are they going to bring into this school next very luckythis is quite need cleaning before i heal it up though 
 
 she cleaned the cut with a dab of some purple liquid that smoked and stung but then poked his shoulder with her wand and he felt it heal instantly 
 
 now just sit quietly for a minute sit and then you can go and get your score 
 
 she bustled out of the tent and he heard her go next door and say how does it feel now diggory 
 
 harry want to sit still he was too full of adrenaline he got to his feet wanting to see what was going on outside but before reached the mouth of the tent two people had come darting inside hermione followed closely by ron 
 
 harry you were brilliant hermione said squeakily there were fingernail marks on her face where she had been clutching it in fear you were amazing you really were 
 
 but harry was looking at ron who was very white and staring at harry as though he were a ghost 
 
 harry he said very seriously whoever put your name in that goblet i i reckon trying to do you in 
 
 it was as though the last few weeks had never happened as though harry were meeting ron for the first time right after been made champion 
 
 caught on have you said harry coldly took you long enough 
 
 hermione stood nervously between them looking from one to the other ron opened his mouth uncertainly harry knew ron was about to apologize and suddenly he found he need to hear it 
 
 okay he said before ron could get the words out forget it 
 
 no said ron i 
 
 forget it harry said 
 
 ron grinned nervously at him and harry grinned back 
 
 hermione burst into tears 
 
 nothing to cry about harry told her bewildered 
 
 you two are so stupid she shouted stamping her foot on the ground tears splashing down her front then before either of them could stop her she had given both of them a hug and dashed away now positively howling 
 
 barking mad said ron shaking his head harry be putting up your scores 
 
 picking up the golden egg and his firebolt feeling more elated than he would have believed possible an hour ago harry ducked out of the tent ron by his side talking fast 
 
 you were the best you know no competition cedric did this weird thing where he transfigured a rock on the groundturned it into a doghe was trying to make the dragon go for the dog instead of him well it was a pretty cool bit of transfiguration and it sort of worked because he did get the egg but he got burned as well the dragon changed its mind halfway through and decided it would rather have him than the labrador he only just got away and that fleur girl tried this sort of charm i think she was trying to put it into a trance well that kind of worked too it went all sleepy but then it snored and this great jet of flame shot out and her skirt caught fire she put it out with a bit of water out of her wand and krum you believe this but he even think of flying he was probably the best after you though hit it with some sort of spell right in the eye only thing is it went trampling around in agony and squashed half the real eggs they took marks off for that he supposed to do any damage to them 
 
 ron drew breath as he and harry reached the edge of the enclosure now that the horntail had been taken away harry could see where the five judges were sitting right at the other end in raised seats draped in gold 
 
 marks out of ten from each one ron said and harry squinting up the field saw the first judge madame maxime raise her wand in the air what hooked like a long silver ribbon shot out of it which twisted itself into a large figure eight 
 
 not bad said ron as the crowd applauded i suppose she took marks off for your shoulder 
 
 mr crouch came next he shot a number nine into the air 
 
 looking good ron yelled thumping harry on the back 
 
 next dumbledore he too put up a nine the crowd was cheering harder than ever 
 
 ludo bagman ten 
 
 ten said harry in disbelief buti got he playing at 
 
 harry complain ron yelled excitedly 
 
 and now karkaroff raised his wand he paused for a moment and then a number shot out of his wand too four 
 
 what ron bellowed furiously four you lousy biased you gave krum ten 
 
 but harry care he have cared if karkaroff had given him zero indignation on his behalf was worth about a hundred points to him he tell ron this of course but his heart felt lighter than air as he turned to leave the enclosure and it just ronthose only gryffindors cheering in the crowd when it had come to it when they had seen what he was facing most of the school had been on his side as well as care about the slytherins he could stand whatever they threw at him now 
 
 tied in first place harry you and krum said charlie weasley hurrying to meet them as they set off back toward the school listen got to run got to go and send mum an owl i swore tell her what happened but that was unbelievable oh yeah and they told me to tell you got to hang around for a few more wants a word back in the champions tent 
 
 ron said he would wait so harry reentered the tent which somehow looked quite different now friendly and welcoming he thought back to how felt while dodging the horntail and compared it to the long wait before walked out to face was no comparison the wait had been immeasurably worse 
 
 fleur cedric and krum all came in together one side of face was covered in a thick orange paste which was presumably mending his burn he grinned at harry when he saw him 
 
 good one harry 
 
 and you said harry grinning back 
 
 well done all of you said ludo bagman bouncing into the tent and looking as pleased as though he personally had just got past a dragon now just a quick few words got a nice long break before the second task which will take place at half past nine on the morning of february the but giving you something to think about in the meantime if you look down at those golden eggs all holding you will see that they opensee the hinges there you need to solve the clue inside the egg because it will tell you what the second task is and enable you to prepare for it all clear sure well off you go then 
 
 harry left the tent rejoined ron and they started to walk back around the edge of the forest talking hard harry wanted to hear what the other champions had done in more detail then as they rounded the clump of trees behind which harry had first heard the dragons roar a witch leapt out from behind them 
 
 it was rita skeeter she was wearing robes today the quill in her hand blended perfectly against them 
 
 congratulations harry she said beaming at him i wonder if you could give me a quick word how you felt facing that dragon how you feel now about the fairness of the scoring 
 
 yeah you can have a word said harry savagely 
 
 and he set off back to the castle with ron 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the goblet of fire 
 

lionfish nov chapter twenty talecontents prev chapter next chapter 
 harry sprinted up to the boys dormitories to fetch the invisibility cloak and the map from his trunk he was so quick that he and ron were ready to leave at least five minutes before hermione hurried back down from the girls dormitories wearing scarf gloves and one of her own knobbly elf hats 
 
 well cold out there she said defensively as ron clicked his tongue impatiently 
 
 they crept through the portrait hole and covered themselves hastily in the cloakron had grown so much he now needed to crouch to prevent his feet showingthen moving slowly and cautiously they proceeded down the many staircases pausing at intervals to check on the map for signs of filch or mrs morris they were lucky they saw nobody but nearly headless nick who was gliding along humming something that sounded horribly like weasley is our king they crept across the entrance hall and out into the silent snowy grounds with a great leap of his heart harry saw little golden squares of light ahead and smoke coiling up from chimney he set off at a quick march the other two jostling and bumping along behind him they crunched excitedly through the thickening snow until at last they reached the wooden front door when harry raised his fist and knocked three times a dog started barking frantically inside 
 
 hagrid us harry called through the keyhole 
 
 shoulda known said a gruff voice 
 
 they beamed at each other under the cloak they could tell by voice that he was pleased bin home three seconds out the way fang out the way yeh dozy dog 
 
 the bolt was drawn back the door creaked open and head appeared in the gap 
 
 hermione screamed 
 
 beard keep it down said hagrid hastily staring wildly over their heads under that cloak are yeh well get in get in 
 
 sorry hermione gasped as the three of them squeezed past hagrid into the house and pulled the cloak off themselves so he could see them i justoh hagrid 
 
 nuthin nuthin said hagrid hastily shutting the door behind them and hurrying to close all the curtains but hermione continued to gaze up at him in horror 
 
 hair was matted with congealed blood and his left eye had been reduced to a puffy slit amid a mass of purple and black bruising there were many cuts on his face and hands some of them still bleeding and he was moving gingerly which made harry suspect broken ribs it was obvious that he had only just got home a thick black travelling cloak lay over the back of a chair and a haversack large enough to carry several small children leaned against the wall inside the door hagrid himself twice the size of a normal man was now limping over to the fire and placing a copper kettle over it 
 
 what happened to you harry demanded while fang danced around them all trying to lick their faces 
 
 told yeh nuthin said hagrid firmly want a cuppa 
 
 come off it said ron in a right state

 fer the las time nuthin said hagrid firmly 
 
 would you say it was nothing if one of us turned up with a pound of mince instead of a face ron demanded 
 
 you ought to go and see madam pomfrey hagrid said hermione anxiously some of those cuts look nasty 
 
 dealin with it all righ said hagrid repressively 
 
 he walked across to the enormous wooden table that stood in the middle of his cabin and twitched aside a tea towel that had been lying on it underneath was a raw bloody steak slightly larger than the average car tyre 
 
 not going to eat that are you hagrid said ron leaning in for a closer look it looks poisonous 
 
 ter look like that dragon meat hagrid said an i didn get it ter eat 
 
 he picked up the steak and slapped it over the left side of his face greenish blood trickled down into his beard as he gave a soft moan of satisfaction 
 
 better it helps with the stingin yeh know 
 
 so are you going to tell us happened to you harry asked 
 
 harry top secret me worth ter tell yeh that 
 
 did the giants beat you up hagrid asked hermione quietly 
 
 fingers slipped on the dragon steak and it slid squelchily on to his chest 
 
 giants said hagrid catching the steak before it reached his belt and slapping it back over his face who said anythin abou giants who yeh bin talkin to told yeh what said bineh 
 
 we guessed said hermione apologetically 
 
 oh yeh did did yeh said hagrid surveying her sternly with the eye that was not hidden by the steak 
 
 it was kind of obvious said ron harry nodded 
 
 hagrid glared at them then snorted threw the steak back on to the table and strode over to the kettle which was now whistling 
 
 never known kids like you three fer knowin yeh oughta he muttered splashing boiling water into three of his mugs an not complimentin yeh neither nosy call it interferin 
 
 but his beard twitched 
 
 so you have been to look for giants said harry grinning as he sat down at the table 
 
 hagrid set tea in front of each of them sat down picked up his steak again and slapped it back over his face 
 
 yeah all righ he grunted i have 
 
 and you found them said hermione in a hushed voice 
 
 well not that difficult ter find ter be honest said hagrid pretty big see 
 
 where are they said ron 
 
 mountains said hagrid unhelpfully 
 
 so why muggles 
 
 they do said hagrid darkly their deaths are always put down ter mountaineerin accidents aren they 
 
 he adjusted the steak a little so that it covered the worst of the bruising 
 
 come on hagrid tell us what been up to said ron tell us about being attacked by the giants and harry can tell you about being attacked by the dementors 
 
 hagrid choked in his mug and dropped his steak at the same time a large quantity of spit tea and dragon blood was sprayed over the table as hagrid coughed and spluttered and the steak slid with a soft splat on to the floor 
 
 whadda yeh mean attacked by dementors growled hagrid 
 
 you know hermione asked him 
 
 i don know any thin bin happenin since i left i was on a secret mission wasn i didn wan owls followin me all over the placeruddy dementors not serious 
 
 yeah i am they turned up in little whinging and attacked my cousin and me and then the ministry of magic expelled me 
 
 what 
 
 and i had to go to a hearing and everything but tell us about the giants first 
 
 you were expelled 
 
 tell us about your summer and tell you about mine 
 
 hagrid glared at him through his one open eye harry looked right back an expression of innocent determination on his face 
 
 oh all righ hagrid said in a resigned voice 
 
 he bent down and tugged the dragon steak out of mouth 
 
 oh hagrid not hygien hermione began but hagrid had already slapped the meat back over his swollen eye 
 
 he took another fortifying gulp of tea then said well we set off righ after term ended 
 
 madame maxime went with you then hermione interjected 
 
 yeah righ said hagrid and a softened expression appeared on the few inches of face that were not obscured by beard or green steak yeah it was jus the pair of us an tell yeh this not afraid of roughin it olympe yeh know a fine woman an knowin where we was goin i wondered ow feel abou clamberin over boulders an sleepin in caves an tha bu she never complained once 
 
 you knew where you were going harry repeated you knew where the giants were 
 
 well durnbledore knew an he told us said hagrid 
 
 are they hidden asked ron is it a secret where they are 
 
 not really said hagrid shaking his shaggy head jus that mos wizards aren bothered where they are as a good long way away but where they very difficult ter get ter fer humans anyway so we needed instructions took us abou a month ter get there 
 
 a month said ron as though he had never heard of a journey lasting such a ridiculously long time butwhy you just grab a portkey or something 
 
 there was an odd expression in unobscured eye as he surveyed ron it was almost pitying 
 
 bein watched ron he said gruffly 
 
 what mean 
 
 yeh don understand said hagrid the keepin an eye on dumbledore an anyone they in league with im an 
 
 we know about that said harry quickly keen to hear the rest of story we know about the ministry watching dumbledore 
 
 so you use magic to get there asked ron looking thunderstruck you had to act like muggles all the way 
 
 well not exactly all the way said hagrid cagily we jus had ter be careful cause olympe an me we stick out a bit 
 
 ron made a stifled noise somewhere between a snort and a sniff and hastily took a gulp of tea 
 
 so not hard ter follow we was pretendin we was goin on holiday together so we got inter france an we made like we was headin fer where school is cause we knew we was bein tailed by someone from the ministry we had to go slow cause not really ter use magic an we knew the be lookin fer a reason ter run us in but we managed ter give the berk tailin us the slip round abou 
 
 ooooh dijon said hermione excitedly been there on holiday did you see 
 
 she fell silent at the look on face 
 
 we chanced a bit o magic after that an it wasn a bad journey ran inter a couple o mad trolls on the polish border an i had a sligh disagreement with a vampire in a pub in minsk bu apart from tha bin smoother 
 
 an then we reached the place an we started trekkin up through the mountains lookin fer signs of em 
 
 we had ter lay off the magic once we got near em partly cause they don like wizards an we didn want ter put their backs up too soon an partly cause dumbledore had warned us was bound ter be after the giants an all said it was odds on sent a messenger off ter them already told us ter be very careful of drawin attention ter ourselves as we got nearer in case there was death eaters around 
 
 hagrid paused for a long draught of tea 
 
 go on said harry urgently 
 
 found em said hagrid baldly went over a ridge one nigh an there they was spread ou underneath us little fires burnin below an huge shadows it was like watchin bits o the mountain movin 
 
 how big are they asked ron in a hushed voice 
 
 bout twenty feet said hagrid casually some o the bigger ones mighta bin 
 
 and how many were there asked harry 
 
 i reckon abou seventy or eighty said hagrid 
 
 is that all said hermione 
 
 yep said hagrid sadly eighty left an there was loads once musta bin a hundred tribes from all over the world bu bin dyin out fer ages wizards killed a few o course bu mostly they killed each other an now dyin out faster than ever not made ter live bunched up together like tha dumbledore says our fault it was the wizards who forced em to go an made em live a good long way from us an they had no choice bu ter stick together fer their own protection 
 
 so said harry you saw them and then what 
 
 well we waited till morning didn want ter go sneakin up on em in the dark fer our own safety said hagrid bout three in the mornin they fell asleep jus where they was sittin we didn dare sleep fer one thing we wanted ter make sure none of em woke up an came up where we were an fer another the snorin was unbelievable caused an avalanche near mornin 
 
 anyway once it was light we wen down ter see em

 well told us how ter do it said hagrid give the gurg gifts show some respect yeh know

 oh the gurg means the chief 
 
 how could you tell which one was the gurg asked ron 
 
 hagrid grunted in amusement 
 
 no problem he said he was the biggest the ugliest and the laziest sittin there waitin ter be brought food by the others dead goats an such like name o karkus put him at feet an the weight o a couple o bull elephants skin like rhino hide an all 
 
 and you just walked up to him said hermione breathlessly 
 
 well down ter him where he was lyin in the valley they was in this dip between four pretty high mountains see beside a mountain lake an karkus was lyin by the lake roarin at the others ter feed him an his wife olympe an i went down the mountainside 
 
 but they try and kill you when they saw you asked ron incredulously 
 
 it was on some o their minds said hagrid shrugging but we did what dumbledore told us ter do which was ter hold our gift up high an keep our eyes on the gurg an ignore the others so what we did an the rest of em went quiet an watched us pass an we got right up ter karkuss leet an we bowed an put our present down in front o him 
 
 what do you give a giant asked ron eagerly food 
 
 nah he can get food all righ fer himself said hagrid we took him magic giants like magic jus don like us usin it against em anyway that firs day we gave im a branch o gubraithian fire 
 
 hermione said wow softly but harry and ron both frowned in puzzlement 
 
 a branch of 
 
 everlasting fire said hermione irritably you ought to know that by now professor mentioned it at least twice in class 
 
 well anyway said hagrid quickly intervening before ron could answer back bewitched this branch to burn fer evermore which isn somethin any wizard could do an so i lies it down in the snow by karkuss feet and says a gift to the gurg of the giants from albus dumbledore who sends his respectful greetings 
 
 and what did karkus say asked harry eagerly 
 
 nothin said hagrid didn speak english 
 
 kidding 
 
 didn matter said hagrid imperturbably dumbledore had warned us tha migh happen karkus knew enough to yell fer a couple o giants who knew our lingo an they translated fer us 
 
 and did he like the present asked ron 
 
 oh yeah it went down a storm once they understood what it was said hagrid turning his dragon steak over to press the cooler side to his swollen eye very pleased so then i said albus dumbledore asks the gurg to speak with his messenger when he returns tomorrow with another gift 
 
 why you speak to them that day asked hermione 
 
 dumbledore wanted us ter take it very slow said hagrid let em see we kept our promises come back tomorrow with another present an then we do come back with another presentgives a good impression see an gives them time ter test out the firs present an fnd out a good one an get em eager fer more in any case giants like karkusoverload em with information an kill yeh jus to simplify things so we bowed outta the way an went off an found ourselves a nice little cave ter spend that night in an the followin mornin we went back an this time we found karkus sittin up waitin fer us lookin all eager 
 
 and you talked to him 
 
 oh yeah firs we presented him with a nice battle an indestructible yeh knowan then we sat down an we talked 
 
 what did he say 
 
 not much said hagrid listened mostly bu there were good signs heard o dumbledore heard argued against the killin o the last giants in britain karkus seemed ter be quite in what dumbledore had ter say an a few o the others specially the ones who had some english they gathered round an listened too we were hopeful when we left that day promised ter come back next mornin with another present 
 
 bu that night it all wen wrong 
 
 what mean said ron quickly 
 
 well like i say not meant ter live together giants said hagrid sadly not in big groups like that they can help themselves they half kill each other every few weeks the men fight each other an the women fight each other the remnants of the old tribes fight each other an even without squabbles over food an the best fires an sleepin spots think seein as how their whole race is abou finished lay off each other bu 
 
 hagrid sighed deeply 
 
 that night a fight broke out we saw it from the mouth of our cave lookin down on the valley went on fer hours yeh wouldn believe the noise an when the sun came up the snow was scarlet an his head was lyin at the bottom o the lake 
 
 whose head gasped hermione 
 
 said hagrid heavily there was a new gurg golgomath he sighed deeply well we hadn bargained on a new gurg two days after made friendly contact with the firs one an we had a funny feelin golgomath wouldn be so keen ter listen to us bu we had ter try 
 
 you went to speak to him asked ron incredulously after watched him rip off another head 
 
 course we did said hagrid we hadn gone all that way ter give up after two days we wen down with the next present meant ter give ter karkus 
 
 i knew it was no go before opened me mouth he was sitting there wearin helmet leerin at us as we got nearer massive one o the biggest ones there black hair an matchin teeth an a necklace o bones bones some of em well i gave it a goheld out a great roll o dragon skinan said a gift fer the gurg of the giants nex thing i knew i was hangin in the air by me feet two of his mates had grabbed me 
 
 hermione clapped her hands to her mouth 
 
 how did you get out of that asked harry 
 
 done if olympe hadn bin there said hagrid she pulled out her wand an did some o the fastes spellwork ever seen ruddy marvellous hit the two holdin me right in the eyes with conjunctivitus curses an they dropped me we were in trouble then cause used magic against em an what giants hate abou wizards we had ter leg it an we knew there was no way we was going ter be able ter march inter the camp again 
 
 blimey hagrid said ron quietly 
 
 so how come taken you so long to get home if you were only there for three days asked hermione 
 
 we didn leave after three days said hagrid looking outraged dumbledore was relyin on us 
 
 but just said there was no way you could go back 
 
 not by daylight we couldn no we just had ter rethink a bit spent a couple o days lyin low up in the cave an watchin an wha we saw wasn good 
 
 did he rip off more heads asked hermione sounding squeamish 
 
 no said hagrid i wish he had 
 
 what mean 
 
 i mean we soon found out he didn object ter all us 
 
 death eaters said harry quickly 
 
 yep said hagrid darkly couple oi em were visitin him day bringin gifts ter the gurg an he wasn dangling them 
 
 how know they were death eaters said ron 
 
 because i recognised one of em hagrid growled macnair remember him bloke they sent ter kill buckbeak maniac he is likes killin as much as golgomath no wonder they were gettin on so well 
 
 so persuaded the giants to join said hermione desperately 
 
 hold yer hippogriffs i haven finished me story yet said hagrid indignantly who considering he had not wanted to tell them anything in the first place now seemed to be rather enjoying himself me an olympe talked it over an we agreed jus cause the gurg looked like favourin didn mean all of em would we had ter try an persuade some o the others the ones who hadn wanted golgomath as gurg 
 
 how could you tell which ones they were asked ron 
 
 well they were the ones bein beaten to a pulp weren they said hagrid patiently the ones with any sense were keepin outta way hidin out in caves roun the gully jus like we were so we decided go pokin round the caves by night an see if we couldn persuade a few o them 
 
 you went poking around dark caves looking for giants said ron with awed respect in his voice 
 
 well it wasn the giants who worried us most said hagrid we were more concerned abou the death eaters dumbledore had told us before we wen not ter tangle with em if we could avoid it an the trouble was they knew we was golgomath told em abou us at night when the giants were sleepin an we wanted ter be creepin inter the caves macnair an the other one were sneakin round the mountains lookin fer us i was hard put to stop olympe jumpin out at em said hagrid the corners of his mouth lifting his wild beard she was rarin ter attack em somethin when roused olympe fiery yeh know spect the french in her 
 
 hagrid gazed into the fire harry allowed him thirty seconds of reminiscence before clearing his throat loudly 
 
 so what happened did you ever get near any of the other giants 
 
 what oh oh yeah we did yeah on the third night after karkus was killed we crept outta the cave bin hidin in an headed back down inter the gully keepin our eyes skinned fer the death eaters got inside a few o the caves no go then in abou the sixth one we found three giants hidin 
 
 cave been cramped said ron 
 
 wasn room ter swing a kneazle said hagrid 
 
 they attack you when they saw you asked hermione 
 
 probably woulda done if bin in any condition said hagrid but they was badly hurt all three o them lot had beaten em unconscious woken up an crawled inter the nearest shelter they could find anyway one o them had a bit of english an e translated fer the others an what we had ter say didn seem ter go down too badly so we kep goin back visitin the wounded i reckon we had abou six or seven o them convinced at one poin 
 
 six or seven said ron eagerly well not badare they going to come over here and start fighting with us 
 
 but hermione said what do you mean at one point hagrid 
 
 hagrid looked at her sadly 
 
 lot raided the caves the ones tha survived didn wan no more ter to do with us after that 
 
 so so there any giants coming said ron looking disappointed 
 
 nope said hagrid heaving a deep sigh as he turned over his steak and applied the cooler side to his face but we did wha we meant ter do we gave em message an some o them heard it an i spect some o remember it jus maybe them that don want ter stay around move outta the mountains an gotta be a chance remember friendly to em could be come 
 
 snow was filling up the window now harry became aware that the knees of his robes were soaked through fang was drooling with his head in lap 
 
 hagrid said hermione quietly after a while 
 
 mmm 
 
 did you was there any sign of did you hear anything about your your mother while you were there 
 
 hagrids unobscured eye rested upon her and hermione looked rather scared 
 
 sorry i forget it 
 
 dead hagrid grunted died years ago they told me 
 
 oh really sorry said hermione in a very small voice hagrid shrugged his massive shoulders 
 
 no need he said shortly remember her much wasn a great mother 
 
 they were silent again hermione glanced nervously at harry and ron plainly wanting them to speak 
 
 but you still explained how you got in this state hagrid ron said gesturing towards bloodstained face 
 
 or why back so late said harry sirius says madame maxime got back ages ago 
 
 who attacked you said ron 
 
 i haven bin attacked said hagrid emphatically i 
 
 but the rest of his words were drowned in a sudden outbreak of rapping on the door hermione gasped her mug slipped through her fingers and smashed on the floor fang yelped all four of them stared at the window beside the doorway the shadow of somebody small and squat rippled across the thin curtain 
 
 her ron whispered 
 
 get under here harry said quickly seizing the invisibility cloak he whirled it over himself and hermione while ron tore around the table and dived under the cloak as well huddled together they backed away into a corner fang was barking madly at the door hagrid looked thoroughly confused 
 
 hagrid hide our mugs 
 
 hagrid seized harry and mugs and shoved them under the cushion in basket fang was now leaping up at the door hagrid pushed him out of the way with his foot and pulled it open 
 
 professor umbridge was standing in the doorway wearing her green tweed cloak and a matching hat with earflaps lips pursed she leaned back so as to see face she barely reached his navel 
 
 so she said slowly and loudly as though speaking to somebody deaf hagrid are you 
 
 without waiting for an answer she strolled into the room her bulging eyes rolling in every direction 
 
 get away she snapped waving her handbag at fang who had bounded up to her and was attempting to lick her face 
 
 eri don want ter be rude said hagrid staring at her but who the ruddy hell are you 
 
 my name is dolores umbridge 
 
 her eyes were sweeping the cabin twice they stared directly into the corner where harry stood sandwiched between ron and hermione 
 
 dolores umbridge hagrid said sounding thoroughly confused i thought you were one o them ministrydon you work with fudge 
 
 i was senior undersecretary to the minister yes said umbridge now pacing around the cabin taking in every tiny detail within from the haversack against the wall to the abandoned travelling cloak i am now the defence against the dark arts teacher 
 
 brave of yeh said hagrid not take tha job any more 
 
 and hogwarts high inquisitor said umbridge giving no sign that she had heard him 
 
 that said hagrid frowning 
 
 precisely what i was going to ask said umbridge pointing at the broken shards of china on the floor that had been mug 
 
 oh said hagrid with a most unhelpful glance towards the corner where harry ron and hermione stood hidden oh tha was was fang he broke a mug so i had ter use this one instead 
 
 hagrid pointed to the mug from which he had been drinking one hand still clamped over the dragon steak pressed to his eye umbridge stood facing him now taking in every detail of his appearance instead of the cabins 
 
 i heard voices she said quietly 
 
 i was talkin ter fang said hagrid stoutly 
 
 and was he talking back to you 
 
 well in a manner o speakin said hagrid looking uncomfortable i sometimes say near enough human 
 
 there are three sets of footprints in the snow leading from the castle doors to your cabin said umbridge sleekly 
 
 hermione gasped harry clapped a hand over her mouth luckily fang was sniffing loudly around the hem of professor robes and she did not appear to have heard 
 
 well i jus got back said hagrid waving an enormous hand at the haversack maybe someone came ter call earlier an i missed em 
 
 there are no footsteps leading away from your cabin door 
 
 well i i don know why be said hagrid tugging nervously at his beard and again glancing towards the corner where harry ron and hermione stood as though asking for help erm 
 
 umbridge wheeled round and strode the length of the cabin looking around carefully she bent and peered under the bed she opened cupboards she passed within two inches of where harry ron and hermione stood pressed against the wall harry actually pulled in his stomach as she walked by after looking carefully inside the enormous cauldron hagrid used for cooking she wheeled round again and said what has happened to you how did you sustain those injuries 
 
 hagrid hastily removed the dragon steak from his face which in opinion was a mistake because the black and purple bruising all around his eye was now clearly visible not to mention the large amount of fresh and congealed blood on his face oh i had a bit of an accident he said lamely 
 
 what sort of accident 
 
 ii tripped 
 
 you tripped she repeated coolly 
 
 yeah right over over a friends broomstick i don fly meself well look at the size o me i don reckon a broomstick hold me friend o mine breeds abraxan horses i dunno if you ve ever seen em big beasts winged yer know had a bit of a ride on one o them an it was 
 
 where have you been asked umbridge cutting coolly through babbling 
 
 i 
 
 been yes she said term started two months ago another teacher has had to cover your classes none of your colleagues has been able to give me any information as to your whereabouts you left no address where have you been 
 
 there was a pause in which hagrid stared at her with his newly uncovered eye harry could almost hear his brain working furiously 
 
 been away for me health he said 
 
 for your health repeated professor umbridge her eyes travelled over discoloured and swollen face dragon blood dripped gently and silently on to his waistcoat i see 
 
 yeah said hagrid bit fresh air yeh know 
 
 yes as gamekeeper fresh air must be so difficult to come by said umbridge sweetly the small patch of face that was not black or purple flushed 
 
 wellchange o scene yeh know 
 
 mountain scenery said umbridge swiftly 
 
 she knows harry thought desperately 
 
 mountains hagrid repeated clearly thinking fast nope south o france fer me bit o sun an an sea 
 
 really said umbridge you have much of a tan 
 
 yeah well sensitive skin said hagrid attempting an ingratiating smile harry noticed that two of his teeth had been knocked out umbridge looked at him coldly his smile faltered then she hoisted her handbag a little higher into the crook of her arm and said i shall of course be informing the minister of your late return 
 
 righ said hagrid nodding 
 
 you ought to know too that as high inquisitor it is my unfortunate but necessary duty to inspect my fellow teachers so i daresay we shall meet again soon enough 
 
 she turned sharply and marched back to the door 
 
 inspectin us hagrid repeated blankly looking after her 
 
 oh yes said umbridge softly looking back at him with her hand on the door handle the ministry is determined to weed out unsatisfactory teachers hagrid goodnight 
 
 she left closing the door behind her with a snap harry made to pull off the invisibility cloak but hermione seized his wrist 
 
 not yet she breathed in his ear she might not be gone yet 
 
 hagrid seemed to be thinking the same way he stumped across the room and pulled back the curtain an inch or so 
 
 goin back ter the castle he said in a low voice blimey inspectin people is she 
 
 yeah said harry pulling off the cloak on probation already 
 
 um what sort of thing are you planning to do with us in class hagrid asked hermione 
 
 oh don you worry abou that got a great load o lessons planned said hagrid enthusiastically scooping up his dragon steak from the table and slapping it over his eye again bin keepin a couple o creatures saved fer yer owl year you wait somethin really special 
 
 erm special in what way asked hermione tentatively 
 
 not sayin said hagrid happily i don want ter spoil the surprise 
 
 look hagrid said hermione urgently dropping all pretence professor umbridge be at all happy if you bring anything to class too dangerous 
 
 dangerous said hagrid looking genially bemused don be silly i wouldn give yeh anythin dangerous i mean all righ they can look after themselves 
 
 hagrid got to pass inspection and to do that it would really be better if she saw you teaching us how to look after porlocks how to tell the difference between knarls and hedgehogs stuff like that said hermione earnestly 
 
 but not very interestin hermione said hagrid the stuff much more impressive bin bringin em on fer years i reckon got the domestic herd in britain 
 
 hagrid please said hermione a note of real desperation in her voice umbridge is looking for any excuse to get rid of teachers she thinks are too close to dumbledore please hagrid teach us something dull bound to come up in our owl 
 
 but hagrid merely yawned widely and cast a look of longing towards the vast bed in the corner 
 
 bin a long day an late he said patting hermione gently on the shoulder so that her knees gave way and hit the floor with a thud ohsorry he pulled her back up by the neck of her robes look don you go worryin abou me i promise yeh got really good stuff planned fer yer lessons now back now you lot had better get back up to the castle an don forget ter wipe yer tootprints out behind yeh 
 
 i dunno if you got through to him said ron a short while later when having checked that the coast was clear they walked back up to the castle through the thickening snow leaving no trace behind them due to the obliteration charm hermione was performing as they went 
 
 then go back again tomorrow said hermione determinedly plan his lessons for him if i have to i care if she throws out trelawney but not getting rid of hagrid

lionfish nov chapter twenty talecontents prev chapter next chapter 
 harry sprinted up to the boys dormitories to fetch the invisibility cloak and the map from his trunk he was so quick that he and ron were ready to leave at least five minutes before hermione hurried back down from the girls dormitories wearing scarf gloves and one of her own knobbly elf hats 
 
 well cold out there she said defensively as ron clicked his tongue impatiently 
 
 they crept through the portrait hole and covered themselves hastily in the cloakron had grown so much he now needed to crouch to prevent his feet showingthen moving slowly and cautiously they proceeded down the many staircases pausing at intervals to check on the map for signs of filch or mrs morris they were lucky they saw nobody but nearly headless nick who was gliding along humming something that sounded horribly like weasley is our king they crept across the entrance hall and out into the silent snowy grounds with a great leap of his heart harry saw little golden squares of light ahead and smoke coiling up from chimney he set off at a quick march the other two jostling and bumping along behind him they crunched excitedly through the thickening snow until at last they reached the wooden front door when harry raised his fist and knocked three times a dog started barking frantically inside 
 
 hagrid us harry called through the keyhole 
 
 shoulda known said a gruff voice 
 
 they beamed at each other under the cloak they could tell by voice that he was pleased bin home three seconds out the way fang out the way yeh dozy dog 
 
 the bolt was drawn back the door creaked open and head appeared in the gap 
 
 hermione screamed 
 
 beard keep it down said hagrid hastily staring wildly over their heads under that cloak are yeh well get in get in 
 
 sorry hermione gasped as the three of them squeezed past hagrid into the house and pulled the cloak off themselves so he could see them i justoh hagrid 
 
 nuthin nuthin said hagrid hastily shutting the door behind them and hurrying to close all the curtains but hermione continued to gaze up at him in horror 
 
 hair was matted with congealed blood and his left eye had been reduced to a puffy slit amid a mass of purple and black bruising there were many cuts on his face and hands some of them still bleeding and he was moving gingerly which made harry suspect broken ribs it was obvious that he had only just got home a thick black travelling cloak lay over the back of a chair and a haversack large enough to carry several small children leaned against the wall inside the door hagrid himself twice the size of a normal man was now limping over to the fire and placing a copper kettle over it 
 
 what happened to you harry demanded while fang danced around them all trying to lick their faces 
 
 told yeh nuthin said hagrid firmly want a cuppa 
 
 come off it said ron in a right state 
 
 tellin yeh fine said hagrid straightening up and turning to beam at them all but wincing blimey good ter see yeh three againhad good summers did yeh 
 
 hagrid been attacked said ron 
 
 fer the las time nuthin said hagrid firmly 
 
 would you say it was nothing if one of us turned up with a pound of mince instead of a face ron demanded 
 
 you ought to go and see madam pomfrey hagrid said hermione anxiously some of those cuts look nasty 
 
 dealin with it all righ said hagrid repressively 
 
 he walked across to the enormous wooden table that stood in the middle of his cabin and twitched aside a tea towel that had been lying on it underneath was a raw bloody steak slightly larger than the average car tyre 
 
 not going to eat that are you hagrid said ron leaning in for a closer look it looks poisonous 
 
 ter look like that dragon meat hagrid said an i didn get it ter eat 
 
 he picked up the steak and slapped it over the left side of his face greenish blood trickled down into his beard as he gave a soft moan of satisfaction 
 
 better it helps with the stingin yeh know 
 
 so are you going to tell us happened to you harry asked 
 
 harry top secret me worth ter tell yeh that 
 
 did the giants beat you up hagrid asked hermione quietly 
 
 fingers slipped on the dragon steak and it slid squelchily on to his chest 
 
 giants said hagrid catching the steak before it reached his belt and slapping it back over his face who said anythin abou giants who yeh bin talkin to told yeh what said bineh 
 
 we guessed said hermione apologetically 
 
 oh yeh did did yeh said hagrid surveying her sternly with the eye that was not hidden by the steak 
 
 it was kind of obvious said ron harry nodded 
 
 hagrid glared at them then snorted threw the steak back on to the table and strode over to the kettle which was now whistling 
 
 never known kids like you three fer knowin yeh oughta he muttered splashing boiling water into three of his mugs an not complimentin yeh neither nosy call it interferin 
 
 but his beard twitched 
 
 so you have been to look for giants said harry grinning as he sat down at the table 
 
 hagrid set tea in front of each of them sat down picked up his steak again and slapped it back over his face 
 
 yeah all righ he grunted i have 
 
 and you found them said hermione in a hushed voice 
 
 well not that difficult ter find ter be honest said hagrid pretty big see 
 
 where are they said ron 
 
 mountains said hagrid unhelpfully 
 
 so why muggles 
 
 they do said hagrid darkly their deaths are always put down ter mountaineerin accidents aren they 
 
 he adjusted the steak a little so that it covered the worst of the bruising 
 
 come on hagrid tell us what been up to said ron tell us about being attacked by the giants and harry can tell you about being attacked by the dementors 
 
 hagrid choked in his mug and dropped his steak at the same time a large quantity of spit tea and dragon blood was sprayed over the table as hagrid coughed and spluttered and the steak slid with a soft splat on to the floor 
 
 whadda yeh mean attacked by dementors growled hagrid 
 
 you know hermione asked him 
 
 i don know any thin bin happenin since i left i was on a secret mission wasn i didn wan owls followin me all over the placeruddy dementors not serious 
 
 yeah i am they turned up in little whinging and attacked my cousin and me and then the ministry of magic expelled me 
 
 what 
 
 and i had to go to a hearing and everything but tell us about the giants first 
 
 you were expelled 
 
 tell us about your summer and tell you about mine 
 
 hagrid glared at him through his one open eye harry looked right back an expression of innocent determination on his face 
 
 oh all righ hagrid said in a resigned voice 
 
 he bent down and tugged the dragon steak out of mouth 
 
 oh hagrid not hygien hermione began but hagrid had already slapped the meat back over his swollen eye 
 
 he took another fortifying gulp of tea then said well we set off righ after term ended 
 
 madame maxime went with you then hermione interjected 
 
 yeah righ said hagrid and a softened expression appeared on the few inches of face that were not obscured by beard or green steak yeah it was jus the pair of us an tell yeh this not afraid of roughin it olympe yeh know a fine woman an knowin where we was goin i wondered ow feel abou clamberin over boulders an sleepin in caves an tha bu she never complained once 
 
 you knew where you were going harry repeated you knew where the giants were 
 
 well durnbledore knew an he told us said hagrid 
 
 are they hidden asked ron is it a secret where they are 
 
 not really said hagrid shaking his shaggy head jus that mos wizards aren bothered where they are as a good long way away but where they very difficult ter get ter fer humans anyway so we needed instructions took us abou a month ter get there 
 
 a month said ron as though he had never heard of a journey lasting such a ridiculously long time butwhy you just grab a portkey or something 
 
 there was an odd expression in unobscured eye as he surveyed ron it was almost pitying 
 
 bein watched ron he said gruffly 
 
 what mean 
 
 yeh don understand said hagrid the keepin an eye on dumbledore an anyone they in league with im an 
 
 we know about that said harry quickly keen to hear the rest of story we know about the ministry watching dumbledore 
 
 so you use magic to get there asked ron looking thunderstruck you had to act like muggles all the way 
 
 well not exactly all the way said hagrid cagily we jus had ter be careful cause olympe an me we stick out a bit 
 
 ron made a stifled noise somewhere between a snort and a sniff and hastily took a gulp of tea 
 
 so not hard ter follow we was pretendin we was goin on holiday together so we got inter france an we made like we was headin fer where school is cause we knew we was bein tailed by someone from the ministry we had to go slow cause not really ter use magic an we knew the be lookin fer a reason ter run us in but we managed ter give the berk tailin us the slip round abou 
 
 ooooh dijon said hermione excitedly been there on holiday did you see 
 
 she fell silent at the look on face 
 
 we chanced a bit o magic after that an it wasn a bad journey ran inter a couple o mad trolls on the polish border an i had a sligh disagreement with a vampire in a pub in minsk bu apart from tha bin smoother 
 
 an then we reached the place an we started trekkin up through the mountains lookin fer signs of em 
 
 we had ter lay off the magic once we got near em partly cause they don like wizards an we didn want ter put their backs up too soon an partly cause dumbledore had warned us was bound ter be after the giants an all said it was odds on sent a messenger off ter them already told us ter be very careful of drawin attention ter ourselves as we got nearer in case there was death eaters around 
 
 hagrid paused for a long draught of tea 
 
 go on said harry urgently 
 
 found em said hagrid baldly went over a ridge one nigh an there they was spread ou underneath us little fires burnin below an huge shadows it was like watchin bits o the mountain movin 
 
 how big are they asked ron in a hushed voice 
 
 bout twenty feet said hagrid casually some o the bigger ones mighta bin 
 
 and how many were there asked harry 
 
 i reckon abou seventy or eighty said hagrid 
 
 is that all said hermione 
 
 yep said hagrid sadly eighty left an there was loads once musta bin a hundred tribes from all over the world bu bin dyin out fer ages wizards killed a few o course bu mostly they killed each other an now dyin out faster than ever not made ter live bunched up together like tha dumbledore says our fault it was the wizards who forced em to go an made em live a good long way from us an they had no choice bu ter stick together fer their own protection 
 
 so said harry you saw them and then what 
 
 well we waited till morning didn want ter go sneakin up on em in the dark fer our own safety said hagrid bout three in the mornin they fell asleep jus where they was sittin we didn dare sleep fer one thing we wanted ter make sure none of em woke up an came up where we were an fer another the snorin was unbelievable caused an avalanche near mornin 
 
 anyway once it was light we wen down ter see em 
 
 just like that said ron looking awestruck you just walked right into a giant camp 
 
 well told us how ter do it said hagrid give the gurg gifts show some respect yeh know 
 
 give the what gifts asked harry 
 
 oh the gurg means the chief 
 
 how could you tell which one was the gurg asked ron 
 
 hagrid grunted in amusement 
 
 no problem he said he was the biggest the ugliest and the laziest sittin there waitin ter be brought food by the others dead goats an such like name o karkus put him at feet an the weight o a couple o bull elephants skin like rhino hide an all 
 
 and you just walked up to him said hermione breathlessly 
 
 well down ter him where he was lyin in the valley they was in this dip between four pretty high mountains see beside a mountain lake an karkus was lyin by the lake roarin at the others ter feed him an his wife olympe an i went down the mountainside 
 
 but they try and kill you when they saw you asked ron incredulously 
 
 it was on some o their minds said hagrid shrugging but we did what dumbledore told us ter do which was ter hold our gift up high an keep our eyes on the gurg an ignore the others so what we did an the rest of em went quiet an watched us pass an we got right up ter karkuss leet an we bowed an put our present down in front o him 
 
 what do you give a giant asked ron eagerly food 
 
 nah he can get food all righ fer himself said hagrid we took him magic giants like magic jus don like us usin it against em anyway that firs day we gave im a branch o gubraithian fire 
 
 hermione said wow softly but harry and ron both frowned in puzzlement 
 
 a branch of 
 
 everlasting fire said hermione irritably you ought to know that by now professor mentioned it at least twice in class 
 
 well anyway said hagrid quickly intervening before ron could answer back bewitched this branch to burn fer evermore which isn somethin any wizard could do an so i lies it down in the snow by karkuss feet and says a gift to the gurg of the giants from albus dumbledore who sends his respectful greetings 
 
 and what did karkus say asked harry eagerly 
 
 nothin said hagrid didn speak english 
 
 kidding 
 
 didn matter said hagrid imperturbably dumbledore had warned us tha migh happen karkus knew enough to yell fer a couple o giants who knew our lingo an they translated fer us 
 
 and did he like the present asked ron 
 
 oh yeah it went down a storm once they understood what it was said hagrid turning his dragon steak over to press the cooler side to his swollen eye very pleased so then i said albus dumbledore asks the gurg to speak with his messenger when he returns tomorrow with another gift 
 
 why you speak to them that day asked hermione 
 
 dumbledore wanted us ter take it very slow said hagrid let em see we kept our promises come back tomorrow with another present an then we do come back with another presentgives a good impression see an gives them time ter test out the firs present an fnd out a good one an get em eager fer more in any case giants like karkusoverload em with information an kill yeh jus to simplify things so we bowed outta the way an went off an found ourselves a nice little cave ter spend that night in an the followin mornin we went back an this time we found karkus sittin up waitin fer us lookin all eager 
 
 and you talked to him 
 
 oh yeah firs we presented him with a nice battle an indestructible yeh knowan then we sat down an we talked 
 
 what did he say 
 
 not much said hagrid listened mostly bu there were good signs heard o dumbledore heard argued against the killin o the last giants in britain karkus seemed ter be quite in what dumbledore had ter say an a few o the others specially the ones who had some english they gathered round an listened too we were hopeful when we left that day promised ter come back next mornin with another present 
 
 bu that night it all wen wrong 
 
 what mean said ron quickly 
 
 well like i say not meant ter live together giants said hagrid sadly not in big groups like that they can help themselves they half kill each other every few weeks the men fight each other an the women fight each other the remnants of the old tribes fight each other an even without squabbles over food an the best fires an sleepin spots think seein as how their whole race is abou finished lay off each other bu 
 
 hagrid sighed deeply 
 
 that night a fight broke out we saw it from the mouth of our cave lookin down on the valley went on fer hours yeh wouldn believe the noise an when the sun came up the snow was scarlet an his head was lyin at the bottom o the lake 
 
 whose head gasped hermione 
 
 said hagrid heavily there was a new gurg golgomath he sighed deeply well we hadn bargained on a new gurg two days after made friendly contact with the firs one an we had a funny feelin golgomath wouldn be so keen ter listen to us bu we had ter try 
 
 you went to speak to him asked ron incredulously after watched him rip off another head 
 
 course we did said hagrid we hadn gone all that way ter give up after two days we wen down with the next present meant ter give ter karkus 
 
 i knew it was no go before opened me mouth he was sitting there wearin helmet leerin at us as we got nearer massive one o the biggest ones there black hair an matchin teeth an a necklace o bones bones some of em well i gave it a goheld out a great roll o dragon skinan said a gift fer the gurg of the giants nex thing i knew i was hangin in the air by me feet two of his mates had grabbed me 
 
 hermione clapped her hands to her mouth 
 
 how did you get out of that asked harry 
 
 done if olympe hadn bin there said hagrid she pulled out her wand an did some o the fastes spellwork ever seen ruddy marvellous hit the two holdin me right in the eyes with conjunctivitus curses an they dropped me we were in trouble then cause used magic against em an what giants hate abou wizards we had ter leg it an we knew there was no way we was going ter be able ter march inter the camp again 
 
 blimey hagrid said ron quietly 
 
 so how come taken you so long to get home if you were only there for three days asked hermione 
 
 we didn leave after three days said hagrid looking outraged dumbledore was relyin on us 
 
 but just said there was no way you could go back 
 
 not by daylight we couldn no we just had ter rethink a bit spent a couple o days lyin low up in the cave an watchin an wha we saw wasn good 
 
 did he rip off more heads asked hermione sounding squeamish 
 
 no said hagrid i wish he had 
 
 what mean 
 
 i mean we soon found out he didn object ter all us 
 
 death eaters said harry quickly 
 
 yep said hagrid darkly couple oi em were visitin him day bringin gifts ter the gurg an he wasn dangling them 
 
 how know they were death eaters said ron 
 
 because i recognised one of em hagrid growled macnair remember him bloke they sent ter kill buckbeak maniac he is likes killin as much as golgomath no wonder they were gettin on so well 
 
 so persuaded the giants to join said hermione desperately 
 
 hold yer hippogriffs i haven finished me story yet said hagrid indignantly who considering he had not wanted to tell them anything in the first place now seemed to be rather enjoying himself me an olympe talked it over an we agreed jus cause the gurg looked like favourin didn mean all of em would we had ter try an persuade some o the others the ones who hadn wanted golgomath as gurg 
 
 how could you tell which ones they were asked ron 
 
 well they were the ones bein beaten to a pulp weren they said hagrid patiently the ones with any sense were keepin outta way hidin out in caves roun the gully jus like we were so we decided go pokin round the caves by night an see if we couldn persuade a few o them 
 
 you went poking around dark caves looking for giants said ron with awed respect in his voice 
 
 well it wasn the giants who worried us most said hagrid we were more concerned abou the death eaters dumbledore had told us before we wen not ter tangle with em if we could avoid it an the trouble was they knew we was golgomath told em abou us at night when the giants were sleepin an we wanted ter be creepin inter the caves macnair an the other one were sneakin round the mountains lookin fer us i was hard put to stop olympe jumpin out at em said hagrid the corners of his mouth lifting his wild beard she was rarin ter attack em somethin when roused olympe fiery yeh know spect the french in her 
 
 hagrid gazed into the fire harry allowed him thirty seconds of reminiscence before clearing his throat loudly 
 
 so what happened did you ever get near any of the other giants 
 
 what oh oh yeah we did yeah on the third night after karkus was killed we crept outta the cave bin hidin in an headed back down inter the gully keepin our eyes skinned fer the death eaters got inside a few o the caves no go then in abou the sixth one we found three giants hidin 
 
 cave been cramped said ron 
 
 wasn room ter swing a kneazle said hagrid 
 
 they attack you when they saw you asked hermione 
 
 probably woulda done if bin in any condition said hagrid but they was badly hurt all three o them lot had beaten em unconscious woken up an crawled inter the nearest shelter they could find anyway one o them had a bit of english an e translated fer the others an what we had ter say didn seem ter go down too badly so we kep goin back visitin the wounded i reckon we had abou six or seven o them convinced at one poin 
 
 six or seven said ron eagerly well not badare they going to come over here and start fighting with us 
 
 but hermione said what do you mean at one point hagrid 
 
 hagrid looked at her sadly 
 
 lot raided the caves the ones tha survived didn wan no more ter to do with us after that 
 
 so so there any giants coming said ron looking disappointed 
 
 nope said hagrid heaving a deep sigh as he turned over his steak and applied the cooler side to his face but we did wha we meant ter do we gave em message an some o them heard it an i spect some o remember it jus maybe them that don want ter stay around move outta the mountains an gotta be a chance remember friendly to em could be come 
 
 snow was filling up the window now harry became aware that the knees of his robes were soaked through fang was drooling with his head in lap 
 
 hagrid said hermione quietly after a while 
 
 mmm 
 
 did you was there any sign of did you hear anything about your your mother while you were there 
 
 hagrids unobscured eye rested upon her and hermione looked rather scared 
 
 sorry i forget it 
 
 dead hagrid grunted died years ago they told me 
 
 oh really sorry said hermione in a very small voice hagrid shrugged his massive shoulders 
 
 no need he said shortly remember her much wasn a great mother 
 
 they were silent again hermione glanced nervously at harry and ron plainly wanting them to speak 
 
 but you still explained how you got in this state hagrid ron said gesturing towards bloodstained face 
 
 or why back so late said harry sirius says madame maxime got back ages ago 
 
 who attacked you said ron 
 
 i haven bin attacked said hagrid emphatically i 
 
 but the rest of his words were drowned in a sudden outbreak of rapping on the door hermione gasped her mug slipped through her fingers and smashed on the floor fang yelped all four of them stared at the window beside the doorway the shadow of somebody small and squat rippled across the thin curtain 
 
 her ron whispered 
 
 get under here harry said quickly seizing the invisibility cloak he whirled it over himself and hermione while ron tore around the table and dived under the cloak as well huddled together they backed away into a corner fang was barking madly at the door hagrid looked thoroughly confused 
 
 hagrid hide our mugs 
 
 hagrid seized harry and mugs and shoved them under the cushion in basket fang was now leaping up at the door hagrid pushed him out of the way with his foot and pulled it open 
 
 professor umbridge was standing in the doorway wearing her green tweed cloak and a matching hat with earflaps lips pursed she leaned back so as to see face she barely reached his navel 
 
 so she said slowly and loudly as though speaking to somebody deaf hagrid are you 
 
 without waiting for an answer she strolled into the room her bulging eyes rolling in every direction 
 
 get away she snapped waving her handbag at fang who had bounded up to her and was attempting to lick her face 
 
 eri don want ter be rude said hagrid staring at her but who the ruddy hell are you 
 
 my name is dolores umbridge 
 
 her eyes were sweeping the cabin twice they stared directly into the corner where harry stood sandwiched between ron and hermione 
 
 dolores umbridge hagrid said sounding thoroughly confused i thought you were one o them ministrydon you work with fudge 
 
 i was senior undersecretary to the minister yes said umbridge now pacing around the cabin taking in every tiny detail within from the haversack against the wall to the abandoned travelling cloak i am now the defence against the dark arts teacher 
 
 brave of yeh said hagrid not take tha job any more 
 
 and hogwarts high inquisitor said umbridge giving no sign that she had heard him 
 
 that said hagrid frowning 
 
 precisely what i was going to ask said umbridge pointing at the broken shards of china on the floor that had been mug 
 
 oh said hagrid with a most unhelpful glance towards the corner where harry ron and hermione stood hidden oh tha was was fang he broke a mug so i had ter use this one instead 
 
 hagrid pointed to the mug from which he had been drinking one hand still clamped over the dragon steak pressed to his eye umbridge stood facing him now taking in every detail of his appearance instead of the cabins 
 
 i heard voices she said quietly 
 
 i was talkin ter fang said hagrid stoutly 
 
 and was he talking back to you 
 
 well in a manner o speakin said hagrid looking uncomfortable i sometimes say near enough human 
 
 there are three sets of footprints in the snow leading from the castle doors to your cabin said umbridge sleekly 
 
 hermione gasped harry clapped a hand over her mouth luckily fang was sniffing loudly around the hem of professor robes and she did not appear to have heard 
 
 well i jus got back said hagrid waving an enormous hand at the haversack maybe someone came ter call earlier an i missed em 
 
 there are no footsteps leading away from your cabin door 
 
 well i i don know why be said hagrid tugging nervously at his beard and again glancing towards the corner where harry ron and hermione stood as though asking for help erm 
 
 umbridge wheeled round and strode the length of the cabin looking around carefully she bent and peered under the bed she opened cupboards she passed within two inches of where harry ron and hermione stood pressed against the wall harry actually pulled in his stomach as she walked by after looking carefully inside the enormous cauldron hagrid used for cooking she wheeled round again and said what has happened to you how did you sustain those injuries 
 
 hagrid hastily removed the dragon steak from his face which in opinion was a mistake because the black and purple bruising all around his eye was now clearly visible not to mention the large amount of fresh and congealed blood on his face oh i had a bit of an accident he said lamely 
 
 what sort of accident 
 
 ii tripped 
 
 you tripped she repeated coolly 
 
 yeah right over over a friends broomstick i don fly meself well look at the size o me i don reckon a broomstick hold me friend o mine breeds abraxan horses i dunno if you ve ever seen em big beasts winged yer know had a bit of a ride on one o them an it was 
 
 where have you been asked umbridge cutting coolly through babbling 
 
 i 
 
 been yes she said term started two months ago another teacher has had to cover your classes none of your colleagues has been able to give me any information as to your whereabouts you left no address where have you been 
 
 there was a pause in which hagrid stared at her with his newly uncovered eye harry could almost hear his brain working furiously 
 
 been away for me health he said 
 
 for your health repeated professor umbridge her eyes travelled over discoloured and swollen face dragon blood dripped gently and silently on to his waistcoat i see 
 
 yeah said hagrid bit fresh air yeh know 
 
 yes as gamekeeper fresh air must be so difficult to come by said umbridge sweetly the small patch of face that was not black or purple flushed 
 
 wellchange o scene yeh know 
 
 mountain scenery said umbridge swiftly 
 
 she knows harry thought desperately 
 
 mountains hagrid repeated clearly thinking fast nope south o france fer me bit o sun an an sea 
 
 really said umbridge you have much of a tan 
 
 yeah well sensitive skin said hagrid attempting an ingratiating smile harry noticed that two of his teeth had been knocked out umbridge looked at him coldly his smile faltered then she hoisted her handbag a little higher into the crook of her arm and said i shall of course be informing the minister of your late return 
 
 righ said hagrid nodding 
 
 you ought to know too that as high inquisitor it is my unfortunate but necessary duty to inspect my fellow teachers so i daresay we shall meet again soon enough 
 
 she turned sharply and marched back to the door 
 
 inspectin us hagrid repeated blankly looking after her 
 
 oh yes said umbridge softly looking back at him with her hand on the door handle the ministry is determined to weed out unsatisfactory teachers hagrid goodnight 
 
 she left closing the door behind her with a snap harry made to pull off the invisibility cloak but hermione seized his wrist 
 
 not yet she breathed in his ear she might not be gone yet 
 
 hagrid seemed to be thinking the same way he stumped across the room and pulled back the curtain an inch or so 
 
 goin back ter the castle he said in a low voice blimey inspectin people is she 
 
 yeah said harry pulling off the cloak on probation already 
 
 um what sort of thing are you planning to do with us in class hagrid asked hermione 
 
 oh don you worry abou that got a great load o lessons planned said hagrid enthusiastically scooping up his dragon steak from the table and slapping it over his eye again bin keepin a couple o creatures saved fer yer owl year you wait somethin really special 
 
 erm special in what way asked hermione tentatively 
 
 not sayin said hagrid happily i don want ter spoil the surprise 
 
 look hagrid said hermione urgently dropping all pretence professor umbridge be at all happy if you bring anything to class too dangerous 
 
 dangerous said hagrid looking genially bemused don be silly i wouldn give yeh anythin dangerous i mean all righ they can look after themselves 
 
 hagrid got to pass inspection and to do that it would really be better if she saw you teaching us how to look after porlocks how to tell the difference between knarls and hedgehogs stuff like that said hermione earnestly 
 
 but not very interestin hermione said hagrid the stuff much more impressive bin bringin em on fer years i reckon got the domestic herd in britain 
 
 hagrid please said hermione a note of real desperation in her voice umbridge is looking for any excuse to get rid of teachers she thinks are too close to dumbledore please hagrid teach us something dull bound to come up in our owl 
 
 but hagrid merely yawned widely and cast a look of longing towards the vast bed in the corner 
 
 bin a long day an late he said patting hermione gently on the shoulder so that her knees gave way and hit the floor with a thud ohsorry he pulled her back up by the neck of her robes look don you go worryin abou me i promise yeh got really good stuff planned fer yer lessons now back now you lot had better get back up to the castle an don forget ter wipe yer tootprints out behind yeh 
 
 i dunno if you got through to him said ron a short while later when having checked that the coast was clear they walked back up to the castle through the thickening snow leaving no trace behind them due to the obliteration charm hermione was performing as they went 
 
 then go back again tomorrow said hermione determinedly plan his lessons for him if i have to i care if she throws out trelawney but not getting rid of hagrid

lionfish nov chapter twenty lord requestcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 harry and ron left the hospital wing first thing on monday morning restored to full health by the ministrations of madam pomfrey and now able to enjoy the benefits of having been knocked out and poisoned the best of which was that hermione was friends with ron again hermione even escorted them down to breakfast bringing with her the news that ginny had argued with dean the drowsing creature in chest suddenly raised its head sniffing the air hopefully 
 
 what did they row about he asked trying to sound casual as they turned onto a corridor that was deserted but for a very small girl who had been examining a tapestry of trolls in tutus she looked terrified at the sight of the approaching sixth years and dropped the heavy brass scales she was carrying 
 
 all right said hermione kindly hurrying forward to help her here 
 
 she tapped the broken scales with her wand and said reparo the girl did not say thank you but remained rooted to the spot as they passed and watched them out of sight ron glanced back at her 
 
 i swear getting smaller he said 
 
 never mind her said harry a little impatiently what did ginny and dean row about hermione 
 
 oh dean was laughing about mclaggen hitting that bludger at you said hermione 
 
 it looked funny said ron reasonably 
 
 it look funny at all said hermione hotly it looked terrible and if coote and peakes caught harry he could have been very badly hurt 
 
 yeah well there was no need for ginny and dean to split up over it said harry still trying to sound casual or are they still together 
 
 yes they arebut why are you so interested asked hermione giving harry a sharp look 
 
 i just want my quidditch team messed up again he said hastily but hermione continued to look suspicious and he was most relieved when a voice behind them called harry giving him an excuse to turn his back on her 
 
 oh hi luna 
 
 i went to the hospital wing to find you said luna rummaging in her bag but they said left 
 
 she thrust what appeared to be a green onion a large spotted toadstool and a considerable amount of what looked like cat litter into hands finally pulling out a rather grubby scroll of parchment that she handed to harry 
 
 been told to give you this 
 
 it was a small roll of parchment which harry recognized at once as another invitation to a lesson with dumbledore 
 
 tonight he told ron and hermione once he had unrolled it 
 
 nice commentary last match said ron to luna as she took back the green onion the toadstool and the cat litter luna smiled vaguely 
 
 making fun of me you she said everyone says i was dreadful 
 
 no serious said ron earnestly i remember enjoying commentary more what is this by the way he added holding the onionlike object up to eye level 
 
 oh a gurdyroot she said stuffing the cat litter and the toadstool back into her bag you can keep it if you like got a few of them really excellent for warding off gulping plimpies 
 
 and she walked away leaving ron chortling still clutching the gurdyroot 
 
 you know grown on me luna he said as they set off again for the great hall i know insane but in a good 
 
 he stopped talking very suddenly lavender brown was standing at the foot of the marble staircase looking thunderous 
 
 hi said ron nervously 
 
 harry muttered to hermione and they sped past though not before they had heard lavender say why you tell me you were getting out today and why was she with you 
 
 ron looked both sulky and annoyed when he appeared at breakfast half an hour later and though he sat with lavender harry did not see them exchange a word all the time they were together hermione was acting as though she was quite oblivious to all of this but once or twice harry saw an inexplicable smirk cross her face all that day she seemed to be in a particularly good mood and that evening in the common room she even consented to look over in other words finish writing herbology essay something she had been resolutely refusing to do up to this point because she had known that harry would then let ron copy his work 
 
 thanks a lot hermione said harry giving her a hasty pat on the back as he checked his watch and saw that it was nearly eight listen got to hurry or be late for dumbledore 
 
 she did not answer but merely crossed out a few of his feebler sentences in a weary sort of way grinning harry hurried out through the portrait hole and off to the office the gargoyle leapt aside at the mention of toffee eclairs and harry took the spiral staircase two steps at a time knocking on the door just as a clock within chimed eight 
 
 enter called dumbledore but as harry put out a hand to push the door it was wrenched open from inside there stood professor trelawney 
 
 aha she cried pointing dramatically at harry as she blinked at him through her magnifying spectacles 
 
 so this is the reason i am to be thrown unceremoniously from your office dumbledore 
 
 my dear sybill said dumbledore in a slightly exasperated voice there is no question of throwing you unceremoniously from anywhere but harry does have an appointment and i really think there is any more to be said 
 
 very well said professor trelawney in a deeply wounded voice if you will not banish the usurping nag so be it perhaps i shall find a school where my talents are better appreciated 
 
 she pushed past harry and disappeared down the spiral staircase they heard her stumble halfway down and harry guessed that she had tripped over one of her trailing shawls 
 
 please close the door and sit down harry said dumbledore sounding rather tired 
 
 harry obeyed noticing as he took his usual seat in front of desk that the pensieve lay between them once more as did two more tiny crystal bottles full of swirling memory 
 
 professor trelawney still happy firenze is teaching then harry asked 
 
 no said dumbledore divination is turning out to be much more trouble than i could have foreseen never having studied the subject myself i cannot ask firenze to return to the forest where he is now an outcast nor can i ask sybill trelawney to leave between ourselves she has no idea of the danger she would be in outside the castle she does not knowand i think it would be unwise to enlighten herthat she made the prophecy about you and voldemort you see 
 
 dumbledore heaved a deep sigh then said but never mind my staffing problems we have much more important matters to discuss firstlyhave you managed the task i set you at the end of our previous lesson 
 
 ah said harry brought up short what with apparition lessons and quidditch and ron being poisoned and getting his skull cracked and his determination to find out what draco malfoy was up to harry had almost forgotten about the memory dumbledore had asked him to extract from professor slughorn well i asked professor slughorn about it at the end of potions sir but er he give it to me 
 
 there was a little silence 
 
 i see said dumbledore eventually peering at harry over the top of his spectacles and giving harry the usual sensation that he was being and you feel that you have exerted your very best efforts in this matter do you that you have exercised all of your considerable ingenuity that you have left no depth of cunning unplumbed in your quest to retrieve the memory 
 
 well harry stalled at a loss for what to say next his single attempt to get hold of the memory suddenly seemed embarrassingly feeble well the day ron swallowed love potion by mistake i took him to professor slughorn i thought maybe if i got professor slughorn in a good enough mood 
 
 and did that work asked dumbledore 
 
 well no sir because ron got poisoned 
 
 which naturally made you forget all about trying to retrieve the memory i would have expected nothing else while your best friend was in danger once it became clear that mr weasley was going to make a full recovery however i would have hoped that you returned to the task i set you i thought i made it clear to you how very important that memory is indeed i did my best to impress upon you that it is the most crucial memory of all and that we will be wasting our time without it 
 
 a hot prickly feeling of shame spread from the top of head all the way down his body dumbledore had not raised his voice he did not even sound angry but harry would have preferred him to yell this cold disappointment was worse than anything 
 
 sir he said a little desperately it that i bothered or anything just had otherother thing 
 
 other things on your mind dumbledore finished the sentence for him i see 
 
 silence fell between them again the most uncomfortable silence harry had ever experienced with dumbledore it seemed to go on and on punctuated only by the little grunting snores of the portrait of armando dippet over head harry felt strangely diminished as though he had shrunk a little since he had entered the room 
 
 when he could stand it no longer he said professor dumbledore really sorry i should have done more i should have realized you have asked me to do it if it really important 
 
 thank you for saying that harry said dumbledore quietly may i hope then that you will give this matter higher priority from now on there will be little point in our meeting after tonight unless we have that memory 
 
 do it sir get it from him he said earnestly 
 
 then we shall say no more about it just now said dumbledore more kindly but continue with our story where we left off you remember where that was 
 
 yes sir said harry quickly voldemort killed his father and his grandparents and made it look as though his uncle morfin did it then he went back to hogwarts and he asked he asked professor slughorn about horcruxes he mumbled shamefacedly 
 
 very good said dumbledore now you will remember i hope that i told you at the very outset of these meetings of ours that we would be entering the realms of guesswork and speculation 
 
 yes sir 
 
 thus far as i hope you agree i have shown you reasonably firm sources of fact for my deductions as to what voldemort did until the age of seventeen 
 
 harry nodded 
 
 but now harry said dumbledore now things become murkier and stranger if it was difficult to find evidence about the boy riddle it has been almost impossible to find anyone prepared to reminisce about the man voldemort in fact i doubt whether there is a soul alive apart from himself who could give us a full account of his life since he left hogwarts however i have two last memories that i would like to share with you dumbledore indicated the two little crystal bottles gleaming beside the pensieve i shall then be glad of your opinion as to whether the conclusions i have drawn from them seem likely 
 
 the idea that dumbledore valued his opinion this highly made harry feel even more deeply ashamed that he had failed in the task of retrieving the horcrux memory and he shifted guiltily in his seat as dumbledore raised the first of the two bottles to the light and examined it 
 
 i hope you are not tired of diving into other memories for they are curious recollections these two he said this first one came from a very old by the name of hokey before we see what hokey witnessed i must quickly recount how lord voldemort left hogwarts 
 
 he reached the seventh year of his schooling with as you might have expected top grades in every examination he had taken all around him his classmates were deciding which jobs they were to pursue once they had left hogwarts nearly everybody expected spectacular things from tom riddle prefect head boy winner of the award for special services to the school i know that several teachers professor slughorn amongst them suggested that he join the ministry of magic offered to set up appointments put him in touch with useful contacts he refused all offers the next thing the staff knew voldemort was working at borgin and burkes 
 
 at borgin and burkes harry repeated stunned 
 
 at borgin and burkes repeated dumbledore calmly i think you will see what attractions the place held for him when we have entered memory but this was not first choice of job hardly anyone knew of it at the time as one of the few in whom the then headmaster confidedbut voldemort first approached professor dippet and asked whether he could remain at hogwarts as a teacher 
 
 he wanted to stay here why asked harry more amazed still 
 
 i believe he had several reasons though he confided none of them to professor dippet said dumbledore firstly and very importantly voldemort was i believe more attached to this school than he has ever been to a person hogwarts was where he had been happiest the first and only place he had felt at home 
 
 harry felt slightly uncomfortable at these words for this was exactly how he felt about hogwarts too 
 
 secondly the castle is a stronghold of ancient magic undoubtedly voldemort had penetrated many more of its secrets than most of the students who pass through the place but he may have felt that there were still mysteries to unravel stores of magic to tap 
 
 and thirdly as a teacher he would have had great power and influence over young witches and wizards perhaps he had gained the idea from professor slughorn the teacher with whom he was on best terms who had demonstrated how influential a role a teacher can play i do not imagine for an instant that voldemort envisaged spending the rest of his life at hogwarts but i do think that he saw it as a useful recruiting ground and a place where he might begin to build himself an army 
 
 but he get the job sir 
 
 no he did not professor dippet told him that he was too young at eighteen but invited him to reapply in a few years if he still wished to teach 
 
 how did you feel about that sir asked harry hesitantly 
 
 deeply uneasy said dumbledore i had advised armando against the appointmenti did not give the reasons i have given you for professor dippet was very fond of voldemort and convinced of his honesty but i did not want lord voldemort back at this school and especially not in a position of power 
 
 which job did he want sir what subject did he want to teach 
 
 somehow harry knew the answer even before dumbledore gave it 
 
 defense against the dark arts it was being taught at the time by an old professor by the name of galatea merrythought who had been at hogwarts for nearly fifty years 
 
 so voldemort went off to borgin and burkes and all the staff who had admired him said what a waste it was a brilliant young wizard like that working in a shop however voldemort was no mere assistant polite and handsome and clever he was soon given particular jobs of the type that only exist in a place like borgin and burkes which specializes as you know harry in objects with unusual and powerful properties voldemort was sent to persuade people to part with their treasures for sale by the partners and he was by all accounts unusually gifted at doing this 
 
 bet he was said harry unable to contain himself 
 
 well quite said dumbledore with a faint smile and now it is time to hear from hokey the who worked for a very old very rich witch by the name of hepzibah smith 
 
 dumbledore tapped a bottle with his wand the cork flew out and he tipped the swirling memory into the pensieve saying as he did so after you harry 
 
 harry got to his feet and bent once more over the rippling silver contents of the stone basin until his face touched them he tumbled through dark nothingness and landed in a sitting room in front of an immensely fat old lady wearing an elaborate ginger wig and a brilliant pink set of robes that flowed all around her giving her the look of a melting iced cake she was looking into a small jeweled mirror and dabbing rouge onto her already scarlet cheeks with a large powder puff while the tiniest and oldest harry had ever seen laced her fleshy feet into tight satin slippers 
 
 hurry up hokey said hepzibah imperiously he said come at four only a couple of minutes to and never been late yet 
 
 she tucked away her powder puff as the straightened up the top of the head barely reached the seat of chair and her papery skin hung off her frame just like the crisp linen sheet she wore draped like a toga 
 
 how do i look said hepzibah turning her head to admire the various angles of her face in the mirror 
 
 lovely madam squeaked hokey 
 
 harry could only assume that it was down in contract that she must lie through her teeth when asked this question because hepzibah smith looked a long way from lovely in his opinion 
 
 a tinkling doorbell rang and both mistress and elf jumped 
 
 quick quick here hokey cried hepzibah and the elf scurried out of the room which was so crammed with objects that it was difficult to see how anybody could navigate their way across it without knocking over at least a dozen things there were cabinets full of little lacquered boxes cases full of books shelves of orbs and celestial globes and many flourishing potted plants in brass containers in fact the room looked like a cross between a magical antique shop and a conservatory 
 
 the returned within minutes followed by a tall young man harry had no difficulty whatsoever in recognizing as voldemort he was plainly dressed in a black suit his hair was a little longer than it had been at school and his cheeks were hollowed but all of this suited him he looked more handsome than ever he picked his way through the cramped room with an air that showed he had visited many times before and bowed low over fat little hand brushing it with his lips 
 
 i brought you flowers he said quietly producing a bunch of roses from nowhere 
 
 you naughty boy you have squealed old hepzibah though harry noticed that she had an empty vase standing ready on the nearest little table you do spoil this old lady tom sit down sit down hokey ah 
 
 the had come dashing back into the room carrying a tray of little cakes which she set at her elbow 
 
 help yourself tom said hepzibah i know how you love my cakes now how are you you look pale they overwork you at that shop said it a hundred times 
 
 voldemort smiled mechanically and hepzibah simpered 
 
 well your excuse for visiting this time she asked batting her lashes 
 
 mr burke would like to make an improved offer for the armor said voldemort five hundred galleons he feels it is a more than fair 
 
 now now not so fast or think only here for my trinkets pouted hepzibah 
 
 i am ordered here because of them said voldemort quietly i am only a poor assistant madam who must do as he is told mr burke wishes me to inquire 
 
 oh mr burke phooey said hepzibah waving a little hand something to show you that never shown mr burke can you keep a secret tom will you promise you tell mr burke got it never let me rest if he knew shown it to you and not selling not to burke not to anyone but you tom appreciate it for its history not how many galleons you can get for it 
 
 be glad to see anything miss hepzibah shows me said voldemort quietly and hepzibah gave another girlish giggle 
 
 i had hokey bring it out for me hokey where are you i want to show mr riddle our finest treasure in fact bring both while at it 
 
 here madam squeaked the and harry saw two leather boxes one on top of the other moving across the room as if of their own volition though he knew the tiny elf was holding them over her head as she wended her way between tables pouffes and footstools 
 
 now said hepzibah happily taking the boxes from the elf laying them in her lap and preparing to open the topmost one i think like this tom oh if my family knew i was showing you they wait to get their hands on this 
 
 she opened the lid harry edged forward a little to get a better view and saw what looked like a small golden cup with two finely wrought handles 
 
 i wonder whether you know what it is tom pick it up have a good look whispered hepzibah and voldemort stretched out a hand and lifted the cup by one handle out of its snug silken wrappings harry thought he saw a red gleam in his dark eyes his greedy expression was curiously mirrored on face except that her tiny eyes were fixed upon handsome features 
 
 a badger murmured voldemort examining the engraving upon the cup then this was 
 
 helga as you very well know you clever boy said hepzibah leaning forward with a loud creaking of corsets and actually pinching his hollow cheek i tell you i was distantly descended this has been handed down in the family for years and years lovely it and all sorts of powers supposed to possess too but i tested them thoroughly i just keep it nice and safe in here 
 
 she hooked the cup back off long forefinger and restored it gently to its box too intent upon settling it carefully back into position to notice the shadow that crossed face as the cup was taken away 
 
 now then said hepzibah happily hokey oh yes there you aretake that away now hokey 
 
 the elf obediently took the boxed cup and hepzibah turned her attention to the much flatter box in her lap 
 
 i think like this even more tom she whispered lean in a little dear boy so you can see of course burke knows got this one i bought it from him and i daresay love to get it back when gone 
 
 she slid back the fine filigree clasp and flipped open the box there upon the smooth crimson velvet lay a heavy golden locket 
 
 voldemort reached out his hand without invitation this time and held it up to the light staring at it 
 
 mark he said quietly as the light played upon an ornate serpentine s 
 
 right said hepzibah delighted apparently at the sight of voldemort gazing at her locket transfixed i had to pay an arm and a leg for it but i let it pass not a real treasure like that had to have it for my collection burke bought it apparently from a woman who seemed to have stolen it but had no idea of its true value 
 
 there was no mistaking it this time eyes flashed scarlet at the words and harry saw his knuckles whiten on the chain 
 
 i daresay burke paid her a pittance but there you are pretty it and again all kinds of powers attributed to it though i just keep it nice and safe 
 
 she reached out to take the locket back for a moment harry thought voldemort was not going to let go of it but then it had slid through his fingers and was back in its red velvet cushion 
 
 so there you are tom clear and i hope you enjoyed that 
 
 she looked him full in the face and for the first time harry saw her foolish smile falter 
 
 are you all right dear 
 
 oh yes said voldemort quietly yes very well 
 
 i thoughtbut a trick of the light i suppose said hepzibah looking unnerved and harry guessed that she too had seen the momentary red gleam in eyes here hokey take these away and lock them up again the usual enchantments 
 
 time to leave harry said dumbledore quietly and as the little elf bobbed away bearing the boxes dumbledore grasped harry once again above the elbow and together they rose up through oblivion and back to office 
 
 hepzibah smith died two days after that little scene said dumbledore resuming his seat and indicating that harry should do the same hokey the was convicted by the ministry of poisoning her evening cocoa by accident 
 
 no way said harry angrily 
 
 i see we are of one mind said dumbledore certainly then are many similarities between this death and that of the riddles in both cases somebody else took the blame someone who had a clear memory of having caused the death 
 
 hokey confessed 
 
 she remembered putting something in her cocoa that turned out not to be sugar but a lethal and poison said dumbledore it was concluded that she had not meant to do it but being old and confused 
 
 voldemort modified her memory just like he did with morfin 
 
 yes that is my conclusion too said dumbledore and just as with morfin the ministry was predisposed to suspect hokey 
 
 because she was a said harry he had rarely felt more in sympathy with the society hermione had set up 
 
 precisely said dumbledore she was old she admitted to having tampered with the drink and nobody at the ministry bothered to inquire further as in the case of morfin by the time i traced her and managed to extract this memory her life was almost over but her memory of course proves nothing except that voldemort knew of the existence of the cup and the locket 
 
 by the time hokey was convicted family had realized that two of her greatest treasures were missing it took them a while to be sure of this for she had many hiding places having always guarded her collection most jealously but before they were sure beyond doubt that the cup and the locket were both gone the assistant who had worked at borgin and burkes the young man who had visited hepzibah so regularly and charmed her so well had resigned his post and vanished his superiors had no idea where he had gone they were as surprised as anyone at his disappearance and that was the last that was seen or heard of tom riddle for a very long time 
 
 now said dumbledore if you mind harry i want to pause once more to draw your attention to certain points of our story voldemort had committed another murder whether it was his first since he killed the riddles i do not know but i think it was this time as you will have seen he killed not for revenge but for gain he wanted the two fabulous trophies that poor besotted old woman showed him just as he had once robbed the other children at his orphanage just as he had stolen his uncle ring so he ran off now with cup and locket 
 
 but said harry frowning it seems mad risking everything throwing away his job just for those 
 
 mad to you perhaps but not to voldemort said dumbledore i hope you will understand in due course exactly what those objects meant to him harry but you must admit that it is not difficult to imagine that he saw the locket at least as rightfully his 
 
 the locket maybe said harry but why take the cup as well 
 
 it had belonged to another of founders said dumbledore i think he still felt a great pull toward the school and that he could not resist an object so steeped in hogwarts history there were other reasons i think i hope to be able to demonstrate them to you in due course 
 
 and now for the very last recollection i have to show you at least until you manage to retrieve professor memory for us ten years separates memory and this one ten years during which we can only guess at what lord voldemort was doing 
 
 harry got to his feet once more as dumbledore emptied the last memory into the pensieve 
 
 whose memory is it he asked 
 
 mine said dumbledore 
 
 and harry dived after dumbledore through the shifting silver mass landing in the very office he had just left there was fawkes slumbering happily on his perch and there behind the desk was dumbledore who looked very similar to the dumbledore standing beside harry though both hands were whole and undamaged and his face was perhaps a little less lined the one difference between the office and this one was that it was snowing in the past bluish flecks were drifting past the window in the dark and building up on the outside ledge 
 
 the younger dumbledore seemed to be waiting for something and sure enough moments after their arrival there was a knock on the door and he said enter 
 
 harry let out a hastily stifled gasp voldemort had entered the room his features were not those harry had seen emerge from the great stone cauldron almost two years ago they were not as the eyes were not yet scarlet the face not yet masklike and yet he was no longer handsome tom riddle it was as though his features had been burned and blurred they were waxy and oddly distorted and the whites of the eyes now had a permanently bloody look though the pupils were not yet the slits that harry knew they would become he was wearing a long black cloak and his face was as pale as the snow glistening on his shoulders 
 
 the dumbledore behind the desk showed no sign of surprise evidently this visit had been made by appointment 
 
 good evening tom said dumbledore easily you sit down 
 
 thank you said voldemort and he took the seat to which dumbledore had gesturedthe very seat by the looks of it that harry had just vacated in the present i heard that you had become headmaster he said and his voice was slightly higher and colder than it had been a worthy choice 
 
 i am glad you approve said dumbledore smiling may i offer you a drink 
 
 that would be welcome said voldemort i have come a long way 
 
 dumbledore stood and swept over to the cabinet where he now kept the pensieve but which then was full of bottles having handed voldemort a goblet of wine and poured one for himself he returned to the seat behind his desk 
 
 so tom to what do i owe the pleasure 
 
 voldemort did not answer at once but merely sipped his wine 
 
 they do not call me tom anymore he said these days i am known as 
 
 i know what you are known as said dumbledore smiling pleasantly but to me afraid you will always be tom riddle it is one of the irritating things about old teachers i am afraid that they never quite forget their charges youthful beginnings 
 
 he raised his glass as though toasting voldemort whose face remained expressionless nevertheless harry felt the atmosphere in the room change subtly refusal to use chosen name was a refusal to allow voldemort to dictate the terms of the meeting and harry could tell that voldemort took it as such 
 
 i am surprised you have remained here so long said voldemort after a short pause i always wondered why a wizard such as yourself never wished to leave school 
 
 well said dumbledore still smiling to a wizard such as myself there can be nothing more important than passing on ancient skills helping hone young minds if i remember correctly you once saw the attraction of teaching too 
 
 i see it still said voldemort i merely wondered why youwho are so often asked for advice by the ministry and who have twice i think been offered the post of minister 
 
 three times at the last count actually said dumbledore but the ministry never attracted me as a career again something we have in common i think 
 
 voldemort inclined his head unsmiling and took another sip of wine dumbledore did not break the silence that stretched between them now but waited with a look of pleasant expectancy for voldemort to talk first 
 
 i have returned he said after a little while later perhaps than professor dippet expected but i have returned nevertheless to request again what he once told me i was too young to have i have come to you to ask that you permit me to return to this castle to teach i think you must know that i have seen and done much since i left this place i could show and tell your students things they can gain from no other wizard 
 
 dumbledore considered voldemort over the top of his own goblet for a while before speaking 
 
 yes i certainly do know that you have seen and done much since leaving us he said quietly rumors of your doings have reached your old school tom i should be sorry to believe half of them 
 
 expression remained impassive as he said greatness inspires envy envy engenders spite spite spawns lies you must know this dumbledore 
 
 you call it greatness what you have been doing do you asked dumbledore delicately 
 
 certainly said voldemort and his eyes seemed to burn red i have experimented i have pushed the boundaries of magic further perhaps than they have ever been pushed 
 
 of some kinds of magic dumbledore corrected him quietly of some of others you remain forgive me woefully ignorant 
 
 for the first time voldemort smiled it was a taut leer an evil thing more threatening than a look of rage 
 
 the old argument he said softly but nothing i have seen in the world has supported your famous pronouncements that love is more powerful than my kind of magic dumbledore 
 
 perhaps you have been looking in the wrong places suggested dumbledore 
 
 well then what better place to start my fresh researches than here at hogwarts said voldemort will you let me return will you let me share my knowledge with your students i place myself and my talents at your disposal i am yours to command 
 
 dumbledore raised his eyebrows and what will become of those whom you command what will happen to those who call themselvesor so rumor has itthe death eaters 
 
 harry could tell that voldemort had not expected dumbledore to know this name he saw eyes flash red again and the slitlike nostrils flare 
 
 my friends he said after a pause will carry on without me i am sure 
 
 i am glad to hear that you consider them friends said dumbledore i was under the impression that they are more in the order of servants 
 
 you are mistaken said voldemort 
 
 then if i were to go to the head tonight i would not find a group of themnott rosier muldber dolohovawaiting your return devoted friends indeed to travel this far with you on a snowy night merely to wish you luck as you attempted to secure a teaching post 
 
 there could be no doubt that detailed knowledge of those with whom he was traveling was even less welcome to voldemort however he rallied almost at once 
 
 you are omniscient as ever dumbledore 
 
 oh no merely friendly with the local barmen said dumbledore lightly now tom 
 
 dumbledore set down his empty glass and drew himself up in his seat the tips of his fingers together in a very characteristic gesture 
 
 let us speak openly why have you come here tonight surrounded by henchmen to request a job we both know you do not want 
 
 voldemort looked coldly surprised a job i do not want on the contrary dumbledore i want it very much 
 
 oh you want to come back to hogwarts but you do not want to teach any more than you wanted to when you were eighteen what is it after tom why not try an open request for once 
 
 voldemort sneered 
 
 if you do not want to give me a job 
 
 of course i said dumbledore and i think for a moment you expected me to nevertheless you came here you asked you must have had a purpose 
 
 voldemort stood up he looked less like tom riddle than ever his features thick with rage 
 
 this is your final word 
 
 it is said dumbledore also standing 
 
 then we have nothing more to say to each other 
 
 no nothing said dumbledore and a great sadness filled his face the time is long gone when i could frighten you with a burning wardrobe and force you to make repayment for your crimes but i wish i could tom i wish i could 
 
 for a second harry was on the verge of shouting a pointless warning he was sure that hand had twitched toward his pocket and his wand but then the moment had passed voldemort had turned away the door was closing and he was gone 
 
 harry felt hand close over his arm again and moments later they were standing together on almost the same spot but there was no snow building on the window ledge and hand was blackened and once more 
 
 why said harry at once looking up into face why did he come back did you ever find out 
 
 i have ideas said dumbledore but no more than that 
 
 what ideas sir 
 
 i shall tell you harry when you have retrieved that memory from professor slughorn said dumbledore 
 
 when you have that last piece of the jigsaw everything will i hope be clear to both of us 
 
 harry was still burning with curiosity and even though dumbledore had walked to the door and was holding it open for him he did not move at once 
 
 was he after the defense against the dark arts job again sir he say 
 
 oh he definitely wanted the defense against the dark arts job said dumbledore the aftermath of our little meeting proved that you see we have never been able to keep a defense against the dark arts teacher for longer than a year since i refused the post to lord voldemort

 the half blood prince 
 

lionfish nov chapter twenty lord requestcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 harry and ron left the hospital wing first thing on monday morning restored to full health by the ministrations of madam pomfrey and now able to enjoy the benefits of having been knocked out and poisoned the best of which was that hermione was friends with ron again hermione even escorted them down to breakfast bringing with her the news that ginny had argued with dean the drowsing creature in chest suddenly raised its head sniffing the air hopefully 
 
 what did they row about he asked trying to sound casual as they turned onto a corridor that was deserted but for a very small girl who had been examining a tapestry of trolls in tutus she looked terrified at the sight of the approaching sixth years and dropped the heavy brass scales she was carrying 
 
 all right said hermione kindly hurrying forward to help her here 
 
 she tapped the broken scales with her wand and said reparo the girl did not say thank you but remained rooted to the spot as they passed and watched them out of sight ron glanced back at her 
 
 i swear getting smaller he said 
 
 never mind her said harry a little impatiently what did ginny and dean row about hermione 
 
 oh dean was laughing about mclaggen hitting that bludger at you said hermione 
 
 it looked funny said ron reasonably 
 
 it look funny at all said hermione hotly it looked terrible and if coote and peakes caught harry he could have been very badly hurt 
 
 yeah well there was no need for ginny and dean to split up over it said harry still trying to sound casual or are they still together 
 
 yes they arebut why are you so interested asked hermione giving harry a sharp look 
 
 i just want my quidditch team messed up again he said hastily but hermione continued to look suspicious and he was most relieved when a voice behind them called harry giving him an excuse to turn his back on her 
 
 oh hi luna 
 
 i went to the hospital wing to find you said luna rummaging in her bag but they said left 
 
 she thrust what appeared to be a green onion a large spotted toadstool and a considerable amount of what looked like cat litter into hands finally pulling out a rather grubby scroll of parchment that she handed to harry 
 
 been told to give you this 
 
 it was a small roll of parchment which harry recognized at once as another invitation to a lesson with dumbledore 
 
 tonight he told ron and hermione once he had unrolled it 
 
 nice commentary last match said ron to luna as she took back the green onion the toadstool and the cat litter luna smiled vaguely 
 
 making fun of me you she said everyone says i was dreadful 
 
 no serious said ron earnestly i remember enjoying commentary more what is this by the way he added holding the onionlike object up to eye level 
 
 oh a gurdyroot she said stuffing the cat litter and the toadstool back into her bag you can keep it if you like got a few of them really excellent for warding off gulping plimpies 
 
 and she walked away leaving ron chortling still clutching the gurdyroot 
 
 you know grown on me luna he said as they set off again for the great hall i know insane but in a good 
 
 he stopped talking very suddenly lavender brown was standing at the foot of the marble staircase looking thunderous 
 
 hi said ron nervously 
 
 harry muttered to hermione and they sped past though not before they had heard lavender say why you tell me you were getting out today and why was she with you 
 
 ron looked both sulky and annoyed when he appeared at breakfast half an hour later and though he sat with lavender harry did not see them exchange a word all the time they were together hermione was acting as though she was quite oblivious to all of this but once or twice harry saw an inexplicable smirk cross her face all that day she seemed to be in a particularly good mood and that evening in the common room she even consented to look over in other words finish writing herbology essay something she had been resolutely refusing to do up to this point because she had known that harry would then let ron copy his work 
 
 thanks a lot hermione said harry giving her a hasty pat on the back as he checked his watch and saw that it was nearly eight listen got to hurry or be late for dumbledore 
 
 she did not answer but merely crossed out a few of his feebler sentences in a weary sort of way grinning harry hurried out through the portrait hole and off to the office the gargoyle leapt aside at the mention of toffee eclairs and harry took the spiral staircase two steps at a time knocking on the door just as a clock within chimed eight 
 
 enter called dumbledore but as harry put out a hand to push the door it was wrenched open from inside there stood professor trelawney 
 
 aha she cried pointing dramatically at harry as she blinked at him through her magnifying spectacles 
 
 so this is the reason i am to be thrown unceremoniously from your office dumbledore 
 
 my dear sybill said dumbledore in a slightly exasperated voice there is no question of throwing you unceremoniously from anywhere but harry does have an appointment and i really think there is any more to be said 
 
 very well said professor trelawney in a deeply wounded voice if you will not banish the usurping nag so be it perhaps i shall find a school where my talents are better appreciated 
 
 she pushed past harry and disappeared down the spiral staircase they heard her stumble halfway down and harry guessed that she had tripped over one of her trailing shawls 
 
 please close the door and sit down harry said dumbledore sounding rather tired 
 
 harry obeyed noticing as he took his usual seat in front of desk that the pensieve lay between them once more as did two more tiny crystal bottles full of swirling memory 
 
 professor trelawney still happy firenze is teaching then harry asked 
 
 no said dumbledore divination is turning out to be much more trouble than i could have foreseen never having studied the subject myself i cannot ask firenze to return to the forest where he is now an outcast nor can i ask sybill trelawney to leave between ourselves she has no idea of the danger she would be in outside the castle she does not knowand i think it would be unwise to enlighten herthat she made the prophecy about you and voldemort you see 
 
 dumbledore heaved a deep sigh then said but never mind my staffing problems we have much more important matters to discuss firstlyhave you managed the task i set you at the end of our previous lesson 
 
 ah said harry brought up short what with apparition lessons and quidditch and ron being poisoned and getting his skull cracked and his determination to find out what draco malfoy was up to harry had almost forgotten about the memory dumbledore had asked him to extract from professor slughorn well i asked professor slughorn about it at the end of potions sir but er he give it to me 
 
 there was a little silence 
 
 i see said dumbledore eventually peering at harry over the top of his spectacles and giving harry the usual sensation that he was being and you feel that you have exerted your very best efforts in this matter do you that you have exercised all of your considerable ingenuity that you have left no depth of cunning unplumbed in your quest to retrieve the memory 
 
 well harry stalled at a loss for what to say next his single attempt to get hold of the memory suddenly seemed embarrassingly feeble well the day ron swallowed love potion by mistake i took him to professor slughorn i thought maybe if i got professor slughorn in a good enough mood 
 
 and did that work asked dumbledore 
 
 well no sir because ron got poisoned 
 
 which naturally made you forget all about trying to retrieve the memory i would have expected nothing else while your best friend was in danger once it became clear that mr weasley was going to make a full recovery however i would have hoped that you returned to the task i set you i thought i made it clear to you how very important that memory is indeed i did my best to impress upon you that it is the most crucial memory of all and that we will be wasting our time without it 
 
 a hot prickly feeling of shame spread from the top of head all the way down his body dumbledore had not raised his voice he did not even sound angry but harry would have preferred him to yell this cold disappointment was worse than anything 
 
 sir he said a little desperately it that i bothered or anything just had otherother thing 
 
 other things on your mind dumbledore finished the sentence for him i see 
 
 silence fell between them again the most uncomfortable silence harry had ever experienced with dumbledore it seemed to go on and on punctuated only by the little grunting snores of the portrait of armando dippet over head harry felt strangely diminished as though he had shrunk a little since he had entered the room 
 
 when he could stand it no longer he said professor dumbledore really sorry i should have done more i should have realized you have asked me to do it if it really important 
 
 thank you for saying that harry said dumbledore quietly may i hope then that you will give this matter higher priority from now on there will be little point in our meeting after tonight unless we have that memory 
 
 do it sir get it from him he said earnestly 
 
 then we shall say no more about it just now said dumbledore more kindly but continue with our story where we left off you remember where that was 
 
 yes sir said harry quickly voldemort killed his father and his grandparents and made it look as though his uncle morfin did it then he went back to hogwarts and he asked he asked professor slughorn about horcruxes he mumbled shamefacedly 
 
 very good said dumbledore now you will remember i hope that i told you at the very outset of these meetings of ours that we would be entering the realms of guesswork and speculation 
 
 yes sir 
 
 thus far as i hope you agree i have shown you reasonably firm sources of fact for my deductions as to what voldemort did until the age of seventeen 
 
 harry nodded 
 
 but now harry said dumbledore now things become murkier and stranger if it was difficult to find evidence about the boy riddle it has been almost impossible to find anyone prepared to reminisce about the man voldemort in fact i doubt whether there is a soul alive apart from himself who could give us a full account of his life since he left hogwarts however i have two last memories that i would like to share with you dumbledore indicated the two little crystal bottles gleaming beside the pensieve i shall then be glad of your opinion as to whether the conclusions i have drawn from them seem likely 
 
 the idea that dumbledore valued his opinion this highly made harry feel even more deeply ashamed that he had failed in the task of retrieving the horcrux memory and he shifted guiltily in his seat as dumbledore raised the first of the two bottles to the light and examined it 
 
 i hope you are not tired of diving into other memories for they are curious recollections these two he said this first one came from a very old by the name of hokey before we see what hokey witnessed i must quickly recount how lord voldemort left hogwarts 
 
 he reached the seventh year of his schooling with as you might have expected top grades in every examination he had taken all around him his classmates were deciding which jobs they were to pursue once they had left hogwarts nearly everybody expected spectacular things from tom riddle prefect head boy winner of the award for special services to the school i know that several teachers professor slughorn amongst them suggested that he join the ministry of magic offered to set up appointments put him in touch with useful contacts he refused all offers the next thing the staff knew voldemort was working at borgin and burkes 
 
 at borgin and burkes harry repeated stunned 
 
 at borgin and burkes repeated dumbledore calmly i think you will see what attractions the place held for him when we have entered memory but this was not first choice of job hardly anyone knew of it at the time as one of the few in whom the then headmaster confidedbut voldemort first approached professor dippet and asked whether he could remain at hogwarts as a teacher 
 
 he wanted to stay here why asked harry more amazed still 
 
 i believe he had several reasons though he confided none of them to professor dippet said dumbledore firstly and very importantly voldemort was i believe more attached to this school than he has ever been to a person hogwarts was where he had been happiest the first and only place he had felt at home 
 
 harry felt slightly uncomfortable at these words for this was exactly how he felt about hogwarts too 
 
 secondly the castle is a stronghold of ancient magic undoubtedly voldemort had penetrated many more of its secrets than most of the students who pass through the place but he may have felt that there were still mysteries to unravel stores of magic to tap 
 
 and thirdly as a teacher he would have had great power and influence over young witches and wizards perhaps he had gained the idea from professor slughorn the teacher with whom he was on best terms who had demonstrated how influential a role a teacher can play i do not imagine for an instant that voldemort envisaged spending the rest of his life at hogwarts but i do think that he saw it as a useful recruiting ground and a place where he might begin to build himself an army 
 
 but he get the job sir 
 
 no he did not professor dippet told him that he was too young at eighteen but invited him to reapply in a few years if he still wished to teach 
 
 how did you feel about that sir asked harry hesitantly 
 
 deeply uneasy said dumbledore i had advised armando against the appointmenti did not give the reasons i have given you for professor dippet was very fond of voldemort and convinced of his honesty but i did not want lord voldemort back at this school and especially not in a position of power 
 
 which job did he want sir what subject did he want to teach 
 
 somehow harry knew the answer even before dumbledore gave it 
 
 defense against the dark arts it was being taught at the time by an old professor by the name of galatea merrythought who had been at hogwarts for nearly fifty years 
 
 so voldemort went off to borgin and burkes and all the staff who had admired him said what a waste it was a brilliant young wizard like that working in a shop however voldemort was no mere assistant polite and handsome and clever he was soon given particular jobs of the type that only exist in a place like borgin and burkes which specializes as you know harry in objects with unusual and powerful properties voldemort was sent to persuade people to part with their treasures for sale by the partners and he was by all accounts unusually gifted at doing this 
 
 bet he was said harry unable to contain himself 
 
 well quite said dumbledore with a faint smile and now it is time to hear from hokey the who worked for a very old very rich witch by the name of hepzibah smith 
 
 dumbledore tapped a bottle with his wand the cork flew out and he tipped the swirling memory into the pensieve saying as he did so after you harry 
 
 harry got to his feet and bent once more over the rippling silver contents of the stone basin until his face touched them he tumbled through dark nothingness and landed in a sitting room in front of an immensely fat old lady wearing an elaborate ginger wig and a brilliant pink set of robes that flowed all around her giving her the look of a melting iced cake she was looking into a small jeweled mirror and dabbing rouge onto her already scarlet cheeks with a large powder puff while the tiniest and oldest harry had ever seen laced her fleshy feet into tight satin slippers 
 
 hurry up hokey said hepzibah imperiously he said come at four only a couple of minutes to and never been late yet 
 
 she tucked away her powder puff as the straightened up the top of the head barely reached the seat of chair and her papery skin hung off her frame just like the crisp linen sheet she wore draped like a toga 
 
 how do i look said hepzibah turning her head to admire the various angles of her face in the mirror 
 
 lovely madam squeaked hokey 
 
 harry could only assume that it was down in contract that she must lie through her teeth when asked this question because hepzibah smith looked a long way from lovely in his opinion 
 
 a tinkling doorbell rang and both mistress and elf jumped 
 
 quick quick here hokey cried hepzibah and the elf scurried out of the room which was so crammed with objects that it was difficult to see how anybody could navigate their way across it without knocking over at least a dozen things there were cabinets full of little lacquered boxes cases full of books shelves of orbs and celestial globes and many flourishing potted plants in brass containers in fact the room looked like a cross between a magical antique shop and a conservatory 
 
 the returned within minutes followed by a tall young man harry had no difficulty whatsoever in recognizing as voldemort he was plainly dressed in a black suit his hair was a little longer than it had been at school and his cheeks were hollowed but all of this suited him he looked more handsome than ever he picked his way through the cramped room with an air that showed he had visited many times before and bowed low over fat little hand brushing it with his lips 
 
 i brought you flowers he said quietly producing a bunch of roses from nowhere 
 
 you naughty boy you have squealed old hepzibah though harry noticed that she had an empty vase standing ready on the nearest little table you do spoil this old lady tom sit down sit down hokey ah 
 
 the had come dashing back into the room carrying a tray of little cakes which she set at her elbow 
 
 help yourself tom said hepzibah i know how you love my cakes now how are you you look pale they overwork you at that shop said it a hundred times 
 
 voldemort smiled mechanically and hepzibah simpered 
 
 well your excuse for visiting this time she asked batting her lashes 
 
 mr burke would like to make an improved offer for the armor said voldemort five hundred galleons he feels it is a more than fair 
 
 now now not so fast or think only here for my trinkets pouted hepzibah 
 
 i am ordered here because of them said voldemort quietly i am only a poor assistant madam who must do as he is told mr burke wishes me to inquire 
 
 oh mr burke phooey said hepzibah waving a little hand something to show you that never shown mr burke can you keep a secret tom will you promise you tell mr burke got it never let me rest if he knew shown it to you and not selling not to burke not to anyone but you tom appreciate it for its history not how many galleons you can get for it 
 
 be glad to see anything miss hepzibah shows me said voldemort quietly and hepzibah gave another girlish giggle 
 
 i had hokey bring it out for me hokey where are you i want to show mr riddle our finest treasure in fact bring both while at it 
 
 here madam squeaked the and harry saw two leather boxes one on top of the other moving across the room as if of their own volition though he knew the tiny elf was holding them over her head as she wended her way between tables pouffes and footstools 
 
 now said hepzibah happily taking the boxes from the elf laying them in her lap and preparing to open the topmost one i think like this tom oh if my family knew i was showing you they wait to get their hands on this 
 
 she opened the lid harry edged forward a little to get a better view and saw what looked like a small golden cup with two finely wrought handles 
 
 i wonder whether you know what it is tom pick it up have a good look whispered hepzibah and voldemort stretched out a hand and lifted the cup by one handle out of its snug silken wrappings harry thought he saw a red gleam in his dark eyes his greedy expression was curiously mirrored on face except that her tiny eyes were fixed upon handsome features 
 
 a badger murmured voldemort examining the engraving upon the cup then this was 
 
 helga as you very well know you clever boy said hepzibah leaning forward with a loud creaking of corsets and actually pinching his hollow cheek i tell you i was distantly descended this has been handed down in the family for years and years lovely it and all sorts of powers supposed to possess too but i tested them thoroughly i just keep it nice and safe in here 
 
 she hooked the cup back off long forefinger and restored it gently to its box too intent upon settling it carefully back into position to notice the shadow that crossed face as the cup was taken away 
 
 now then said hepzibah happily hokey oh yes there you aretake that away now hokey 
 
 the elf obediently took the boxed cup and hepzibah turned her attention to the much flatter box in her lap 
 
 i think like this even more tom she whispered lean in a little dear boy so you can see of course burke knows got this one i bought it from him and i daresay love to get it back when gone 
 
 she slid back the fine filigree clasp and flipped open the box there upon the smooth crimson velvet lay a heavy golden locket 
 
 voldemort reached out his hand without invitation this time and held it up to the light staring at it 
 
 mark he said quietly as the light played upon an ornate serpentine s 
 
 right said hepzibah delighted apparently at the sight of voldemort gazing at her locket transfixed i had to pay an arm and a leg for it but i let it pass not a real treasure like that had to have it for my collection burke bought it apparently from a woman who seemed to have stolen it but had no idea of its true value 
 
 there was no mistaking it this time eyes flashed scarlet at the words and harry saw his knuckles whiten on the chain 
 
 i daresay burke paid her a pittance but there you are pretty it and again all kinds of powers attributed to it though i just keep it nice and safe 
 
 she reached out to take the locket back for a moment harry thought voldemort was not going to let go of it but then it had slid through his fingers and was back in its red velvet cushion 
 
 so there you are tom clear and i hope you enjoyed that 
 
 she looked him full in the face and for the first time harry saw her foolish smile falter 
 
 are you all right dear 
 
 oh yes said voldemort quietly yes very well 
 
 i thoughtbut a trick of the light i suppose said hepzibah looking unnerved and harry guessed that she too had seen the momentary red gleam in eyes here hokey take these away and lock them up again the usual enchantments 
 
 time to leave harry said dumbledore quietly and as the little elf bobbed away bearing the boxes dumbledore grasped harry once again above the elbow and together they rose up through oblivion and back to office 
 
 hepzibah smith died two days after that little scene said dumbledore resuming his seat and indicating that harry should do the same hokey the was convicted by the ministry of poisoning her evening cocoa by accident 
 
 no way said harry angrily 
 
 i see we are of one mind said dumbledore certainly then are many similarities between this death and that of the riddles in both cases somebody else took the blame someone who had a clear memory of having caused the death 
 
 hokey confessed 
 
 she remembered putting something in her cocoa that turned out not to be sugar but a lethal and poison said dumbledore it was concluded that she had not meant to do it but being old and confused 
 
 voldemort modified her memory just like he did with morfin 
 
 yes that is my conclusion too said dumbledore and just as with morfin the ministry was predisposed to suspect hokey 
 
 because she was a said harry he had rarely felt more in sympathy with the society hermione had set up 
 
 precisely said dumbledore she was old she admitted to having tampered with the drink and nobody at the ministry bothered to inquire further as in the case of morfin by the time i traced her and managed to extract this memory her life was almost over but her memory of course proves nothing except that voldemort knew of the existence of the cup and the locket 
 
 by the time hokey was convicted family had realized that two of her greatest treasures were missing it took them a while to be sure of this for she had many hiding places having always guarded her collection most jealously but before they were sure beyond doubt that the cup and the locket were both gone the assistant who had worked at borgin and burkes the young man who had visited hepzibah so regularly and charmed her so well had resigned his post and vanished his superiors had no idea where he had gone they were as surprised as anyone at his disappearance and that was the last that was seen or heard of tom riddle for a very long time 
 
 now said dumbledore if you mind harry i want to pause once more to draw your attention to certain points of our story voldemort had committed another murder whether it was his first since he killed the riddles i do not know but i think it was this time as you will have seen he killed not for revenge but for gain he wanted the two fabulous trophies that poor besotted old woman showed him just as he had once robbed the other children at his orphanage just as he had stolen his uncle ring so he ran off now with cup and locket 
 
 but said harry frowning it seems mad risking everything throwing away his job just for those 
 
 mad to you perhaps but not to voldemort said dumbledore i hope you will understand in due course exactly what those objects meant to him harry but you must admit that it is not difficult to imagine that he saw the locket at least as rightfully his 
 
 the locket maybe said harry but why take the cup as well 
 
 it had belonged to another of founders said dumbledore i think he still felt a great pull toward the school and that he could not resist an object so steeped in hogwarts history there were other reasons i think i hope to be able to demonstrate them to you in due course 
 
 and now for the very last recollection i have to show you at least until you manage to retrieve professor memory for us ten years separates memory and this one ten years during which we can only guess at what lord voldemort was doing 
 
 harry got to his feet once more as dumbledore emptied the last memory into the pensieve 
 
 whose memory is it he asked 
 
 mine said dumbledore 
 
 and harry dived after dumbledore through the shifting silver mass landing in the very office he had just left there was fawkes slumbering happily on his perch and there behind the desk was dumbledore who looked very similar to the dumbledore standing beside harry though both hands were whole and undamaged and his face was perhaps a little less lined the one difference between the office and this one was that it was snowing in the past bluish flecks were drifting past the window in the dark and building up on the outside ledge 
 
 the younger dumbledore seemed to be waiting for something and sure enough moments after their arrival there was a knock on the door and he said enter 
 
 harry let out a hastily stifled gasp voldemort had entered the room his features were not those harry had seen emerge from the great stone cauldron almost two years ago they were not as the eyes were not yet scarlet the face not yet masklike and yet he was no longer handsome tom riddle it was as though his features had been burned and blurred they were waxy and oddly distorted and the whites of the eyes now had a permanently bloody look though the pupils were not yet the slits that harry knew they would become he was wearing a long black cloak and his face was as pale as the snow glistening on his shoulders 
 
 the dumbledore behind the desk showed no sign of surprise evidently this visit had been made by appointment 
 
 good evening tom said dumbledore easily you sit down 
 
 thank you said voldemort and he took the seat to which dumbledore had gesturedthe very seat by the looks of it that harry had just vacated in the present i heard that you had become headmaster he said and his voice was slightly higher and colder than it had been a worthy choice 
 
 i am glad you approve said dumbledore smiling may i offer you a drink 
 
 that would be welcome said voldemort i have come a long way 
 
 dumbledore stood and swept over to the cabinet where he now kept the pensieve but which then was full of bottles having handed voldemort a goblet of wine and poured one for himself he returned to the seat behind his desk 
 
 so tom to what do i owe the pleasure 
 
 voldemort did not answer at once but merely sipped his wine 
 
 they do not call me tom anymore he said these days i am known as 
 
 i know what you are known as said dumbledore smiling pleasantly but to me afraid you will always be tom riddle it is one of the irritating things about old teachers i am afraid that they never quite forget their charges youthful beginnings 
 
 he raised his glass as though toasting voldemort whose face remained expressionless nevertheless harry felt the atmosphere in the room change subtly refusal to use chosen name was a refusal to allow voldemort to dictate the terms of the meeting and harry could tell that voldemort took it as such 
 
 i am surprised you have remained here so long said voldemort after a short pause i always wondered why a wizard such as yourself never wished to leave school 
 
 well said dumbledore still smiling to a wizard such as myself there can be nothing more important than passing on ancient skills helping hone young minds if i remember correctly you once saw the attraction of teaching too 
 
 i see it still said voldemort i merely wondered why youwho are so often asked for advice by the ministry and who have twice i think been offered the post of minister 
 
 three times at the last count actually said dumbledore but the ministry never attracted me as a career again something we have in common i think 
 
 voldemort inclined his head unsmiling and took another sip of wine dumbledore did not break the silence that stretched between them now but waited with a look of pleasant expectancy for voldemort to talk first 
 
 i have returned he said after a little while later perhaps than professor dippet expected but i have returned nevertheless to request again what he once told me i was too young to have i have come to you to ask that you permit me to return to this castle to teach i think you must know that i have seen and done much since i left this place i could show and tell your students things they can gain from no other wizard 
 
 dumbledore considered voldemort over the top of his own goblet for a while before speaking 
 
 yes i certainly do know that you have seen and done much since leaving us he said quietly rumors of your doings have reached your old school tom i should be sorry to believe half of them 
 
 expression remained impassive as he said greatness inspires envy envy engenders spite spite spawns lies you must know this dumbledore 
 
 you call it greatness what you have been doing do you asked dumbledore delicately 
 
 certainly said voldemort and his eyes seemed to burn red i have experimented i have pushed the boundaries of magic further perhaps than they have ever been pushed 
 
 of some kinds of magic dumbledore corrected him quietly of some of others you remain forgive me woefully ignorant 
 
 for the first time voldemort smiled it was a taut leer an evil thing more threatening than a look of rage 
 
 the old argument he said softly but nothing i have seen in the world has supported your famous pronouncements that love is more powerful than my kind of magic dumbledore 
 
 perhaps you have been looking in the wrong places suggested dumbledore 
 
 well then what better place to start my fresh researches than here at hogwarts said voldemort will you let me return will you let me share my knowledge with your students i place myself and my talents at your disposal i am yours to command 
 
 dumbledore raised his eyebrows and what will become of those whom you command what will happen to those who call themselvesor so rumor has itthe death eaters 
 
 harry could tell that voldemort had not expected dumbledore to know this name he saw eyes flash red again and the slitlike nostrils flare 
 
 my friends he said after a pause will carry on without me i am sure 
 
 i am glad to hear that you consider them friends said dumbledore i was under the impression that they are more in the order of servants 
 
 you are mistaken said voldemort 
 
 then if i were to go to the head tonight i would not find a group of themnott rosier muldber dolohovawaiting your return devoted friends indeed to travel this far with you on a snowy night merely to wish you luck as you attempted to secure a teaching post 
 
 there could be no doubt that detailed knowledge of those with whom he was traveling was even less welcome to voldemort however he rallied almost at once 
 
 you are omniscient as ever dumbledore 
 
 oh no merely friendly with the local barmen said dumbledore lightly now tom 
 
 dumbledore set down his empty glass and drew himself up in his seat the tips of his fingers together in a very characteristic gesture 
 
 let us speak openly why have you come here tonight surrounded by henchmen to request a job we both know you do not want 
 
 voldemort looked coldly surprised a job i do not want on the contrary dumbledore i want it very much 
 
 oh you want to come back to hogwarts but you do not want to teach any more than you wanted to when you were eighteen what is it after tom why not try an open request for once 
 
 voldemort sneered 
 
 if you do not want to give me a job 
 
 of course i said dumbledore and i think for a moment you expected me to nevertheless you came here you asked you must have had a purpose 
 
 voldemort stood up he looked less like tom riddle than ever his features thick with rage 
 
 this is your final word 
 
 it is said dumbledore also standing 
 
 then we have nothing more to say to each other 
 
 no nothing said dumbledore and a great sadness filled his face the time is long gone when i could frighten you with a burning wardrobe and force you to make repayment for your crimes but i wish i could tom i wish i could 
 
 for a second harry was on the verge of shouting a pointless warning he was sure that hand had twitched toward his pocket and his wand but then the moment had passed voldemort had turned away the door was closing and he was gone 
 
 harry felt hand close over his arm again and moments later they were standing together on almost the same spot but there was no snow building on the window ledge and hand was blackened and once more 
 
 why said harry at once looking up into face why did he come back did you ever find out 
 
 i have ideas said dumbledore but no more than that 
 
 what ideas sir 
 
 i shall tell you harry when you have retrieved that memory from professor slughorn said dumbledore 
 
 when you have that last piece of the jigsaw everything will i hope be clear to both of us 
 
 harry was still burning with curiosity and even though dumbledore had walked to the door and was holding it open for him he did not move at once 
 
 was he after the defense against the dark arts job again sir he say 
 
 oh he definitely wanted the defense against the dark arts job said dumbledore the aftermath of our little meeting proved that you see we have never been able to keep a defense against the dark arts teacher for longer than a year since i refused the post to lord voldemort

 the half blood prince 
 

lionfish nov chapter twenty xenophilius lovegoodcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 
 harry had not expected hermiones anger to abate over night and was therefore unsurprised that she communicated mainly by dirty looks and pointed silences the next morning ron responded by maintaining an unnaturally somber demeanor in her presence as an outward sign of continuing remorse in fact when all three of them were together harry felt like the only at a poorly attended funeral during those few moments he spent alone with harry however collecting water and searching the undergrowth for mushrooms ron became shamelessly cheery 
 
 someone helped us he kept saying someone sent that doe someones on our side one horcrux down mate 
 
 bolstered by the destruction of the locket they set to debating the possible locations of the other horcruxes and even though they had discussed the matter so often before harry felt optimistic certain that more breakthroughs would succeed the first hermiones sulkiness could not mar his buoyant spirits the sudden upswing in their fortunes the appearance of the mysterious due the recovery of gryffindors sword and above all rons return made harry so happy that it was quite difficult to maintain a straight face 
 
 late in the afternoon he and ron escaped hermiones baleful presence again and under the pretense of scouring the bare hedges for nonexistent blackberries they continued their ongoing exchange of news harry had finally managed to tell ron the whole story of his and hermiones various wanderings right up to the full story of what had happened at godrics hollow ron was now filling harry in on everything he had discovered about the wider wizarding world during his weeks away 
 
 and how did you find out about the taboo he asked harry after explaining the many desperate attempts of to evade the ministry 
 
 the what 
 
 you and hermione have stopped saying name 
 
 oh yeah well its just a bad habit weve slipped into said harry but i havent got a problem calling him v c 
 
 no roared ron causing harry to jump into the hedge and hermione nose buried in a book at the tent entrance to scowl over at them sorry said ron wrenching harry back out of the brambles but the names been jinxed harry thats how they track people using his name breaks protective enchantments it causes some kind of magical disturbance c its how they found us in tottenham court road 
 
 because we used his name 
 
 exactly youve got to give them credit it makes sense it was only people who were serious about standing up to him like dumbledore who even dared use it now theyve put a taboo on it anyone who says it is trackable c way to find order members they nearly got kingsley c 
 
 youre kidding 
 
 yeah a bunch of death eaters cornered him bill said but he fought his way out hes on the run now just like us ron scratched his chin thoughtfully with the end of his wand you dont reckon kingsley could have sent that doe 
 
 his patronus is a lynx we saw it at the wedding remember 
 
 oh yeah 
 
 they moved farther along the hedge away from the tent and hermione 
 
 harry you dont reckon it couldve been dumbledore 
 
 dumbledore what 
 
 ron looked a little embarrassed but said in a low voice dumbledore the doe i mean ron was watching harry out of the corners of his eyes he had the real sword last didnt he 
 
 harry did not laugh at ron because he understood too well the longing behind the question the idea that dumbledore had managed to come back to them that he was watching over them would have inexpressibly comforting he shook his head 
 
 dumbledores dead he said i saw it happen i saw the body hes definitely gone anyway his patronus was a phoenix not a doe 
 
 patronuses can change though cant they said ron tonkss changed didnt it 
 
 yeah but if dumbledore was alive why wouldnt he show himself why wouldnt he just hand us the sword 
 
 search me said ron same reason he didnt give it to you while he was alive same reason he left you an old snitch and hermione a book of kids stories 
 
 which is what asked harry turning to look ron full in the face desperate for the answer 
 
 i dunno said ron sometimes ive thought when ive been a bit hacked off he was having a laugh or c or he just wanted to make it more difficult but i dont think so not anymore he knew what he was doing when he gave me the deluminator didnt he he c well rons ears turned bright red and he became engrossed in a tuft of grass at his feet which he prodded with his toe he mustve known id run out on you 
 
 no harry corrected him he mustve known youd always want to come back 
 
 ron looked grateful but still awkward partly to change the subject harry said speaking of dumbledore have you heard what skeeter wrote about him 
 
 oh yeah said ron at once people are talking about it quite a lot course if things were different itd be huge news dumbledore being pals with grindelwald but now its just something to laugh about for people who didnt like dumbledore and a bit of a slap in the face for everyone who thought he was such a good bloke i dont know that its such a big deal though he was really young when they c 
 
 our age said harry just as he had retorted to hermione and something in his face seemed to decide ron against pursuing the subject 
 
 a large spider sat in the middle of a frosted web in the brambles harry took aim at it with the wand ron had given him the previous night which hermione had since condescended to examine and had decided was made of blackthorn 
 
 engorgio 
 
 the spider gave a little shiver bouncing slightly in the web harry tried again this time the spider grew slightly larger 
 
 stop that said ron sharply im sorry i said dumbledore was young okay 
 
 harry had forgotten rons hatred of spiders 
 
 sorry c reducio 
 
 the spider did not shrink harry looked down at the blackthorn wand every minor spell he had cast with it so far that day had seemed less powerful than those he had produced with his phoenix wand the new one felt intrusively unfamiliar like having somebody elses hand sewn to the end of his arm 
 
 you just need to practice said hermione who had approached them noiselessly from behind and had stood watching anxiously as harry tried to enlarge and reduce the spider its all a matter of confidence harry 
 
 he knew why she wanted it to be all right she still felt guilty about breaking his wand he bit back the retort that sprung to his lips that she could take the blackthorn wand if she thought it made no difference and he would have hers instead keen for them all to be friends again however he agreed but when ron gave hermione a tentative smile she stalked off and vanished behind her book once more 
 
 all three of them returned to the tent when darkness fell and harry took first watch sitting in the entrance he tried to make the blackthorn wand levitate small stones at his feet but his magic still seemed clumsier and less powerful than it had done before hermione was lying on her bunk reading while ron after many nervous glances up at her had taken a small wooden wireless out of his rucksack and started to try to tune it 
 
 theres this one program he told harry in a low voice that tells the news like it really is all the others are on side and are following the ministry line but this one you wait till you hear it its great only they cant do it every night they have to keep changing locations in case theyre raided and you need a password to tune in trouble is i missed the last one 
 
 he drummed lightly on the top of the radio with his wand muttering random words under his breath he threw hermione many covert glances plainly fearing an angry outburst but for all the notice she took of him he might not have been there for ten minutes or so ron tapped and muttered hermione turned the pages of her book and harry continued to practice with the blackthorn wand 
 
 finally hermione climbed down from her bunk ron ceased his tapping at once 
 
 if its annoying you ill stop he told hermione nervously 
 
 hermione did not deign to respond but approached harry 
 
 we need to talk she said 
 
 he looked at the book still clutched in her hand it was the life and lies of albus dumbledore 
 
 what he said apprehensively it flew through his mind that there was a chapter on him in there he was not sure he felt up to hearing ritas version of his relationship with dumbledore hermiones answer however was completely unexpected 
 
 i want to go and see xenophilius lovegood 
 
 he stared at her 
 
 sorry 
 
 xenophilius lovegood lunas father i want to go and talk to him 
 
 er c why 
 
 she took a deep breath as though bracing herself and said its that mark the mark in beedle the bard look at this 
 
 she thrust the life and lies of albus dumbledore under harrys unwilling eyes and saw a photograph of the original letter that dumbledore had written grindelwald with dumbledores familiar thin slanting handwriting he hated seeing absolute proof that dumbledore really had written those words that they had not been ritas invention 
 
 the signature said hermione look at the signature harry 
 
 he obeyed for a moment he had no idea what she was talking about but looking more closely with the aid of his lit wand he saw that dumbledore had replaced the a of albus with a tiny version of the same triangular mark inscribed upon the tales of beedle the bard 
 
 er c what are you c said ron tentatively but hermione quelled him with a look and turned back to harry 
 
 it keeps cropping up doesnt it she said i know viktor said it was grindelwalds mark but it was definitely on that old grave in godrics hollow and the dates on the headstone were long before grindelwald came along and now this well we cant ask dumbledore or grindelwald what it means c i dont even know whether grindelwalds still alive c but we can ask mr lovegood he was wearing the symbol at the wedding im sure this is important harry 
 
 harry did not answer immediately he looked into her intense eager face and then out into the surrounding darkness thinking after a long pause he said hermione we dont need another godrics hollow we talked ourselves into going there and c 
 
 but it keeps appearing harry dumbledore left me the tales of beedle the bard how do you know were not supposed to find out about the sign 
 
 here we go again harry felt slightly exasperated we keep trying to convince ourselves dumbledore left us secret signs and clues c 
 
 the deluminator turned out to be pretty useful piped up ron i think hermiones right i think we ought to go and see lovegood 
 
 harry threw him a dark look he was quite sure that rons support of hermione had little to do with a desire to know the meaning of the triangular rune 
 
 it wont be like godrics hollow ron added lovegoods on your side harry the quibblers been for you all along it keeps telling everyone theyve got to help you 
 
 im sure this is important said hermione earnestly 
 
 but dont you think if it was dumbledore would have told me about it before he died 
 
 maybe maybe its something you need to find out for yourself said hermione with a faint air of clutching at straws 
 
 yeah said ron sycophantically that makes sense 
 
 no it doesnt snapped hermione but i still think we ought to talk to mr lovegood a symbol that links dumbledore grindelwald and godrics hollow harry im sure we ought to know about this 
 
 i think we should vote on it said ron those in favor of going to see love good c 
 
 his hand flew into the air before hermiones her lips quivered suspiciously as she raised her own 
 
 outvoted harry sorry said ron clapping him on the back 
 
 fine said harry half amused half irritated only once weve seen lovegood lets try and look for some more horcruxes shall we where do the lovegoods live anyway do either of you know 
 
 yeah theyre not far from my place said ron i dunno exactly where but mum and dad always point toward the hills whenever they mention them shouldnt be hard to find 
 
 when hermione had returned to her bunk harry lowered his voice 
 
 you only agreed to try and get back in her good books 
 
 alls fair in love and war said ron brightly and this is a bit of both cheer up its the christmas holidays lunall be home 
 
 they had an excellent view of the village of ottery st catchopole from the breezy hillside to which they disapparated next morning from their high vantage point the village looked like a collection of toy houses in the great slanting shafts of sunlight stretching to earth in the breaks between clouds they stood for a minute or two looking toward the burrow their hands shadowing their eyes but all they could make out were the high hedges and trees of the orchard which afforded the crooked little house protection from muggle eyes 
 
 its weird being this near but not going to visit said ron 
 
 well its not like you havent just seen them you were there for christmas said hermione coldly 
 
 i wasnt at the burrow said ron with an incredulous laugh do you think i was going to go back there and tell them all id walked out on you yeah fred and george wouldve been great about it and ginny shed have been really understanding 
 
 but where have you been then asked hermione surprised 
 
 bill and fleurs new place shell cottage bills always been decent to me he c he wasnt impressed when he heard what id done but he didnt go on about it he knew i was really sorry none of the rest of the family know i was there bill told mum he and fleur werent going home for christmas because they wanted to spend it alone you know first holiday after they were married i dont think fleur minded you know how much she hates celestina warbeck 
 
 ron turned his back on the burrow 
 
 lets try up here he said leading the way over the top of the hill 
 
 they walked for a few hours harry at hermiones insistence hidden beneath the invisibility cloak the cluster of low hills appeared to be uninhabited apart from one small cottage which seemed deserted 
 
 do you think its theirs and theyve gone away for christmas said hermione peering through the window at a neat little kitchen with geraniums on the windowsill ron snorted 
 
 listen ive got a feeling youd be able to tell who lived there if you looked through the lovegoods window lets try the next lot of hills 
 
 so they disapparated a few miles farther north 
 
 aha shouted ron as the wind whipped their hair and clothes ron was pointing upward toward the top of the hill on which they had appeared where a most house rose vertically against the sky a great black cylinder with a ghostly moon hanging behind it in the afternoon sky thats got to be lunas house who else would live in a place like that it looks like a giant rook 
 
 its nothing like a bird said hermione frowning at the tower 
 
 i was talking about a chess rook said ron a castle to you 
 
 rons legs were the longest and he reached the top of the hill first when harry and hermione caught up with him panting and clutching stitches in their sides they found him grinning broadly 
 
 its theirs said ron look 
 
 three signs had been tacked to a gate the first read 
 
 the quibbler editor x lovegood 
 the second 
 
 pick your own mistletoe 
 the third 
 keep off the dirigible plums 
 the gate creaked as they opened it the zigzagging path leading to the front door was overgrown with a variety of odd plants including a bush covered in orange radishlike fruit luna sometimes wore as earrings harry thought he recognized a snargaluff and gave the wizened stump a wide berth two aged crab apple trees bent with the wind stripped of leaves but still heavy with red fruits and bushy crowns of white beaded mistletoe stood sentinel on either side of the front door a little owl with a slightly flattened hawklike head peered down at them from one of the branches 
 
 youd better take off the invisibility cloak harry said hermione its you mr lovegood wants to help not us 
 
 he did as she suggested handing her the cloak to stow in the beaded bag she then rapped three times on the thick black door which was studded with iron nails and bore a knocker shaped like an eagle 
 
 barely ten seconds passed then the door was flung open and there stood xenophilius lovegood barefoot and wearing what appeared to be a stained nightshirt his long white candyfloss hair was dirty and unkempt xenophilius had been positively dapper at bill and fleurs wedding by comparison 
 
 what what is it who are you what do you want he cried in a querulous voice looking first at hermione then at ron and finally at harry upon which his mouth fell open in a perfect comical o 
 
 hello mr lovegood said harry holding out his hand im harry harry potter 
 
 xenophilius did not take harrys hand although the eye that was not pointing inward at his nose slid straight to the scar on harrys forehead 
 
 would it be okay if we came in asked harry theres something wed like to ask you 
 
 i im not sure thats advisable whispered xenophilius he swallowed and cast a quick look around the garden rather a shock my word i im afraid i dont really think i ought to c 
 
 it wont take long said harry slightly disappointed by this welcome 
 
 i c oh all right then come in quickly quickly 
 
 they were barely over the threshold when xenophilius slammed the door shut behind them they were standing in the most peculiar kitchen harry had ever seen the room was perfectly circular so that he felt like being inside a giant pepper pot everything was curved to fit the walls c the stove the sink and the cupboards c and all of it had been painted with flowers insects and birds in bright primary colors harry thought he recognized lunas styles the effect in such and enclosed space was slightly overwhelming 
 
 in the middle of the floor a spiral staircase led to the upper levels there was a great deal of clattering and banging coming from overhead harry wondered what luna could be doing 
 
 youd better come up said xenophilius still looking extremely uncomfortable and he led the way 
 
 the room above seemed to be a combination of living room and workplace and as such was even more cluttered than the kitchen though much smaller and entirely round the room somewhat resembled the room of requirement on the unforgettable occasion that it had transformed itself into a gigantic labyrinth comprised of centuries of hidden objects there were piles upon piles of books and papers on every surface delicately made models of creatures harry did not recognize all flapping wings or snapping jaws hung from the ceiling 
 
 luna was not there the thing that was making such a racket was a wooden object covered in magically turning cogs and wheels it looked like the bizarre offspring of a workbench and a set of shelves but after a moment harry deduced that it was an printing press due to the fact that it was churning out quibblers 
 
 excuse me said xenophilius and he strode over to the machine seized grubbily tablecloth from beneath an immense number of books and papers which all tumbled onto the floor and threw it over the press somewhat muffling the loud bangs and clatters he then faced harry 
 
 why have you come here before harry could speak however hermione let out a small cry of shock 
 
 mr lovegood c whats that 
 
 see was pointing at an enormous gray spiral horn not unlike that of a unicorn which had been mounted on the wall protruding several feet into the room 
 
 it is the horn of a snorkack said xenophilius 
 
 no it isnt said hermione 
 
 hermione muttered harry embarrassed nows not the moment c 
 
 but harry its an erumpent horn its a class b tradeable material and its an extraordinary dangerous thing to have in a house 
 
 howd you know its an erumpent horn asked ron edging away from the horn as fast as he could given the extreme clutter of the room 
 
 theres a description in fantastic beasts and where to find them mr lovegood you need to get rid of it straightaway dont you know it can explode at the slightest touch 
 
 the crumple horned snorkack said xenophilius very clearly a mulish look upon his face is a shy and highly magical creature and its horn c 
 
 mr lovegood i recognize the grooved markings around the base thats an erumpent horn and its incredibly dangerous c i dont know where you got it 
 
 i bought it said xenophilius dogmatically two weeks ago from a delightful young wizard who knew my interest in the exquisite snorkack a christmas surprise for my luna now he said turning to harry why exactly have you come here mr potter 
 
 we need some help said harry before hermione could start again 
 
 ah said xenophilius help hmm 
 
 his good eye moved again to harrys scar he seemed simultaneously terrified and mesmerized 
 
 yes the thing is helping harry potter rather dangerous 
 
 arent you the one who keeps telling everyone its their first duty to help harry said ron in that magazine of yours 
 
 xenophilius glanced behind him at the concealed printing press still banging and clattering beneath the tablecloth 
 
 er c yes i have expressed that view however c 
 
 thats for everyone else to do not you personally said ron 
 
 xenophilius did not answer he kept swallowing his eyes darting between the three of them harry had the impression that he was undergoing some painful internal struggle 
 
 wheres luna asked hermione lets see what she thinks 
 
 xenophilius gulped he seemed to be steeling himself finally he said in a shaky voice difficult to hear over the noise of the printing press luna is down at the stream fishing for freshwater plimpies sheshe will like to see you ill go and call her and then c yes very well i shall try to help you 
 
 he disappeared down the spiral staircase and they heard the front open and close they looked at each other 
 
 cowardly old wart said ron lunas got ten times his guts 
 
 hes probably worried about whatll happen to them if the death eaters find out i was here said harry 
 
 well i agree with ron said hermione awful old hypocrite telling everyone else to help you and trying to worm our of it himself and for heavens sake keep away from that horn 
 
 harry crossed to the window on the far side of the room he could see a stream a thin glittering ribbon lying far below them at the base of the hill they were very high up a bird fluttered past the window as he stared in the direction of the burrow now invisible beyond another line of hills ginny was over there somewhere they were closer to each other today than they had been since bill and fleurs wedding but she could have no idea he was gazing toward her now thinking of her he suppose he ought to be glad of it anyone he came into contact with was in danger xenophiliuss attitude proved that he turned away from the windows and his gaze fell upon another peculiar object standing upon the cluttered curved slide board a stone but of a beautiful but witch wearing a most headdress two objects that resembled golden ear trumpets curved out from the sides a tiny pair of glittering blue wing was stuck to a leather strap that ran over the top of her head while one of the orange radishes had been stuck to a second strap around her forehead 
 
 look at this said harry 
 
 fetching said ron surprised he didnt wear that to the wedding 
 
 they heard the front door close and a moment later xenophilius climbed back up the spiral staircase into the room his thin legs now encase in wellington boots bearing a tray of teacups and a steaming teapot 
 
 ah you have spotted my pet invention he said shoving the tray into hermiones arms and joining harry at the statues side 
 
 modeled fittingly enough upon the head of the beautiful rowens ravenclaw wit beyond measure is a mans greatest treasure 
 
 he indicated the objects like ear trumpets 
 
 these are the wrackpurt siphons c to remove all sources of distraction from the thinkers immediate area here he pointed out the tiny wings a billywig propeller to induce an elevated frame of mind finally he pointed to the orange radish the dirigible plum so as to enhance the ability to accept the extraordinary 
 
 xenophilius strode back to the tea tray which hermione had managed to balance precariously on one of the cluttered side tables 
 
 may i offer you all an infusion of gurdyroots said xenophilius we make it ourselves as he started to pour out the drink which was as deeply purple as beetroot juice he added luna is down beyond bottom bridge she is most excited that you are here she ought not to be too long she has caught nearly enough plumpies to make soup for all of us do sit down and help yourselves to sugar 
 
 now he remove a tottering pile of papers from an armchair and sat down his wellingtoned legs crossed how may i help you mr potter 
 
 well said harry glancing at hermione who nodded encouragingly its about that symbol you were wearing around your neck at bill and fleurs wedding mr lovegood we wondered what it meant 
 
 xenophilius raised his eyebrows 
 
 are you referring to the sign of the deathly hallows

lionfish nov chapter twenty xenophilius lovegoodcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 
 harry had not expected hermiones anger to abate over night and was therefore unsurprised that she communicated mainly by dirty looks and pointed silences the next morning ron responded by maintaining an unnaturally somber demeanor in her presence as an outward sign of continuing remorse in fact when all three of them were together harry felt like the only at a poorly attended funeral during those few moments he spent alone with harry however collecting water and searching the undergrowth for mushrooms ron became shamelessly cheery 
 
 someone helped us he kept saying someone sent that doe someones on our side one horcrux down mate 
 
 bolstered by the destruction of the locket they set to debating the possible locations of the other horcruxes and even though they had discussed the matter so often before harry felt optimistic certain that more breakthroughs would succeed the first hermiones sulkiness could not mar his buoyant spirits the sudden upswing in their fortunes the appearance of the mysterious due the recovery of gryffindors sword and above all rons return made harry so happy that it was quite difficult to maintain a straight face 
 
 late in the afternoon he and ron escaped hermiones baleful presence again and under the pretense of scouring the bare hedges for nonexistent blackberries they continued their ongoing exchange of news harry had finally managed to tell ron the whole story of his and hermiones various wanderings right up to the full story of what had happened at godrics hollow ron was now filling harry in on everything he had discovered about the wider wizarding world during his weeks away 
 
 and how did you find out about the taboo he asked harry after explaining the many desperate attempts of to evade the ministry 
 
 the what 
 
 you and hermione have stopped saying name 
 
 oh yeah well its just a bad habit weve slipped into said harry but i havent got a problem calling him v c 
 
 no roared ron causing harry to jump into the hedge and hermione nose buried in a book at the tent entrance to scowl over at them sorry said ron wrenching harry back out of the brambles but the names been jinxed harry thats how they track people using his name breaks protective enchantments it causes some kind of magical disturbance c its how they found us in tottenham court road 
 
 because we used his name 
 
 exactly youve got to give them credit it makes sense it was only people who were serious about standing up to him like dumbledore who even dared use it now theyve put a taboo on it anyone who says it is trackable c way to find order members they nearly got kingsley c 
 
 youre kidding 
 
 yeah a bunch of death eaters cornered him bill said but he fought his way out hes on the run now just like us ron scratched his chin thoughtfully with the end of his wand you dont reckon kingsley could have sent that doe 
 
 his patronus is a lynx we saw it at the wedding remember 
 
 oh yeah 
 
 they moved farther along the hedge away from the tent and hermione 
 
 harry you dont reckon it couldve been dumbledore 
 
 dumbledore what 
 
 ron looked a little embarrassed but said in a low voice dumbledore the doe i mean ron was watching harry out of the corners of his eyes he had the real sword last didnt he 
 
 harry did not laugh at ron because he understood too well the longing behind the question the idea that dumbledore had managed to come back to them that he was watching over them would have inexpressibly comforting he shook his head 
 
 dumbledores dead he said i saw it happen i saw the body hes definitely gone anyway his patronus was a phoenix not a doe 
 
 patronuses can change though cant they said ron tonkss changed didnt it 
 
 yeah but if dumbledore was alive why wouldnt he show himself why wouldnt he just hand us the sword 
 
 search me said ron same reason he didnt give it to you while he was alive same reason he left you an old snitch and hermione a book of kids stories 
 
 which is what asked harry turning to look ron full in the face desperate for the answer 
 
 i dunno said ron sometimes ive thought when ive been a bit hacked off he was having a laugh or c or he just wanted to make it more difficult but i dont think so not anymore he knew what he was doing when he gave me the deluminator didnt he he c well rons ears turned bright red and he became engrossed in a tuft of grass at his feet which he prodded with his toe he mustve known id run out on you 
 
 no harry corrected him he mustve known youd always want to come back 
 
 ron looked grateful but still awkward partly to change the subject harry said speaking of dumbledore have you heard what skeeter wrote about him 
 
 oh yeah said ron at once people are talking about it quite a lot course if things were different itd be huge news dumbledore being pals with grindelwald but now its just something to laugh about for people who didnt like dumbledore and a bit of a slap in the face for everyone who thought he was such a good bloke i dont know that its such a big deal though he was really young when they c 
 
 our age said harry just as he had retorted to hermione and something in his face seemed to decide ron against pursuing the subject 
 
 a large spider sat in the middle of a frosted web in the brambles harry took aim at it with the wand ron had given him the previous night which hermione had since condescended to examine and had decided was made of blackthorn 
 
 engorgio 
 
 the spider gave a little shiver bouncing slightly in the web harry tried again this time the spider grew slightly larger 
 
 stop that said ron sharply im sorry i said dumbledore was young okay 
 
 harry had forgotten rons hatred of spiders 
 
 sorry c reducio 
 
 the spider did not shrink harry looked down at the blackthorn wand every minor spell he had cast with it so far that day had seemed less powerful than those he had produced with his phoenix wand the new one felt intrusively unfamiliar like having somebody elses hand sewn to the end of his arm 
 
 you just need to practice said hermione who had approached them noiselessly from behind and had stood watching anxiously as harry tried to enlarge and reduce the spider its all a matter of confidence harry 
 
 he knew why she wanted it to be all right she still felt guilty about breaking his wand he bit back the retort that sprung to his lips that she could take the blackthorn wand if she thought it made no difference and he would have hers instead keen for them all to be friends again however he agreed but when ron gave hermione a tentative smile she stalked off and vanished behind her book once more 
 
 all three of them returned to the tent when darkness fell and harry took first watch sitting in the entrance he tried to make the blackthorn wand levitate small stones at his feet but his magic still seemed clumsier and less powerful than it had done before hermione was lying on her bunk reading while ron after many nervous glances up at her had taken a small wooden wireless out of his rucksack and started to try to tune it 
 
 theres this one program he told harry in a low voice that tells the news like it really is all the others are on side and are following the ministry line but this one you wait till you hear it its great only they cant do it every night they have to keep changing locations in case theyre raided and you need a password to tune in trouble is i missed the last one 
 
 he drummed lightly on the top of the radio with his wand muttering random words under his breath he threw hermione many covert glances plainly fearing an angry outburst but for all the notice she took of him he might not have been there for ten minutes or so ron tapped and muttered hermione turned the pages of her book and harry continued to practice with the blackthorn wand 
 
 finally hermione climbed down from her bunk ron ceased his tapping at once 
 
 if its annoying you ill stop he told hermione nervously 
 
 hermione did not deign to respond but approached harry 
 
 we need to talk she said 
 
 he looked at the book still clutched in her hand it was the life and lies of albus dumbledore 
 
 what he said apprehensively it flew through his mind that there was a chapter on him in there he was not sure he felt up to hearing ritas version of his relationship with dumbledore hermiones answer however was completely unexpected 
 
 i want to go and see xenophilius lovegood 
 
 he stared at her 
 
 sorry 
 
 xenophilius lovegood lunas father i want to go and talk to him 
 
 er c why 
 
 she took a deep breath as though bracing herself and said its that mark the mark in beedle the bard look at this 
 
 she thrust the life and lies of albus dumbledore under harrys unwilling eyes and saw a photograph of the original letter that dumbledore had written grindelwald with dumbledores familiar thin slanting handwriting he hated seeing absolute proof that dumbledore really had written those words that they had not been ritas invention 
 
 the signature said hermione look at the signature harry 
 
 he obeyed for a moment he had no idea what she was talking about but looking more closely with the aid of his lit wand he saw that dumbledore had replaced the a of albus with a tiny version of the same triangular mark inscribed upon the tales of beedle the bard 
 
 er c what are you c said ron tentatively but hermione quelled him with a look and turned back to harry 
 
 it keeps cropping up doesnt it she said i know viktor said it was grindelwalds mark but it was definitely on that old grave in godrics hollow and the dates on the headstone were long before grindelwald came along and now this well we cant ask dumbledore or grindelwald what it means c i dont even know whether grindelwalds still alive c but we can ask mr lovegood he was wearing the symbol at the wedding im sure this is important harry 
 
 harry did not answer immediately he looked into her intense eager face and then out into the surrounding darkness thinking after a long pause he said hermione we dont need another godrics hollow we talked ourselves into going there and c 
 
 but it keeps appearing harry dumbledore left me the tales of beedle the bard how do you know were not supposed to find out about the sign 
 
 here we go again harry felt slightly exasperated we keep trying to convince ourselves dumbledore left us secret signs and clues c 
 
 the deluminator turned out to be pretty useful piped up ron i think hermiones right i think we ought to go and see lovegood 
 
 harry threw him a dark look he was quite sure that rons support of hermione had little to do with a desire to know the meaning of the triangular rune 
 
 it wont be like godrics hollow ron added lovegoods on your side harry the quibblers been for you all along it keeps telling everyone theyve got to help you 
 
 im sure this is important said hermione earnestly 
 
 but dont you think if it was dumbledore would have told me about it before he died 
 
 maybe maybe its something you need to find out for yourself said hermione with a faint air of clutching at straws 
 
 yeah said ron sycophantically that makes sense 
 
 no it doesnt snapped hermione but i still think we ought to talk to mr lovegood a symbol that links dumbledore grindelwald and godrics hollow harry im sure we ought to know about this 
 
 i think we should vote on it said ron those in favor of going to see love good c 
 
 his hand flew into the air before hermiones her lips quivered suspiciously as she raised her own 
 
 outvoted harry sorry said ron clapping him on the back 
 
 fine said harry half amused half irritated only once weve seen lovegood lets try and look for some more horcruxes shall we where do the lovegoods live anyway do either of you know 
 
 yeah theyre not far from my place said ron i dunno exactly where but mum and dad always point toward the hills whenever they mention them shouldnt be hard to find 
 
 when hermione had returned to her bunk harry lowered his voice 
 
 you only agreed to try and get back in her good books 
 
 alls fair in love and war said ron brightly and this is a bit of both cheer up its the christmas holidays lunall be home 
 
 they had an excellent view of the village of ottery st catchopole from the breezy hillside to which they disapparated next morning from their high vantage point the village looked like a collection of toy houses in the great slanting shafts of sunlight stretching to earth in the breaks between clouds they stood for a minute or two looking toward the burrow their hands shadowing their eyes but all they could make out were the high hedges and trees of the orchard which afforded the crooked little house protection from muggle eyes 
 
 its weird being this near but not going to visit said ron 
 
 well its not like you havent just seen them you were there for christmas said hermione coldly 
 
 i wasnt at the burrow said ron with an incredulous laugh do you think i was going to go back there and tell them all id walked out on you yeah fred and george wouldve been great about it and ginny shed have been really understanding 
 
 but where have you been then asked hermione surprised 
 
 bill and fleurs new place shell cottage bills always been decent to me he c he wasnt impressed when he heard what id done but he didnt go on about it he knew i was really sorry none of the rest of the family know i was there bill told mum he and fleur werent going home for christmas because they wanted to spend it alone you know first holiday after they were married i dont think fleur minded you know how much she hates celestina warbeck 
 
 ron turned his back on the burrow 
 
 lets try up here he said leading the way over the top of the hill 
 
 they walked for a few hours harry at hermiones insistence hidden beneath the invisibility cloak the cluster of low hills appeared to be uninhabited apart from one small cottage which seemed deserted 
 
 do you think its theirs and theyve gone away for christmas said hermione peering through the window at a neat little kitchen with geraniums on the windowsill ron snorted 
 
 listen ive got a feeling youd be able to tell who lived there if you looked through the lovegoods window lets try the next lot of hills 
 
 so they disapparated a few miles farther north 
 
 aha shouted ron as the wind whipped their hair and clothes ron was pointing upward toward the top of the hill on which they had appeared where a most house rose vertically against the sky a great black cylinder with a ghostly moon hanging behind it in the afternoon sky thats got to be lunas house who else would live in a place like that it looks like a giant rook 
 
 its nothing like a bird said hermione frowning at the tower 
 
 i was talking about a chess rook said ron a castle to you 
 
 rons legs were the longest and he reached the top of the hill first when harry and hermione caught up with him panting and clutching stitches in their sides they found him grinning broadly 
 
 its theirs said ron look 
 
 three signs had been tacked to a gate the first read 
 
 the quibbler editor x lovegood 
 the second 
 
 pick your own mistletoe 
 the third 
 keep off the dirigible plums 
 the gate creaked as they opened it the zigzagging path leading to the front door was overgrown with a variety of odd plants including a bush covered in orange radishlike fruit luna sometimes wore as earrings harry thought he recognized a snargaluff and gave the wizened stump a wide berth two aged crab apple trees bent with the wind stripped of leaves but still heavy with red fruits and bushy crowns of white beaded mistletoe stood sentinel on either side of the front door a little owl with a slightly flattened hawklike head peered down at them from one of the branches 
 
 youd better take off the invisibility cloak harry said hermione its you mr lovegood wants to help not us 
 
 he did as she suggested handing her the cloak to stow in the beaded bag she then rapped three times on the thick black door which was studded with iron nails and bore a knocker shaped like an eagle 
 
 barely ten seconds passed then the door was flung open and there stood xenophilius lovegood barefoot and wearing what appeared to be a stained nightshirt his long white candyfloss hair was dirty and unkempt xenophilius had been positively dapper at bill and fleurs wedding by comparison 
 
 what what is it who are you what do you want he cried in a querulous voice looking first at hermione then at ron and finally at harry upon which his mouth fell open in a perfect comical o 
 
 hello mr lovegood said harry holding out his hand im harry harry potter 
 
 xenophilius did not take harrys hand although the eye that was not pointing inward at his nose slid straight to the scar on harrys forehead 
 
 would it be okay if we came in asked harry theres something wed like to ask you 
 
 i im not sure thats advisable whispered xenophilius he swallowed and cast a quick look around the garden rather a shock my word i im afraid i dont really think i ought to c 
 
 it wont take long said harry slightly disappointed by this welcome 
 
 i c oh all right then come in quickly quickly 
 
 they were barely over the threshold when xenophilius slammed the door shut behind them they were standing in the most peculiar kitchen harry had ever seen the room was perfectly circular so that he felt like being inside a giant pepper pot everything was curved to fit the walls c the stove the sink and the cupboards c and all of it had been painted with flowers insects and birds in bright primary colors harry thought he recognized lunas styles the effect in such and enclosed space was slightly overwhelming 
 
 in the middle of the floor a spiral staircase led to the upper levels there was a great deal of clattering and banging coming from overhead harry wondered what luna could be doing 
 
 youd better come up said xenophilius still looking extremely uncomfortable and he led the way 
 
 the room above seemed to be a combination of living room and workplace and as such was even more cluttered than the kitchen though much smaller and entirely round the room somewhat resembled the room of requirement on the unforgettable occasion that it had transformed itself into a gigantic labyrinth comprised of centuries of hidden objects there were piles upon piles of books and papers on every surface delicately made models of creatures harry did not recognize all flapping wings or snapping jaws hung from the ceiling 
 
 luna was not there the thing that was making such a racket was a wooden object covered in magically turning cogs and wheels it looked like the bizarre offspring of a workbench and a set of shelves but after a moment harry deduced that it was an printing press due to the fact that it was churning out quibblers 
 
 excuse me said xenophilius and he strode over to the machine seized grubbily tablecloth from beneath an immense number of books and papers which all tumbled onto the floor and threw it over the press somewhat muffling the loud bangs and clatters he then faced harry 
 
 why have you come here before harry could speak however hermione let out a small cry of shock 
 
 mr lovegood c whats that 
 
 see was pointing at an enormous gray spiral horn not unlike that of a unicorn which had been mounted on the wall protruding several feet into the room

 hermione muttered harry embarrassed nows not the moment c

 fairy tales of hans christian andersen 
 little claus and big claus 
 by hans christian andersen 
 
 in a village there once lived two men who had the same name 
 they were both called claus one of them had four horses but the 
 other had only one so to distinguish them people called the owner of 
 the four horses great claus and he who had only one little 
 claus now we shall hear what happened to them for this is a true 
 story 
 
 through the whole week little claus was obliged to plough for 
 great claus and lend him his one horse and once a week on a sunday great claus lent him all his four horses then how little claus would smack his whip over all five horses they were as good as his own on that one day the sun shone brightly and the church bells were ringing merrily as the people passed by dressed in their best clothes with their under their arms they were going to hear the clergyman preach they looked at little claus ploughing with his five horses and he was so proud that he smacked his whip and said my five horses 
 
 you must not say that said big claus for only one of them 
 belongs to you but little claus soon forgot what he ought to say 
 and when any one passed he would call out my five horses 
 
 now i must beg you not to say that again said big claus for 
 if you do i shall hit your horse on the head so that he will drop 
 dead on the spot and there will be an end of him 
 
 i promise you i will not say it any more said the other but as 
 soon as people came by nodding to him and wishing him good day he became so pleased and thought how grand it looked to have five horses ploughing in his field that he cried out again all my horses 
 
 your horses for you said big claus and seizing a 
 hammer he struck the one horse of little claus on the head and he 
 fell dead instantly 
 
 oh now i have no horse at all said little claus weeping but 
 after a while he took off the dead skin and hung the hide 
 to dry in the wind then he put the dry skin into a bag and 
 placing it over his shoulder went out into the next town to sell 
 the skin he had a very long way to go and had to pass 
 through a dark gloomy forest presently a storm arose and he lost 
 his way and before he discovered the right path evening came on and it was still a long way to the town and too far to return home before night near the road stood a large farmhouse the shutters outside the windows were closed but lights shone through the crevices at the top 
 
 i might get permission to stay here for the night thought little 
 claus so he went up to the door and knocked the wife opened the door but when she heard what he wanted she told him to go away as her husband would not allow her to admit strangers 
 then i shall be obliged to lie out here said little claus to himself as the wife shut the door in his face near to the farmhouse 
 stood a large haystack and between it and the house was a small shed with a thatched roof i can lie up there said little claus as he 
 saw the roof it will make a famous bed but i hope the stork will 
 not fly down and bite my legs for on it stood a living stork 
 whose nest was in the roof so little claus climbed to the roof of the 
 shed and while he turned himself to get comfortable he discovered 
 that the wooden shutters which were closed did not reach to the tops of the windows of the farmhouse so that he could see into a room in which a large table was laid out with wine roast meat and a 
 splendid fish the wife and the sexton were sitting at the 
 table together and she filled his glass and helped him plenteously 
 to fish which appeared to be his favorite dish if i could only 
 get some too thought little claus and then as he stretched his 
 neck towards the window he spied a large beautiful pie indeed 
 they had a glorious feast before them 
 
 at this moment he heard some one riding down the road towards the 
 farmhouse it was the farmer returning home he was a good man but still he had a very strange prejudice he could not bear the sight of a sexton if one appeared before him he would put himself in a 
 terrible rage in consequence of this dislike the sexton had gone 
 to visit the wife during her absence from home and the good woman had placed before him the best she had in the house to eat when she heard the farmer coming she was frightened and begged the sexton to hide himself in a large empty chest that stood in the room he did so for he knew her husband could not endure the sight of a sexton the woman then quickly put away the wine and hid all the rest of the nice things in the oven for if her husband had seen them he would have asked what they were brought out for oh dear sighed little claus from the top of the shed as he saw all the good things disappear 
 
 is any one up there asked the farmer looking up and 
 discovering little claus why are you lying up there come down 
 and come into the house with me so little claus came down and told the farmer how he had lost his way and begged for a lodging 
 
 all right said the farmer but we must have something to eat 
 first 
 
 the woman received them both very kindly laid the cloth on a 
 large table and placed before them a dish of porridge the farmer was very hungry and ate his porridge with a good appetite but little 
 claus could not help thinking of the nice roast meat fish and pies 
 which he knew were in the oven under the table at his feet lay 
 the sack containing the skin which he intended to sell at the 
 next town now little claus did not relish the porridge at all so 
 he trod with his foot on the sack under the table and the dry skin 
 squeaked quite loud hush said little claus to his sack at the 
 same time treading upon it again till it squeaked louder than before 
 hallo what have you got in your sack asked the farmer 
 
 oh it is a conjuror said little claus and he says we need 
 not eat porridge for he has conjured the oven full of roast meat 
 fish and pie 
 
 wonderful cried the farmer starting up and opening the oven 
 door and there lay all the nice things hidden by the wife 
 but which he supposed had been conjured there by the wizard under 
 the table the woman dared not say anything so she placed the 
 things before them and they both ate of the fish the meat and the 
 pastry 
 
 then little claus trod again upon his sack and it squeaked as 
 before what does he say now asked the farmer 
 
 he says replied little claus that there are three bottles 
 of wine for us standing in the corner by the oven 
 
 so the woman was obliged to bring out the wine also which she had 
 hidden and the farmer drank it till he became quite merry he would 
 have liked such a conjuror as little claus carried in his sack could 
 he conjure up the evil one asked the farmer i should like to see 
 him now while i am so merry 
 
 oh yes replied little claus my conjuror can do anything i 
 ask him can you not he asked treading at the same time on the 
 sack till it squeaked do you hear he answers yes but he fears 
 that we shall not like to look at him 
 
 oh i am not afraid what will he be like 
 
 well he is very much like a sexton 
 
 ha said the farmer then he must be ugly do you know i cannot 
 endure the sight of a sexton however that matter i shall 
 know who it is so i shall not mind now then i have got up my 
 courage but let him come too near me 
 
 stop i must ask the conjuror said little claus so he trod 
 on the bag and stooped his ear down to listen 
 
 what does he say 
 
 he says that you must go and open that large chest which stands 
 in the corner and you will see the evil one crouching down inside 
 but you must hold the lid firmly that he may not slip out 
 
 will you come and help me hold it said the farmer going 
 towards the chest in which his wife had hidden the sexton who now lay inside very much frightened the farmer opened the lid a very 
 little way and peeped in 
 
 oh cried he springing backwards i saw him and he is exactly 
 like our sexton how dreadful it is so after that he was obliged 
 to drink again and they sat and drank till far into the night 
 
 you must sell your conjuror to me said the farmer ask as much 
 as you like i will pay it indeed i would give you directly a whole 
 bushel of gold 
 
 no indeed i cannot said little claus only think how much 
 profit i could make out of this conjuror 
 
 but i should like to have him said the fanner still continuing 
 his entreaties 
 
 well said little claus at length you have been so good as 
 to give me a lodging i will not refuse you you shall have 
 the conjuror for a bushel of money but i will have quite full 
 measure 
 
 so you shall said the farmer but you must take away the chest 
 as well i would not have it in the house another hour there is no 
 knowing if he may not be still there 
 
 so little claus gave the farmer the sack containing the dried 
 skin and received in exchange a bushel of money full 
 measure the farmer also gave him a wheelbarrow on which to carry away the chest and the gold 
 
 farewell said little claus as he went off with his money and 
 the great chest in which the sexton lay still concealed on one 
 side of the forest was a broad deep river the water flowed so 
 rapidly that very few were able to swim against the stream a new 
 bridge had lately been built across it and in the middle of this 
 bridge little claus stopped and said loud enough to be heard by 
 the sexton now what shall i do with this stupid chest it is as 
 heavy as if it were full of stones i shall be tired if i roll it 
 any farther so i may as well throw it in the river if it swims after 
 me to my house well and good and if not it will not much matter 
 so he seized the chest in his hand and lifted it up a little as 
 if he were going to throw it into the water 
 
 no leave it alone cried the sexton from within the chest let 
 me out first 
 
 oh exclaimed little claus pretending to be frightened he 
 is in there still is he i must throw him into the river that he may 
 be drowned 
 
 oh no oh no cried the sexton i will give you a whole 
 bushel full of money if you will let me go 
 
 why that is another matter said little claus opening the 
 chest the sexton crept out pushed the empty chest into the water 
 and went to his house then he measured out a whole bushel full of 
 gold for little claus who had already received one from the farmer 
 so that now he had a barrow full 
 
 i have been well paid for my horse said he to himself when he 
 reached home entered his own room and emptied all his money into a heap on the floor how vexed great claus will be when he finds out how rich i have become all through my one horse but i shall not 
 tell him exactly how it all happened then he sent a boy to great 
 claus to borrow a bushel measure 
 
 what can he want it for thought great claus so he smeared 
 the bottom of the measure with tar that some of whatever was put into it might stick there and remain and so it happened for when the 
 measure returned three new silver florins were sticking to it 
 
 what does this mean said great claus so he ran off directly to 
 little claus and asked where did you get so much money 
 
 oh for my skin i sold it yesterday 
 
 it was certainly well paid for then said great claus and he 
 ran home to his house seized a hatchet and knocked all his four 
 horses on the head flayed off their skins and took them to the 
 town to sell skins skins buy skins he cried as he went 
 through the streets all the shoemakers and tanners came running 
 and asked how much he wanted for them 
 
 a bushel of money for each replied great claus 
 
 are you mad they all cried do you think we have money to 
 spend by the bushel 
 
 skins skins he cried again buy skins but to all who 
 inquired the price his answer was a bushel of money 
 
 he is making fools of us said they all then the shoemakers 
 took their straps and the tanners their leather aprons and began 
 to beat great claus 
 
 skins skins they cried mocking him yes mark your 
 skin for you till it is black and blue 
 
 out of the town with him said they and great claus was obliged 
 to run as fast as he could he had never before been so thoroughly 
 beaten 
 
 ah said he as he came to his house little claus shall pay me 
 for this i will beat him to death 
 
 meanwhile the old grandmother of little claus died she had been 
 cross unkind and really spiteful to him but he was very sorry 
 and took the dead woman and laid her in his warm bed to see if he 
 could bring her to life again there he determined that she should lie 
 the whole night while he seated himself in a chair in a corner of the 
 room as he had often done before during the night as he sat there 
 the door opened and in came great claus with a hatchet he knew 
 well where little bed stood so he went right up to it and 
 struck the old grandmother on the head thinking it must be little 
 claus 
 
 there cried he now you cannot make a fool of me again and 
 then he went home 
 
 that is a very wicked man thought little claus he meant to 
 kill me it is a good thing for my old grandmother that she was 
 already dead or he would have taken her life then he dressed his 
 old grandmother in her best clothes borrowed a horse of his harnessed it to a cart then he placed the old woman on the back seat so that she might not fall out as he drove and rode away through the wood by sunrise they reached a large inn where little claus stopped and went to get something to eat the landlord was a rich man and a good man too but as passionate as if he had been made of pepper and snuff 
 
 good morning said he to little claus you are come betimes 
 
 
 yes said little claus i am going to the town with my old 
 grandmother she is sitting at the back of the wagon but i cannot 
 bring her into the room will you take her a glass of mead but you 
 must speak very loud for she cannot hear well 
 
 yes certainly i will replied the landlord and pouring out 
 a glass of mead he carried it out to the dead grandmother who sat 
 upright in the cart here is a glass of mead from your grandson 
 said the landlord the dead woman did not answer a word but sat quite still do you not hear cried the landlord as loud as he could 
 here is a glass of mead from your grandson 
 
 again and again he bawled it out but as she did not stir he 
 flew into a passion and threw the glass of mead in her face it 
 struck her on the nose and she fell backwards out of the cart for 
 she was only seated there not tied in 
 
 hallo cried little claus rushing out of the door and seizing 
 hold of the landlord by the throat you have killed my grandmother 
 see here is a great hole in her forehead 
 
 oh how unfortunate said the landlord wringing his hands 
 this all comes of my fiery temper dear little claus i will give you 
 a bushel of money i will bury your grandmother as if she were my own only keep silent or else they will cut off my head and that would be disagreeable 
 
 so it happened that little claus received another bushel of money 
 and the landlord buried his old grandmother as if she had been his 
 own when little claus reached home again he immediately sent a boy to great claus requesting him to lend him a bushel measure how is this thought great claus did i not kill him i must go and see for myself so he went to little claus and took the bushel measure with him how did you get all this money asked great claus staring with wide open eyes at his treasures 
 
 you killed my grandmother instead of me said little claus 
 
 so i have sold her for a bushel of money 
 
 that is a good price at all events said great claus so he went 
 home took a hatchet and killed his old grandmother with one blow 
 then he placed her on a cart and drove into the town to the 
 apothecary and asked him if he would buy a dead body 
 whose is it and where did you get it asked the apothecary 
 
 it is my grandmother he replied i killed her with a blow 
 that i might get a bushel of money for her 
 
 heaven preserve us cried the apothecary you are out of your 
 mind say such things or you will lose your head and then 
 he talked to him seriously about the wicked deed he had done and told him that such a wicked man would surely be punished great claus got so frightened that he rushed out of the surgery jumped into the cart whipped up his horses and drove home quickly the apothecary and all the people thought him mad and let him drive where he liked 
 
 you shall pay for this said great claus as soon as he got into 
 the highroad that you shall little claus so as soon as he reached 
 home he took the largest sack he could find and went over to little 
 claus you have played me another trick said he first i killed 
 all my horses and then my old grandmother and it is all your 
 fault but you shall not make a fool of me any more so he laid 
 hold of little claus round the body and pushed him into the sack 
 which he took on his shoulders saying now going to drown you in the river 
 
 he had a long way to go before he reached the river and little 
 claus was not a very light weight to carry the road led by the 
 church and as they passed he could hear the organ playing and the 
 people singing beautifully great claus put down the sack close to the 
 and thought he might as well go in and hear a psalm 
 before he went any farther little claus could not possibly get out of 
 the sack and all the people were in church so in he went 
 
 oh dear oh dear sighed little claus in the sack as he turned and twisted about but he found he could not loosen the string with which it was tied presently an old cattle driver with snowy hair passed by carrying a large staff in his hand with which he drove a large herd of cows and oxen before him they stumbled against the sack in which lay little claus and turned it over oh dear sighed little claus i am very young yet i am soon going to heaven 
 
 and i poor fellow said the drover i who am so old already 
 cannot get there 
 
 open the sack cried little claus creep into it instead of me 
 and you will soon be there 
 
 with all my heart replied the drover opening the sack from 
 which sprung little claus as quickly as possible will you take 
 care of my cattle said the old man as he crept into the bag 
 
 yes said little claus and he tied up the sack and then walked 
 off with all the cows and oxen 
 
 when great claus came out of church he took up the sack and 
 placed it on his shoulders it appeared to have become lighter for 
 the old drover was not half so heavy as little claus 
 
 how light he seems now said he ah it is because i have 
 been to a church so he walked on to the river which was deep and 
 broad and threw the sack containing the old drover into the water 
 believing it to be little claus there you may lie he exclaimed 
 
 you will play me no more tricks now then he turned to go home 
 but when he came to a place where two roads crossed there was 
 little claus driving the cattle how is this said great claus did 
 i not drown you just now 
 
 yes said little claus you threw me into the river about 
 half an hour ago 
 
 but wherever did you get all these fine beasts asked great 
 claus 
 
 these beasts are replied little claus tell 
 you the whole story and thank you for drowning me i am above you 
 now i am really very rich i was frightened to be sure while i 
 lay tied up in the sack and the wind whistled in my ears when you 
 threw me into the river from the bridge and i sank to the bottom 
 immediately but i did not hurt myself for i fell upon beautifully 
 soft grass which grows down there and in a moment the sack opened and the sweetest little maiden came towards me she had robes and a wreath of green leaves on her wet hair she took me by the hand and said so you are come little claus and here are some cattle for you to begin with about a mile farther on the road there is another herd for you then i saw that the river formed a great highway for the people who live in the sea they were walking 
 and driving here and there from the sea to the land at the spot where 
 the river terminates the bed of the river was covered with the 
 loveliest flowers and sweet fresh grass the fish swam past me as 
 rapidly as the birds do here in the air how handsome all the people 
 were and what fine cattle were grazing on the hills and in the 
 valleys 
 
 but why did you come up again said great claus if it was 
 all so beautiful down there i should not have done so 
 well said little claus it was good policy on my part you 
 heard me say just now that i was told by the to go a mile 
 farther on the road and i should find a whole herd of cattle by 
 the road she meant the river for she could not travel any other 
 way but i knew the winding of the river and how it bends 
 sometimes to the right and sometimes to the left and it seemed a long 
 way so i chose a shorter one and by coming up to the land and then driving across the fields back again to the river i shall save half a 
 mile and get all my cattle more quickly 
 
 what a lucky fellow you are exclaimed great claus do you 
 think i should get any if i went down to the bottom of 
 the river 
 
 yes i think so said little claus but i cannot carry you 
 there in a sack you are too heavy however if you will go there 
 first and then creep into a sack i will throw you in with the 
 greatest pleasure 
 
 thank you said great claus but remember if i do not get 
 any down there i shall come up again and give you a good 
 thrashing 
 
 no now be too fierce about it said little claus as 
 they walked on towards the river when they approached it the cattle 
 who were very thirsty saw the stream and ran down to drink 
 
 see what a hurry they are in said little claus they are 
 longing to get down again 
 
 come help me make haste said great claus or get 
 beaten so he crept into a large sack which had been lying across 
 the back of one of the oxen 
 
 put in a stone said great claus or i may not sink 
 
 oh not much fear of that he replied still he put a 
 large stone into the bag and then tied it tightly and gave it a 
 push 
 
 plump in went great claus and immediately sank to the bottom 
 of the river 
 
 afraid he will not find any cattle said little claus and 
 then he drove his own beasts homewards

 fairy tales of hans christian andersen 
 little claus and big claus 
 by hans christian andersen 
 
 in a village there once lived two men who had the same name 
 they were both called claus one of them had four horses but the 
 other had only one so to distinguish them people called the owner of 
 the four horses great claus and he who had only one little 
 claus now we shall hear what happened to them for this is a true 
 story 
 
 through the whole week little claus was obliged to plough for 
 great claus and lend him his one horse and once a week on a sunday great claus lent him all his four horses then how little claus would smack his whip over all five horses they were as good as his own on that one day the sun shone brightly and the church bells were ringing merrily as the people passed by dressed in their best clothes with their under their arms they were going to hear the clergyman preach they looked at little claus ploughing with his five horses and he was so proud that he smacked his whip and said my five horses 
 
 you must not say that said big claus for only one of them 
 belongs to you but little claus soon forgot what he ought to say 
 and when any one passed he would call out my five horses 
 
 now i must beg you not to say that again said big claus for 
 if you do i shall hit your horse on the head so that he will drop 
 dead on the spot and there will be an end of him 
 
 i promise you i will not say it any more said the other but as 
 soon as people came by nodding to him and wishing him good day he became so pleased and thought how grand it looked to have five horses ploughing in his field that he cried out again all my horses 
 
 your horses for you said big claus and seizing a 
 hammer he struck the one horse of little claus on the head and he 
 fell dead instantly 
 
 oh now i have no horse at all said little claus weeping but 
 after a while he took off the dead skin and hung the hide 
 to dry in the wind then he put the dry skin into a bag and 
 placing it over his shoulder went out into the next town to sell 
 the skin he had a very long way to go and had to pass 
 through a dark gloomy forest presently a storm arose and he lost 
 his way and before he discovered the right path evening came on and it was still a long way to the town and too far to return home before night near the road stood a large farmhouse the shutters outside the windows were closed but lights shone through the crevices at the top 
 
 i might get permission to stay here for the night thought little 
 claus so he went up to the door and knocked the wife opened the door but when she heard what he wanted she told him to go away as her husband would not allow her to admit strangers 
 then i shall be obliged to lie out here said little claus to himself as the wife shut the door in his face near to the farmhouse 
 stood a large haystack and between it and the house was a small shed with a thatched roof i can lie up there said little claus as he 
 saw the roof it will make a famous bed but i hope the stork will 
 not fly down and bite my legs for on it stood a living stork 
 whose nest was in the roof so little claus climbed to the roof of the 
 shed and while he turned himself to get comfortable he discovered 
 that the wooden shutters which were closed did not reach to the tops of the windows of the farmhouse so that he could see into a room in which a large table was laid out with wine roast meat and a 
 splendid fish the wife and the sexton were sitting at the 
 table together and she filled his glass and helped him plenteously 
 to fish which appeared to be his favorite dish if i could only 
 get some too thought little claus and then as he stretched his 
 neck towards the window he spied a large beautiful pie indeed 
 they had a glorious feast before them 
 
 at this moment he heard some one riding down the road towards the 
 farmhouse it was the farmer returning home he was a good man but still he had a very strange prejudice he could not bear the sight of a sexton if one appeared before him he would put himself in a 
 terrible rage in consequence of this dislike the sexton had gone 
 to visit the wife during her absence from home and the good woman had placed before him the best she had in the house to eat when she heard the farmer coming she was frightened and begged the sexton to hide himself in a large empty chest that stood in the room he did so for he knew her husband could not endure the sight of a sexton the woman then quickly put away the wine and hid all the rest of the nice things in the oven for if her husband had seen them he would have asked what they were brought out for oh dear sighed little claus from the top of the shed as he saw all the good things disappear 
 
 is any one up there asked the farmer looking up and 
 discovering little claus why are you lying up there come down 
 and come into the house with me so little claus came down and told the farmer how he had lost his way and begged for a lodging 
 
 all right said the farmer but we must have something to eat 
 first 
 
 the woman received them both very kindly laid the cloth on a 
 large table and placed before them a dish of porridge the farmer was very hungry and ate his porridge with a good appetite but little 
 claus could not help thinking of the nice roast meat fish and pies 
 which he knew were in the oven under the table at his feet lay 
 the sack containing the skin which he intended to sell at the 
 next town now little claus did not relish the porridge at all so 
 he trod with his foot on the sack under the table and the dry skin 
 squeaked quite loud hush said little claus to his sack at the 
 same time treading upon it again till it squeaked louder than before 
 hallo what have you got in your sack asked the farmer 
 
 oh it is a conjuror said little claus and he says we need 
 not eat porridge for he has conjured the oven full of roast meat 
 fish and pie 
 
 wonderful cried the farmer starting up and opening the oven 
 door and there lay all the nice things hidden by the wife 
 but which he supposed had been conjured there by the wizard under 
 the table the woman dared not say anything so she placed the 
 things before them and they both ate of the fish the meat and the 
 pastry 
 
 then little claus trod again upon his sack and it squeaked as 
 before what does he say now asked the farmer 
 
 he says replied little claus that there are three bottles 
 of wine for us standing in the corner by the oven 
 
 so the woman was obliged to bring out the wine also which she had 
 hidden and the farmer drank it till he became quite merry he would 
 have liked such a conjuror as little claus carried in his sack could 
 he conjure up the evil one asked the farmer i should like to see 
 him now while i am so merry 
 
 oh yes replied little claus my conjuror can do anything i 
 ask him can you not he asked treading at the same time on the 
 sack till it squeaked do you hear he answers yes but he fears 
 that we shall not like to look at him 
 
 oh i am not afraid what will he be like 
 
 well he is very much like a sexton 
 
 ha said the farmer then he must be ugly do you know i cannot 
 endure the sight of a sexton however that matter i shall 
 know who it is so i shall not mind now then i have got up my 
 courage but let him come too near me 
 
 stop i must ask the conjuror said little claus so he trod 
 on the bag and stooped his ear down to listen 
 
 what does he say 
 
 he says that you must go and open that large chest which stands 
 in the corner and you will see the evil one crouching down inside 
 but you must hold the lid firmly that he may not slip out 
 
 will you come and help me hold it said the farmer going 
 towards the chest in which his wife had hidden the sexton who now lay inside very much frightened the farmer opened the lid a very 
 little way and peeped in 
 
 oh cried he springing backwards i saw him and he is exactly 
 like our sexton how dreadful it is so after that he was obliged 
 to drink again and they sat and drank till far into the night 
 
 you must sell your conjuror to me said the farmer ask as much 
 as you like i will pay it indeed i would give you directly a whole 
 bushel of gold 
 
 no indeed i cannot said little claus only think how much 
 profit i could make out of this conjuror 
 
 but i should like to have him said the fanner still continuing 
 his entreaties 
 
 well said little claus at length you have been so good as 
 to give me a lodging i will not refuse you you shall have 
 the conjuror for a bushel of money but i will have quite full 
 measure 
 
 so you shall said the farmer but you must take away the chest 
 as well i would not have it in the house another hour there is no 
 knowing if he may not be still there 
 
 so little claus gave the farmer the sack containing the dried 
 skin and received in exchange a bushel of money full 
 measure the farmer also gave him a wheelbarrow on which to carry away the chest and the gold 
 
 farewell said little claus as he went off with his money and 
 the great chest in which the sexton lay still concealed on one 
 side of the forest was a broad deep river the water flowed so 
 rapidly that very few were able to swim against the stream a new 
 bridge had lately been built across it and in the middle of this 
 bridge little claus stopped and said loud enough to be heard by 
 the sexton now what shall i do with this stupid chest it is as 
 heavy as if it were full of stones i shall be tired if i roll it 
 any farther so i may as well throw it in the river if it swims after 
 me to my house well and good and if not it will not much matter 
 so he seized the chest in his hand and lifted it up a little as 
 if he were going to throw it into the water 
 
 no leave it alone cried the sexton from within the chest let 
 me out first 
 
 oh exclaimed little claus pretending to be frightened he 
 is in there still is he i must throw him into the river that he may 
 be drowned 
 
 oh no oh no cried the sexton i will give you a whole 
 bushel full of money if you will let me go 
 
 why that is another matter said little claus opening the 
 chest the sexton crept out pushed the empty chest into the water 
 and went to his house then he measured out a whole bushel full of 
 gold for little claus who had already received one from the farmer 
 so that now he had a barrow full 
 
 i have been well paid for my horse said he to himself when he 
 reached home entered his own room and emptied all his money into a heap on the floor how vexed great claus will be when he finds out how rich i have become all through my one horse but i shall not 
 tell him exactly how it all happened then he sent a boy to great 
 claus to borrow a bushel measure 
 
 what can he want it for thought great claus so he smeared 
 the bottom of the measure with tar that some of whatever was put into it might stick there and remain and so it happened for when the 
 measure returned three new silver florins were sticking to it 
 
 what does this mean said great claus so he ran off directly to 
 little claus and asked where did you get so much money 
 
 oh for my skin i sold it yesterday 
 
 it was certainly well paid for then said great claus and he 
 ran home to his house seized a hatchet and knocked all his four 
 horses on the head flayed off their skins and took them to the 
 town to sell skins skins buy skins he cried as he went 
 through the streets all the shoemakers and tanners came running 
 and asked how much he wanted for them 
 
 a bushel of money for each replied great claus 
 
 are you mad they all cried do you think we have money to 
 spend by the bushel 
 
 skins skins he cried again buy skins but to all who 
 inquired the price his answer was a bushel of money 
 
 he is making fools of us said they all then the shoemakers 
 took their straps and the tanners their leather aprons and began 
 to beat great claus 
 
 skins skins they cried mocking him yes mark your 
 skin for you till it is black and blue 
 
 out of the town with him said they and great claus was obliged 
 to run as fast as he could he had never before been so thoroughly 
 beaten 
 
 ah said he as he came to his house little claus shall pay me 
 for this i will beat him to death 
 
 meanwhile the old grandmother of little claus died she had been 
 cross unkind and really spiteful to him but he was very sorry 
 and took the dead woman and laid her in his warm bed to see if he 
 could bring her to life again there he determined that she should lie 
 the whole night while he seated himself in a chair in a corner of the 
 room as he had often done before during the night as he sat there 
 the door opened and in came great claus with a hatchet he knew 
 well where little bed stood so he went right up to it and 
 struck the old grandmother on the head thinking it must be little 
 claus 
 
 there cried he now you cannot make a fool of me again and 
 then he went home 
 
 that is a very wicked man thought little claus he meant to 
 kill me it is a good thing for my old grandmother that she was 
 already dead or he would have taken her life then he dressed his 
 old grandmother in her best clothes borrowed a horse of his harnessed it to a cart then he placed the old woman on the back seat so that she might not fall out as he drove and rode away through the wood by sunrise they reached a large inn where little claus stopped and went to get something to eat the landlord was a rich man and a good man too but as passionate as if he had been made of pepper and snuff 
 
 good morning said he to little claus you are come betimes 
 
 
 yes said little claus i am going to the town with my old 
 grandmother she is sitting at the back of the wagon but i cannot 
 bring her into the room will you take her a glass of mead but you 
 must speak very loud for she cannot hear well 
 
 yes certainly i will replied the landlord and pouring out 
 a glass of mead he carried it out to the dead grandmother who sat 
 upright in the cart here is a glass of mead from your grandson 
 said the landlord the dead woman did not answer a word but sat quite still do you not hear cried the landlord as loud as he could 
 here is a glass of mead from your grandson 
 
 again and again he bawled it out but as she did not stir he 
 flew into a passion and threw the glass of mead in her face it 
 struck her on the nose and she fell backwards out of the cart for 
 she was only seated there not tied in 
 
 hallo cried little claus rushing out of the door and seizing 
 hold of the landlord by the throat you have killed my grandmother 
 see here is a great hole in her forehead 
 
 oh how unfortunate said the landlord wringing his hands 
 this all comes of my fiery temper dear little claus i will give you 
 a bushel of money i will bury your grandmother as if she were my own only keep silent or else they will cut off my head and that would be disagreeable 
 
 so it happened that little claus received another bushel of money 
 and the landlord buried his old grandmother as if she had been his 
 own when little claus reached home again he immediately sent a boy to great claus requesting him to lend him a bushel measure how is this thought great claus did i not kill him i must go and see for myself so he went to little claus and took the bushel measure with him how did you get all this money asked great claus staring with wide open eyes at his treasures 
 
 you killed my grandmother instead of me said little claus 
 
 so i have sold her for a bushel of money 
 
 that is a good price at all events said great claus so he went 
 home took a hatchet and killed his old grandmother with one blow 
 then he placed her on a cart and drove into the town to the 
 apothecary and asked him if he would buy a dead body 
 whose is it and where did you get it asked the apothecary 
 
 it is my grandmother he replied i killed her with a blow 
 that i might get a bushel of money for her 
 
 heaven preserve us cried the apothecary you are out of your 
 mind say such things or you will lose your head and then 
 he talked to him seriously about the wicked deed he had done and told him that such a wicked man would surely be punished great claus got so frightened that he rushed out of the surgery jumped into the cart whipped up his horses and drove home quickly the apothecary and all the people thought him mad and let him drive where he liked 
 
 you shall pay for this said great claus as soon as he got into 
 the highroad that you shall little claus so as soon as he reached 
 home he took the largest sack he could find and went over to little 
 claus you have played me another trick said he first i killed 
 all my horses and then my old grandmother and it is all your 
 fault but you shall not make a fool of me any more so he laid 
 hold of little claus round the body and pushed him into the sack 
 which he took on his shoulders saying now going to drown you in the river 
 
 he had a long way to go before he reached the river and little 
 claus was not a very light weight to carry the road led by the 
 church and as they passed he could hear the organ playing and the 
 people singing beautifully great claus put down the sack close to the 
 and thought he might as well go in and hear a psalm 
 before he went any farther little claus could not possibly get out of 
 the sack and all the people were in church so in he went 
 
 oh dear oh dear sighed little claus in the sack as he turned and twisted about but he found he could not loosen the string with which it was tied presently an old cattle driver with snowy hair passed by carrying a large staff in his hand with which he drove a large herd of cows and oxen before him they stumbled against the sack in which lay little claus and turned it over oh dear sighed little claus i am very young yet i am soon going to heaven 
 
 and i poor fellow said the drover i who am so old already 
 cannot get there 
 
 open the sack cried little claus creep into it instead of me 
 and you will soon be there 
 
 with all my heart replied the drover opening the sack from 
 which sprung little claus as quickly as possible will you take 
 care of my cattle said the old man as he crept into the bag 
 
 yes said little claus and he tied up the sack and then walked 
 off with all the cows and oxen 
 
 when great claus came out of church he took up the sack and 
 placed it on his shoulders it appeared to have become lighter for 
 the old drover was not half so heavy as little claus 
 
 how light he seems now said he ah it is because i have 
 been to a church so he walked on to the river which was deep and 
 broad and threw the sack containing the old drover into the water 
 believing it to be little claus there you may lie he exclaimed 
 
 you will play me no more tricks now then he turned to go home 
 but when he came to a place where two roads crossed there was 
 little claus driving the cattle how is this said great claus did 
 i not drown you just now 
 
 yes said little claus you threw me into the river about 
 half an hour ago 
 
 but wherever did you get all these fine beasts asked great 
 claus 
 
 these beasts are replied little claus tell 
 you the whole story and thank you for drowning me i am above you 
 now i am really very rich i was frightened to be sure while i 
 lay tied up in the sack and the wind whistled in my ears when you 
 threw me into the river from the bridge and i sank to the bottom 
 immediately but i did not hurt myself for i fell upon beautifully 
 soft grass which grows down there and in a moment the sack opened and the sweetest little maiden came towards me she had robes and a wreath of green leaves on her wet hair she took me by the hand and said so you are come little claus and here are some cattle for you to begin with about a mile farther on the road there is another herd for you then i saw that the river formed a great highway for the people who live in the sea they were walking 
 and driving here and there from the sea to the land at the spot where 
 the river terminates the bed of the river was covered with the 
 loveliest flowers and sweet fresh grass the fish swam past me as 
 rapidly as the birds do here in the air how handsome all the people 
 were and what fine cattle were grazing on the hills and in the 
 valleys 
 
 but why did you come up again said great claus if it was 
 all so beautiful down there i should not have done so 
 well said little claus it was good policy on my part you 
 heard me say just now that i was told by the to go a mile 
 farther on the road and i should find a whole herd of cattle by 
 the road she meant the river for she could not travel any other 
 way but i knew the winding of the river and how it bends 
 sometimes to the right and sometimes to the left and it seemed a long 
 way so i chose a shorter one and by coming up to the land and then driving across the fields back again to the river i shall save half a 
 mile and get all my cattle more quickly 
 
 what a lucky fellow you are exclaimed great claus do you 
 think i should get any if i went down to the bottom of 
 the river 
 
 yes i think so said little claus but i cannot carry you 
 there in a sack you are too heavy however if you will go there 
 first and then creep into a sack i will throw you in with the 
 greatest pleasure 
 
 thank you said great claus but remember if i do not get 
 any down there i shall come up again and give you a good 
 thrashing 
 
 no now be too fierce about it said little claus as 
 they walked on towards the river when they approached it the cattle 
 who were very thirsty saw the stream and ran down to drink 
 
 see what a hurry they are in said little claus they are 
 longing to get down again 
 
 come help me make haste said great claus or get 
 beaten so he crept into a large sack which had been lying across 
 the back of one of the oxen 
 
 put in a stone said great claus or i may not sink 
 
 oh not much fear of that he replied still he put a 
 large stone into the bag and then tied it tightly and gave it a 
 push 
 
 plump in went great claus and immediately sank to the bottom 
 of the river 
 
 afraid he will not find any cattle said little claus and 
 then he drove his own beasts homewards

 on the morning of the pierre was leaving mozhaysk at the descent of the high steep hill down which a winding road led out of the town past the cathedral on the right where a service was being held and the bells were ringing pierre got out of his vehicle and proceeded on foot behind him a cavalry regiment was coming down the hill preceded by its singers coming up toward him was a train of carts carrying men who had been wounded in the engagement the day before the peasant drivers shouting and lashing their horses kept crossing from side to side the carts in each of which three or four wounded soldiers were lying or sitting jolted over the stones that had been thrown on the steep incline to make it something like a road the wounded bandaged with rags with pale cheeks compressed lips and knitted brows held on to the sides of the carts as they were jolted against one another almost all of them stared with naive childlike curiosity at white hat and green coat 
 coachman shouted angrily at the convoy of wounded to keep to one side of the road the cavalry regiment as it descended the hill with its singers surrounded carriage and blocked the road pierre stopped being pressed against the side of the cutting in which the road ran the sunshine from behind the hill did not penetrate into the cutting and there it was cold and damp but above head was the bright august sunshine and the bells sounded merrily one of the carts with wounded stopped by the side of the road close to pierre the driver in his bast shoes ran panting up to it placed a stone under one of its tireless hind wheels and began arranging the on his little horse 
 one of the wounded an old soldier with a bandaged arm who was following the cart on foot caught hold of it with his sound hand and turned to look at pierre 
 i say fellow countryman will they set us down here or take us on to moscow he asked 
 pierre was so deep in thought that he did not hear the question he was looking now at the cavalry regiment that had met the convoy of wounded now at the cart by which he was standing in which two wounded men were sitting and one was lying one of those sitting up in the cart had probably been wounded in the cheek his whole head was wrapped in rags and one cheek was swollen to the size of a head his nose and mouth were twisted to one side this soldier was looking at the cathedral and crossing himself another a young lad a recruit as white as though there was no blood in his thin face looked at pierre kindly with a fixed smile the third lay prone so that his face was not visible the cavalry singers were passing close by 
 ah lost quite lost is my head so keen 
 living in a foreign land they sang their soldiers dance song 
 as if responding to them but with a different sort of merriment the metallic sound of the bells reverberated high above and the hot rays of the sun bathed the top of the opposite slope with yet another sort of merriment but beneath the slope by the cart with the wounded near the panting little nag where pierre stood it was damp somber and sad 
 the soldier with the swollen cheek looked angrily at the cavalry singers 
 oh the coxcombs he muttered reproachfully 
 not the soldiers only but seen peasants today too the peasants even they have to go said the soldier behind the cart addressing pierre with a sad smile no distinctions made nowadays they want the whole nation to fall on them in a word moscow they want to make an end of it 
 in spite of the obscurity of the words pierre understood what he wanted to say and nodded approval 
 the road was clear again pierre descended the hill and drove on 
 he kept looking to either side of the road for familiar faces but only saw everywhere the unfamiliar faces of various military men of different branches of the service who all looked with astonishment at his white hat and green tail coat 
 having gone nearly three miles he at last met an acquaintance and eagerly addressed him this was one of the head army doctors he was driving toward pierre in a covered gig sitting beside a young surgeon and on recognizing pierre he told the cossack who occupied the seat to pull up 
 count your excellency how come you to be here asked the doctor 
 well you know i wanted to see 
 yes yes there will be something to see 
 pierre got out and talked to the doctor explaining his intention of taking part in a battle 
 the doctor advised him to apply direct to kutuzov 
 why should you be god knows where out of sight during the battle he said exchanging glances with his young companion anyhow his serene highness knows you and will receive you graciously what you must do 
 the doctor seemed tired and in a hurry 
 you think so ah i also wanted to ask you where our position is exactly said pierre 
 the position repeated the doctor well not my line drive past tatarinova a lot of digging is going on there go up the hillock and see 
 can one see from there if you would 
 but the doctor interrupted him and moved toward his gig 
 i would go with you but on my honor up to here and he pointed to his throat galloping to the commander of the corps how do matters stand you know count be a battle tomorrow out of an army of a hundred thousand we must expect at least twenty thousand wounded and we stretchers or bunks or dressers or doctors enough for six thousand we have ten thousand carts but we need other things as well we must manage as best we can 
 the strange thought that of the thousands of men young and old who had stared with merry surprise at his hat perhaps the very men he had noticed twenty thousand were inevitably doomed to wounds and death amazed pierre 
 they may die tomorrow why are they thinking of anything but death and by some latent sequence of thought the descent of the mozhaysk hill the carts with the wounded the ringing bells the slanting rays of the sun and the songs of the cavalrymen vividly recurred to his mind 
 the cavalry ride to battle and meet the wounded and do not for a moment think of what awaits them but pass by winking at the wounded yet from among these men twenty thousand are doomed to die and they wonder at my hat strange thought pierre continuing his way to tatarinova 
 in front of a house to the left of the road stood carriages wagons and crowds of orderlies and sentinels the commander in chief was putting up there but just when pierre arrived he was not in and hardly any of the staff were there they had gone to the church service pierre drove on toward gorki 
 when he had ascended the hill and reached the little village street he saw for the first time peasant militiamen in their white shirts and with crosses on their caps who talking and laughing loudly animated and perspiring were at work on a huge knoll overgrown with grass to the right of the road 
 some of them were digging others were wheeling barrowloads of earth along planks while others stood about doing nothing 
 two officers were standing on the knoll directing the men on seeing these peasants who were evidently still amused by the novelty of their position as soldiers pierre once more thought of the wounded men at mozhaysk and understood what the soldier had meant when he said they want the whole nation to fall on them the sight of these bearded peasants at work on the battlefield with their queer clumsy boots and perspiring necks and their shirts opening from the left toward the middle unfastened exposing their sunburned collarbones impressed pierre more strongly with the solemnity and importance of the moment than anything he had yet seen or heard

 jondrette comes near weeping 
 the hovel was so dark that people coming from without felt on entering it the effect produced on entering a cellar the two advanced therefore with a certain hesitation being hardly able to distinguish the vague forms surrounding them while they could be clearly seen and scrutinized by the eyes of the inhabitants of the garret who were accustomed to this twilight 
 m leblanc approached with his sad but kindly look and said to jondrette the father 
 monsieur in this package you will find some new clothes and some woollen stockings and blankets 
 our angelic benefactor overwhelms us said jondrette bowing to the very earth 
 then bending down to the ear of his eldest daughter while the two visitors were engaged in examining this lamentable interior he added in a low and rapid voice 
 hey 
 what did i say

 the dramatic artist good 
 it was lucky for jondrette that this had occurred to him for at the very moment m leblanc turned to him and said to him with the air of a person who is seeking to recall a name 
 i see that you are greatly to be pitied monsieur 
 fabantou replied jondrette quickly 
 monsieur fabantou yes that is it 
 i remember 
 dramatic artist sir and one who has had some success 
 here jondrette evidently judged the moment propitious for capturing the philanthropist 
 he exclaimed with an accent which smacked at the same time of the vainglory of the mountebank at fairs and the humility of the mendicant on the highway 
 a pupil of talma 
 sir 
 i am a pupil of talma 
 fortune formerly smiled on 
 now it is turn 
 you see my benefactor no bread no fire 
 my poor babes have no fire my only chair has no seat 
 a broken pane 
 and in such weather my spouse in bed 
 ill 
 poor woman said m leblanc 
 my child wounded added jondrette 
 the child diverted by the arrival of the strangers had fallen to contemplating the young lady and had ceased to sob 
 cry bawl said jondrette to her in a low voice 
 at the same time he pinched her sore hand 
 all this was done with the talent of a juggler 
 the little girl gave vent to loud shrieks 
 the adorable young girl whom marius in his heart called his ursule approached her hastily 
 poor dear child said she 
 you see my beautiful young lady pursued jondrette her bleeding wrist 
 it came through an accident while working at a machine to earn six sous a day 
 it may be necessary to cut off her arm 
 really said the old gentleman in alarm 
 the little girl taking this seriously fell to sobbing more violently than ever 
 alas yes my benefactor replied the father 
 for several minutes jondrette had been scrutinizing the benefactor in a singular fashion 
 as he spoke he seemed to be examining the other attentively as though seeking to summon up his recollections all at once profiting by a moment when the were questioning the child with interest as to her injured hand he passed near his wife who lay in her bed with a stupid and dejected air and said to her in a rapid but very low tone 
 take a look at that man 
 then turning to m leblanc and continuing his lamentations 
 you see sir 
 all the clothing that i have is my chemise and all torn at that 
 in the depths of winter 
 i go out for lack of a coat 
 if i had a coat of any sort i would go and see mademoiselle mars who knows me and is very fond of me 
 does she not still reside in the rue de la do you know sir we played together in the provinces 
 i shared her laurels celimene would come to my succor sir 
 elmire would bestow alms on belisaire 
 but no nothing 
 and not a sou in the house my wife ill and not a sou 
 my daughter dangerously injured not a sou 
 my wife suffers from fits of suffocation 
 it comes from her age and besides her nervous system is affected she ought to have assistance and my daughter also 
 but the doctor but the apothecary 
 how am i to pay them 
 i would kneel to a penny sir 
 such is the condition to which the arts are reduced and do you know my charming young lady and you my generous protector do you know you who breathe forth virtue and goodness and who perfume that church where my daughter sees you every day when she says her i have brought up my children religiously sir i did not want them to take to the theatre 
 ah the hussies if i catch them tripping 
 i do not jest that i i read them lessons on honor on morality on virtue 
 ask them 
 they have got to walk straight 
 they are none of your unhappy wretches who begin by having no family and end by espousing the public one is mamselle nobody and one becomes madame everybody deuce take it 
 none of that in the fabantou family 
 i mean to bring them up virtuously and they shall be honest and nice and believe in god by the sacred name 
 well sir my worthy sir do you know what is going to happen is the fourth day of february the fatal day the last day of grace allowed me by my landlord if by this evening i have not paid my rent my oldest daughter my spouse with her fever my child with her wound we shall all four be turned out of here and thrown into the street on the boulevard without shelter in the rain in the snow there sir 
 i owe for four whole year that is to say sixty francs 
 jondrette lied 
 four quarters would have amounted to only forty francs and he could not owe four because six months had not elapsed since marius had paid for two 
 m leblanc drew five francs from his pocket and threw them on the table 
 jondrette found time to mutter in the ear of his eldest daughter 
 the scoundrel 
 what does he think i can do with his five francs that pay me for my chair and pane of glass 
 what comes of incurring expenses 
 in the meanwhile m leblanc had removed the large brown which he wore over his blue coat and had thrown it over the back of the chair 
 monsieur fabantou he said these five francs are all that i have about me but i shall now take my daughter home and i will return this is this evening that you must pay is it not 
 face lighted up with a strange expression he replied vivaciously 
 yes respected sir 
 at eight i must be at my 
 i will be here at six and i will fetch you the sixty francs 
 my benefactor exclaimed jondrette overwhelmed 
 and he added in a low tone 
 take a good look at him wife 
 m leblanc had taken the arm of the young girl once more and had turned towards the door 
 farewell until this evening my friends said he 
 six said jondrette 
 six precisely 
 at that moment the overcoat lying on the chair caught the eye of the elder jondrette girl 
 you are forgetting your coat sir said she 
 jondrette darted an annihilating look at his daughter accompanied by a formidable shrug of the shoulders 
 m leblanc turned back and said with a smile 
 i have not forgotten it i am leaving it 
 o my protector said jondrette my august benefactor i melt into tears 
 permit me to accompany you to your carriage 
 if you come out answered m leblanc put on this coat it really is very cold 
 jondrette did not need to be told twice 
 he hastily donned the brown and all three went out jondrette preceding the two strangers

 jondrette comes near weeping 
 the hovel was so dark that people coming from without felt on entering it the effect produced on entering a cellar the two advanced therefore with a certain hesitation being hardly able to distinguish the vague forms surrounding them while they could be clearly seen and scrutinized by the eyes of the inhabitants of the garret who were accustomed to this twilight 
 m leblanc approached with his sad but kindly look and said to jondrette the father 
 monsieur in this package you will find some new clothes and some woollen stockings and blankets 
 our angelic benefactor overwhelms us said jondrette bowing to the very earth 
 then bending down to the ear of his eldest daughter while the two visitors were engaged in examining this lamentable interior he added in a low and rapid voice 
 hey

 pierre stepped out of his carriage and passing the toiling militiamen ascended the knoll from which according to the doctor the battlefield could be seen 
 it was about eleven the sun shone somewhat to the left and behind him and brightly lit up the enormous panorama which rising like an amphitheater extended before him in the clear rarefied atmosphere 
 from above on the left bisecting that amphitheater wound the smolensk highroad passing through a village with a white church some five hundred paces in front of the knoll and below it this was borodino below the village the road crossed the river by a bridge and winding down and up rose higher and higher to the village of valuevo visible about four miles away where napoleon was then stationed beyond valuevo the road disappeared into a yellowing forest on the horizon far in the distance in that birch and fir forest to the right of the road the cross and belfry of the kolocha monastery gleamed in the sun here and there over the whole of that blue expanse to right and left of the forest and the road smoking campfires could be seen and indefinite masses of troops ours and the the ground to the right along the course of the kolocha and moskva rivers was broken and hilly between the hollows the villages of bezubova and zakharino showed in the distance on the left the ground was more level there were fields of grain and the smoking ruins of semenovsk which had been burned down could be seen 
 all that pierre saw was so indefinite that neither the left nor the right side of the field fully satisfied his expectations nowhere could he see the battlefield he had expected to find but only fields meadows troops woods the smoke of campfires villages mounds and streams and try as he would he could descry no military position in this place which teemed with life nor could he even distinguish our troops from the 
 i must ask someone who knows he thought and addressed an officer who was looking with curiosity at his huge unmilitary figure 
 may i ask you said pierre what village that is in front 
 burdino it said the officer turning to his companion 
 borodino the other corrected him 
 the officer evidently glad of an opportunity for a talk moved up to pierre 
 are those our men there pierre inquired 
 yes and there further on are the french said the officer there they are there you can see them 
 where where asked pierre 
 one can see them with the naked eye why there 
 the officer pointed with his hand to the smoke visible on the left beyond the river and the same stern and serious expression that pierre had noticed on many of the faces he had met came into his face 
 ah those are the french and over there pierre pointed to a knoll on the left near which some troops could be seen 
 those are ours 
 ah ours and there pierre pointed to another knoll in the distance with a big tree on it near a village that lay in a hollow where also some campfires were smoking and something black was visible 
 his again said the officer it was the shevardino redoubt it was ours yesterday but now it is his 
 then how about our position 
 our position replied the officer with a smile of satisfaction i can tell you quite clearly because i constructed nearly all our entrenchments there you see our center at borodino just there and he pointed to the village in front of them with the white church where one crosses the kolocha you see down there where the rows of hay are lying in the hollow the bridge our center our right flank is over there he pointed sharply to the right far away in the broken ground where the moskva river is and we have thrown up three redoubts there very strong ones the left flank here the officer paused well you see difficult to explain yesterday our left flank was there at shevardino you see where the oak is but now we have withdrawn our left wing now it is over there do you see that village and the smoke semenovsk yes there he pointed to knoll but the battle will hardly be there his having moved his troops there is only a ruse he will probably pass round to the right of the moskva but wherever it may be many a man will be missing tomorrow he remarked 
 an elderly sergeant who had approached the officer while he was giving these explanations had waited in silence for him to finish speaking but at this point evidently not liking the remark interrupted him 
 gabions must be sent for said he sternly 
 the officer appeared abashed as though he understood that one might think of how many men would be missing tomorrow but ought not to speak to speak of it 
 well send number three company again the officer replied hurriedly 
 and you are you one of the doctors 
 no come on my own answered pierre and he went down the hill again passing the militiamen 
 oh those damned fellows muttered the officer who followed him holding his nose as he ran past the men at work 
 there they are bringing her coming there they are be here in a minute voices were suddenly heard saying and officers soldiers and militiamen began running forward along the road 
 a church procession was coming up the hill from borodino first along the dusty road came the infantry in ranks bareheaded and with arms reversed from behind them came the sound of church singing 
 soldiers and militiamen ran bareheaded past pierre toward the procession 
 they are bringing her our protectress the iberian mother of god someone cried 
 the smolensk mother of god another corrected him 
 the militiamen both those who had been in the village and those who had been at work on the battery threw down their spades and ran to meet the church procession following the battalion that marched along the dusty road came priests in their vestments one little old man in a hood with attendants and singers behind them soldiers and officers bore a large icon with an embossed metal cover this was the icon that had been brought from and had since accompanied the army behind before and on both sides crowds of militiamen with bared heads walked ran and bowed to the ground 
 at the summit of the hill they stopped with the icon the men who had been holding it up by the linen bands attached to it were relieved by others the chanters relit their censers and service began the hot rays of the sun beat down vertically and a fresh soft wind played with the hair of the bared heads and with the ribbons decorating the icon the singing did not sound loud under the open sky an immense crowd of bareheaded officers soldiers and militiamen surrounded the icon behind the priest and a chanter stood the notabilities on a spot reserved for them a bald general with general with a st cross on his neck stood just behind the back and without crossing himself he was evidently a german patiently awaited the end of the service which he considered it necessary to hear to the end probably to arouse the patriotism of the russian people another general stood in a martial pose crossing himself by shaking his hand in front of his chest while looking about him standing among the crowd of peasants pierre recognized several acquaintances among these notables but did not look at them his whole attention was absorbed in watching the serious expression on the faces of the crowd of soldiers and militiamen who were all gazing eagerly at the icon as soon as the tired chanters who were singing the service for the twentieth time that day began lazily and mechanically to sing save from calamity thy servants o mother of god and the priest and deacon chimed in for to thee under god we all flee as to an inviolable bulwark and protection there again kindled in all those faces the same expression of consciousness of the solemnity of the impending moment that pierre had seen on the faces at the foot of the hill at mozhaysk and momentarily on many and many faces he had met that morning and heads were bowed more frequently and hair tossed back and sighs and the sound men made as they crossed themselves were heard 
 the crowd round the icon suddenly parted and pressed against pierre someone a very important personage judging by the haste with which way was made for him was approaching the icon 
 it was kutuzov who had been riding round the position and on his way back to tatarinova had stopped where the service was being held pierre recognized him at once by his peculiar figure which distinguished him from everybody else 
 with a long overcoat on his his exceedingly stout body with uncovered white head and puffy face showing the white ball of the eye he had lost kutuzov walked with plunging swaying gait into the crowd and stopped behind the priest he crossed himself with an accustomed movement bent till he touched the ground with his hand and bowed his white head with a deep sigh behind kutuzov was bennigsen and the suite despite the presence of the commander in chief who attracted the attention of all the superior officers the militiamen and soldiers continued their prayers without looking at him 
 when the service was over kutuzov stepped up to the icon sank heavily to his knees bowed to the ground and for a long time tried vainly to rise but could not do so on account of his weakness and weight his white head twitched with the effort at last he rose kissed the icon as a child does with naively pouting lips and again bowed till he touched the ground with his hand the other generals followed his example then the officers and after them with excited faces pressing on one another crowding panting and pushing scrambled the soldiers and militiamen

 tariff of licensed cabs 
 two francs an hour 
 marius had lost nothing of this entire scene and yet in reality had seen nothing 
 his eyes had remained fixed on the young girl his heart had so to speak seized her and wholly enveloped her from the moment of her very first step in that garret 
 during her entire stay there he had lived that life of ecstasy which suspends material perceptions and precipitates the whole soul on a single point he contemplated not that girl but that light which wore a satin pelisse and a velvet bonnet 
 the star sirius might have entered the room and he would not have been any more dazzled 
 while the young girl was engaged in opening the package unfolding the clothing and the blankets questioning the sick mother kindly and the little injured girl tenderly he watched her every movement he sought to catch her words 
 he knew her eyes her brow her beauty her form her walk he did not know the sound of her voice he had once fancied that he had caught a few words at the luxembourg but he was not absolutely sure of the fact 
 he would have given ten years of his life to hear it in order that he might bear away in his soul a little of that music 
 but everything was drowned in the lamentable exclamations and trumpet bursts of jondrette this added a touch of genuine wrath to marius ecstasy 
 he devoured her with his eyes 
 he could not believe that it really was that divine creature whom he saw in the midst of those vile creatures in that monstrous lair 
 it seemed to him that he beheld a in the midst of toads 
 when she took her departure he had but one thought to follow her to cling to her trace not to quit her until he learned where she lived not to lose her again at least after having so miraculously her 
 he leaped down from the commode and seized his hat 
 as he laid his hand on the lock of the door and was on the point of opening it a sudden reflection caused him to pause the corridor was long the staircase steep jondrette was talkative m leblanc had no doubt not yet regained his carriage if on turning round in the corridor or on the staircase he were to catch sight of him marius in that house he would evidently take the alarm and find means to escape from him again and this time it would be final 
 what was he to do 
 should he wait a little 
 but while he was waiting the carriage might drive off 
 marius was perplexed at last he accepted the risk and quitted his room 
 there was no one in the corridor 
 he hastened to the stairs there was no one on the staircase 
 he descended in all haste and reached the boulevard in time to see a fiacre turning the corner of the rue du on its way back to paris 
 marius rushed headlong in that direction 
 on arriving at the angle of the boulevard he caught sight of the fiacre again rapidly descending the rue mouffetard the carriage was already a long way off and there was no means of overtaking it what run after it impossible and besides the people in the carriage would assuredly notice an individual running at full speed in pursuit of a fiacre and the father would recognize him 
 at that moment wonderful and unprecedented good luck marius perceived an empty cab passing along the boulevard 
 there was but one thing to be done to jump into this cab and follow the fiacre 
 that was sure efficacious and free from danger 
 marius made the driver a sign to halt and called to him 
 by the hour 
 marius wore no cravat he had on his which was destitute of buttons his shirt was torn along one of the plaits on the bosom 
 the driver halted winked and held out his left hand to marius rubbing his forefinger gently with his thumb 
 what is it said marius 
 pay in advance said the coachman 
 marius recollected that he had but sixteen sous about him 
 how much he demanded 
 forty sous 
 i will pay on my return 
 the only reply was to whistle the air of la palisse and to whip up his horse 
 marius stared at the retreating cabriolet with a bewildered air for the lack of four and twenty sous he was losing his joy his happiness his love 
 he had seen and he was becoming blind again 
 he reflected bitterly and it must be confessed with profound regret on the five francs which he had bestowed that very morning on that miserable girl 
 if he had had those five francs he would have been saved he would have been born again he would have emerged from the limbo and darkness he would have made his escape from isolation and spleen from his widowed state he might have the black thread of his destiny to that beautiful golden thread which had just floated before his eyes and had broken at the same instant once more 
 he returned to his hovel in despair 
 he might have told himself that m leblanc had promised to return in the evening and that all he had to do was to set about the matter more skilfully so that he might follow him on that occasion but in his contemplation it is doubtful whether he had heard this 
 as he was on the point of mounting the staircase he perceived on the other side of the boulevard near the deserted wall skirting the rue de la jondrette wrapped in the engaged in conversation with one of those men of disquieting aspect who have been dubbed by common consent prowlers of the barriers people of equivocal face of suspicious monologues who present the air of having evil minds and who generally sleep in the daytime which suggests the supposition that they work by night 
 these two men standing there motionless and in conversation in the snow which was falling in whirlwinds formed a group that a policeman would surely have observed but which marius hardly noticed 
 still in spite of his mournful preoccupation he could not refrain from saying to himself that this prowler of the barriers with whom jondrette was talking resembled a certain panchaud alias printanier alias bigrenaille whom courfeyrac had once pointed out to him as a very dangerous nocturnal roamer this name the reader has learned in the preceding book this panchaud alias printanier alias bigrenaille figured later on in many criminal trials and became a notorious rascal he was at that time only a famous rascal 
 he exists in the state of tradition among ruffians and assassins

 tariff of licensed cabs 
 two francs an hour 
 marius had lost nothing of this entire scene and yet in reality had seen nothing 
 his eyes had remained fixed on the young girl his heart had so to speak seized her and wholly enveloped her from the moment of her very first step in that garret 
 during her entire stay there he had lived that life of ecstasy which suspends material perceptions and precipitates the whole soul on a single point he contemplated not that girl but that light which wore a satin pelisse and a velvet bonnet 
 the star sirius might have entered the room and he would not have been any more dazzled 
 while the young girl was engaged in opening the package unfolding the clothing and the blankets questioning the sick mother kindly and the little injured girl tenderly he watched her every movement he sought to catch her words 
 he knew her eyes her brow her beauty her form her walk he did not know the sound of her voice he had once fancied that he had caught a few words at the luxembourg but he was not absolutely sure of the fact 
 he would have given ten years of his life to hear it in order that he might bear away in his soul a little of that music 
 but everything was drowned in the lamentable exclamations and trumpet bursts of jondrette this added a touch of genuine wrath to marius ecstasy 
 he devoured her with his eyes 
 he could not believe that it really was that divine creature whom he saw in the midst of those vile creatures in that monstrous lair 
 it seemed to him that he beheld a in the midst of toads 
 when she took her departure he had but one thought to follow her to cling to her trace not to quit her until he learned where she lived not to lose her again at least after having so miraculously her 
 he leaped down from the commode and seized his hat 
 as he laid his hand on the lock of the door and was on the point of opening it a sudden reflection caused him to pause the corridor was long the staircase steep jondrette was talkative m leblanc had no doubt not yet regained his carriage if on turning round in the corridor or on the staircase he were to catch sight of him marius in that house he would evidently take the alarm and find means to escape from him again and this time it would be final 
 what was he to do 
 should he wait a little 
 but while he was waiting the carriage might drive off 
 marius was perplexed at last he accepted the risk and quitted his room 
 there was no one in the corridor 
 he hastened to the stairs there was no one on the staircase 
 he descended in all haste and reached the boulevard in time to see a fiacre turning the corner of the rue du on its way back to paris 
 marius rushed headlong in that direction 
 on arriving at the angle of the boulevard he caught sight of the fiacre again rapidly descending the rue mouffetard the carriage was already a long way off and there was no means of overtaking it what run after it impossible and besides the people in the carriage would assuredly notice an individual running at full speed in pursuit of a fiacre and the father would recognize him 
 at that moment wonderful and unprecedented good luck marius perceived an empty cab passing along the boulevard 
 there was but one thing to be done to jump into this cab and follow the fiacre 
 that was sure efficacious and free from danger 
 marius made the driver a sign to halt and called to him 
 by the hour 
 marius wore no cravat he had on his which was destitute of buttons his shirt was torn along one of the plaits on the bosom 
 the driver halted winked and held out his left hand to marius rubbing his forefinger gently with his thumb 
 what is it said marius

 how much he demanded

 staggering amid the crush pierre looked about him 
 count peter kirilovich how did you get here said a voice 
 pierre looked round boris drubetskoy brushing his knees with his hand he had probably soiled them when he too had knelt before the icon came up to him smiling boris was elegantly dressed with a slightly martial touch appropriate to a campaign he wore a long coat and like kutuzov had a whip slung across his shoulder 
 meanwhile kutuzov had reached the village and seated himself in the shade of the nearest house on a bench which one cossack had run to fetch and another had hastily covered with a rug an immense and brilliant suite surrounded him 
 the icon was carried further accompanied by the throng pierre stopped some thirty paces from kutuzov talking to boris 
 he explained his wish to be present at the battle and to see the position 
 this is what you must do said boris i will do the honors of the camp to you you will see everything best from where count bennigsen will be i am in attendance on him you know mention it to him but if you want to ride round the position come along with us we are just going to the left flank then when we get back do spend the night with me and arrange a game of cards of course you know dmitri sergeevich those are his quarters and he pointed to the third house in the village of gorki 
 but i should like to see the right flank they say very strong said pierre i should like to start from the moskva river and ride round the whole position 
 well you can do that later but the chief thing is the left flank 
 yes yes but where is prince regiment can you point it out to me 
 prince we shall pass it and take you to him 
 what about the left flank asked pierre 
 to tell you the truth between ourselves god only knows what state our left flank is in said boris confidentially lowering his voice it is not at all what count bennigsen intended he meant to fortify that knoll quite differently but boris shrugged his shoulders his serene highness would not have it or someone persuaded him you see but boris did not finish for at that moment kaysarov adjutant came up to pierre ah kaysarov said boris addressing him with an unembarrassed smile i was just trying to explain our position to the count it is amazing how his serene highness could so the intentions of the french 
 you mean the left flank asked kaysarov 
 yes exactly the left flank is now extremely strong 
 though kutuzov had dismissed all unnecessary men from the staff boris had contrived to remain at headquarters after the changes he had established himself with count bennigsen who like all on whom boris had been in attendance considered young prince drubetskoy an invaluable man 
 in the higher command there were two sharply defined parties party and that of bennigsen the chief of staff boris belonged to the latter and no one else while showing servile respect to kutuzov could so create an impression that the old fellow was not much good and that bennigsen managed everything now the decisive moment of battle had come when kutuzov would be destroyed and the power pass to bennigsen or even if kutuzov won the battle it would be felt that everything was done by bennigsen in any case many great rewards would have to be given for action and new men would come to the front so boris was full of nervous vivacity all day 
 after kaysarov others whom pierre knew came up to him and he had not time to reply to all the questions about moscow that were showered upon him or to listen to all that was told him the faces all expressed animation and apprehension but it seemed to pierre that the cause of the excitement shown in some of these faces lay chiefly in questions of personal success his mind however was occupied by the different expression he saw on other faces an expression that spoke not of personal matters but of the universal questions of life and death kutuzov noticed figure and the group gathered round him 
 call him to me said kutuzov 
 an adjutant told pierre of his serene highness wish and pierre went toward bench but a militiaman got there before him it was dolokhov 
 how did that fellow get here asked pierre 
 a creature that wriggles in anywhere was the answer he has been degraded you know now he wants to bob up again been proposing some scheme or other and has crawled into the picket line at night a brave fellow 
 pierre took off his hat and bowed respectfully to kutuzov 
 i concluded that if i reported to your serene highness you might send me away or say that you knew what i was reporting but then i lose anything dolokhov was saying 
 yes yes 
 but if i were right i should be rendering a service to my fatherland for which i am ready to die 
 yes yes 
 and should your serene highness require a man who will not spare his skin please think of me perhaps i may prove useful to your serene highness 
 yes yes kutuzov repeated his laughing eye narrowing more and more as he looked at pierre 
 just then boris with his courtierlike adroitness stepped up to side near kutuzov and in a most natural manner without raising his voice said to pierre as though continuing an interrupted conversation 
 the militia have put on clean white shirts to be ready to die what heroism count 
 boris evidently said this to pierre in order to be overheard by his serene highness he knew attention would be caught by those words and so it was 
 what are you saying about the militia he asked boris 
 preparing for tomorrow your serene highness for death they have put on clean shirts 
 ah a wonderful a matchless people said kutuzov and he closed his eyes and swayed his head a matchless people he repeated with a sigh 
 so you want to smell gunpowder he said to pierre yes a pleasant smell i have the honor to be one of your adorers is she well my quarters are at your service 
 and as often happens with old people kutuzov began looking about as if forgetting all he wanted to say or do 
 then evidently remembering what he wanted he beckoned to andrew kaysarov his brother 
 those verses those verses of how do they go eh those he wrote about gerakov lectures for the corps inditing recite them recite them said he evidently preparing to laugh 
 kaysarov recited kutuzov smilingly nodded his head to the rhythm of the verses 
 when pierre had left kutuzov dolokhov came up to him and took his hand 
 i am very glad to meet you here count he said aloud regardless of the presence of strangers and in a particularly resolute and solemn tone on the eve of a day when god alone knows who of us is fated to survive i am glad of this opportunity to tell you that i regret the misunderstandings that occurred between us and should wish you not to have any ill feeling for me i beg you to forgive me 
 pierre looked at dolokhov with a smile not knowing what to say to him with tears in his eyes dolokhov embraced pierre and kissed him 
 boris said a few words to his general and count bennigsen turned to pierre and proposed that he should ride with him along the line 
 it will interest you said he 
 yes very much replied pierre 
 half an hour later kutuzov left for tatarinova and bennigsen and his suite with pierre among them set out on their ride along the line

 offers of service from misery to wretchedness 
 marius ascended the stairs of the hovel with slow steps at the moment when he was about to his cell he caught sight of the elder jondrette girl following him through the corridor 
 the very sight of this girl was odious to him it was she who had his five francs it was too late to demand them back the cab was no longer there the fiacre was far away 
 moreover she would not have given them back as for questioning her about the residence of the persons who had just been there that was useless it was evident that she did not know since the letter signed fabantou had been addressed to the benevolent gentleman of the church of 
 marius entered his room and pushed the door to after him 
 it did not close he turned round and beheld a hand which held the door half open 
 what is it he asked who is there 
 it was the jondrette girl 
 is it you resumed marius almost harshly still you 
 what do you want with me 
 she appeared to be thoughtful and did not look at him 
 she no longer had the air of assurance which had characterized her that morning she did not enter but held back in the darkness of the corridor where marius could see her through the door 
 come now will you answer cried marius 
 what do you want with me 
 she raised her dull eyes in which a sort of gleam seemed to flicker vaguely and said 
 monsieur marius you look sad 
 what is the matter with you 
 with me said marius 
 yes you 
 there is nothing the matter with me 
 yes there is 
 no 
 i tell you there is 
 let me alone 
 marius gave the door another push but she retained her hold on it 
 stop said she you are in the wrong 
 although you are not rich you were kind this morning 
 be so again now you gave me something to eat now tell me what ails you you are grieved that is plain 
 i do not want you to be grieved what can be done for it 
 can i be of any service 
 employ me i do not ask for your secrets you need not tell them to me but i may be of use nevertheless 
 i may be able to help you since i help my father 
 when it is necessary to carry letters to go to houses to inquire from door to door to find out an address to follow any one i am of service 
 well you may assuredly tell me what is the matter with you and i will go and speak to the persons sometimes it is enough if some one speaks to the persons that suffices to let them understand matters and everything comes right make use of me 
 an idea flashed across marius mind 
 what branch does one disdain when one feels that one is falling 
 he drew near to the jondrette girl 
 listen he said to her 
 she interrupted him with a gleam of joy in her eyes 
 oh yes do call me thou 
 i like that better 
 well he resumed thou hast brought hither that old gentleman and his daughter 
 yes 
 dost thou know their address 
 no 
 find it for me 
 the dull eyes had grown joyous and they now became gloomy 
 is that what you want she demanded 
 yes 
 do you know them 
 no 
 that is to say she resumed quickly you do not know her but you wish to know her 
 this them which had turned into her had something indescribably significant and bitter about it 
 well can you do it said marius 
 you shall have the beautiful address 
 there was still a shade in the words the beautiful lady which troubled marius 
 he resumed 
 never mind after all the address of the father and daughter their address indeed 
 she gazed fixedly at him 
 what will you give me 
 anything you like 
 anything i like 
 yes 
 you shall have the address 
 she dropped her head then with a brusque movement she pulled to the door which closed behind her 
 marius found himself alone 
 he dropped into a chair with his head and both elbows on his bed absorbed in thoughts which he could not grasp and as though a prey to vertigo 
 all that had taken place since the morning the appearance of the angel her disappearance what that creature had just said to him a gleam of hope floating in an immense despair this was what filled his brain confusedly 
 all at once he was violently aroused from his revery 
 he heard the shrill hard voice of jondrette utter these words which were fraught with a strange interest for him 
 i tell you that i am sure of it and that i recognized him 
 of whom was jondrette speaking 
 whom had he recognized 
 m leblanc the father of his ursule what 
 did jondrette know him was marius about to obtain in this abrupt and unexpected fashion all the information without which his life was so dark to him was he about to learn at last who it was that he loved who that young girl was 
 who her father was 
 was the dense shadow which enwrapped them on the point of being dispelled 
 was the veil about to be rent 
 ah 
 heavens 
 he bounded rather than climbed upon his commode and resumed his post near the little in the partition wall 
 again he beheld the interior of hovel

 they then crossed the hollow to semenovsk where the soldiers were dragging away the last logs from the huts and barns then they rode downhill and uphill across a ryefield trodden and beaten down as if by hail following a track freshly made by the artillery over the furrows of the plowed land and reached some fleches which were still being dug 
 a kind of entrenchment 
 at the fleches bennigsen stopped and began looking at the shevardino redoubt opposite which had been ours the day before and where several horsemen could be descried the officers said that either napoleon or murat was there and they all gazed eagerly at this little group of horsemen pierre also looked at them trying to guess which of the scarcely discernible figures was napoleon at last those mounted men rode away from the mound and disappeared 
 bennigsen spoke to a general who approached him and began explaining the whole position of our troops pierre listened to him straining each faculty to understand the essential points of the impending battle but was mortified to feel that his mental capacity was inadequate for the task he could make nothing of it bennigsen stopped speaking and noticing that pierre was listening suddenly said to him 
 i think this interests you 
 on the contrary very interesting replied pierre not quite truthfully 
 from the fleches they rode still farther to the left along a road winding through a thick birch wood in the middle of the wood a brown hare with white feet sprang out and scared by the tramp of the many horses grew so confused that it leaped along the road in front of them for some time arousing general attention and laughter and only when several voices shouted at it did it dart to one side and disappear in the thicket after going through the wood for about a mile and a half they came out on a glade where troops of corps were stationed to defend the left flank 
 here at the extreme left flank bennigsen talked a great deal and with much heat and as it seemed to pierre gave orders of great military importance in front of troops was some high ground not occupied by troops bennigsen loudly criticized this mistake saying that it was madness to leave a height which commanded the country around unoccupied and to place troops below it some of the generals expressed the same opinion one in particular declared with martial heat that they were put there to be slaughtered bennigsen on his own authority ordered the troops to occupy the high ground this disposition on the left flank increased doubt of his own capacity to understand military matters listening to bennigsen and the generals criticizing the position of the troops behind the hill he quite understood them and shared their opinion but for that very reason he could not understand how the man who put them there behind the hill could have made so gross and palpable a blunder 
 pierre did not know that these troops were not as bennigsen supposed put there to defend the position but were in a concealed position as an ambush that they should not be seen and might be able to strike an approaching enemy unexpectedly bennigsen did not know this and moved the troops forward according to his own ideas without mentioning the matter to the commander in chief

 book wicked poor man 
 chapter xii 
 
 the use made of m piece 
 nothing in the aspect of the family was altered except that the wife and daughters had levied on the package and put on woollen stockings and jackets 
 two new blankets were thrown across the two beds 
 jondrette had evidently just returned 
 he still had the breathlessness of out of doors 
 his daughters were seated on the floor near the fireplace the elder engaged in dressing the wounded hand 
 his wife had sunk back on the bed near the fireplace with a face indicative of astonishment 
 jondrette was pacing up and down the garret with long strides 
 his eyes were extraordinary 
 the woman who seemed timid and overwhelmed with stupor in the presence of her husband turned to say 
 what really 
 you are sure 
 sure 
 eight years have passed 
 but i recognize him 
 ah 
 i recognize him 
 i knew him at once 
 what 
 it force itself on you 
 no 
 but i told you 
 pay attention 
 why it is his figure it is his face only are people who do not grow old i know how they manage is the very sound of his voice he is better dressed that is all 
 ah you mysterious old devil got you that i have 
 he paused and said to his daughters 
 get out of here queer that it strike you 
 they arose to obey 
 the mother stammered 
 with her injured hand 
 the air will do it good said jondrette 
 be off 
 it was plain that this man was of the sort to whom no one offers to reply 
 the two girls departed 
 at the moment when they were about to pass through the door the father detained the elder by the arm and said to her with a peculiar accent 
 you will be here at five precisely 
 both of you i shall need you 
 marius redoubled his attention 
 on being left alone with his wife jondrette began to pace the room again and made the tour of it two or three times in silence then he spent several minutes in tucking the lower part of the chemise which he wore into his trousers 
 all at once he turned to the female jondrette folded his arms and exclaimed 
 and would you like to have me tell you something 
 the young lady 
 well what retorted his wife the young lady 
 marius could not doubt that it was really she of whom they were speaking he listened with ardent anxiety 
 his whole life was in his ears 
 but jondrette had bent over and spoke to his wife in a whisper then he straightened himself up and concluded aloud 
 it is she 
 that one said his wife 
 that very one said the husband 
 no expression can reproduce the significance of the words surprise rage hate wrath were mingled and combined in one monstrous intonation 
 the pronunciation of a few words the name no doubt which her husband had whispered in her ear had sufficed to rouse this huge somnolent woman and from being repulsive she became terrible 
 it is not possible she cried 
 when i think that my daughters are going barefoot and have not a gown to their backs 
 what a satin pelisse a velvet bonnet boots and everything more than two hundred francs worth of clothes so that one would think she was a lady 
 no you are mistaken 
 why in the first place the other was hideous and this one is not so she really is not it be she 
 i tell you that it is she 
 you will see 
 at this absolute assertion the jondrette woman raised her large red blonde face and stared at the ceiling with a horrible expression at that moment she seemed to marius even more to be feared than her husband 
 she was a sow with the look of a tigress 
 what she resumed that horrible beautiful young lady who gazed at my daughters with an air of is that beggar brat 
 oh 
 i should like to kick her stomach in for her 
 she sprang off of the bed and remained standing for a moment her hair in disorder her nostrils dilating her mouth half open her fists clenched and drawn back 
 then she fell back on the bed once more 
 the man paced to and fro and paid no attention to his female 
 after a silence lasting several minutes he approached the female jondrette and halted in front of her with folded arms as he had done a moment before 
 and shall i tell you another thing 
 what is it she asked 
 he answered in a low curt voice 
 my fortune is made 
 the woman stared at him with the look that signifies 
 is the person who is addressing me on the point of going mad 
 he went on 
 thunder 
 it was not so very long ago that i was a parishioner of the parish of i have had enough of misery my share and other share i am not joking any longer i find it comic any more had enough of puns good god no more farces eternal father i want to eat till i am full i want to drink my fill to gormandize to sleep to do nothing 
 i want to have my turn so i do come now before i die 
 i want to be a bit of a millionnaire 
 he took a turn round the hovel and added 
 like other people 
 what do you mean by that asked the woman 
 he shook his head winked screwed up one eye and raised his voice like a medical professor who is about to make a demonstration 
 what do i mean by that 
 listen 
 hush muttered the woman not so loud 
 these are matters which must not be overheard 
 bah 
 here 
 our neighbor 
 i saw him go out a little while ago 
 besides he listen the big booby and i tell you that i saw him go out 
 nevertheless by a sort of instinct jondrette lowered his voice although not sufficiently to prevent marius hearing his words one favorable circumstance which enabled marius not to lose a word of this conversation was the falling snow which deadened the sound of vehicles on the boulevard 
 this is what marius heard 
 listen carefully 
 the croesus is caught or as good as caught all settled already 
 everything is arranged 
 i have seen some people 
 he will come here this evening at six to bring sixty francs the rascal 
 did you notice how i played that game on him my sixty francs my landlord my fourth of february i even owe for one quarter 
 he a fool 
 so he will come at six the hour when our neighbor goes to his dinner mother bougon is off washing dishes in the city 
 not a soul in the house 
 the neighbor never comes home until eleven the children shall stand on watch 
 you shall help us 
 he will give in 
 and what if he does not give in demanded his wife 
 jondrette made a sinister gesture and said 
 fix him 
 and he burst out laughing 
 this was the first time marius had seen him laugh 
 the laugh was cold and sweet and provoked a shudder 
 jondrette opened a cupboard near the fireplace and drew from it an old cap which he placed on his head after brushing it with his sleeve 
 now said he going out 
 i have some more people that i must see 
 good ones 
 see how well the whole thing will work i shall be away as short a time as possible a fine stroke of business do you look after the house 
 and with both fists thrust into the pockets of his trousers he stood for a moment in thought then exclaimed 
 do you know mighty lucky by the way that he recognize me 
 if he had recognized me on his side he would not have come back again 
 he would have slipped through our fingers it was my beard that saved us my romantic beard my pretty little romantic beard 
 and again he broke into a laugh 
 he stepped to the window 
 the snow was still falling and streaking the gray of the sky 
 what beastly weather said he 
 then lapping his overcoat across his breast 
 this rind is too large for me 
 never mind he added he did a devilish good thing in leaving it for me the old scoundrel if it been for that i have gone out and everything would have gone wrong 
 what small points things hang on anyway 
 and pulling his cap down over his eyes he quitted the room 
 he had barely had time to take half a dozen steps from the door when the door opened again and his savage but intelligent face made its appearance once more in the opening 
 i came near forgetting said he 
 you are to have a brazier of charcoal ready 
 and he flung into his apron the piece which the philanthropist had left with him 
 a brazier of charcoal asked his wife 
 yes 
 how many bushels 
 two good ones 
 that will come to thirty sous 
 with the rest i will buy something for dinner 
 the devil no 
 why 
 go and spend the piece 
 why 
 because i shall have to buy something too 
 what 
 something 
 how much shall you need 
 whereabouts in the neighborhood is there an shop 
 rue mouffetard 
 ah yes at the corner of a street i can see the shop 
 but tell me how much you will need for what you have to purchase 
 fifty francs 
 there be much left for dinner 
 eating is not the point something better to be done 
 enough my jewel 
 at this word from his wife jondrette closed the door again and this time marius heard his step die away in the corridor of the hovel and descend the staircase rapidly

 on that bright evening of august prince andrew lay leaning on his elbow in a shed in the village of knyazkovo at the further end of his encampment through a gap in the broken wall he could see beside the wooden fence a row of thirty birches with their lower branches lopped off a field on which shocks of oats were standing and some bushes near which rose the smoke of campfires the soldiers kitchens 
 narrow and burdensome and useless to anyone as his life now seemed to him prince andrew on the eve of battle felt agitated and irritable as he had done seven years before at austerlitz 
 he had received and given the orders for next battle and had nothing more to do but his thoughts the simplest clearest and therefore most terrible thoughts would give him no peace he knew that battle would be the most terrible of all he had taken part in and for the first time in his life the possibility of death presented itself to him not in relation to any worldly matter or with reference to its effect on others but simply in relation to himself to his own soul vividly plainly terribly and almost as a certainty and from the height of this perception all that had previously tormented and preoccupied him suddenly became illumined by a cold white light without shadows without perspective without distinction of outline all life appeared to him like pictures at which he had long been gazing by artificial light through a glass now he suddenly saw those badly daubed pictures in clear daylight and without a glass yes yes there they are those false images that agitated enraptured and tormented me said he to himself passing in review the principal pictures of the magic lantern of life and regarding them now in the cold white daylight of his clear perception of death there they are those rudely painted figures that once seemed splendid and mysterious glory the good of society love of a woman the fatherland itself how important these pictures appeared to me with what profound meaning they seemed to be filled and it is all so simple pale and crude in the cold white light of this morning which i feel is dawning for me the three great sorrows of his life held his attention in particular his love for a woman his death and the french invasion which had overrun half russia love that little girl who seemed to me brimming over with mystic forces yes indeed i loved her i made romantic plans of love and happiness with her oh what a boy i was he said aloud bitterly ah me i believed in some ideal love which was to keep her faithful to me for the whole year of my absence like the gentle dove in the fable she was to pine apart from me but it was much simpler really it was all very simple and horrible 
 when my father built bald hills he thought the place was his his land his air his peasants but napoleon came and swept him aside unconscious of his existence as he might brush a chip from his path and his bald hills and his whole life fell to pieces princess mary says it is a trial sent from above what is the trial for when he is not here and will never return he is not here for whom then is the trial intended the fatherland the destruction of moscow and tomorrow i shall be killed perhaps not even by a frenchman but by one of our own men by a soldier discharging a musket close to my ear as one of them did yesterday and the french will come and take me by head and heels and fling me into a hole that i may not stink under their noses and new conditions of life will arise which will seem quite ordinary to others and about which i shall know nothing i shall not exist 
 he looked at the row of birches shining in the sunshine with their motionless green and yellow foliage and white bark to die to be killed tomorrow that i should not exist that all this should still be but no me 
 and the birches with their light and shade the curly clouds the smoke of the campfires and all that was around him changed and seemed terrible and menacing a cold shiver ran down his spine he rose quickly went out of the shed and began to walk about 
 after he had returned voices were heard outside the shed that he cried 
 the captain timokhin formerly squadron commander but now from lack of officers a battalion commander shyly entered the shed followed by an adjutant and the regimental paymaster 
 prince andrew rose hastily listened to the business they had come about gave them some further instructions and was about to dismiss them when he heard a familiar lisping voice behind the shed 
 devil take it said the voice of a man stumbling over something 
 prince andrew looked out of the shed and saw pierre who had tripped over a pole on the ground and had nearly fallen coming his way it was unpleasant to prince andrew to meet people of his own set in general and pierre especially for he reminded him of all the painful moments of his last visit to moscow 
 you what a surprise said he what brings you here this is unexpected 
 as he said this his eyes and face expressed more than coldness they expressed hostility which pierre noticed at once he had approached the shed full of animation but on seeing prince face he felt constrained and ill at ease 
 i have come simply you know come it interests me said pierre who had so often that day senselessly repeated that word interesting i wish to see the battle 
 oh yes and what do the masonic brothers say about war how would they stop it said prince andrew sarcastically well and moscow and my people have they reached moscow at last he asked seriously 
 yes they have julie drubetskaya told me so i went to see them but missed them they have gone to your estate near moscow

 prince andrew rose hastily listened to the business they had come about gave them some further instructions and was about to dismiss them when he heard a familiar lisping voice behind the shed 
 devil take it said the voice of a man stumbling over something 
 prince andrew looked out of the shed and saw pierre who had tripped over a pole on the ground and had nearly fallen coming his way it was unpleasant to prince andrew to meet people of his own set in general and pierre especially for he reminded him of all the painful moments of his last visit to moscow 
 you what a surprise said he what brings you here this is unexpected 
 as he said this his eyes and face expressed more than coldness they expressed hostility which pierre noticed at once he had approached the shed full of animation but on seeing prince face he felt constrained and ill at ease 
 i have come simply you know come it interests me said pierre who had so often that day senselessly repeated that word interesting i wish to see the battle 
 oh yes and what do the masonic brothers say about war how would they stop it said prince andrew sarcastically well and moscow and my people have they reached moscow at last he asked seriously 
 yes they have julie drubetskaya told me so i went to see them but missed them they have gone to your estate near moscow

 marius dreamer as he was was as we have said firm and energetic by nature 
 his habits of solitary meditation while they had developed in him sympathy and compassion had perhaps diminished the faculty for irritation but had left intact the power of waxing indignant he had the kindliness of a brahmin and the severity of a judge he took pity upon a toad but he crushed a viper 
 now it was into a hole of vipers that his glance had just been directed it was a nest of monsters that he had beneath his eyes 
 these wretches must be stamped upon said he 
 not one of the enigmas which he had hoped to see solved had been elucidated on the contrary all of them had been rendered more dense if anything he knew nothing more about the beautiful maiden of the luxembourg and the man whom he called m leblanc except that jondrette was acquainted with them 
 athwart the mysterious words which had been uttered the only thing of which he caught a distinct glimpse was the fact that an ambush was in course of preparation a dark but terrible trap that both of them were incurring great danger she probably her father certainly that they must be saved that the hideous plots of the jondrettes must be thwarted and the web of these spiders broken 
 he scanned the female jondrette for a moment 
 she had pulled an old stove from a corner and she was rummaging among the old heap of iron 
 he descended from the commode as softly as possible taking care not to make the least noise 
 amid his terror as to what was in preparation and in the horror with which the jondrettes had inspired him he experienced a sort of joy at the idea that it might be granted to him perhaps to render a service to the one whom he loved 
 but how was it to be done 
 how warn the persons threatened he did not know their address 
 they had reappeared for an instant before his eyes and had then plunged back again into the immense depths of paris

 but jondrette and his men would see him on the watch the spot was lonely they were stronger than he they would devise means to seize him or to get him away and the man whom marius was anxious to save would be lost 
 one had just struck the trap was to be sprung at six 
 marius had five hours before him 
 there was but one thing to be done 
 he put on his decent coat knotted a silk handkerchief round his neck took his hat and went out without making any more noise than if he had been treading on moss with bare feet 
 moreover the jondrette woman continued to rummage among her old iron 
 once outside of the house he made for the rue du 
 he had almost reached the middle of this street near a very low wall which a man can easily step over at certain points and which abuts on a waste space and was walking slowly in consequence of his preoccupied condition and the snow deadened the sound of his steps all at once he heard voices talking very close by 
 he turned his head the street was deserted there was not a soul in it it was broad daylight and yet he distinctly heard voices 
 it occurred to him to glance over the wall which he was skirting 
 there in fact sat two men flat on the snow with their backs against the wall talking together in subdued tones 
 these two persons were strangers to him one was a bearded man in a blouse and the other a individual in rags the bearded man had on a fez the head was bare and the snow had lodged in his hair 
 by thrusting his head over the wall marius could hear their remarks

 book ten 
 chapter xxv 
 
 the officers were about to take leave but prince andrew apparently reluctant to be left alone with his friend asked them to stay and have tea seats were brought in and so was the tea the officers gazed with surprise at huge stout figure and listened to his talk of moscow and the position of our army round which he had ridden prince andrew remained silent and his expression was so forbidding that pierre addressed his remarks chiefly to the battalion commander 
 so you understand the whole position of our troops prince andrew interrupted him 
 yes that is how do you mean said pierre not being a military man i say i have understood it fully but i understand the general position 
 well then you know more than anyone else be it who it may said prince andrew 
 oh said pierre looking over his spectacles in perplexity at prince andrew well and what do think of appointment he asked 
 i was very glad of his appointment all i know replied prince andrew 
 and tell me your opinion of barclay de tolly in moscow they are saying heaven knows what about him what do you think of him 
 ask them replied prince andrew indicating the officers 
 pierre looked at timokhin with the condescendingly interrogative smile with which everybody involuntarily addressed that officer 
 we see light again since his serenity has been appointed your excellency said timokhin timidly and continually turning to glance at his colonel 
 why so asked pierre 
 well to mention only firewood and fodder let me inform you why when we were retreating from sventsyani we dare not touch a stick or a wisp of hay or anything you see we were going away so he would get it all it so your excellency and again timokhin turned to the prince but we in our regiment two officers were for that kind of thing but when his serenity took command everything became straight forward now we see light 
 then why was it forbidden 
 timokhin looked about in confusion not knowing what or how to answer such a question pierre put the same question to prince andrew 
 why so as not to lay waste the country we were abandoning to the enemy said prince andrew with venomous irony it is very sound one permit the land to be pillaged and accustom the troops to marauding at smolensk too he judged correctly that the french might outflank us as they had larger forces but he could not understand this cried prince andrew in a shrill voice that seemed to escape him involuntarily he could not understand that there for the first time we were fighting for russian soil and that there was a spirit in the men such as i had never seen before that we had held the french for two days and that that success had increased our strength tenfold he ordered us to retreat and all our efforts and losses went for nothing he had no thought of betraying us he tried to do the best he could he thought out everything and that is why he is unsuitable he is unsuitable now just because he plans out everything very thoroughly and accurately as every german has to how can i explain well say your father has a german valet and he is a splendid valet and satisfies your requirements better than you could then all right to let him serve but if your father is mortally sick send the valet away and attend to your father with your own unpracticed awkward hands and will soothe him better than a skilled man who is a stranger could so it has been with barclay while russia was well a foreigner could serve her and be a splendid minister but as soon as she is in danger she needs one of her own kin but in your club they have been making him out a traitor they slander him as a traitor and the only result will be that afterwards ashamed of their false accusations they will make him out a hero or a genius instead of a traitor and that will be still more unjust he is an honest and very punctilious german 
 and they say a skillful commander rejoined pierre 
 i understand what is meant by a skillful commander replied prince andrew ironically 
 a skillful commander replied pierre why one who foresees all contingencies and foresees the intentions 
 but impossible said prince andrew as if it were a matter settled long ago 
 pierre looked at him in surprise 
 and yet they say that war is like a game of chess he remarked 
 yes replied prince andrew but with this little difference that in chess you may think over each move as long as you please and are not limited for time and with this difference too that a knight is always stronger than a pawn and two pawns are always stronger than one while in war a battalion is sometimes stronger than a division and sometimes weaker than a company the relative strength of bodies of troops can never be known to anyone believe me he went on if things depended on arrangements made by the staff i should be there making arrangements but instead of that i have the honor to serve here in the regiment with these gentlemen and i consider that on us battle will depend and not on those others success never depends and never will depend on position or equipment or even on numbers and least of all on position 
 but on what then 
 on the feeling that is in me and in him he pointed to timokhin and in each soldier 
 prince andrew glanced at timokhin who looked at his commander in alarm and bewilderment in contrast to his former reticent taciturnity prince andrew now seemed excited he could apparently not refrain from expressing the thoughts that had suddenly occurred to him 
 a battle is won by those who firmly resolve to win it why did we lose the battle at austerlitz the french losses were almost equal to ours but very early we said to ourselves that we were losing the battle and we did lose it and we said so because we had nothing to fight for there we wanted to get away from the battlefield as soon as we could lost so let us run and we ran if we had not said that till the evening heaven knows what might not have happened but tomorrow we say it you talk about our position the left flank weak and the right flank too extended he went on all nonsense nothing of the kind but what awaits us tomorrow a hundred million most diverse chances which will be decided on the instant by the fact that our men or theirs run or do not run and that this man or that man is killed but all that is being done at present is only play the fact is that those men with whom you have ridden round the position not only do not help matters but hinder they are only concerned with their own petty interests 
 at such a moment said pierre reproachfully 
 at such a moment prince andrew repeated to them it is only a moment affording opportunities to undermine a rival and obtain an extra cross or ribbon for me tomorrow means this a russian army of a hundred thousand and a french army of a hundred thousand have met to fight and the thing is that these two hundred thousand men will fight and the side that fights more fiercely and spares itself least will win and if you like i will tell you that whatever happens and whatever muddles those at the top may make we shall win battle tomorrow happen what may we shall win 
 there now your excellency the truth the real truth said timokhin who would spare himself now the soldiers in my battalion believe me drink their vodka not the day for that they say 
 all were silent the officers rose prince andrew went out of the shed with them giving final orders to the adjutant after they had gone pierre approached prince andrew and was about to start a conversation when they heard the clatter of three horses hoofs on the road not far from the shed and looking in that direction prince andrew recognized wolzogen and clausewitz accompanied by a cossack they rode close by continuing to converse and prince andrew involuntarily heard these words 
 der krieg muss in raum verlegt werden der ansicht kann ich nicht genug preis geben said one of them 
 the war must be extended widely i cannot sufficiently commend that view 
 oh ja said the other der zweck ist nur den feind zu schwachen so kann man gewiss nicht den verlust der in achtung nehmen 
 oh yes the only aim is to weaken the enemy so of course one cannot take into account the loss of private individuals 
 oh no agreed the other 
 extend widely said prince andrew with an angry snort when they had ridden past in that extend were my father son and sister at bald hills all the same to him what i was saying to you those german gentlemen win the battle tomorrow but will only make all the mess they can because they have nothing in their german heads but theories not worth an empty eggshell and in their hearts the one thing needed tomorrow that which timokhin has they have yielded up all europe to him and have now come to teach us fine teachers and again his voice grew shrill 
 so you think we shall win battle asked pierre 
 yes yes answered prince andrew absently one thing i would do if i had the power he began again i would not take prisoners why take prisoners chivalry the french have destroyed my home and are on their way to destroy moscow they have outraged and are outraging me every moment they are my enemies in my opinion they are all criminals and so thinks timokhin and the whole army they should be executed since they are my foes they cannot be my friends whatever may have been said at tilsit 
 yes yes muttered pierre looking with shining eyes at prince andrew i quite agree with you 
 the question that had perturbed pierre on the mozhaysk hill and all that day now seemed to him quite clear and completely solved he now understood the whole meaning and importance of this war and of the impending battle all he had seen that day all the significant and stern expressions on the faces he had seen in passing were lit up for him by a new light he understood that latent heat as they say in physics of patriotism which was present in all these men he had seen and this explained to him why they all prepared for death calmly and as it were lightheartedly 
 not take prisoners prince andrew continued that by itself would quite change the whole war and make it less cruel as it is we have played at war vile we play at magnanimity and all that stuff such magnanimity and sensibility are like the magnanimity and sensibility of a lady who faints when she sees a calf being killed she is so that she look at blood but enjoys eating the calf served up with sauce they talk to us of the rules of war of chivalry of flags of truce of mercy to the unfortunate and so on all rubbish i saw chivalry and flags of truce in they humbugged us and we humbugged them they plunder other houses issue false paper money and worst of all they kill my children and my father and then talk of rules of war and magnanimity to foes take no prisoners but kill and be killed he who has come to this as i have through the same sufferings 
 prince andrew who had thought it was all the same to him whether or not moscow was taken as smolensk had been was suddenly checked in his speech by an unexpected cramp in his throat he paced up and down a few times in silence but his eyes glittered feverishly and his lips quivered as he began speaking 
 if there was none of this magnanimity in war we should go to war only when it was worth while going to certain death as now then there would not be war because paul ivanovich had offended michael ivanovich and when there was a war like this one it would be war and then the determination of the troops would be quite different then all these westphalians and hessians whom napoleon is leading would not follow him into russia and we should not go to fight in austria and prussia without knowing why war is not courtesy but the most horrible thing in life and we ought to understand that and not play at war we ought to accept this terrible necessity sternly and seriously it all lies in that get rid of falsehood and let war be war and not a game as it is now war is the favorite pastime of the idle and frivolous the military calling is the most highly honored 
 but what is war what is needed for success in warfare what are the habits of the military the aim of war is murder the methods of war are spying treachery and their encouragement the ruin of a inhabitants robbing them or stealing to provision the army and fraud and falsehood termed military craft the habits of the military class are the absence of freedom that is discipline idleness ignorance cruelty debauchery and drunkenness and in spite of all this it is the highest class respected by everyone all the kings except the chinese wear military uniforms and he who kills most people receives the highest rewards 
 they meet as we shall meet tomorrow to murder one another they kill and maim tens of thousands and then have thanksgiving services for having killed so many people they even exaggerate the number and they announce a victory supposing that the more people they have killed the greater their achievement how does god above look at them and hear them exclaimed prince andrew in a shrill piercing voice ah my friend it has of late become hard for me to live i see that i have begun to understand too much and it do for man to taste of the tree of knowledge of good and evil ah well not for long he added 
 however sleepy and time for me to sleep go back to gorki said prince andrew suddenly 
 oh no pierre replied looking at prince andrew with frightened compassionate eyes 
 go go before a battle one must have sleep out repeated prince andrew 
 he came quickly up to pierre and embraced and kissed him be off he shouted whether we meet again or not and turning away hurriedly he entered the shed 
 it was already dark and pierre could not make out whether the expression of prince face was angry or tender 
 for some time he stood in silence considering whether he should follow him or go away no he does not want it pierre concluded and i know that this is our last meeting he sighed deeply and rode back to gorki 
 on the shed prince andrew lay down on a rug but he could not sleep 
 he closed his eyes one picture succeeded another in his imagination on one of them he dwelt long and joyfully he vividly recalled an evening in petersburg natasha with animated and excited face was telling him how she had gone to look for mushrooms the previous summer and had lost her way in the big forest she incoherently described the depths of the forest her feelings and a talk with a beekeeper she met and constantly interrupted her story to say no i not telling it right no you understand though he encouraged her by saying that he did understand and he really had understood all she wanted to say but natasha was not satisfied with her own words she felt that they did not convey the passionately poetic feeling she had experienced that day and wished to convey he was such a delightful old man and it was so dark in the forest and he had such kind no i describe it she had said flushed and excited prince andrew smiled now the same happy smile as then when he had looked into her eyes i understood her he thought i not only understood her but it was just that inner spiritual force that sincerity that frankness of soul that very soul of hers which seemed to be fettered by her body it was that soul i loved in her loved so strongly and happily and suddenly he remembered how his love had ended he did not need anything of that kind he neither saw nor understood anything of the sort he only saw in her a pretty and fresh young girl with whom he did not deign to unite his fate and i and he is still alive and gay 
 prince andrew jumped up as if someone had burned him and again began pacing up and down in front of the shed

 not take prisoners prince andrew continued that by itself would quite change the whole war and make it less cruel as it is we have played at war vile we play at magnanimity and all that stuff such magnanimity and sensibility are like the magnanimity and sensibility of a lady who faints when she sees a calf being killed she is so that she look at blood but enjoys eating the calf served up with sauce they talk to us of the rules of war of chivalry of flags of truce of mercy to the unfortunate and so on all rubbish i saw chivalry and flags of truce in they humbugged us and we humbugged them they plunder other houses issue false paper money and worst of all they kill my children and my father and then talk of rules of war and magnanimity to foes take no prisoners but kill and be killed he who has come to this as i have through the same sufferings 
 prince andrew who had thought it was all the same to him whether or not moscow was taken as smolensk had been was suddenly checked in his speech by an unexpected cramp in his throat he paced up and down a few times in silence but his eyes glittered feverishly and his lips quivered as he began speaking 
 if there was none of this magnanimity in war we should go to war only when it was worth while going to certain death as now then there would not be war because paul ivanovich had offended michael ivanovich and when there was a war like this one it would be war and then the determination of the troops would be quite different then all these westphalians and hessians whom napoleon is leading would not follow him into russia and we should not go to fight in austria and prussia without knowing why war is not courtesy but the most horrible thing in life and we ought to understand that and not play at war we ought to accept this terrible necessity sternly and seriously it all lies in that get rid of falsehood and let war be war and not a game as it is now war is the favorite pastime of the idle and frivolous the military calling is the most highly honored 
 but what is war what is needed for success in warfare what are the habits of the military the aim of war is murder the methods of war are spying treachery and their encouragement the ruin of a inhabitants robbing them or stealing to provision the army and fraud and falsehood termed military craft the habits of the military class are the absence of freedom that is discipline idleness ignorance cruelty debauchery and drunkenness and in spite of all this it is the highest class respected by everyone all the kings except the chinese wear military uniforms and he who kills most people receives the highest rewards 
 they meet as we shall meet tomorrow to murder one another they kill and maim tens of thousands and then have thanksgiving services for having killed so many people they even exaggerate the number and they announce a victory supposing that the more people they have killed the greater their achievement how does god above look at them and hear them exclaimed prince andrew in a shrill piercing voice ah my friend it has of late become hard for me to live i see that i have begun to understand too much and it do for man to taste of the tree of knowledge of good and evil ah well not for long he added 
 however sleepy and time for me to sleep go back to gorki said prince andrew suddenly 
 oh no pierre replied looking at prince andrew with frightened compassionate eyes 
 go go before a battle one must have sleep out repeated prince andrew 
 he came quickly up to pierre and embraced and kissed him be off he shouted whether we meet again or not and turning away hurriedly he entered the shed 
 it was already dark and pierre could not make out whether the expression of prince face was angry or tender 
 for some time he stood in silence considering whether he should follow him or go away no he does not want it pierre concluded and i know that this is our last meeting he sighed deeply and rode back to gorki 
 on the shed prince andrew lay down on a rug but he could not sleep 
 he closed his eyes one picture succeeded another in his imagination on one of them he dwelt long and joyfully he vividly recalled an evening in petersburg natasha with animated and excited face was telling him how she had gone to look for mushrooms the previous summer and had lost her way in the big forest she incoherently described the depths of the forest her feelings and a talk with a beekeeper she met and constantly interrupted her story to say no i not telling it right no you understand though he encouraged her by saying that he did understand and he really had understood all she wanted to say but natasha was not satisfied with her own words she felt that they did not convey the passionately poetic feeling she had experienced that day and wished to convey he was such a delightful old man and it was so dark in the forest and he had such kind no i describe it she had said flushed and excited prince andrew smiled now the same happy smile as then when he had looked into her eyes i understood her he thought i not only understood her but it was just that inner spiritual force that sincerity that frankness of soul that very soul of hers which seemed to be fettered by her body it was that soul i loved in her loved so strongly and happily and suddenly he remembered how his love had ended he did not need anything of that kind he neither saw nor understood anything of the sort he only saw in her a pretty and fresh young girl with whom he did not deign to unite his fate and i and he is still alive and gay 
 prince andrew jumped up as if someone had burned him and again began pacing up and down in front of the shed

 book wicked poor man 
 chapter xiv 
 
 in which a police agent bestows two fistfuls on a lawyer 
 on arriving at no rue de pontoise he ascended to the first floor and inquired for the commissary of police 
 the commissary of police is not here said a clerk but there is an inspector who takes his place 
 would you like to speak to him are you in haste 
 yes said marius 
 the clerk introduced him into the office 
 there stood a tall man behind a grating leaning against a stove and holding up with both hands the tails of a vast topcoat with three collars his face was square with a thin firmmouth thick gray and very ferocious whiskers and a look that was enough to turn your pockets inside out 
 of that glance it might have been well said not that it penetrated but that it searched 
 this air was not much less ferocious nor less terrible than the dog is at times no less terrible to meet than the wolf 
 what do you want he said to marius without adding monsieur 
 is this monsieur le commissaire de police 
 he is absent 
 i am here in his stead 
 the matter is very private 
 then speak 
 and great haste is required 
 then speak quick 
 this calm abrupt man was both terrifying and reassuring at one and the same time 
 he inspired fear and confidence marius related the adventure to him 
 that a person with whom he was not acquainted otherwise than by sight was to be inveigled into a trap that very evening that as he occupied the room adjoining the den he marius pontmercy a lawyer had heard the whole plot through the partition that the wretch who had planned the trap was a certain jondrette that there would be accomplices probably some prowlers of the barriers among others a certain panchaud alias printanier alias bigrenaille that daughters were to lie in wait that there was no way of warning the threatened man since he did not even know his name and that finally all this was to be carried out at six that evening at the most deserted point of the boulevard de in house no 
 at the sound of this number the inspector raised his head and said coldly 
 so it is in the room at the end of the corridor 
 precisely answered marius and he added 
 are you acquainted with that house 
 the inspector remained silent for a moment then replied as he warmed the heel of his boot at the door of the stove 
 apparently 
 he went on muttering between his teeth and not addressing marius so much as his cravat 
 must have had a hand in this 
 this word struck marius 
 said he i did hear that word pronounced in fact 
 and he repeated to the inspector the dialogue between the man and the bearded man in the snow behind the wall of the rue du 
 the inspector muttered 
 the man must be brujon and the bearded one alias 
 he had dropped his eyelids again and became absorbed in thought 
 as for father i think i recognize him here burned my coat 
 they always have too much fire in these cursed stoves 
 number former property of gorbeau 
 then he glanced at marius 
 you saw only that bearded and that man 
 and panchaud 
 you see a little imp of a dandy prowling about the premises 
 no 
 nor a big lump of matter resembling an elephant in the jardin des plantes 
 no 
 nor a scamp with the air of an old red tail 
 no 
 as for the fourth no one sees him not even his adjutants clerks and employees 
 it is not surprising that you did not see him 
 no who are all those persons asked marius 
 the inspector answered 
 besides this is not the time for them 
 he relapsed into silence then resumed 
 i know that barrack 
 impossible to conceal ourselves inside it without the artists seeing us and then they will get off simply by countermanding the vaudeville 
 they are so modest an audience embarrasses them 
 none of that none of that 
 i want to hear them sing and make them dance 
 this monologue concluded he turned to marius and demanded gazing at him intently the while 
 are you afraid 
 of what said marius 
 of these men 
 no more than yourself retorted marius rudely who had begun to notice that this police agent had not yet said monsieur to him 
 the inspector stared still more intently at marius and continued with sententious solemnity 
 there you speak like a brave man and like an honest man courage does not fear crime and honesty does not fear authority 
 marius interrupted him 
 that is well but what do you intend to do 
 the inspector contented himself with the remark 
 the lodgers have with which to get in at night you must have one 
 yes said marius 
 have you it about you 
 yes 
 give it to me said the inspector 
 marius took his key from his waistcoat pocket handed it to the inspector and added 
 if you will take my advice you will come in force 
 the inspector cast on marius such a glance as voltaire might have bestowed on a provincial academician who had suggested a rhyme to him with one movement he plunged his hands which were enormous into the two immense pockets of his and pulled out two small steel pistols of the sort called then he presented them to marius saying rapidly in a curt tone 
 take these 
 go home 
 hide in your chamber so that you may be supposed to have gone out 
 they are loaded 
 each one carries two balls 
 you will keep watch there is a hole in the wall as you have informed me 
 these men will come 
 leave them to their own devices for a time 
 when you think matters have reached a crisis and that it is time to put a stop to them fire a shot not too soon 
 the rest concerns me 
 a shot into the ceiling the air no matter where 
 above all things not too soon 
 wait until they begin to put their project into execution you are a lawyer you know the proper point 
 marius took the pistols and put them in the side pocket of his coat 
 that makes a lump that can be seen said the inspector put them in your trousers pocket 
 marius hid the pistols in his trousers pockets 
 now pursued the inspector there is not a minute more to be lost by any one 
 what time is it 
 two 
 seven is the hour 
 six answered marius 
 i have plenty of time said the inspector but no more than enough forget anything that i have said to you 
 bang 
 a pistol shot 
 rest easy said marius 
 and as marius laid his hand on the handle of the door on his way out the inspector called to him 
 by the way if you have occasion for my services between now and then come or send here 
 you will ask for inspector javert

 on august the eve of the battle of borodino m de beausset prefect of the french palace arrived at quarters at valuevo with colonel fabvier the former from paris and the latter from madrid 
 donning his court uniform m de beausset ordered a box he had brought for the emperor to be carried before him and entered the first compartment of tent where he began opening the box while conversing with who surrounded him 
 fabvier not entering the tent remained at the entrance talking to some generals of his acquaintance 
 the emperor napoleon had not yet left his bedroom and was finishing his toilet slightly snorting and grunting he presented now his back and now his plump hairy chest to the brush with which his valet was rubbing him down another valet with his finger over the mouth of a bottle was sprinkling eau de cologne on the pampered body with an expression which seemed to say that he alone knew where and how much eau de cologne should be sprinkled short hair was wet and matted on the forehead but his face though puffy and yellow expressed physical satisfaction go on harder go on he muttered to the valet who was rubbing him slightly twitching and grunting an who had entered the bedroom to report to the emperor the number of prisoners taken in action was standing by the door after delivering his message awaiting permission to withdraw napoleon frowning looked at him from under his brows 
 no prisoners said he repeating the words they are forcing us to exterminate them so much the worse for the russian army go on harder harder he muttered hunching his back and presenting his fat shoulders 
 all right let monsieur de beausset enter and fabvier too he said nodding to the 
 yes sire and the disappeared through the door of the tent 
 two valets rapidly dressed his majesty and wearing the blue uniform of the guards he went with firm quick steps to the reception room 
 de hands meanwhile were busily engaged arranging the present he had brought from the empress on two chairs directly in front of the entrance but napoleon had dressed and come out with such unexpected rapidity that he had not time to finish arranging the surprise 
 napoleon noticed at once what they were about and guessed that they were not ready he did not wish to deprive them of the pleasure of giving him a surprise so he pretended not to see de beausset and called fabvier to him listening silently and with a stern frown to what fabvier told him of the heroism and devotion of his troops fighting at salamanca at the other end of europe with but one thought to be worthy of their emperor and but one fear to fail to please him the result of that battle had been deplorable napoleon made ironic remarks during account as if he had not expected that matters could go otherwise in his absence 
 i must make up for that in moscow said napoleon see you later he added and summoned de beausset who by that time had prepared the surprise having placed something on the chairs and covered it with a cloth 
 de beausset bowed low with that courtly french bow which only the old retainers of the bourbons knew how to make and approached him presenting an envelope 
 napoleon turned to him gaily and pulled his ear 
 you have hurried here i am very glad well what is paris saying he asked suddenly changing his former stern expression for a most cordial tone 
 sire all paris regrets your absence replied de beausset as was proper 
 but though napoleon knew that de beausset had to say something of this kind and though in his lucid moments he knew it was untrue he was pleased to hear it from him again he honored him by touching his ear 
 i am very sorry to have made you travel so far said he 
 sire i expected nothing less than to find you at the gates of moscow replied de beausset 
 napoleon smiled and lifting his head absentmindedly glanced to the right an approached with gliding steps and offered him a gold snuffbox which he took 
 yes it has happened luckily for you he said raising the open snuffbox to his nose you are fond of travel and in three days you will see moscow you surely did not expect to see that asiatic capital you will have a pleasant journey 
 de beausset bowed gratefully at this regard for his taste for travel of which he had not till then been aware 
 ha this asked napoleon noticing that all the courtiers were looking at something concealed under a cloth 
 with courtly adroitness de beausset half turned and without turning his back to the emperor retired two steps twitching off the cloth at the same time and said 
 a present to your majesty from the empress 
 it was a portrait painted in bright colors by gerard of the son borne to napoleon by the daughter of the emperor of austria the boy whom for some reason everyone called the king of rome 
 a very pretty boy with a look of the christ in the sistine madonna was depicted playing at stick and ball the ball represented the terrestrial globe and the stick in his other hand a scepter 
 though it was not clear what the artist meant to express by depicting the king of rome spiking the earth with a stick the allegory apparently seemed to napoleon as it had done to all who had seen it in paris quite clear and very pleasing 
 the king of rome he said pointing to the portrait with a graceful gesture admirable 
 with the natural capacity of an italian for changing the expression of his face at will he drew nearer to the portrait and assumed a look of pensive tenderness he felt that what he now said and did would be historical and it seemed to him that it would now be best for him whose grandeur enabled his son to play stick and ball with the terrestrial globe to show in contrast to that grandeur the simplest paternal tenderness his eyes grew dim he moved forward glanced round at a chair which seemed to place itself under him and sat down on it before the portrait at a single gesture from him everyone went out on tiptoe leaving the great man to himself and his emotion 
 having sat still for a while he touched himself not knowing why the thick spot of paint representing the highest light in the portrait rose and recalled de beausset and the officer on duty he ordered the portrait to be carried outside his tent that the old guard stationed round it might not be deprived of the pleasure of seeing the king of rome the son and heir of their adored monarch 
 and while he was doing m de beausset the honor of breakfasting with him they heard as napoleon had anticipated the rapturous cries of the officers and men of the old guard who had run up to see the portrait 
 vive vive le roi de rome vive came those ecstatic cries 
 after breakfast napoleon in de presence dictated his order of the day to the army 
 short and energetic he remarked when he had read over the proclamation which he had dictated straight off without corrections it ran 
 soldiers this is the battle you have so longed for victory depends on you it is essential for us it will give us all we need comfortable quarters and a speedy return to our country behave as you did at austerlitz friedland vitebsk and smolensk let our remotest posterity recall your achievements this day with pride let it be said of each of you he was in the great battle before moscow 
 before moscow repeated napoleon and inviting m de beausset who was so fond of travel to accompany him on his ride he went out of the tent to where the horses stood saddled 
 your majesty is too kind replied de beausset to the invitation to accompany the emperor he wanted to sleep did not know how to ride and was afraid of doing so 
 but napoleon nodded to the traveler and de beausset had to mount when napoleon came out of the tent the shouting of the guards before his portrait grew still louder napoleon frowned 
 take him away he said pointing with a gracefully majestic gesture to the portrait it is too soon for him to see a field of battle 
 de beausset closed his eyes bowed his head and sighed deeply to indicate how profoundly he valued and comprehended the words

 but who the deuce is he following 
 some fine flowery bonneted wench 
 in love 
 but observed bossuet i see any wench nor any flowery bonnet in the street 
 not a woman round 
 courfeyrac took a survey and exclaimed 
 following a man 
 a man in fact wearing a gray cap and whose gray beard could be distinguished although they only saw his back was walking along about twenty paces in advance of marius 
 this man was dressed in a which was perfectly new and too large for him and in a frightful pair of trousers all hanging in rags and black with mud 
 bossuet burst out laughing 
 who is that man 
 he retorted courfeyrac a poet 
 poets are very fond of wearing the trousers of dealers in rabbit skins and the overcoats of peers of france 
 see where marius will go said bossuet see where the man is going follow them hey 
 bossuet exclaimed courfeyrac eagle of meaux 
 you are a prodigious brute 
 follow a man who is following another man indeed 
 they retraced their steps 
 marius had in fact seen jondrette passing along the rue mouffetard and was spying on his proceedings 
 jondrette walked straight ahead without a suspicion that he was already held by a glance 
 he quitted the rue mouffetard and marius saw him enter one of the most terrible hovels in the rue gracieuse he remained there about a quarter of an hour then returned to the rue mouffetard he halted at an shop which then stood at the corner of the rue and a few minutes later marius saw him emerge from the shop holding in his hand a huge cold chisel with a white wood handle which he concealed beneath his at the top of the rue he turned to the left and proceeded rapidly to the rue du the day was declining the snow which had ceased for a moment had just begun again marius posted himself on the watch at the very corner of the rue du which was deserted as usual and did not follow jondrette into it 
 it was lucky that he did so for on arriving in the vicinity of the wall where marius had heard the man and the bearded man conversing jondrette turned round made sure that no one was following him did not see him then sprang across the wall and disappeared 
 the waste land bordered by this wall communicated with the back yard of an of bad repute who had failed and who still kept a few old berlins under his sheds 
 marius thought that it would be wise to profit by absence to return home moreover it was growing late every evening bougon when she set out for her in town had a habit of locking the door which was always closed at dusk marius had given his key to the inspector of police it was important therefore that he should make haste 
 evening had arrived night had almost closed in on the horizon and in the immensity of space there remained but one spot illuminated by the sun and that was the moon 
 it was rising in a ruddy glow behind the low dome of salpetriere 
 marius returned to no with great strides 
 the door was still open when he arrived 
 he mounted the stairs on and glided along the wall of the corridor to his chamber 
 this corridor as the reader will remember was bordered on both sides by attics all of which were for the moment empty and to let 
 bougon was in the habit of leaving all the doors open 
 as he passed one of these attics marius thought he perceived in the uninhabited cell the motionless heads of four men vaguely lighted up by a remnant of daylight falling through a dormer window 
 marius made no attempt to see not wishing to be seen himself he succeeded in reaching his chamber without being seen and without making any noise 
 it was high time 
 a moment later he heard bougon take her departure locking the door of the house behind her

 jondrette makes his purchases 
 a few moments later about three courfeyrac chanced to be passing along the rue mouffetard in company with bossuet the snow had redoubled in violence and filled the air 
 bossuet was just saying to courfeyrac 
 one would say to see all these fall that there was a plague of white butterflies in heaven 
 all at once bossuet caught sight of marius coming up the street towards the barrier with a peculiar air 
 hold said bossuet 
 marius 
 i saw him said courfeyrac 
 speak to him 
 why 
 he is busy 
 with what 
 you see his air 
 what air 
 he has the air of a man who is following some one 
 true said bossuet 
 just see the eyes he is making said courfeyrac 
 but who the deuce is he following 
 some fine flowery bonneted wench 
 in love 
 but observed bossuet i see any wench nor any flowery bonnet in the street

 on the of august so his historians tell us napoleon spent the whole day on horseback inspecting the locality considering plans submitted to him by his marshals and personally giving commands to his generals 
 the original line of the russian forces along the river kolocha had been dislocated by the capture of the shevardino redoubt on the and part of the line the left flank had been drawn back that part of the line was not entrenched and in front of it the ground was more open and level than elsewhere it was evident to anyone military or not that it was here the french should attack it would seem that not much consideration was needed to reach this conclusion nor any particular care or trouble on the part of the emperor and his marshals nor was there any need of that special and supreme quality called genius that people are so apt to ascribe to napoleon yet the historians who described the event later and the men who then surrounded napoleon and he himself thought otherwise 
 napoleon rode over the plain and surveyed the locality with a profound air and in silence nodded with approval or shook his head dubiously and without communicating to the generals around him the profound course of ideas which guided his decisions merely gave them his final conclusions in the form of commands having listened to a suggestion from davout who was now called prince to turn the russian left wing napoleon said it should not be done without explaining why not to a proposal made by general campan who was to attack the fleches to lead his division through the woods napoleon agreed though the duke of elchingen ney ventured to remark that a movement through the woods was dangerous and might disorder the division 
 having inspected the country opposite the shevardino redoubt napoleon pondered a little in silence and then indicated the spots where two batteries should be set up by the morrow to act against the russian entrenchments and the places where in line with them the field artillery should be placed 
 after giving these and other commands he returned to his tent and the dispositions for the battle were written down from his dictation 
 these dispositions of which the french historians write with enthusiasm and other historians with profound respect were as follows 
 at dawn the two new batteries established during the night on the plain occupied by the prince will open fire on the opposing batteries of the enemy 
 at the same time the commander of the artillery of the st corps general pernetti with thirty cannon of division and all the howitzers of and divisions will move forward open fire and overwhelm with shellfire the battery against which will operate 
 guns of the artillery of the guards 
 guns of division 
 and guns of and divisions 
 
 in all guns 
 the commander of the artillery of the rd corps general fouche will place the howitzers of the rd and th corps sixteen in all on the flanks of the battery that is to bombard the entrenchment on the left which will have forty guns in all directed against it 
 general sorbier must be ready at the first order to advance with all the howitzers of the artillery against either one or other of the entrenchments 
 during the cannonade prince poniatowski is to advance through the wood on the village and turn the position 
 general campan will move through the wood to seize the first fortification 
 after the advance has begun in this manner orders will be given in accordance with the movements 
 the cannonade on the left flank will begin as soon as the guns of the right wing are heard the sharpshooters of division and of the division will open a heavy fire on seeing the attack commence on the right wing 
 the will occupy the village and cross by its three bridges advancing to the same heights as and divisions which under his leadership will be directed against the redoubt and come into line with the rest of the forces 
 all this must be done in good order le tout se fera avec ordre et methode as far as possible retaining troops in reserve 
 the imperial camp near mozhaysk 
 september 
 these dispositions which are very obscure and confused if one allows oneself to regard the arrangements without religious awe of his genius related to orders to deal with four points four different orders not one of these was or could be carried out 
 in the disposition it is said first that the batteries placed on the spot chosen by napoleon with the guns of pernetti and fouche which were to come in line with them guns in all were to open fire and shower shells on the russian fleches and redoubts this could not be done as from the spots selected by napoleon the projectiles did not carry to the russian works and those guns shot into the air until the nearest commander contrary to instructions moved them forward 
 the second order was that poniatowski moving to the village through the wood should turn the russian left flank this could not be done and was not done because poniatowski advancing on the village through the wood met tuchkov there barring his way and could not and did not turn the russian position 
 the third order was general campan will move through the wood to seize the first fortification general division did not seize the first fortification but was driven back for on emerging from the wood it had to reform under grapeshot of which napoleon was unaware 
 the fourth order was the will occupy the village borodino and cross by its three bridges advancing to the same heights as and divisions for whose movements no directions are given which under his leadership will be directed against the redoubt and come into line with the rest of the forces 
 as far as one can make out not so much from this unintelligible sentence as from the attempts the made to execute the orders given him he was to advance from the left through borodino to the redoubt while the divisions of morand and gerard were to advance simultaneously from the front 
 all this like the other parts of the disposition was not and could not be executed after passing through borodino the was driven back to the kolocha and could get no farther while the divisions of morand and gerard did not take the redoubt but were driven back and the redoubt was only taken at the end of the battle by the cavalry a thing probably unforeseen and not heard of by napoleon so not one of the orders in the disposition was or could be executed but in the disposition it is said that after the fight has commenced in this manner orders will be given in accordance with the movements and so it might be supposed that all necessary arrangements would be made by napoleon during the battle but this was not and could not be done for during the whole battle napoleon was so far away that as appeared later he could not know the course of the battle and not one of his orders during the fight could be executed

 in which will be found the words to an english air which was in fashion in 
 marius seated himself on his bed 
 it might have been five only half an hour separated him from what was about to happen he heard the beating of his arteries as one hears the ticking of a watch in the dark 
 he thought of the double march which was going on at that moment in the advancing on one side justice coming up on the other 
 he was not afraid but he could not think without a shudder of what was about to take place as is the case with all those who are suddenly assailed by an unforeseen adventure the entire day produced upon him the effect of a dream and in order to persuade himself that he was not the prey of a nightmare he had to feel the cold barrels of the steel pistols in his trousers pockets 
 it was no longer snowing the moon disengaged itself more and more clearly from the mist and its light mingled with the white reflection of the snow which had fallen communicated to the chamber a sort of twilight aspect 
 there was a light in the jondrette den 
 marius saw the hole in the wall shining with a reddish glow which seemed bloody to him 
 it was true that the light could not be produced by a candle however there was not a sound in the jondrette quarters not a soul was moving there not a soul speaking not a breath the silence was glacial and profound and had it not been for that light he might have thought himself next door to a sepulchre 
 marius softly removed his boots and pushed them under his bed 
 several minutes elapsed 
 marius heard the lower door turn on its hinges a heavy step mounted the staircase and hastened along the corridor the latch of the hovel was noisily lifted it was jondrette returning 
 instantly several voices arose 
 the whole family was in the garret 
 only it had been silent in the absence like wolf whelps in the absence of the wolf 
 i said he 
 good evening daddy yelped the girls 
 well said the mother 
 going responded jondrette but my feet are beastly cold 
 good 
 you have dressed up 
 you have done well you must inspire confidence 
 all ready to go out 
 forget what i told you 
 you will do everything sure 
 rest easy 
 because said jondrette 
 and he left the phrase unfinished 
 marius heard him lay something heavy on the table probably the chisel which he had purchased 
 by the way said jondrette have you been eating here 
 yes said the mother 
 i got three large potatoes and some salt i took advantage of the fire to cook them 
 good returned jondrette 
 i will take you out to dine with me 
 we will have a duck and fixings 
 you shall dine like charles the tenth all is going well 
 then he added 
 the is open 
 the cats are there 
 he lowered his voice still further and said 
 put this in the fire 
 marius heard a sound of charcoal being knocked with the tongs or some iron utensil and jondrette continued 
 have you greased the hinges of the door so that they will not squeak 
 yes replied the mother 
 what time is it 
 nearly six 
 the struck from a while ago 
 the devil ejaculated jondrette the children must go and watch come you do you listen here 
 a whispering ensued 
 voice became audible again 
 has old bougon left 
 yes said the mother 
 are you sure that there is no one in our room 
 he has not been in all day and you know very well that this is his dinner hour 
 you are sure 
 sure 
 all the same said jondrette no harm in going to see whether he is there 
 here my girl take the candle and go there 
 marius fell on his hands and knees and crawled silently under his bed 
 hardly had he concealed himself when he perceived a light through the crack of his door 
 cried a voice he is not in here 
 he recognized the voice of the eldest daughter 
 did you go in demanded her father 
 no replied the girl but as his key is in the door he must be out 
 the father exclaimed 
 go in nevertheless 
 the door opened and marius saw the tall jondrette come in with a candle in her hand 
 she was as she had been in the morning only still more repulsive in this light 
 she walked straight up to the bed 
 marius endured an indescribable moment of anxiety but near the bed there was a mirror nailed to the wall and it was thither that she was directing her steps she raised herself on tiptoe and looked at herself in it in the neighboring room the sound of iron articles being moved was audible 
 she smoothed her hair with the palm of her hand and smiled into the mirror humming with her cracked and sepulchral amours ont dure toute une semaine 
 mais que du bonheur les instants sont courts 
 huit jours c etait bien la peine 
 le temps des amours devait durer toujours 
 devrait durer toujours devrait durer toujours 
 our love has lasted a whole week but how short are the instants of happiness 
 to adore each other for eight days was hardly worth the while 
 the time of love should last forever 
 in the meantime marius trembled 
 it seemed impossible to him that she should not hear his breathing 
 she stepped to the window and looked out with the way she had 
 how ugly paris is when it has put on a white chemise said she 
 she returned to the mirror and began again to put on airs before it scrutinizing herself and face in turn 
 well cried her father what are you about there 
 i am looking under the bed and the furniture she replied continuing to arrange her hair no one here 
 booby yelled her father 
 come here this minute 
 and waste any time about it 
 coming 
 coming said she 
 one has no time for anything in this hovel 
 she me quittez pour aller a la gloire 
 mon triste coeur suivra partout 
 you leave me to go to glory my sad heart will follow you everywhere 
 she cast a parting glance in the mirror and went out shutting the door behind her 
 a moment more and marius heard the sound of the two young girls bare feet in the corridor and voice shouting to them 
 pay strict heed 
 one on the side of the barrier the other at the corner of the rue du lose sight for a moment of the door of this house and the moment you see anything rush here on the instant as hard as you can go 
 you have a key to get in 
 the eldest girl grumbled 
 the idea of standing watch in the snow barefoot 
 you shall have some dainty little green silk boots said the father 
 they ran down stairs and a few seconds later the shock of the outer door as it banged to announced that they were outside 
 there now remained in the house only marius the jondrettes and probably also the mysterious persons of whom marius had caught a glimpse in the twilight behind the door of the unused attic

 many historians say that the french did not win the battle of borodino because napoleon had a cold and that if he had not had a cold the orders he gave before and during the battle would have been still more full of genius and russia would have been lost and the face of the world have been changed to historians who believe that russia was shaped by the will of one man peter the great and that france from a republic became an empire and french armies went to russia at the will of one man napoleon to say that russia remained a power because napoleon had a bad cold on the of august may seem logical and convincing 
 if it had depended on will to fight or not to fight the battle of borodino and if this or that other arrangement depended on his will then evidently a cold affecting the manifestation of his will might have saved russia and consequently the valet who omitted to bring napoleon his waterproof boots on the would have been the savior of russia along that line of thought such a deduction is indubitable as indubitable as the deduction voltaire made in jest without knowing what he was jesting at when he saw that the massacre of st bartholomew was due to charles stomach being deranged but to men who do not admit that russia was formed by the will of one man peter i or that the french empire was formed and the war with russia begun by the will of one man napoleon that argument seems not merely untrue and irrational but contrary to all human reality to the question of what causes historic events another answer presents itself namely that the course of human events is predetermined from on high depends on the coincidence of the wills of all who take part in the events and that a influence on the course of these events is purely external and fictitious 
 strange as at first glance it may seem to suppose that the massacre of st bartholomew was not due to charles will though he gave the order for it and thought it was done as a result of that order and strange as it may seem to suppose that the slaughter of eighty thousand men at borodino was not due to will though he ordered the commencement and conduct of the battle and thought it was done because he ordered it strange as these suppositions appear yet human dignity which tells me that each of us is if not more at least not less a man than the great napoleon demands the acceptance of that solution of the question and historic investigation abundantly confirms it 
 at the battle of borodino napoleon shot at no one and killed no one that was all done by the soldiers therefore it was not he who killed people 
 the french soldiers went to kill and be killed at the battle of borodino not because of orders but by their own volition the whole army french italian german polish and dutch hungry ragged and weary of the campaign felt at the sight of an army blocking their road to moscow that the wine was drawn and must be drunk had napoleon then forbidden them to fight the russians they would have killed him and have proceeded to fight the russians because it was inevitable 
 when they heard proclamation offering them as compensation for mutilation and death the words of posterity about their having been in the battle before moscow they cried vive just as they had cried vive at the sight of the portrait of the boy piercing the terrestrial globe with a toy stick and just as they would have cried vive at any nonsense that might be told them there was nothing left for them to do but cry vive and go to fight in order to get food and rest as conquerors in moscow so it was not because of commands that they killed their fellow men 
 and it was not napoleon who directed the course of the battle for none of his orders were executed and during the battle he did not know what was going on before him so the way in which these people killed one another was not decided by will but occurred independently of him in accord with the will of hundreds of thousands of people who took part in the common action it only seemed to napoleon that it all took place by his will and so the question whether he had or had not a cold has no more historic interest than the cold of the least of the transport soldiers 
 moreover the assertion made by various writers that his cold was the cause of his dispositions not being as well planned as on former occasions and of his orders during the battle not being as good as previously is quite baseless which again shows that cold on the of august was unimportant 
 the dispositions cited above are not at all worse but are even better than previous dispositions by which he had won victories his during the battle were also no worse than formerly but much the same as usual these dispositions and orders only seem worse than previous ones because the battle of borodino was the first napoleon did not win the profoundest and most excellent dispositions and orders seem very bad and every learned militarist criticizes them with looks oks importance when they relate to a battle that has been lost and the very worst dispositions and orders seem very good and serious people fill whole volumes to demonstrate their merits when they relate to a battle that has been won 
 the dispositions drawn up by weyrother for the battle of austerlitz were a model of perfection for that kind of composition but still they were criticized criticized for their very perfection for their excessive minuteness 
 napoleon at the battle of borodino fulfilled his office as representative of authority as well as and even better than at other battles he did nothing harmful to the progress of the battle he inclined to the most reasonable opinions he made no confusion did not contradict himself did not get frightened or run away from the field of battle but with his great tact and military experience carried out his role of appearing to command calmly and with dignity

 the use made of marius piece 
 marius decided that the moment had now arrived when he must resume his post at his observatory 
 in a twinkling and with the agility of his age he had reached the hole in the partition 
 he looked 
 the interior of the jondrette apartment presented a curious aspect and marius found an explanation of the singular light which he had noticed 
 a candle was burning in a candlestick covered with verdigris but that was not what really lighted the chamber the hovel was completely illuminated as it were by the reflection from a rather large brazier standing in the fireplace and filled with burning charcoal the brazier prepared by the jondrette woman that morning 
 the charcoal was glowing hot and the brazier was red a blue flame flickered over it and helped him to make out the form of the chisel purchased by jondrette in the rue where it had been thrust into the brazier to heat 
 in one corner near the door and as though prepared for some definite use two heaps were visible which appeared to be the one a heap of old iron the other a heap of ropes 
 all this would have caused the mind of a person who knew nothing of what was in preparation to waver between a very sinister and a very simple idea 
 the lair thus lighted up more resembled a forge than a mouth of hell but jondrette in this light had rather the air of a demon than of a smith 
 the heat of the brazier was so great that the candle on the table was melting on the side next the and was drooping over an old of copper worthy of diogenes turned cartouche stood on the 
 the brazier placed in the fireplace itself beside the nearly extinct brands sent its vapors up the chimney and gave out no odor 
 the moon entering through the four panes of the window cast its whiteness into the crimson and flaming garret and to the poetic spirit of marius who was dreamy even in the moment of action it was like a thought of heaven mingled with the misshapen reveries of earth 
 a breath of air which made its way in through the open pane helped to dissipate the smell of the charcoal and to conceal the presence of the brazier 
 the jondrette lair was if the reader recalls what we have said of the gorbeau building admirably chosen to serve as the theatre of a violent and sombre deed and as the envelope for a crime it was the most retired chamber in the most isolated house on the most deserted boulevard in paris 
 if the system of ambush and traps had not already existed they would have been invented there 
 the whole thickness of a house and a multitude of uninhabited rooms separated this den from the boulevard and the only window that existed opened on waste lands enclosed with walls and palisades 
 jondrette had lighted his pipe seated himself on the seatless chair and was engaged in smoking 
 his wife was talking to him in a low tone 
 if marius had been courfeyrac that is to say one of those men who laugh on every occasion in life he would have burst with laughter when his gaze fell on the jondrette woman 
 she had on a black bonnet with plumes not unlike the hats of the at the coronation of charles x an immense tartan shawl over her knitted petticoat and the shoes which her daughter had scorned in the morning 
 it was this toilette which had extracted from jondrette the exclamation 
 good 
 you have dressed up you have done well 
 you must inspire confidence 
 as for jondrette he had not taken off the new surtout which was too large for him and which m leblanc had given him and his costume continued to present that contrast of coat and trousers which constituted the ideal of a poet in eyes 
 all at once jondrette lifted up his voice 
 by the way 
 now that i think of it 
 in this weather he will come in a carriage 
 light the lantern take it and go down stairs you will stand behind the lower door 
 the very moment that you hear the carriage stop you will open the door instantly he will come up you will light the staircase and the corridor and when he enters here you will go down stairs again as speedily as possible you will pay the coachman and dismiss the fiacre 
 and the money inquired the woman 
 jondrette fumbled in his trousers pocket and handed her five francs 
 this she exclaimed 
 jondrette replied with dignity 
 that is the monarch which our neighbor gave us this morning 
 and he added 
 do you know what 
 two chairs will be needed here 
 what for 
 to sit on 
 marius felt a cold chill pass through his limbs at hearing this mild answer from jondrette 
 pardieu 
 go and get one of our 
 and with a rapid movement she opened the door of the den and went out into the corridor 
 marius absolutely had not the time to descend from the commode reach his bed and conceal himself beneath it 
 take the candle cried jondrette 
 no said she it would embarrass me i have the two chairs to carry there is moonlight 
 marius heard mother heavy hand fumbling at his lock in the dark 
 the door opened 
 he remained nailed to the spot with the shock and with horror 
 the jondrette entered 
 the dormer window permitted the entrance of a ray of moonlight between two blocks of shadow 
 one of these blocks of shadow entirely covered the wall against which marius was leaning so that he disappeared within it 
 mother jondrette raised her eyes did not see marius took the two chairs the only ones which marius possessed and went away letting the door fall heavily to behind her 
 she the lair 
 here are the two chairs 
 and here is the lantern 
 go down as quick as you can 
 she hastily obeyed and jondrette was left alone 
 he placed the two chairs on opposite sides of the table turned the chisel in the brazier set in front of the fireplace an old screen which masked the then went to the corner where lay the pile of rope and bent down as though to examine something marius then recognized the fact that what he had taken for a shapeless mass was a very with wooden rungs and two hooks with which to attach it 
 this ladder and some large tools veritable masses of iron which were mingled with the old iron piled up behind the door had not been in the jondrette hovel in the morning and had evidently been brought thither in the afternoon during marius absence 
 those are the utensils of an maker thought marius 
 had marius been a little more learned in this line he would have recognized in what he took for the engines of an maker certain instruments which will force a lock or pick a lock and others which will cut or slice the two families of tools which burglars call cadets and fauchants 
 the fireplace and the two chairs were exactly opposite marius the brazier being concealed the only light in the room was now furnished by the candle the smallest bit of crockery on the table or on the cast a large shadow 
 there was something indescribably calm threatening and hideous about this chamber one felt that there existed in it the anticipation of something terrible 
 jondrette had allowed his pipe to go out a serious sign of preoccupation and had again seated himself 
 the candle brought out the fierce and the fine angles of his countenance 
 he indulged in scowls and in abrupt unfoldings of the right hand as though he were responding to the last counsels of a sombre inward monologue 
 in the course of one of these dark replies which he was making to himself he pulled the table drawer rapidly towards him took out a long kitchen knife which was concealed there and tried the edge of its blade on his nail 
 that done he put the knife back in the drawer and shut it 
 marius on his side grasped the pistol in his right pocket drew it out and cocked it 
 the pistol emitted a sharp clear click as he cocked it 
 jondrette started half rose listened a moment then began to laugh and said 
 what a fool i am

 marius kept the pistol in his hand

 on returning from a second inspection of the lines napoleon remarked 
 the chessmen are set up the game will begin tomorrow 
 having ordered punch and summoned de beausset he began to talk to him about paris and about some changes he meant to make the empress household surprising the prefect by his memory of minute details relating to the court 
 he showed an interest in trifles joked about de love of travel and chatted carelessly as a famous surgeon who knows his job does when turning up his sleeves and putting on his apron while a patient is being strapped to the operating table the matter is in my hands and is clear and definite in my head when the times comes to set to work i shall do it as no one else could but now i can jest and the more i jest and the calmer i am the more tranquil and confident you ought to be and the more amazed at my genius 
 having finished his second glass of punch napoleon went to rest before the serious business which he considered awaited him next day he was so much interested in that task that he was unable to sleep and in spite of his cold which had grown worse from the dampness of the evening he went into the large division of the tent at three in the morning loudly blowing his nose he asked whether the russians had not withdrawn and was told that the fires were still in the same places he nodded approval 
 the adjutant in attendance came into the tent 
 well rapp do you think we shall do good business today napoleon asked him 
 without doubt sire replied rapp 
 napoleon looked at him 
 do you remember sire what you did me the honor to say at smolensk continued rapp the wine is drawn and must be drunk 
 napoleon frowned and sat silent for a long time leaning his head on his hand 
 this poor army he suddenly remarked it has diminished greatly since smolensk fortune is frankly a courtesan rapp i have always said so and i am beginning to experience it but the guards rapp the guards are intact he remarked interrogatively 
 yes sire replied rapp 
 napoleon took a lozenge put it in his mouth and glanced at his watch he was not sleepy and it was still not nearly morning it was impossible to give further orders for the sake of killing time for the orders had all been given and were now being executed 
 have the biscuits and rice been served out to the regiments of the guards asked napoleon sternly 
 yes sire 
 the rice too 
 rapp replied that he had given the order about the rice but napoleon shook his head in dissatisfaction as if not believing that his order had been executed an attendant came in with punch napoleon ordered another glass to be brought for rapp and silently sipped his own 
 i have neither taste nor smell he remarked sniffing at his glass this cold is tiresome they talk about medicine what is the good of medicine when it cure a cold corvisart gave me these lozenges but they help at all what can doctors cure one cure anything our body is a machine for living it is organized for that it is its nature let life go on in it unhindered and let it defend itself it will do more than if you paralyze it by encumbering it with remedies our body is like a perfect watch that should go for a certain time watchmaker cannot open it he can only adjust it by fumbling and that blindfold yes our body is just a machine for living that is all 
 and having entered on the path of definition of which he was fond napoleon suddenly and unexpectedly gave a new one 
 do you know rapp what military art is asked he it is the art of being stronger than the enemy at a given moment all 
 rapp made no reply 
 tomorrow we shall have to deal with kutuzov said napoleon we shall see do you remember at braunau he commanded an army for three weeks and did not once mount a horse to inspect his entrenchments we shall see 
 he looked at his watch it was still only four he did not feel sleepy the punch was finished and there was still nothing to do he rose walked to and fro put on a warm overcoat and a hat and went out of the tent the night was dark and damp a scarcely perceptible moisture was descending from above near by the campfires were dimly burning among the french guards and in the distance those of the russian line shone through the smoke the weather was calm and the rustle and tramp of the french troops already beginning to move to take up their positions were clearly audible 
 napoleon walked about in front of his tent looked at the fires and listened to these sounds and as he was passing a tall guardsman in a shaggy cap who was standing sentinel before his tent and had drawn himself up like a black pillar at sight of the emperor napoleon stopped in front of him 
 what year did you enter the service he asked with that affectation of military bluntness and geniality with which he always addressed the soldiers 
 the man answered the question 
 ah one of the old ones has your regiment had its rice 
 it has your majesty 
 napoleon nodded and walked away 
 at five napoleon rode to the village of shevardino 
 it was growing light the sky was clearing only a single cloud lay in the east the abandoned campfires were burning themselves out in the faint morning light 
 on the right a single deep report of a cannon resounded and died away in the prevailing silence some minutes passed a second and a third report shook the air then a fourth and a fifth boomed solemnly near by on the right 
 the first shots had not yet ceased to reverberate before others rang out and yet more were heard mingling with and overtaking one another 
 napoleon with his suite rode up to the shevardino redoubt where he dismounted the game had begun

 he looked at his watch it was still only four he did not feel sleepy the punch was finished and there was still nothing to do he rose walked to and fro put on a warm overcoat and a hat and went out of the tent the night was dark and damp a scarcely perceptible moisture was descending from above near by the campfires were dimly burning among the french guards and in the distance those of the russian line shone through the smoke the weather was calm and the rustle and tramp of the french troops already beginning to move to take up their positions were clearly audible 
 napoleon walked about in front of his tent looked at the fires and listened to these sounds and as he was passing a tall guardsman in a shaggy cap who was standing sentinel before his tent and had drawn himself up like a black pillar at sight of the emperor napoleon stopped in front of him 
 what year did you enter the service he asked with that affectation of military bluntness and geniality with which he always addressed the soldiers 
 the man answered the question 
 ah one of the old ones has your regiment had its rice 
 it has your majesty 
 napoleon nodded and walked away 
 at five napoleon rode to the village of shevardino 
 it was growing light the sky was clearing only a single cloud lay in the east the abandoned campfires were burning themselves out in the faint morning light 
 on the right a single deep report of a cannon resounded and died away in the prevailing silence some minutes passed a second and a third report shook the air then a fourth and a fifth boomed solemnly near by on the right 
 the first shots had not yet ceased to reverberate before others rang out and yet more were heard mingling with and overtaking one another 
 napoleon with his suite rode up to the shevardino redoubt where he dismounted the game had begun

 jean valjean 
 towards the middle of the night jean valjean woke 
 jean valjean came from a poor peasant family of brie 
 he had not learned to read in his childhood 
 when he reached estate be became a at faverolles 
 his mother was named jeanne mathieu his father was called jean valjean or vlajean probably a sobriquet and a contraction of viola jean jean 
 jean valjean was of that thoughtful but not gloomy disposition which constitutes the peculiarity of affectionate natures on the whole however there was something decidedly sluggish and insignificant about jean valjean in appearance at least he had lost his father and mother at a very early age 
 his mother had died of a milk fever which had not been properly attended to his father a like himself had been killed by a fall from a tree 
 all that remained to jean valjean was a sister older than widow with seven children boys and girls this sister had brought up jean valjean and so long as she had a husband she lodged and fed her young brother 
 the husband died 
 the eldest of the seven children was eight years old 
 the youngest one 
 jean valjean had just attained his year 
 he took the place and in his turn supported the sister who had brought him up 
 this was done simply as a duty and even a little churlishly on the part of jean valjean 
 thus his youth had been spent in rude and toil 
 he had never known a kind woman friend in his native parts 
 he had not had the time to fall in love 
 he returned at night weary and ate his broth without uttering a word his sister mother jeanne often took the best part of his repast from his bowl while he was bit of meat a slice of bacon the heart of the give to one of her children as he went on eating with his head bent over the table and almost into his soup his long hair falling about his bowl and concealing his eyes he had the air of perceiving nothing and allowing it there was at faverolles not far from the valjean thatched cottage on the other side of the lane a wife named the valjean children habitually famished sometimes went to borrow from a pint of milk in their name which they drank behind a hedge or in some alley corner snatching the jug from each other so hastily that the little girls spilled it on their aprons and down their necks 
 if their mother had known of this marauding she would have punished the delinquents severely jean valjean gruffly and grumblingly paid for the pint of milk behind their back and the children were not punished 
 in pruning season he earned eighteen sous a day then he hired out as a as laborer as on a farm as a drudge he did whatever he could 
 his sister worked also but what could she do with seven little children 
 it was a sad group enveloped in misery which was being gradually annihilated 
 a very hard winter came jean had no work 
 the family had no bread 
 no bread literally seven children 
 one sunday evening maubert isabeau the baker on the church square at faverolles was preparing to go to bed when he heard a violent blow on the grated front of his shop 
 he arrived in time to see an arm passed through a hole made by a blow from a fist through the grating and the glass 
 the arm seized a loaf of bread and carried it off 
 isabeau ran out in haste the robber fled at the full speed of his legs 
 isabeau ran after him and stopped him the thief had flung away the loaf but his arm was still bleeding it was jean valjean 
 this took place in 
 jean valjean was taken before the tribunals of the time for theft and breaking and entering an inhabited house at night 
 he had a gun which he used better than any one else in the world he was a bit of a poacher and this injured his case 
 there exists a legitimate prejudice against poachers the poacher like the smuggler smacks too strongly of the brigand nevertheless we will remark cursorily there is still an abyss between these races of men and the hideous assassin of the towns the poacher lives in the forest the smuggler lives in the mountains or on the sea 
 the cities make ferocious men because they make corrupt men 
 the mountain the sea the forest make savage men they develop the fierce side but often without destroying the humane side 
 jean valjean was pronounced guilty 
 the terms of the code were explicit 
 there occur formidable hours in our civilization there are moments when the penal laws decree a shipwreck what an ominous minute is that in which society draws back and consummates the irreparable abandonment of a sentient being jean valjean was condemned to five years in the galleys 
 on the d of april the victory of montenotte won by the of the army of italy whom the message of the directory to the five hundred of the d of floreal year iv calls was announced in paris on that same day a great gang of was put in chains at bicetre 
 jean valjean formed a part of that gang 
 an old turnkey of the prison who is now nearly eighty years old still recalls perfectly that unfortunate wretch who was chained to the end of the fourth line in the north angle of the courtyard 
 he was seated on the ground like the others he did not seem to comprehend his position except that it was horrible it is probable that he also was disentangling from amid the vague ideas of a poor man ignorant of everything something excessive while the bolt of his iron collar was being riveted behind his head with heavy blows from the hammer he wept his tears stifled him they impeded his speech he only managed to say from time to time i was a at faverolles 
 then still sobbing he raised his right hand and lowered it gradually seven times as though he were touching in succession seven heads of unequal heights and from this gesture it was divined that the thing which he had done whatever it was he had done for the sake of clothing and nourishing seven little children 
 he set out for toulon 
 he arrived there after a journey of days on a cart with a chain on his neck 
 at toulon he was clothed in the red cassock 
 all that had constituted his life even to his name was effaced he was no longer even jean valjean he was number what became of his sister what became of the seven children 
 who troubled himself about that what becomes of the handful of leaves from the young tree which is sawed off at the root 
 it is always the same story 
 these poor living beings these creatures of god henceforth without support without guide without refuge wandered away at even knows each in his own direction perhaps and little by little buried themselves in that cold mist which engulfs solitary destinies gloomy shades into which disappear in succession so many unlucky heads in the sombre march of the human race 
 they quitted the country the of what had been their village forgot them the boundary line of what had been their field forgot them after a few years residence in the galleys jean valjean himself forgot them in that heart where there had been a wound there was a scar that is all 
 only once during all the time which he spent at toulon did he hear his sister mentioned 
 this happened i think towards the end of the fourth year of his captivity 
 i know not through what channels the news reached him 
 some one who had known them in their own country had seen his sister 
 she was in paris she lived in a poor street rear in the rue du gindre she had with her only one child a little boy the youngest where were the other six 
 perhaps she did not know herself every morning she went to a printing office no rue du sabot where she was a folder and stitcher 
 she was obliged to be there at six in the before daylight in winter in the same building with the printing office there was a school and to this school she took her little boy who was seven years old but as she entered the printing office at six and the school only opened at seven the child had to wait in the courtyard for the school to open for an hour of a winter night in the open air they would not allow the child to come into the printing office because he was in the way they said 
 when the workmen passed in the morning they beheld this poor little being seated on the pavement overcome with drowsiness and often fast asleep in the shadow crouched down and doubled up over his basket 
 when it rained an old woman the portress took pity on him she took him into her den where there was a pallet a and two wooden chairs and the little one slumbered in a corner pressing himself close to the cat that he might suffer less from cold 
 at seven the school opened and he entered 
 that is what was told to jean valjean 
 they talked to him about it for one day it was a moment a flash as though a window had suddenly been opened upon the destiny of those things whom he had loved then all closed again 
 he heard nothing more forever 
 nothing from them ever reached him again he never beheld them he never met them again and in the continuation of this mournful history they will not be met with any more 
 towards the end of this fourth year jean turn to escape arrived 
 his comrades assisted him as is the custom in that sad place he escaped 
 he wandered for two days in the fields at liberty if being at liberty is to be hunted to turn the head every instant to quake at the slightest noise to be afraid of a smoking roof of a passing man of a barking dog of a galloping horse of a striking clock of the day because one can see of the night because one cannot see of the highway of the path of a bush of sleep 
 on the evening of the second day he was captured he had neither eaten nor slept for hours 
 the maritime tribunal condemned him for this crime to a prolongation of his term for three years which made eight years 
 in the sixth year his turn to escape occurred again he availed himself of it but could not accomplish his flight fully 
 he was missing at the cannon were fired and at night the patrol found him hidden under the keel of a vessel in process of construction he resisted the galley guards who seized him 
 escape and rebellion this case provided for by a special code was punished by an addition of five years two of them in the double chain 
 thirteen years in the tenth year his turn came round again he again profited by it he succeeded no better 
 three years for this fresh attempt sixteen years 
 finally i think it was during his thirteenth year he made a last attempt and only succeeded in getting retaken at the end of four hours of absence 
 three years for those four hours nineteen years 
 in october he was released he had entered there in for having broken a pane of glass and taken a loaf of bread 
 room for a brief parenthesis 
 this is the second time during his studies on the penal question and damnation by law that the author of this book has come across the theft of a loaf of bread as the point of departure for the disaster of a destiny claude gaux had stolen a loaf jean valjean had stolen a loaf english statistics prove the fact that four thefts out of five in london have hunger for their immediate cause 
 jean valjean had entered the galleys sobbing and shuddering he emerged impassive 
 he had entered in despair he emerged gloomy 
 what had taken place in that soul

 the empire strikes back 
 vii 
 
 the double sets of wings on luke fighter were pulled together toform one wing as the small sleek craft streaked away from the planet of snow and ice 
 during his flight the young commander had time to reflect on the events of thepast few days he now had time to ponder the enigmatic words of the ghostly benkenobi and think about his friendship with han solo and also consider his tenuousrelationship with leia organa as he thought of the people he cared most about hearrived at a sudden decision gazing back one last time at the small icy planet hetold himself there was no longer any turning back 
 luke flipped a number of switches on his control board and took the intoa steep turn he watched the heavens shift as he rocketed off in a new at top velocity he was bringing his craft back onto an even course whenartoo still snug in his specially designed socket began to whistle and beep 
 the miniature computer installed in ship for translating the flashed the small message onto a control panel viewscreen 
 nothing wrong artoo luke replied after reading the just setting a new course 
 the small droid beeped excitedly and luke turned to read the updated printouton the viewscreen 
 no luke replied not going to regroup with the others 
 this news startled artoo who immediately emitted a series of galvanic noises 
 going to the dagobah system answered luke 
 again the robot beeped calculating the amount of fuel carried by the 
 we have enough power 
 artoo gave vent to a longer singsong series of toots and whistles 
 they need us there said luke to the question about the plannedrebel rendezvous 
 artoo then gently beeped a reminder about princess order young pilot exclaimed countermanding that order now be still 
 the little droid fell silent luke was after all a commander in the rebelalliance and as such could countermand orders he was making a few minoradjustments on the controls when artoo chirped up again 
 yes artoo sighed luke 
 this time the droid made a series of soft noises selecting each beep and whistlecarefully he did not want to annoy luke but the findings on his computer wereimportant enough to report 
 yes artoo i know the dagobah system appear on any of ournavigational charts but worry there 
 another worried beep from the r unit 
 very sure the youth said trying to reassure his mechanical me 
 whether or not artoo did trust the human being at the controls he onlyvented a meek little sigh for a moment he was completely silent as if he beeped again 
 yes artoo 
 this communication from the robot was even more carefully put forth might even call the tactful it seemed artoo had nointention of offending the human to whom he had entrusted himself but itpossible the robot calculated that the brain was slightly all he had lain a long time in the snowdrifts of hoth or another possibilitycomputed by artoo perhaps the wampa ice creature had struck him more seriouslythan had diagnosed 
 no luke answered no headache i feel fine why 
 chirp was coyly innocent 
 no dizziness no drowsiness even the scars are gone 
 the next whistle rose questioningly in pitch 
 no all right artoo rather keep it on manual control for a while 
 then the stout robot delivered a final whimper that sounded to luke like a noiseof defeat luke was amused by the concern for his health trust luke said with a gentle smile i know where going and get us theresafely not far 
 han solo was desperate now the falcon had still not been able to shrug offthe four tie fighter or the enormous star destroyer that pursued it 
 solo raced down to the hold and began to work frantically on repairing themalfunctioning hyperdrive unit it was all but impossible to carry out the delicaterepair work necessary while the falcon shook with each blast of flak from thefighters 
 han snapped orders at his copilot who checked the mechanisms as he wascommanded horizontal booster 
 the wookiee barked it looked fine to him 
 alluvial damper 
 another bark that part was also in place 
 chewie get me the hydrospanners 
 chewbacca rushed over to the pit with the tools han grabbed the paused and looked at his faithful wookiee friend 
 i know how going to get out of this one he confided 
 just then a resounding thump hit the side making the ship pitch andturn radically 
 chewbacca barked anxiously 
 han braced himself at the impact the hydrospanners flew from his hand whenhe managed to regain his balance he shouted at chewbacca over the noise that wasno laser blast something hit us 
 hanhan princess leia called to him from the cockpit she was up here 
 like a shot he lurched out of the hold and raced back to the cockpit withchewbacca they were stunned by what they saw through the windows 
 asteroids 
 enormous chunks of flying rock hurtled through space as far as they could if those damn imperial pursuit ships trouble enough 
 han instantly returned to his seat once more taking over the his copilot settled himself back into his own seat just as a particularlylarge asteroid sped by the prow of the ship 
 han felt he had to stay as calm as possible otherwise they might not last morethan a few moments chewie he ordered set 
 leia gasped she knew what order meant and was stunned by so recklessa plan not thinking of heading into the asteroid field she asked hopingshe had misunderstood his command 
 worry they follow us through this he shouted with glee 
 if i might remind you sir threepio offered trying to be a rational probability of successfully navigating through an asteroid field is approximatelytwo thousand four hundred and to one 
 no one seemed to hear him 
 princess leia scowled you have to do this to impress me she said asthe falcon was pummeled hard by another asteroid 
 han was enjoying himself enormously and chose to ignore her on sweetheart he laughed grasping the controls more tightly do some flyin 
 leia winced and resigned buckled herself firmly into her seat 
 still muttering calculations shut down his synthesized humanvoice when the wookiee turned and growled at him 
 but han concentrated only on carrying out his plan he knew it would work ithad was no other choice flying more on instinct than on instruments hesteered his ship through the relentless rain of stone glancing quickly at his scannerscreens he saw that the tie fighters and the avengers had not yet abandoned thechase it would be an imperial funeral he thought as he maneuvered the falconthrough the asteroid hail 
 he looked at another viewscreen and smiled as it showed a collision between anasteroid and a tie fighter the explosion registered on the screen with a burst oflight no survivors in that one han thought 
 the tie fighter pilots chasing the falcon were among the best in the they compete with han solo either they good enough or crazy enough only a lunatic would have plunged his ship into a suicidaljourney through these asteroids crazy or not these pilots had no choice but tofollow in hot pursuit they undoubtedly would be better off perishing in thisbombardment of rocks than reporting failure to their dark master 
 the greatest of all the imperial star destroyers regally moved out of was flanked by two other star destroyers and the entire group was accompanied bya protective squadron of smaller warships in the central destroyer admiral piettstood outside darth private meditation chamber the upper jaw slowlyopened until piett was able to glimpse his robed master standing in the lord piett said with reverence 
 come in admiral 
 admiral piett felt great awe as he stepped into the dimly lit room and approachedthe dark lord of the sith his master stood silhouetted so that piett could just barelymake out the lines of a set of mechanical appendages as they retracted a respiratortube from head he shuddered when he realized that he might be the firstever to have seen his master unmasked 
 the sight was horrifying vader his back turned to piett was entirely clothedin black but above his studded black neck ban gleamed his naked head though theadmiral tried to avert his eyes morbid fascination forced him to look at that head it was covered with a maze of thick scar tissue that twisted aroundagainst skin the thought crossed mind that there mightbe a heavy price for viewing what no one else had seen just then the robot handsgrasped the black helmet and gently lowered it over the dark head 
 his helmet back in place darth vader turned to hear his report 
 our pursuit ship have sighted the millennium falcon my lord it has enteredan asteroid field 
 asteroids concern me admiral vader said as he slowly clenched his want that ship not excuses how long until you will have skywalker and theothers in the millennium falcon 
 soon lord vader the admiral answered trembling in fear 
 yes admiral darth vader said slowly soon 
 two gigantic asteroids hurtled toward the millennium falcon its pilot quicklymade a daring banking maneuver that brought it skirring out of the path of those twoasteroids nearly to collide with a third 
 as the falcon darted in and out of the asteroid field it was followed closely bythree imperial tie fighters that veered through the rocks in hot pursuit suddenlyone of the three was fatally scraped by a shapeless chunk of rock and spun off inanother direction hopelessly out of control the other two tie fighters continuedtheir chase accompanied by the star destroyer avenger which was blasting speedingasteroid in its path 
 han solo glimpsed the pursuing ships through the windows of his cockpit as hespun his craft around speeding under yet another oncoming asteroid then bringingthe freighter back to its position but the millennium falcon was notyet out of danger asteroids were still streaking past the freighter a small onebounced off the ship with a loud reverberating clang terrifying chewbacca andcausing to cover his eye lenses with a bronzed hand 
 han glanced at leia and saw that she was sitting as she stared at theswarm of asteroids it looked to him as if she wished she were thousands of milesaway 
 well he remarked you said you wanted to be around when i was wrong 
 she look at him i take it back 
 that star destroyer is slowing down han announced checking his computerreadings 
 good she replied shortly 
 the view outside the cockpit was still thick with racing asteroids goingto get pulverized if we stay out here much longer he observed 
 against that leia remarked dryly 
 got to get out of this shower 
 that make sense 
 going to get in closer to one of the big ones han added 
 that did not make sense 
 closer threepio exclaimed throwing up his metal arms his artificial braincould scarcely register what his auditory sensors had just perceived 
 closer leia repeated in disbelief 
 chewbacca stared at his pilot in amazement and barked 
 none of the three could understand why their captain who had risked his life thesave them all would now try to get them killed making a few simple adjustmentson the cockpit controls han swerved the millennium falcon between a few largeasteroids then aimed the craft directly at one the size of a moon 
 a flashing shower of smaller rocks exploded against the enormous surface as the millennium falcon with the tie fighters still inpursuit flew directly above the asteroid it was like skimming over the surface of asmall planet barren and devoid of all life 
 with expert precision han solo steered his ship toward still another giantasteroid the largest one they had yet encountered summoning all the skill that hadmade his reputation known throughout the galaxy he maneuvered the falcon so thatthe only object between it and the tie fighters was the deadly floating rock 
 there was only a brief brilliant flare of light then nothing the shatteredremains of the two tie fighters drifted away into the darkness and the in its on its way 
 han felt an inner glow as bright as the spectacle that had just lighted up the smiled to himself in quiet triumph 
 then he noticed an image on the main scope of his control console and nudgedhis hairy copilot there han pointed to the image chewie get a reading onthat looks pretty good 
 what is it leia asked 
 the pilot ignored her question that should do nicely he said 
 as they flew near the surface han looked down at the craggy eye caught by a shadowy area that looked like a crater of mammoth lowered the falcon to surface level and flew it directly into the crater its bowllikewalls suddenly rising up around his ship 
 and still two tie fighters chased after him firing their laser cannons andattempting to mimic his every maneuver 
 han solo knew he had to be trickier and more daring if he was to lose the deadlypursuit ships spotting a narrow chasm through his windscreen he banked themillennium falcon to one side the ship soared sideways through the trench 
 unexpectedly the two tie fighters followed one of them even sparked as itgrazed the walls with its metal hull 
 twisting banking and turning his ship han pressed through the narrow behind the black sky flared as the two tie fighters crashed against one exploded against the rocky ground 
 han reduced his speed he still safe from the imperial about the canyon he spotted something dark a gaping cave mouth at thevery bottom of the crater large enough to hold the millennium ifnot he and his crew would know soon enough 
 slowing his hip han coursed into the cave entrance and through a large he hoped would make the ideal hiding place he took a deep breath as hisship was promptly devoured by the shadows 
 a tiny was approaching the atmosphere of the dagobah planet 
 as he neared the planet luke skywalker was able to glimpse a portion of itscurved surface through a heavy cover of thick clouds the planet was uncharted andvirtually unknown somehow luke had made his way there though he whether it was his hand along that had guided his ship into this unexploredsector of space 
 riding in the back of scanned the passing addressed his remarks to luke via the computer scope 
 luke read the viewscreen interpreter yes dagobah artoo heanswered the little robot then glanced out the cockpit window as the fighter shipbegan to descend toward the surface looks a little grim it 
 artoo beeped attempting for one last time to get his master back on a moresensible course 
 no luke replied i want to change my mind about this he checkedthe monitors and began to feel a bit nervous not picking up any cities ortechnology massive readings though something alive downthere 
 artoo was worried too and that was translated as an apprehensive inquiry 
 yes sure perfectly safe for droids will you take it easy luke wasbeginning to get annoyed just have to see what happens 
 he heard a pathetic electronic whimper from the rear of the cockpit 
 worry 
 the sailed through the twilight halo separating pitch black space from surface luke took a deep breath then plunged his craft into the whiteblanket of mists 
 he see a thing his vision was entirely obstructed by the densewhiteness pressing against the canopy windows of his ship his only choice was tocontrol his solely by instruments but the scopes registeringanything even as luke flew ever nearer to the planet desperately he worked hiscontrols no longer able to discern even so much as his altitude 
 when an alarm began to buzz artoo joined its clarion call with his own franticseries of whistles and beeps 
 i know i know luke shouted still fighting the controls of his ship all thescopes are dead i see a thing hang on going to start the landing just hope something underneath us 
 artoo squealed again but his sound were effectively frowned by the of the retrorockets luke felt his stomach plunge as the ship began todrop rapidly he braced against his seat steeling himself for any possibleimpact then the ship lunged and luke heard an awful sound as if the limbs of treeswere being snapped off by his speeding craft 
 when the finally screeched to a halt it was with a tremendous jolt thatnearly flung its pilot through the cockpit window certain at last that he was on theground luke slumped back in his chair and sighed with relief he then pulled aswitch that lifted his canopy when he raised his head outside the ship to gethis first look at the alien world luke skywalker gasped 
 the was completely surrounded by mists its bright landing lights notilluminating more than a few feet in front of it eyes gradually began to growaccustomed to the gloom all around him so that he could just barely see the twistedtrunks and roots of trees he pulled himself out of the cockpit asartoo detached his stout body from its cubbyhole plug 
 artoo luke said you stay put while i look around 
 the enormous gray tree had gnarled and intertwining roots that rose far aboveluke before they joined to form trunks he tilted back his head and could see thebranches high above that seemed to form a canopy with the cautiously climbed out onto the long nose of his ship and saw that he in a small body of water 
 artoo emitted a short there was a loud splash followed by turned just in time to glimpse the domed topside as it disappearedbeneath the foggy surface 
 artoo artoo luke called he kneeled down on the smooth hull of the shipand leaned forward anxiously searching for his mechanical friend 
 but the black waters were serene revealing not a sign of the little r could not tell how deep this still murky pond might be but it looked extremelydeep he was suddenly gripped by the realization that he might never see his droidfriend again just then a tiny periscope broke through the surface of the water andluke could hear a faint gurgling beep 
 what a relief luke thought as he watched the periscope make its way towardshore he ran along the nose of his fighter and when the shore line was lessthan three meters away the young commander jumped into the water and scrambledup the shore he looked back and saw that artoo was still making his way towardthe beach 
 hurry artoo luke shouted 
 whatever it was that suddenly moved through the water behind artoo moved tooquickly and was too obscured by the mist for luke to clearly identify it al he couldsee was a massive dark form this creature rose up for a moment then dove beneaththe surface making a loud bang against the little metal hill luke heard pathetic electronic scream for help then nothing 
 luke stood there as he continued to stare at the black waters stillas death itself as he watched a few bubbles began to erupt at the heart began to pound in fear as he realized he was standing too near the before he could move the robot was spit out by the thing lurkingbeneath the black surface artoo made a graceful arc through the air and camecrashing down onto a soft patch of gray moss 
 artoo luke yelled running to him are you okay luke was grateful that theshadowy swamp lurker apparently found metal droid neither palatable nor digestible 
 feebly the robot replied with a series of faint whistles and beeps 
 if saying coming here was a bad idea beginning to agree with admitted looking around at their dismal surroundings at least he was human companionship on the ice world here except for artoo thereseemed to be nothing but this murky creatures as yet unseen that mightlurk in the falling darkness

 by the time he finished clearing off artoo luke observed that the sky had grownnoticeably darker shadows loomed ominously all around him and the distant seem quite so far away anymore he and artoo glanced around at the surrounding them then huddled a bit closer suddenly luke noticeda pair of tiny but vicious eyes winking at them through the shadowy underbrush thenvanishing with a scutter of diminutive feet 
 he hesitated to doubt the advice of ben kenobi but now he was beginning towonder if that robed specter had somehow made a mistake leading him to this planetwith its mysterious jedi teacher

 it was beyond the computerized abilities of artoo to provide an answer for eitherof these questions but he made a little comforting beep anyway

 the empire strikes back 
 vii 
 
 the double sets of wings on luke fighter were pulled together toform one wing as the small sleek craft streaked away from the planet of snow and ice 
 during his flight the young commander had time to reflect on the events of thepast few days he now had time to ponder the enigmatic words of the ghostly benkenobi and think about his friendship with han solo and also consider his tenuousrelationship with leia organa as he thought of the people he cared most about hearrived at a sudden decision gazing back one last time at the small icy planet hetold himself there was no longer any turning back 
 luke flipped a number of switches on his control board and took the intoa steep turn he watched the heavens shift as he rocketed off in a new at top velocity he was bringing his craft back onto an even course whenartoo still snug in his specially designed socket began to whistle and beep 
 the miniature computer installed in ship for translating the flashed the small message onto a control panel viewscreen 
 nothing wrong artoo luke replied after reading the just setting a new course 
 the small droid beeped excitedly and luke turned to read the updated printouton the viewscreen 
 no luke replied not going to regroup with the others 
 this news startled artoo who immediately emitted a series of galvanic noises 
 going to the dagobah system answered luke 
 again the robot beeped calculating the amount of fuel carried by the 
 we have enough power 
 artoo gave vent to a longer singsong series of toots and whistles 
 they need us there said luke to the question about the plannedrebel rendezvous 
 artoo then gently beeped a reminder about princess order young pilot exclaimed countermanding that order now be still 
 the little droid fell silent luke was after all a commander in the rebelalliance and as such could countermand orders he was making a few minoradjustments on the controls when artoo chirped up again 
 yes artoo sighed luke 
 this time the droid made a series of soft noises selecting each beep and whistlecarefully he did not want to annoy luke but the findings on his computer wereimportant enough to report 
 yes artoo i know the dagobah system appear on any of ournavigational charts but worry there 
 another worried beep from the r unit 
 very sure the youth said trying to reassure his mechanical me 
 whether or not artoo did trust the human being at the controls he onlyvented a meek little sigh for a moment he was completely silent as if he beeped again 
 yes artoo 
 this communication from the robot was even more carefully put forth might even call the tactful it seemed artoo had nointention of offending the human to whom he had entrusted himself but itpossible the robot calculated that the brain was slightly all he had lain a long time in the snowdrifts of hoth or another possibilitycomputed by artoo perhaps the wampa ice creature had struck him more seriouslythan had diagnosed 
 no luke answered no headache i feel fine why 
 chirp was coyly innocent 
 no dizziness no drowsiness even the scars are gone 
 the next whistle rose questioningly in pitch 
 no all right artoo rather keep it on manual control for a while 
 then the stout robot delivered a final whimper that sounded to luke like a noiseof defeat luke was amused by the concern for his health trust luke said with a gentle smile i know where going and get us theresafely not far 
 han solo was desperate now the falcon had still not been able to shrug offthe four tie fighter or the enormous star destroyer that pursued it 
 solo raced down to the hold and began to work frantically on repairing themalfunctioning hyperdrive unit it was all but impossible to carry out the delicaterepair work necessary while the falcon shook with each blast of flak from thefighters 
 han snapped orders at his copilot who checked the mechanisms as he wascommanded horizontal booster 
 the wookiee barked it looked fine to him 
 alluvial damper 
 another bark that part was also in place 
 chewie get me the hydrospanners 
 chewbacca rushed over to the pit with the tools han grabbed the paused and looked at his faithful wookiee friend 
 i know how going to get out of this one he confided 
 just then a resounding thump hit the side making the ship pitch andturn radically 
 chewbacca barked anxiously 
 han braced himself at the impact the hydrospanners flew from his hand whenhe managed to regain his balance he shouted at chewbacca over the noise that wasno laser blast something hit us 
 hanhan princess leia called to him from the cockpit she was up here 
 like a shot he lurched out of the hold and raced back to the cockpit withchewbacca they were stunned by what they saw through the windows 
 asteroids 
 enormous chunks of flying rock hurtled through space as far as they could if those damn imperial pursuit ships trouble enough 
 han instantly returned to his seat once more taking over the his copilot settled himself back into his own seat just as a particularlylarge asteroid sped by the prow of the ship 
 han felt he had to stay as calm as possible otherwise they might not last morethan a few moments chewie he ordered set 
 leia gasped she knew what order meant and was stunned by so recklessa plan not thinking of heading into the asteroid field she asked hopingshe had misunderstood his command 
 worry they follow us through this he shouted with glee 
 if i might remind you sir threepio offered trying to be a rational probability of successfully navigating through an asteroid field is approximatelytwo thousand four hundred and to one 
 no one seemed to hear him 
 princess leia scowled you have to do this to impress me she said asthe falcon was pummeled hard by another asteroid 
 han was enjoying himself enormously and chose to ignore her on sweetheart he laughed grasping the controls more tightly do some flyin 
 leia winced and resigned buckled herself firmly into her seat 
 still muttering calculations shut down his synthesized humanvoice when the wookiee turned and growled at him 
 but han concentrated only on carrying out his plan he knew it would work ithad was no other choice flying more on instinct than on instruments hesteered his ship through the relentless rain of stone glancing quickly at his scannerscreens he saw that the tie fighters and the avengers had not yet abandoned thechase it would be an imperial funeral he thought as he maneuvered the falconthrough the asteroid hail 
 he looked at another viewscreen and smiled as it showed a collision between anasteroid and a tie fighter the explosion registered on the screen with a burst oflight no survivors in that one han thought 
 the tie fighter pilots chasing the falcon were among the best in the they compete with han solo either they good enough or crazy enough only a lunatic would have plunged his ship into a suicidaljourney through these asteroids crazy or not these pilots had no choice but tofollow in hot pursuit they undoubtedly would be better off perishing in thisbombardment of rocks than reporting failure to their dark master 
 the greatest of all the imperial star destroyers regally moved out of was flanked by two other star destroyers and the entire group was accompanied bya protective squadron of smaller warships in the central destroyer admiral piettstood outside darth private meditation chamber the upper jaw slowlyopened until piett was able to glimpse his robed master standing in the lord piett said with reverence 
 come in admiral 
 admiral piett felt great awe as he stepped into the dimly lit room and approachedthe dark lord of the sith his master stood silhouetted so that piett could just barelymake out the lines of a set of mechanical appendages as they retracted a respiratortube from head he shuddered when he realized that he might be the firstever to have seen his master unmasked 
 the sight was horrifying vader his back turned to piett was entirely clothedin black but above his studded black neck ban gleamed his naked head though theadmiral tried to avert his eyes morbid fascination forced him to look at that head it was covered with a maze of thick scar tissue that twisted aroundagainst skin the thought crossed mind that there mightbe a heavy price for viewing what no one else had seen just then the robot handsgrasped the black helmet and gently lowered it over the dark head 
 his helmet back in place darth vader turned to hear his report 
 our pursuit ship have sighted the millennium falcon my lord it has enteredan asteroid field 
 asteroids concern me admiral vader said as he slowly clenched his want that ship not excuses how long until you will have skywalker and theothers in the millennium falcon 
 soon lord vader the admiral answered trembling in fear 
 yes admiral darth vader said slowly soon

 book one 
 chapter xxi 
 
 while in the rostovs ballroom the sixth anglaise was being danced to a tune in which the weary musicians blundered and while tired footmen and cooks were getting the supper count bezukhov had a sixth stroke the doctors pronounced recovery impossible after a mute confession communion was administered to the dying man preparations made for the sacrament of unction and in his house there was the bustle and thrill of suspense usual at such moments outside the house beyond the gates a group of undertakers who hid whenever a carriage drove up waited in expectation of an important order for an expensive funeral the military governor of moscow who had been assiduous in sending to inquire after the health came himself that evening to bid a last farewell to the celebrated grandee of court count bezukhov 
 the magnificent reception room was crowded everyone stood up respectfully when the military governor having stayed about half an hour alone with the dying man passed out slightly acknowledging their bows and trying to escape as quickly as from the glances fixed on him by the doctors clergy and relatives of the family prince vasili who had grown thinner and paler during the last few days escorted him to the door repeating something to him several times in low tones 
 when the military governor had gone prince vasili sat down all alone on a chair in the ballroom crossing one leg high over the other leaning his elbow on his knee and covering his face with his hand after sitting so for a while he rose and looking about him with frightened eyes went with unusually hurried steps down the long corridor leading to the back of the house to the room of the eldest princess 
 those who were in the dimly lit reception room spoke in nervous whispers and whenever anyone went into or came from the dying room grew silent and gazed with eyes full of curiosity or expectancy at his door which creaked slightly when opened 
 the limits of human life are fixed and may not be said an old priest to a lady who had taken a seat beside him and was listening naively to his words 
 i wonder is it not too late to administer unction asked the lady adding the clerical title as if she had no opinion of her own on the subject 
 ah madam it is a great sacrament replied the priest passing his hand over the thin grizzled strands of hair combed back across his bald head 
 who was that the military governor himself was being asked at the other side of the room how he is 
 yes and he is over sixty i hear the count no longer recognizes anyone they wished to administer the sacrament of unction 
 i knew someone who received that sacrament seven times 
 the second princess had just come from the sickroom with her eyes red from weeping and sat down beside dr lorrain who was sitting in a graceful pose under a portrait of catherine leaning his elbow on a table 
 beautiful said the doctor in answer to a remark about the weather the weather is beautiful princess and besides in moscow one feels as if one were in the country 
 yes indeed replied the princess with a sigh so he may have something to drink 
 lorrain considered 
 has he taken his medicine 
 yes 
 the doctor glanced at his watch 
 take a glass of boiled water and put a pinch of cream of tartar and he indicated with his delicate fingers what he meant by a pinch 
 dere has neffer been a gase a german doctor was saying to an dat one liffs after de sird stroke 
 and what a man he was remarked the and who will inherit his wealth he added in a whisper 
 it go begging replied the german with a smile 
 everyone again looked toward the door which creaked as the second princess went in with the drink she had prepared according to instructions the german doctor went up to lorrain 
 do you think he can last till morning asked the german addressing lorrain in french which he pronounced badly 
 lorrain pursing up his lips waved a severely negative finger before his nose 
 tonight not later said he in a low voice and he moved away with a decorous smile of at being able clearly to understand and state the condition 
 meanwhile prince vasili had opened the door into the princess room 
 in this room it was almost dark only two tiny lamps were burning before the icons and there was a pleasant scent of flowers and burnt pastilles the room was crowded with small pieces of furniture whatnots cupboards and little tables the quilt of a high white feather bed was just visible behind a screen a small dog began to bark 
 ah is it you cousin 
 she rose and smoothed her hair which was as usual so extremely smooth that it seemed to be made of one piece with her head and covered with varnish 
 has anything happened she asked i am so terrified 
 no there is no change i only came to have a talk about business catiche muttered the prince seating himself wearily on the chair she had just vacated you have made the place warm i must say he remarked well sit down have a talk 
 catherine 
 i thought perhaps something had happened she said with her unchanging stonily severe expression and sitting down opposite the prince she prepared to listen 
 i wished to get a nap mon cousin but i 
 well my dear said prince vasili taking her hand and bending it downwards as was his habit 
 it was plain that this well referred to much that they both understood without naming 
 the princess who had a straight rigid body abnormally long for her legs looked directly at prince vasili with no sign of emotion in her prominent gray eyes then she shook her head and glanced up at the icons with a sigh this might have been taken as an expression of sorrow and devotion or of weariness and hope of resting before long prince vasili understood it as an expression of weariness 
 and i he said do you think it is easier for me i am as worn out as a post horse but still i must have a talk with you catiche a very serious talk 
 prince vasili said no more and his cheeks began to twitch nervously now on one side now on the other giving his face an unpleasant expression which was never to be seen on it in a drawing room his eyes too seemed strange at one moment they looked impudently sly and at the next glanced round in alarm 
 the princess holding her little dog on her lap with her thin bony hands looked attentively into prince eyes evidently resolved not to be the first to break silence if she had to wait till morning 
 well you see my dear princess and cousin catherine semenovna continued prince vasili returning to his theme apparently not without an inner struggle at such a moment as this one must think of everything one must think of the future of all of you i love you all like children of my own as you know 
 the princess continued to look at him without moving and with the same dull expression 
 and then of course my family has also to be considered prince vasili went on testily pushing away a little table without looking at her you know catiche that we you three sisters mamontov and my wife are the only direct heirs i know i know how hard it is for you to talk or think of such matters it is no easier for me but my dear i am getting on for sixty and must be prepared for anything do you know i have sent for pierre the count pointing to his portrait definitely demanded that he should be called 
 prince vasili looked questioningly at the princess but could not make out whether she was considering what he had just said or whether she was simply looking at him 
 there is one thing i constantly pray god to grant mon cousin she replied and it is that he would be merciful to him and would allow his noble soul peacefully to leave this 
 yes yes of course interrupted prince vasili impatiently rubbing his bald head and angrily pulling back toward him the little table that he had pushed away but in short the fact is you know yourself that last winter the count made a will by which he left all his property not to us his direct heirs but to pierre 
 he has made wills enough quietly remarked the princess but he cannot leave the estate to pierre pierre is illegitimate 
 but my dear said prince vasili suddenly clutching the little table and becoming more animated and talking more rapidly what if a letter has been written to the emperor in which the count asks for legitimation do you understand that in consideration of the services his request would be granted 
 the princess smiled as people do who think they know more about the subject under discussion than those they are talking with 
 i can tell you more continued prince vasili seizing her hand that letter was written though it was not sent and the emperor knew of it the only question is has it been destroyed or not if not then as soon as all is over and prince vasili sighed to intimate what he meant by the words all is over and the papers are opened the will and letter will be delivered to the emperor and the petition will certainly be granted pierre will get everything as the legitimate son 
 and our share asked the princess smiling ironically as if anything might happen only not that 
 but my poor catiche it is as clear as daylight he will then be the legal heir to everything and you get anything you must know my dear whether the will and letter were written and whether they have been destroyed or not and if they have somehow been overlooked you ought to know where they are and must find them because 
 what next the princess interrupted smiling sardonically and not changing the expression of her eyes i am a woman and you think we are all stupid but i know this an illegitimate son cannot inherit un batard she added as if supposing that this translation of the word would effectively prove to prince vasili the invalidity of his contention 
 a bastard 
 well really catiche you understand you are so intelligent how is it you see that if the count has written a letter to the emperor begging him to recognize pierre as legitimate it follows that pierre will not be pierre but will become count bezukhov and will then inherit everything under the will and if the will and letter are not destroyed then you will have nothing but the consolation of having been dutiful et tout ce qui certain 
 and all that follows therefrom 
 i know the will was made but i also know that it is invalid and you mon cousin seem to consider me a perfect fool said the princess with the expression women assume when they suppose they are saying something witty and stinging 
 my dear princess catherine semenovna began prince vasili impatiently i came here not to wrangle with you but to talk about your interests as with a kinswoman a good kind true relation and i tell you for the tenth time that if the letter to the emperor and the will in favor are among the papers then my dear girl you and your sisters are not heiresses if you believe me then believe an expert i have just been talking to dmitri onufrich the family solicitor and he says the same 
 at this a sudden change evidently took place in the princess ideas her thin lips grew white though her eyes did not change and her voice when she began to speak passed through such transitions as she herself evidently did not expect 
 that would be a fine thing said she i never wanted anything and i now 
 she pushed the little dog off her lap and smoothed her dress 
 and this is gratitude this is recognition for those who have sacrificed everything for his sake she cried splendid fine i want anything prince 
 yes but you are not the only one there are your sisters replied prince vasili 
 but the princess did not listen to him 
 yes i knew it long ago but had forgotten i knew that i could expect nothing but meanness deceit envy intrigue and ingratitude the blackest ingratitude in this house 
 do you or do you not know where that will is insisted prince vasili his cheeks twitching more than ever 
 yes i was a fool i still believed in people loved them and sacrificed myself but only the base the vile succeed i know who has been intriguing 
 the princees wished to rise but the prince held her by the hand she had the air of one who has suddenly lost faith in the whole human race she gave her companion an angry glance 
 there is still time my dear you must remember catiche that it was all done casually in a moment of anger of illness and was afterwards forgotten our duty my dear is to rectify his mistake to ease his last moments by not letting him commit this injustice and not to let him die feeling that he is rendering unhappy those who 
 who sacrificed everything for him chimed in the princess who would again have risen had not the prince still held her fast though he never could appreciate it no mon cousin she added with a sigh i shall always remember that in this world one must expect no reward that in this world there is neither honor nor justice in this world one has to be cunning and cruel 
 now come come be reasonable i know your excellent heart 
 no i have a wicked heart 
 i know your heart repeated the prince i value your friendship and wish you to have as good an opinion of me upset yourself and let us talk sensibly while there is still time be it a day or be it but an hour tell me all you know about the will and above all where it is you must know we will take it at once and show it to the count he has no doubt forgotten it and will wish to destroy it you understand that my sole desire is conscientiously to carry out his wishes that is my only reason for being here i came simply to help him and you 
 now i see it all i know who has been intriguing i know cried the princess 
 not the point my dear 
 that protege of yours that sweet princess drubetskaya that anna mikhaylovna whom i would not take for a housemaid the infamous vile woman 
 do not let us lose any time 
 ah talk to me last winter she wheedled herself in here and told the count such vile disgraceful things about us especially about sophie i repeat them that it made the count quite ill and he would not see us for a whole fortnight i know it was then he wrote this vile infamous paper but i thought the thing was invalid 
 got to it at last why did you not tell me about it sooner 
 in the inlaid portfolio that he keeps under his pillow said the princess ignoring his question now i know yes if i have a sin a great sin it is hatred of that vile woman almost shrieked the princess now quite changed and what does she come worming herself in here for but i will give her a piece of my mind the time will come

 chapter xxi 
 
 while in the rostovs ballroom the sixth anglaise was being danced to a tune in which the weary musicians blundered and while tired footmen and cooks were getting the supper count bezukhov had a sixth stroke the doctors pronounced recovery impossible after a mute confession communion was administered to the dying man preparations made for the sacrament of unction and in his house there was the bustle and thrill of suspense usual at such moments outside the house beyond the gates a group of undertakers who hid whenever a carriage drove up waited in expectation of an important order for an expensive funeral the military governor of moscow who had been assiduous in sending to inquire after the health came himself that evening to bid a last farewell to the celebrated grandee of court count bezukhov 
 the magnificent reception room was crowded everyone stood up respectfully when the military governor having stayed about half an hour alone with the dying man passed out slightly acknowledging their bows and trying to escape as quickly as from the glances fixed on him by the doctors clergy and relatives of the family prince vasili who had grown thinner and paler during the last few days escorted him to the door repeating something to him several times in low tones 
 when the military governor had gone prince vasili sat down all alone on a chair in the ballroom crossing one leg high over the other leaning his elbow on his knee and covering his face with his hand after sitting so for a while he rose and looking about him with frightened eyes went with unusually hurried steps down the long corridor leading to the back of the house to the room of the eldest princess 
 those who were in the dimly lit reception room spoke in nervous whispers and whenever anyone went into or came from the dying room grew silent and gazed with eyes full of curiosity or expectancy at his door which creaked slightly when opened 
 the limits of human life are fixed and may not be said an old priest to a lady who had taken a seat beside him and was listening naively to his words 
 i wonder is it not too late to administer unction asked the lady adding the clerical title as if she had no opinion of her own on the subject 
 ah madam it is a great sacrament replied the priest passing his hand over the thin grizzled strands of hair combed back across his bald head 
 who was that the military governor himself was being asked at the other side of the room how he is 
 yes and he is over sixty i hear the count no longer recognizes anyone they wished to administer the sacrament of unction 
 i knew someone who received that sacrament seven times 
 the second princess had just come from the sickroom with her eyes red from weeping and sat down beside dr lorrain who was sitting in a graceful pose under a portrait of catherine leaning his elbow on a table 
 beautiful said the doctor in answer to a remark about the weather the weather is beautiful princess and besides in moscow one feels as if one were in the country 
 yes indeed replied the princess with a sigh so he may have something to drink 
 lorrain considered 
 has he taken his medicine 
 yes 
 the doctor glanced at his watch 
 take a glass of boiled water and put a pinch of cream of tartar and he indicated with his delicate fingers what he meant by a pinch 
 dere has neffer been a gase a german doctor was saying to an dat one liffs after de sird stroke 
 and what a man he was remarked the and who will inherit his wealth he added in a whisper 
 it go begging replied the german with a smile 
 everyone again looked toward the door which creaked as the second princess went in with the drink she had prepared according to instructions the german doctor went up to lorrain 
 do you think he can last till morning asked the german addressing lorrain in french which he pronounced badly 
 lorrain pursing up his lips waved a severely negative finger before his nose 
 tonight not later said he in a low voice and he moved away with a decorous smile of at being able clearly to understand and state the condition 
 meanwhile prince vasili had opened the door into the princess room 
 in this room it was almost dark only two tiny lamps were burning before the icons and there was a pleasant scent of flowers and burnt pastilles the room was crowded with small pieces of furniture whatnots cupboards and little tables the quilt of a high white feather bed was just visible behind a screen a small dog began to bark 
 ah is it you cousin 
 she rose and smoothed her hair which was as usual so extremely smooth that it seemed to be made of one piece with her head and covered with varnish 
 has anything happened she asked i am so terrified 
 no there is no change i only came to have a talk about business catiche muttered the prince seating himself wearily on the chair she had just vacated you have made the place warm i must say he remarked well sit down have a talk 
 catherine 
 i thought perhaps something had happened she said with her unchanging stonily severe expression and sitting down opposite the prince she prepared to listen 
 i wished to get a nap mon cousin but i 
 well my dear said prince vasili taking her hand and bending it downwards as was his habit 
 it was plain that this well referred to much that they both understood without naming 
 the princess who had a straight rigid body abnormally long for her legs looked directly at prince vasili with no sign of emotion in her prominent gray eyes then she shook her head and glanced up at the icons with a sigh this might have been taken as an expression of sorrow and devotion or of weariness and hope of resting before long prince vasili understood it as an expression of weariness 
 and i he said do you think it is easier for me i am as worn out as a post horse but still i must have a talk with you catiche a very serious talk 
 prince vasili said no more and his cheeks began to twitch nervously now on one side now on the other giving his face an unpleasant expression which was never to be seen on it in a drawing room his eyes too seemed strange at one moment they looked impudently sly and at the next glanced round in alarm

 chapter 
 
 we had sad work with little cathy that day she rose in high glee eager to join her cousin and such passionate tears and lamentations followed the news of his departure that edgar himself was obliged to soothe her by affirming he should come back soon he added however if i can get him and there were no hopes of that this promise poorly pacified her but time was more potent and though still at intervals she inquired of her father when linton would return before she did see him again his features had waxed so dim in her memory that she did not recognize him 
 when i chanced to encounter the housekeeper of wuthering heights in paying business visits to gimmerton i used to ask how the young master got on for he lived almost as secluded as catherine herself and was never to be seen i could gather from her that he continued in weak health and was a tiresome inmate she said mr heathcliff seemed to dislike him ever longer and worse though he took some trouble to conceal it he had an antipathy to the sound of his voice and could not do at all with his sitting in the same room with him many minutes together there seldom passed much talk between them linton learnt his lessons and spent his evenings in a small apartment they called the parlour or else lay in bed all day for he was constantly getting coughs and colds and aches and pains of some sort 
 and i never knew such a creature added the woman nor one so careful of hisseln he will go on if i leave the window open a bit late in the evening oh killing a breath of night air and he must have a fire in the middle of summer and bacca pipe is poison and he must always have sweets and dainties and always milk milk for naught how the rest of us are pinched in winter and there sit wrapped in his furred cloak in his chair by the fire some toast and water or other slop on the hob to sip at and if hareton for pity comes to amuse is not though sure to part one swearing and the other crying i believe the master would relish thrashing him to a mummy if he were not his son and certain he would be fit to turn him out of doors if he knew half the nursing he gives hisseln but then he go into danger of temptation he never enters the parlour and should linton show those ways in the house where he is he sends him upstairs directly 
 i divined from this account that utter lack of sympathy had rendered young heathcliff selfish and disagreeable if he were not so originally and my interest in him consequently decayed though still i was moved with a sense of grief at his lot and a wish that he had been left with us mr edgar encouraged me to gain information he thought a great deal about him i fancy and would have run some risk to see him and he told me once to ask the housekeeper whether he ever came into the village she said he had only been twice on horseback accompanying his father and both times he pretended to be quite knocked up for three or four days afterwards the housekeeper left if i recollect rightly two years after he came and another whom i did not know was her successor she lives there still 
 time wore on at the grange in its former pleasant way till miss cathy reached sixteen on the anniversary of her birth we never manifested any signs of rejoicing because it was also the anniversary of my late death her father invariably spent that day alone in the library and walked at dusk as far as gimmerton kirkyard where he would frequently prolong his stay beyond midnight therefore catherine was thrown on her own resources for amusement this both of march was a beautiful spring day and when her father had retired my young lady came down dressed for going out and said she had asked to have a ramble on the edge of the moors with me and mr linton had given her leave if we went only a short distance and were back within the hour 
 so make haste ellen she cried i know where i wish to go where a colony of moor game are settled i want to see whether they have made their nests yet 
 that must be a good distance up i answered they breed on the edge of the moor 
 no not she said gone very near with papa 
 i put on my bonnet and sallied out thinking nothing more of the matter she bounded before me and returned to my side and was off again like a young greyhound and at first i found plenty of entertainment in listening to the larks singing far and near and enjoying the sweet warm sunshine and watching her my pet and my delight with her golden ringlets flying loose behind and her bright cheek as soft and pure in its bloom as a wild rose and her eyes radiant with cloudless pleasure she was a happy creature and an angel in those days a pity she could not be content 
 well said i where are your moor game miss cathy we should be at them the grange park fence is a great way off now 
 oh a little a little farther ellen was her answer continually climb to that hillock pass that bank and by the time you reach the other side i shall have raised the birds 
 but there were so many hillocks and banks to climb and pass that at length i began to be weary and told her we must halt and retrace our steps i shouted to her as she had outstripped me a long way she either did not hear or did not regard for she still sprang on and i was compelled to follow finally she dived into a hollow and before i came in sight of her again she was two miles nearer wuthering heights than her own home and i beheld a couple of persons arrest her one of whom i felt convinced was mr heathcliff himself 
 cathy had been caught in the fact of plundering or at least hunting out the nests of the grouse the heights were land and he was reproving the poacher 
 neither taken any nor found any she said as i toiled to them expanding her hands in corroboration of the statement i mean to take them but papa told me there were quantities up here and i wished to see the eggs 
 heathcliff glanced at me with an smile expressing his acquaintance with the party and consequently his malevolence towards it and demanded who papa was 
 mr linton of thrushcross grange she replied i thought you did not know me or you have spoken in that way 
 you suppose papa is highly esteemed and respected then he said sarcastically 
 and what are you inquired catherine gazing curiously on the speaker that man seen before is he your son 
 she pointed to hareton the other individual who had gained nothing but increased bulk and strength by the addition of two years to his age he seemed as awkward and rough as ever 
 miss cathy i interrupted it will be three hours instead of one that we are out presently we really must go back 
 no that man is not my son answered heathcliff pushing me aside but i have one and you have seen him before too and though your nurse is in a hurry i think both you and she would be the better for a little rest will you just turn this nab of heath and walk into my house get home earlier for the ease and you shall receive a kind welcome 
 i whispered catherine that she on any account accede to the proposal it was entirely out of the question 
 why she asked aloud tired of running and the ground is dewy i sit here let us go ellen besides he says i have seen his son mistaken i think but i guess where he lives at the farmhouse i visited in coming from penistone crags you 
 i do come nelly hold your will be a treat for her to look in on us hareton get forwards with the lass you shall walk with me nelly 
 no not going to any such place i cried struggling to release my arm which he had seized but she was almost at the doorstones already scampering round the brow at full speed her appointed companion did not pretend to escort her he shied off by the roadside and vanished 
 mr heathcliff very wrong i continued you know you mean no good and there see linton and all will be told as soon as ever we return and i shall have the blame 
 i want her to see linton he answered looking better these few days not often fit to be seen and soon persuade her to keep the visit secret where is the harm of it 
 the harm of it is that her father would hate me if he found i suffered her to enter your house and i am convinced you have a bad design in encouraging her to do so i replied 
 my design is as honest as possible inform you of its whole scope he said that the two cousins may fall in love and get married acting generously to your master his young chit has no expectations and should she second my wishes be provided for at once as joint successor with linton 
 if linton died i answered and his life is quite uncertain catherine would be the heir 
 no she would not he said there is no clause in the will to secure it so his property would go to me but to prevent disputes i desire their union and am resolved to bring it about 
 and resolved she shall never approach your house with me again i returned as we reached the gate where miss cathy waited our coming 
 heathcliff bid me be quiet and preceding us up the path hastened to open the door my young lady gave him several looks as if she could not exactly make up her mind what to think of him but now he smiled when he met her eye and softened his voice in addressing her and i was foolish enough to imagine the memory of her mother might disarm him from desiring her injury linton stood on the hearth he had been out walking in the fields for his cap was on and he was calling to joseph to bring him dry shoes he had grown tall of his age still wanting some months of sixteen his features were pretty yet and his eye and complexion brighter than i remembered them though with merely temporary lustre borrowed from the salubrious air and genial sun 
 now who is that asked mr heathcliff turning to cathy can you tell 
 your son she said having doubtfully surveyed first one and then the other 
 yes yes answered he but is this the only time you have beheld him think ah you have a short memory linton you recall your cousin that you used to tease us so with wishing to see 
 what linton cried cathy kindling into joyful surprise at the name is that little linton taller than i am are you linton 
 the youth stepped forward and acknowledged himself she kissed him fervently and they gazed with wonder at the change time had wrought in the appearance of each catherine had reached her full height her figure was both plump and slender elastic as steel and her whole aspect sparkling with health and spirits looks and movements were very languid and his form extremely slight but there was a grace in his manner that mitigated these defects and rendered him not unpleasing after exchanging numerous marks of fondness with him his cousin went to mr heathcliff who lingered by the door dividing his attention between the objects inside and those that lay without pretending that is to observe the latter and really noting the former alone 
 and you are my uncle then she cried reaching up to salute him i thought i liked you though you were cross at first why you visit at the grange with linton to live all these years such close neighbours and never see us is odd what have you done so for 
 i visited it once or twice too often before you were born he answered it if you have any kisses to spare give them to linton they are thrown away on me 
 naughty ellen exclaimed catherine flying to attack me next with her lavish caresses wicked ellen to try to hinder me from entering but take this walk every morning in future may i uncle and sometimes bring papa you be glad to see us 
 of course replied the uncle with a hardly suppressed grimace resulting from his deep aversion to both the proposed visitors but stay he continued turning towards the young lady now i think of it better tell you mr linton has a prejudice against me we quarrelled at one time of our lives with unchristian ferocity and if you mention coming here to him put a veto on your visits altogether therefore you must not mention it unless you be careless of seeing your cousin hereafter you may come if you will but you must not mention it 
 why did you quarrel asked catherine considerably 
 he thought me too poor to wed his sister answered heathcliff and was grieved that i got her his pride was hurt and never forgive it 
 wrong said the young lady some time tell him so but linton and i have no share in your quarrel not come here then he shall come to the grange 
 it will be too far for me murmured her cousin to walk four miles would kill me no come here miss catherine now and then not every morning but once or twice a week 
 the father launched towards his son a glance of bitter contempt 
 i am afraid nelly i shall lose my labour he muttered to me miss catherine as the ninny calls her will discover his value and send him to the devil now if it had been you know that twenty times a day i covet hareton with all his degradation have loved the lad had he been someone else but i think safe from her love pit him against that paltry creature unless it bestir itself briskly we calculate it will scarcely last till it is eighteen oh confound the vapid thing absorbed in drying his feet and never looks at 
 yes father answered the boy 
 have you nothing to show your cousin anywhere about not even a rabbit or a nest take her into the garden before you change your shoes and into the stable to see your horse 
 you rather sit here asked linton addressing cathy in a tone which expressed reluctance to move again 
 i know she replied casting a longing look to the door and evidently eager to be active 
 he kept his seat and shrank closer to the fire heathcliff rose and went into the kitchen and from thence to the yard calling out for hareton hareton responded and presently the two reentered the young man had been washing himself as was visible by the glow on his cheeks and his wetted hair 
 oh ask you uncle cried miss cathy recollecting the assertion that is not my cousin is he 
 yes he replied your nephew you like him catherine looked queer is he not a handsome lad he continued the uncivil little thing stood on tiptoe and whispered a sentence in ear he laughed hareton darkened i perceived he was very sensitive to suspected slights and had obviously a dim notion of his inferiority but his master or guardian chased the frown by exclaiming 
 be the favourite among us hareton she says you are was it well something very flattering here you go with her round the farm and behave like a gentleman mind use any bad words and stare when the young lady is not looking at you and be ready to hide your face when she is and when you speak say your words slowly and keep your hands out of your pockets be off and entertain her as nicely as you can 
 he watched the couple walking past the window earnshaw had his countenance completely averted from his companion he seemed studying the familiar landscape with a and an interest catherine took a sly look at him expressing small admiration she then turned her attention to seeking out objects of amusement for herself and tripped merrily on lilting a tune to supply the lack of conversation 
 tied his tongue observed heathcliff not venture a single syllable all the time nelly you recollect me at his some years younger did i ever look so stupid so gaumless as joseph calls it 
 worse i replied because more sullen with it 
 a pleasure in him he continued reflecting aloud he has satisfied my expectations if he were a born fool i should not enjoy it half so much but no fool and i can sympathize with all his feelings having felt them myself i know what he suffers now for instance exactly it is merely a beginning of what he shall suffer though and never be able to emerge from his bathos of coarseness and ignorance got him faster than his scoundrel of a father secured me and lower for he takes a pride in his brutishness taught him to scorn everything as silly and weak you think hindley would be proud of his son if he could see him almost as proud as i am of mine but this difference one is gold put to the use of and the other is tin polished to ape a service of silver mine has nothing valuable about it yet i shall have the merit of making it go as far as such poor stuff can go his had qualities and they are lost rendered worse than unavailing i have nothing to regret he would have more than any but i are aware of and the best of it is hareton is damnably fond of me own that outmatched hindley there if the dead villain could rise from his grave to abuse me for his wrongs i should have the fun of seeing the said offspring fight him back again indignant that he should dare to rail at the one friend he has in the world 
 heathcliff chuckled a fiendish laugh at the idea i made no reply because i saw that he expected none meantime our young companion who sat too removed from us to hear what was said began to evince symptoms of uneasiness probably repenting that he had denied himself the treat of society for fear of a little fatigue his father remarked the restless glances wandering to the window and the hand irresolutely extended towards his cap 
 get up you idle boy he exclaimed with assumed heartiness away after them they are just at the corner by the stand of hives 
 linton gathered his energies and left the hearth the lattice was open and as he stepped out i heard cathy inquiring of her unsociable attendant what was that inscription over the door hareton stared up and scratched his head like a true clown 
 some damnable writing he answered i cannot read it 
 read it cried catherine i can read it english but i want to know why it is there 
 linton giggled the first appearance of mirth he had exhibited 
 he does not know his letters he said to his cousin could you believe in the existence of such a colossal dunce 
 is he all as he should be asked miss cathy seriously or is he simple not right questioned him twice now and each time he looked so stupid i think he does not understand me i can hardly understand him sure 
 linton repeated his laugh and glanced at hareton tauntingly who certainly did not seem quite clear of comprehension at that moment 
 nothing the matter but laziness is there earnshaw he said my cousin fancies you are an idiot there you experience the consequence of scorning as you would say have you noticed catherine his frightful yorkshire pronunciation 
 why where the devil is the use growled hareton more ready in answering his daily companion he was about to enlarge further but the two youngsters broke into a noisy fit of merriment my giddy miss being delighted to discover that she might turn his strange talk to matter of amusement 
 where is the use of the devil in that sentence tittered linton papa told you not to say any bad words and you open your mouth without one do try to behave like a gentleman now do 
 if thou more a lass than a lad fell thee this minute i would pitiful lath of a crater retorted the angry boor retreating while his face burnt with mingled rage and mortification for he was conscious of being insulted and embarrassed how to resent it 
 mr heathcliff having overheard the conversation as well as i smiled when he saw him go but immediately afterwards cast a look of singular aversion on the flippant pair who remained chattering in the doorway the boy finding animation enough while discussing faults and deficiencies and relating anecdotes of his and the girl relishing his pert and spiteful sayings without considering the ill nature they evinced but i began to dislike more than to compassionate linton and to excuse his father in some measure for holding him cheap 
 we stayed till afternoon i could not tear miss cathy away before but happily my master had not quitted his apartment and remained ignorant of our prolonged absence as we walked home i would fain have enlightened my charge on the characters of the people we had quitted but she got it into her head that i was prejudiced against them 
 aha she cried you take side ellen you are partial i know or else you have cheated me so many years into the notion that linton lived a long way from here really extremely angry only so pleased i show it but you must hold your tongue about my uncle my uncle remember and scold papa for quarrelling with him 
 and so she ran on till i dropped endeavouring to convince her of her mistake she did not mention the visit that night because she did not see mr linton next day it all came out sadly to my chagrin and still i was not altogether sorry i thought the burden of directing and warning would be more efficiently borne by him than me but he was too timid in giving satisfactory reasons for his wish that she should shun connection with the household of the heights and catherine liked good reasons for every restraint that harassed her petted will 
 papa she exclaimed after the salutations guess whom i saw yesterday in my walk on the moors ah papa you started not done right have you now i listen and you shall hear how i found you out and ellen who is in league with you and yet pretended to pity me so when i kept hoping and was always disappointed about coming back 
 she gave a faithful account of her excursion and its consequences and my master though he cast more than one reproachful look at me said nothing till she had concluded then he drew her to him and asked if she knew why he had concealed near neighbourhood from her could she think it was to deny her a pleasure that she might harmlessly enjoy 
 it was because you disliked mr heathcliff she answered 
 then you believe i care more for my own feelings than yours cathy he said no it was not because i disliked mr heathcliff but because mr heathcliff dislikes me and is a most diabolical man delighting to wrong and ruin those he hates if they give him the slightest opportunity i knew that you could not keep up an acquaintance with your cousin without being brought into contact with him and i knew he would detest you on my account so for your own good and nothing else i took precautions that you should not see linton again i meant to explain this some time as you grew older and sorry i delayed it 
 but mr heathcliff was quite cordial papa observed catherine not at all convinced and he object to our seeing each other he said i might come to his house when i pleased only i must not tell you because you had quarrelled with him and would not forgive him for marrying aunt isabella and you you are the one to be blamed he is willing to let us be friends at least linton and i and you are not 
 my master perceiving that she would not take his word for her evil disposition gave a hasty sketch of his conduct to isabella and the manner in which wuthering heights became his property he could not bear to discourse long upon the topic for though he spoke little of it he still felt the same horror and detestation of his ancient enemy that had occupied his heart ever since mrs death she might have been living yet if it had not been for him was his constant bitter reflection and in his eyes heathcliff seemed a murderer miss with no bad deeds except her own slight acts of disobedience injustice and passion rising from hot temper and thoughtlessness and repented of on the day they were amazed at the blackness of spirit that could brood on and cover revenge for years and deliberately prosecute its plans without a visitation of remorse she appeared so deeply impressed and shocked at this new view of human from all her studies and all her ideas till mr edgar deemed it unnecessary to pursue the subject he merely added 
 you will know hereafter darling why i wish you to avoid his house and family now return to your old employments and amusements and think no more about them 
 catherine kissed her father and sat down quietly to her lessons for a couple of hours according to custom then she accompanied him into the grounds and the whole day passed as usual but in the evening when she had retired to her room and i went to help her to undress i found her crying on her knees by the bedside 
 oh fie silly child i exclaimed if you had any real griefs be ashamed to waste a tear on this little contrariety you never had one shadow of substantial sorrow miss catherine suppose for a minute that master and i were dead and you were by yourself in the world how would you feel then compare the present occasion with such an affliction as that and be thankful for the friends you have instead of coveting more 
 not crying for myself ellen she answered for him he expected to see me again tomorrow and there be so disappointed and wait for me and i come 
 nonsense said i do you imagine he has thought as much of you as you have of him he hareton for a companion not one in a hundred would weep at losing a relation they had just seen twice for two afternoons linton will conjecture how it is and trouble himself no further about you 
 but may i not write a note to tell him why i cannot come she asked rising to her feet and just send those books i promised to lend him his books are not as nice as mine and he wanted to have them extremely when i told him how interesting they were may i not ellen 
 no indeed no indeed replied i with decision then he would write to you and never be an end of it no miss catherine the acquaintance must be dropped entirely so papa expects and i shall see that it is done 
 but how can one little note she recommenced putting on an imploring countenance 
 silence i interrupted not begin with your little notes get into bed 
 she threw at me a very naughty look so naughty that i would not kiss her good night at first i covered her up and shut her door in great displeasure but repenting half way i returned softly and lo there was miss standing at the table with a bit of blank paper before her and a pencil in her hand which she guiltily slipped out of sight on my entrance 
 get nobody to take that catherine i said if you write it and at present i shall put out your candle 
 i set the extinguisher on the flame receiving as i did so a slap on my hand and petulant cross thing i then quitted her again and she drew the bolt in one of her worst most peevish humours the letter was finished and forwarded to its destination by a who came from the village but that i learn till some time afterwards weeks passed on and cathy recovered her temper though she grew wondrous fond of stealing off to corners by herself and often if i came near her suddenly while reading she would start and bend over the book evidently desirous to hide it and i detected edges of loose paper sticking out beyond the leaves she also got a trick of coming down early in the morning and lingering about the kitchen as if she were expecting the arrival of something and she had a small drawer in a cabinet in the library which she would trifle over for hours and whose key she took special care to remove when she left it 
 one day as she inspected this drawer i observed that the playthings and trinkets which recently formed its contents were transmuted into bits of folded paper my curiosity and suspicions were aroused i determined to take a peep at her mysterious treasures so at night as soon as she and my master were safe upstairs i searched and readily found among my house keys one that would fit the lock having opened i emptied the whole contents into my apron and took them with me to examine at leisure in my own chamber though i could not but suspect i was still surprised to discover that they were a mass of almost it must have linton heathcliff answers to documents forwarded by her the earlier dated were embarrassed and short gradually however they expanded into copious love letters foolish as the age of the writer rendered natural yet with touches here and there which i thought were borrowed from a more experienced source some of them struck me as singularly odd compounds of ardour and flatness commencing in strong feeling and concluding in the affected wordy way that a schoolboy might use to a fancied incorporeal sweetheart whether they satisfied cathy i know but they appeared very worthless trash to me after turning over as many as i thought proper i tied them in a handkerchief and set them aside relocking the vacant drawer 
 following her habit my young lady descended early and visited the kitchen i watched her go to the door on the arrival of a certain little boy and while the dairymaid filled his can she tucked something into his jacket pocket and plucked something out i went round by the garden and laid wait for the messenger who fought valorously to defend his trust and we spilt the milk between us but i succeeded in abstracting the epistle and threatening serious consequences if he did not look sharp home i remained under the wall and perused miss affectionate composition it was more simple and more eloquent than her very pretty and very silly i shook my head and went meditating into the house the day being wet she could not divert herself with rambling about the park so at the conclusion of her morning studies she resorted to the solace of the drawer her father sat reading at the table and i on purpose had sought a bit of work in some unripped fringes of the window curtain keeping my eye steadily fixed on her proceedings never did any bird flying back to a plundered nest which it had left brimful of chirping young ones express more complete despair in its anguished cries and flutterings than she by her single oh and the change that transfigured her late happy countenance mr linton looked up 
 what is the matter love have you hurt yourself he said 
 his tone and look assured her he had not been the discoverer of the hoard 
 no papa she gasped ellen ellen come sick i obeyed her summons and accompanied her out 
 oh ellen you have got them she commenced immediately dropping on her knees when we were enclosed alone oh give them to me and never never do so again tell papa you have not told papa ellen say you have not been exceedingly naughty but i do it any more 
 with a grave severity in my manner i bid her stand up 
 so i exclaimed miss catherine you are tolerably far on it seems you may well be ashamed of them a fine bundle of trash you study in your leisure hours to be sure why good enough to be printed and what do you suppose the master will think when i display it before him i shown it yet but you imagine i shall keep your ridiculous secrets for shame and you must have led the way in writing such absurdities he would not have thought of beginning certain 
 i i sobbed cathy fit to break her heart i once think of loving him till 
 loving cried i as scornfully as i could utter the word loving did anybody ever hear the like i might just as well talk of loving the miller who comes once a year to buy our corn pretty loving indeed and both times together you have seen linton hardly four hours in your life now here is the babyish trash going with it to the library and see what your father says to such loving 
 she sprang at her precious epistles but i held them above my head and then she poured out further frantic entreaties that i would burn anything rather than show them and being really fully as inclined to laugh as i esteemed it all girlish at length relented in a measure and asked 
 if i consent to burn them will you promise faithfully neither to send nor receive a letter again nor a book for i perceive you have sent him books nor locks of hair nor rings nor playthings 
 we send playthings cried catherine her pride overcoming her shame 
 nor anything at all then my lady i said unless you will here i go 
 i promise ellen she cried catching my dress oh put them in the fire do do 
 but when i proceeded to open a place with the poker the sacrifice was too painful to be borne she earnestly supplicated that i would spare her one or two 
 one or two ellen to keep for sake 
 i unknotted the handkerchief and commenced dropping them in from an angle and the flame curled up the chimney 
 i will have one you cruel wretch she screamed darting her hand into the fire and drawing forth some half consumed fragments at the expense of her fingers 
 very i will have some to exhibit to papa i answered shaking back the rest into the bundle and turning anew to the door 
 she emptied her blackened pieces into the flames and motioned me to finish the immolation it was done i stirred up the ashes and interred them under a shovelful of coals and she mutely and with a sense of intense injury retired to her private apartment i descended to tell my master that the young qualm of sickness was almost gone but i judged it best for her to lie down a while she dine but she reappeared at tea pale and red about the eyes and marvellously subdued in outward aspect next morning i answered the letter by a slip of paper inscribed master heathcliff is requested to send no more notes to miss linton as she will not receive them and thenceforth the little boy came with vacant pockets

 chapter 
 
 we had sad work with little cathy that day she rose in high glee eager to join her cousin and such passionate tears and lamentations followed the news of his departure that edgar himself was obliged to soothe her by affirming he should come back soon he added however if i can get him and there were no hopes of that this promise poorly pacified her but time was more potent and though still at intervals she inquired of her father when linton would return before she did see him again his features had waxed so dim in her memory that she did not recognize him 
 when i chanced to encounter the housekeeper of wuthering heights in paying business visits to gimmerton i used to ask how the young master got on for he lived almost as secluded as catherine herself and was never to be seen i could gather from her that he continued in weak health and was a tiresome inmate she said mr heathcliff seemed to dislike him ever longer and worse though he took some trouble to conceal it he had an antipathy to the sound of his voice and could not do at all with his sitting in the same room with him many minutes together there seldom passed much talk between them linton learnt his lessons and spent his evenings in a small apartment they called the parlour or else lay in bed all day for he was constantly getting coughs and colds and aches and pains of some sort 
 and i never knew such a creature added the woman nor one so careful of hisseln he will go on if i leave the window open a bit late in the evening oh killing a breath of night air and he must have a fire in the middle of summer and bacca pipe is poison and he must always have sweets and dainties and always milk milk for naught how the rest of us are pinched in winter and there sit wrapped in his furred cloak in his chair by the fire some toast and water or other slop on the hob to sip at and if hareton for pity comes to amuse is not though sure to part one swearing and the other crying i believe the master would relish thrashing him to a mummy if he were not his son and certain he would be fit to turn him out of doors if he knew half the nursing he gives hisseln but then he go into danger of temptation he never enters the parlour and should linton show those ways in the house where he is he sends him upstairs directly 
 i divined from this account that utter lack of sympathy had rendered young heathcliff selfish and disagreeable if he were not so originally and my interest in him consequently decayed though still i was moved with a sense of grief at his lot and a wish that he had been left with us mr edgar encouraged me to gain information he thought a great deal about him i fancy and would have run some risk to see him and he told me once to ask the housekeeper whether he ever came into the village she said he had only been twice on horseback accompanying his father and both times he pretended to be quite knocked up for three or four days afterwards the housekeeper left if i recollect rightly two years after he came and another whom i did not know was her successor she lives there still 
 time wore on at the grange in its former pleasant way till miss cathy reached sixteen on the anniversary of her birth we never manifested any signs of rejoicing because it was also the anniversary of my late death her father invariably spent that day alone in the library and walked at dusk as far as gimmerton kirkyard where he would frequently prolong his stay beyond midnight therefore catherine was thrown on her own resources for amusement this both of march was a beautiful spring day and when her father had retired my young lady came down dressed for going out and said she had asked to have a ramble on the edge of the moors with me and mr linton had given her leave if we went only a short distance and were back within the hour 
 so make haste ellen she cried i know where i wish to go where a colony of moor game are settled i want to see whether they have made their nests yet 
 that must be a good distance up i answered they breed on the edge of the moor 
 no not she said gone very near with papa 
 i put on my bonnet and sallied out thinking nothing more of the matter she bounded before me and returned to my side and was off again like a young greyhound and at first i found plenty of entertainment in listening to the larks singing far and near and enjoying the sweet warm sunshine and watching her my pet and my delight with her golden ringlets flying loose behind and her bright cheek as soft and pure in its bloom as a wild rose and her eyes radiant with cloudless pleasure she was a happy creature and an angel in those days a pity she could not be content 
 well said i where are your moor game miss cathy we should be at them the grange park fence is a great way off now 
 oh a little a little farther ellen was her answer continually climb to that hillock pass that bank and by the time you reach the other side i shall have raised the birds 
 but there were so many hillocks and banks to climb and pass that at length i began to be weary and told her we must halt and retrace our steps i shouted to her as she had outstripped me a long way she either did not hear or did not regard for she still sprang on and i was compelled to follow finally she dived into a hollow and before i came in sight of her again she was two miles nearer wuthering heights than her own home and i beheld a couple of persons arrest her one of whom i felt convinced was mr heathcliff himself 
 cathy had been caught in the fact of plundering or at least hunting out the nests of the grouse the heights were land and he was reproving the poacher 
 neither taken any nor found any she said as i toiled to them expanding her hands in corroboration of the statement i mean to take them but papa told me there were quantities up here and i wished to see the eggs 
 heathcliff glanced at me with an smile expressing his acquaintance with the party and consequently his malevolence towards it and demanded who papa was 
 mr linton of thrushcross grange she replied i thought you did not know me or you have spoken in that way 
 you suppose papa is highly esteemed and respected then he said sarcastically 
 and what are you inquired catherine gazing curiously on the speaker that man seen before is he your son 
 she pointed to hareton the other individual who had gained nothing but increased bulk and strength by the addition of two years to his age he seemed as awkward and rough as ever 
 miss cathy i interrupted it will be three hours instead of one that we are out presently we really must go back 
 no that man is not my son answered heathcliff pushing me aside but i have one and you have seen him before too and though your nurse is in a hurry i think both you and she would be the better for a little rest will you just turn this nab of heath and walk into my house get home earlier for the ease and you shall receive a kind welcome 
 i whispered catherine that she on any account accede to the proposal it was entirely out of the question 
 why she asked aloud tired of running and the ground is dewy i sit here let us go ellen besides he says i have seen his son mistaken i think but i guess where he lives at the farmhouse i visited in coming from penistone crags you 
 i do come nelly hold your will be a treat for her to look in on us hareton get forwards with the lass you shall walk with me nelly 
 no not going to any such place i cried struggling to release my arm which he had seized but she was almost at the doorstones already scampering round the brow at full speed her appointed companion did not pretend to escort her he shied off by the roadside and vanished 
 mr heathcliff very wrong i continued you know you mean no good and there see linton and all will be told as soon as ever we return and i shall have the blame 
 i want her to see linton he answered looking better these few days not often fit to be seen and soon persuade her to keep the visit secret where is the harm of it 
 the harm of it is that her father would hate me if he found i suffered her to enter your house and i am convinced you have a bad design in encouraging her to do so i replied 
 my design is as honest as possible inform you of its whole scope he said that the two cousins may fall in love and get married acting generously to your master his young chit has no expectations and should she second my wishes be provided for at once as joint successor with linton 
 if linton died i answered and his life is quite uncertain catherine would be the heir 
 no she would not he said there is no clause in the will to secure it so his property would go to me but to prevent disputes i desire their union and am resolved to bring it about 
 and resolved she shall never approach your house with me again i returned as we reached the gate where miss cathy waited our coming 
 heathcliff bid me be quiet and preceding us up the path hastened to open the door my young lady gave him several looks as if she could not exactly make up her mind what to think of him but now he smiled when he met her eye and softened his voice in addressing her and i was foolish enough to imagine the memory of her mother might disarm him from desiring her injury linton stood on the hearth he had been out walking in the fields for his cap was on and he was calling to joseph to bring him dry shoes he had grown tall of his age still wanting some months of sixteen his features were pretty yet and his eye and complexion brighter than i remembered them though with merely temporary lustre borrowed from the salubrious air and genial sun 
 now who is that asked mr heathcliff turning to cathy can you tell 
 your son she said having doubtfully surveyed first one and then the other 
 yes yes answered he but is this the only time you have beheld him think ah you have a short memory linton you recall your cousin that you used to tease us so with wishing to see 
 what linton cried cathy kindling into joyful surprise at the name is that little linton taller than i am are you linton 
 the youth stepped forward and acknowledged himself she kissed him fervently and they gazed with wonder at the change time had wrought in the appearance of each catherine had reached her full height her figure was both plump and slender elastic as steel and her whole aspect sparkling with health and spirits looks and movements were very languid and his form extremely slight but there was a grace in his manner that mitigated these defects and rendered him not unpleasing after exchanging numerous marks of fondness with him his cousin went to mr heathcliff who lingered by the door dividing his attention between the objects inside and those that lay without pretending that is to observe the latter and really noting the former alone 
 and you are my uncle then she cried reaching up to salute him i thought i liked you though you were cross at first why you visit at the grange with linton to live all these years such close neighbours and never see us is odd what have you done so for 
 i visited it once or twice too often before you were born he answered it if you have any kisses to spare give them to linton they are thrown away on me 
 naughty ellen exclaimed catherine flying to attack me next with her lavish caresses wicked ellen to try to hinder me from entering but take this walk every morning in future may i uncle and sometimes bring papa you be glad to see us 
 of course replied the uncle with a hardly suppressed grimace resulting from his deep aversion to both the proposed visitors but stay he continued turning towards the young lady now i think of it better tell you mr linton has a prejudice against me we quarrelled at one time of our lives with unchristian ferocity and if you mention coming here to him put a veto on your visits altogether therefore you must not mention it unless you be careless of seeing your cousin hereafter you may come if you will but you must not mention it 
 why did you quarrel asked catherine considerably 
 he thought me too poor to wed his sister answered heathcliff and was grieved that i got her his pride was hurt and never forgive it 
 wrong said the young lady some time tell him so but linton and i have no share in your quarrel not come here then he shall come to the grange 
 it will be too far for me murmured her cousin to walk four miles would kill me no come here miss catherine now and then not every morning but once or twice a week 
 the father launched towards his son a glance of bitter contempt 
 i am afraid nelly i shall lose my labour he muttered to me miss catherine as the ninny calls her will discover his value and send him to the devil now if it had been you know that twenty times a day i covet hareton with all his degradation have loved the lad had he been someone else but i think safe from her love pit him against that paltry creature unless it bestir itself briskly we calculate it will scarcely last till it is eighteen oh confound the vapid thing absorbed in drying his feet and never looks at 
 yes father answered the boy 
 have you nothing to show your cousin anywhere about not even a rabbit or a nest take her into the garden before you change your shoes and into the stable to see your horse 
 you rather sit here asked linton addressing cathy in a tone which expressed reluctance to move again 
 i know she replied casting a longing look to the door and evidently eager to be active 
 he kept his seat and shrank closer to the fire heathcliff rose and went into the kitchen and from thence to the yard calling out for hareton hareton responded and presently the two reentered the young man had been washing himself as was visible by the glow on his cheeks and his wetted hair 
 oh ask you uncle cried miss cathy recollecting the assertion that is not my cousin is he 
 yes he replied your nephew you like him catherine looked queer is he not a handsome lad he continued the uncivil little thing stood on tiptoe and whispered a sentence in ear he laughed hareton darkened i perceived he was very sensitive to suspected slights and had obviously a dim notion of his inferiority but his master or guardian chased the frown by exclaiming 
 be the favourite among us hareton she says you are was it well something very flattering here you go with her round the farm and behave like a gentleman mind use any bad words and stare when the young lady is not looking at you and be ready to hide your face when she is and when you speak say your words slowly and keep your hands out of your pockets be off and entertain her as nicely as you can 
 he watched the couple walking past the window earnshaw had his countenance completely averted from his companion he seemed studying the familiar landscape with a and an interest catherine took a sly look at him expressing small admiration she then turned her attention to seeking out objects of amusement for herself and tripped merrily on lilting a tune to supply the lack of conversation 
 tied his tongue observed heathcliff not venture a single syllable all the time nelly you recollect me at his some years younger did i ever look so stupid so gaumless as joseph calls it 
 worse i replied because more sullen with it 
 a pleasure in him he continued reflecting aloud he has satisfied my expectations if he were a born fool i should not enjoy it half so much but no fool and i can sympathize with all his feelings having felt them myself i know what he suffers now for instance exactly it is merely a beginning of what he shall suffer though and never be able to emerge from his bathos of coarseness and ignorance got him faster than his scoundrel of a father secured me and lower for he takes a pride in his brutishness taught him to scorn everything as silly and weak you think hindley would be proud of his son if he could see him almost as proud as i am of mine but this difference one is gold put to the use of and the other is tin polished to ape a service of silver mine has nothing valuable about it yet i shall have the merit of making it go as far as such poor stuff can go his had qualities and they are lost rendered worse than unavailing i have nothing to regret he would have more than any but i are aware of and the best of it is hareton is damnably fond of me own that outmatched hindley there if the dead villain could rise from his grave to abuse me for his wrongs i should have the fun of seeing the said offspring fight him back again indignant that he should dare to rail at the one friend he has in the world 
 heathcliff chuckled a fiendish laugh at the idea i made no reply because i saw that he expected none meantime our young companion who sat too removed from us to hear what was said began to evince symptoms of uneasiness probably repenting that he had denied himself the treat of society for fear of a little fatigue his father remarked the restless glances wandering to the window and the hand irresolutely extended towards his cap 
 get up you idle boy he exclaimed with assumed heartiness away after them they are just at the corner by the stand of hives 
 linton gathered his energies and left the hearth the lattice was open and as he stepped out i heard cathy inquiring of her unsociable attendant what was that inscription over the door hareton stared up and scratched his head like a true clown 
 some damnable writing he answered i cannot read it 
 read it cried catherine i can read it english but i want to know why it is there 
 linton giggled the first appearance of mirth he had exhibited 
 he does not know his letters he said to his cousin could you believe in the existence of such a colossal dunce 
 is he all as he should be asked miss cathy seriously or is he simple not right questioned him twice now and each time he looked so stupid i think he does not understand me i can hardly understand him sure 
 linton repeated his laugh and glanced at hareton tauntingly who certainly did not seem quite clear of comprehension at that moment 
 nothing the matter but laziness is there earnshaw he said my cousin fancies you are an idiot there you experience the consequence of scorning as you would say have you noticed catherine his frightful yorkshire pronunciation 
 why where the devil is the use growled hareton more ready in answering his daily companion he was about to enlarge further but the two youngsters broke into a noisy fit of merriment my giddy miss being delighted to discover that she might turn his strange talk to matter of amusement 
 where is the use of the devil in that sentence tittered linton papa told you not to say any bad words and you open your mouth without one do try to behave like a gentleman now do 
 if thou more a lass than a lad fell thee this minute i would pitiful lath of a crater retorted the angry boor retreating while his face burnt with mingled rage and mortification for he was conscious of being insulted and embarrassed how to resent it 
 mr heathcliff having overheard the conversation as well as i smiled when he saw him go but immediately afterwards cast a look of singular aversion on the flippant pair who remained chattering in the doorway the boy finding animation enough while discussing faults and deficiencies and relating anecdotes of his and the girl relishing his pert and spiteful sayings without considering the ill nature they evinced but i began to dislike more than to compassionate linton and to excuse his father in some measure for holding him cheap 
 we stayed till afternoon i could not tear miss cathy away before but happily my master had not quitted his apartment and remained ignorant of our prolonged absence as we walked home i would fain have enlightened my charge on the characters of the people we had quitted but she got it into her head that i was prejudiced against them 
 aha she cried you take side ellen you are partial i know or else you have cheated me so many years into the notion that linton lived a long way from here really extremely angry only so pleased i show it but you must hold your tongue about my uncle my uncle remember and scold papa for quarrelling with him 
 and so she ran on till i dropped endeavouring to convince her of her mistake she did not mention the visit that night because she did not see mr linton next day it all came out sadly to my chagrin and still i was not altogether sorry i thought the burden of directing and warning would be more efficiently borne by him than me but he was too timid in giving satisfactory reasons for his wish that she should shun connection with the household of the heights and catherine liked good reasons for every restraint that harassed her petted will 
 papa she exclaimed after the salutations guess whom i saw yesterday in my walk on the moors ah papa you started not done right have you now i listen and you shall hear how i found you out and ellen who is in league with you and yet pretended to pity me so when i kept hoping and was always disappointed about coming back 
 she gave a faithful account of her excursion and its consequences and my master though he cast more than one reproachful look at me said nothing till she had concluded then he drew her to him and asked if she knew why he had concealed near neighbourhood from her could she think it was to deny her a pleasure that she might harmlessly enjoy 
 it was because you disliked mr heathcliff she answered 
 then you believe i care more for my own feelings than yours cathy he said no it was not because i disliked mr heathcliff but because mr heathcliff dislikes me and is a most diabolical man delighting to wrong and ruin those he hates if they give him the slightest opportunity i knew that you could not keep up an acquaintance with your cousin without being brought into contact with him and i knew he would detest you on my account so for your own good and nothing else i took precautions that you should not see linton again i meant to explain this some time as you grew older and sorry i delayed it 
 but mr heathcliff was quite cordial papa observed catherine not at all convinced and he object to our seeing each other he said i might come to his house when i pleased only i must not tell you because you had quarrelled with him and would not forgive him for marrying aunt isabella and you you are the one to be blamed he is willing to let us be friends at least linton and i and you are not 
 my master perceiving that she would not take his word for her evil disposition gave a hasty sketch of his conduct to isabella and the manner in which wuthering heights became his property he could not bear to discourse long upon the topic for though he spoke little of it he still felt the same horror and detestation of his ancient enemy that had occupied his heart ever since mrs death she might have been living yet if it had not been for him was his constant bitter reflection and in his eyes heathcliff seemed a murderer miss with no bad deeds except her own slight acts of disobedience injustice and passion rising from hot temper and thoughtlessness and repented of on the day they were amazed at the blackness of spirit that could brood on and cover revenge for years and deliberately prosecute its plans without a visitation of remorse she appeared so deeply impressed and shocked at this new view of human from all her studies and all her ideas till mr edgar deemed it unnecessary to pursue the subject he merely added 
 you will know hereafter darling why i wish you to avoid his house and family now return to your old employments and amusements and think no more about them 
 catherine kissed her father and sat down quietly to her lessons for a couple of hours according to custom then she accompanied him into the grounds and the whole day passed as usual but in the evening when she had retired to her room and i went to help her to undress i found her crying on her knees by the bedside 
 oh fie silly child i exclaimed if you had any real griefs be ashamed to waste a tear on this little contrariety you never had one shadow of substantial sorrow miss catherine suppose for a minute that master and i were dead and you were by yourself in the world how would you feel then compare the present occasion with such an affliction as that and be thankful for the friends you have instead of coveting more 
 not crying for myself ellen she answered for him he expected to see me again tomorrow and there be so disappointed and wait for me and i come 
 nonsense said i do you imagine he has thought as much of you as you have of him he hareton for a companion not one in a hundred would weep at losing a relation they had just seen twice for two afternoons linton will conjecture how it is and trouble himself no further about you 
 but may i not write a note to tell him why i cannot come she asked rising to her feet and just send those books i promised to lend him his books are not as nice as mine and he wanted to have them extremely when i told him how interesting they were may i not ellen 
 no indeed no indeed replied i with decision then he would write to you and never be an end of it no miss catherine the acquaintance must be dropped entirely so papa expects and i shall see that it is done 
 but how can one little note she recommenced putting on an imploring countenance 
 silence i interrupted not begin with your little notes get into bed 
 she threw at me a very naughty look so naughty that i would not kiss her good night at first i covered her up and shut her door in great displeasure but repenting half way i returned softly and lo there was miss standing at the table with a bit of blank paper before her and a pencil in her hand which she guiltily slipped out of sight on my entrance 
 get nobody to take that catherine i said if you write it and at present i shall put out your candle 
 i set the extinguisher on the flame receiving as i did so a slap on my hand and petulant cross thing i then quitted her again and she drew the bolt in one of her worst most peevish humours the letter was finished and forwarded to its destination by a who came from the village but that i learn till some time afterwards weeks passed on and cathy recovered her temper though she grew wondrous fond of stealing off to corners by herself and often if i came near her suddenly while reading she would start and bend over the book evidently desirous to hide it and i detected edges of loose paper sticking out beyond the leaves she also got a trick of coming down early in the morning and lingering about the kitchen as if she were expecting the arrival of something and she had a small drawer in a cabinet in the library which she would trifle over for hours and whose key she took special care to remove when she left it 
 one day as she inspected this drawer i observed that the playthings and trinkets which recently formed its contents were transmuted into bits of folded paper my curiosity and suspicions were aroused i determined to take a peep at her mysterious treasures so at night as soon as she and my master were safe upstairs i searched and readily found among my house keys one that would fit the lock having opened i emptied the whole contents into my apron and took them with me to examine at leisure in my own chamber though i could not but suspect i was still surprised to discover that they were a mass of almost it must have linton heathcliff answers to documents forwarded by her the earlier dated were embarrassed and short gradually however they expanded into copious love letters foolish as the age of the writer rendered natural yet with touches here and there which i thought were borrowed from a more experienced source some of them struck me as singularly odd compounds of ardour and flatness commencing in strong feeling and concluding in the affected wordy way that a schoolboy might use to a fancied incorporeal sweetheart whether they satisfied cathy i know but they appeared very worthless trash to me after turning over as many as i thought proper i tied them in a handkerchief and set them aside relocking the vacant drawer 
 following her habit my young lady descended early and visited the kitchen i watched her go to the door on the arrival of a certain little boy and while the dairymaid filled his can she tucked something into his jacket pocket and plucked something out i went round by the garden and laid wait for the messenger who fought valorously to defend his trust and we spilt the milk between us but i succeeded in abstracting the epistle and threatening serious consequences if he did not look sharp home i remained under the wall and perused miss affectionate composition it was more simple and more eloquent than her very pretty and very silly i shook my head and went meditating into the house the day being wet she could not divert herself with rambling about the park so at the conclusion of her morning studies she resorted to the solace of the drawer her father sat reading at the table and i on purpose had sought a bit of work in some unripped fringes of the window curtain keeping my eye steadily fixed on her proceedings never did any bird flying back to a plundered nest which it had left brimful of chirping young ones express more complete despair in its anguished cries and flutterings than she by her single oh and the change that transfigured her late happy countenance mr linton looked up 
 what is the matter love have you hurt yourself he said 
 his tone and look assured her he had not been the discoverer of the hoard 
 no papa she gasped ellen ellen come sick i obeyed her summons and accompanied her out 
 oh ellen you have got them she commenced immediately dropping on her knees when we were enclosed alone oh give them to me and never never do so again tell papa you have not told papa ellen say you have not been exceedingly naughty but i do it any more 
 with a grave severity in my manner i bid her stand up 
 so i exclaimed miss catherine you are tolerably far on it seems you may well be ashamed of them a fine bundle of trash you study in your leisure hours to be sure why good enough to be printed and what do you suppose the master will think when i display it before him i shown it yet but you imagine i shall keep your ridiculous secrets for shame and you must have led the way in writing such absurdities he would not have thought of beginning certain 
 i i sobbed cathy fit to break her heart i once think of loving him till 
 loving cried i as scornfully as i could utter the word loving did anybody ever hear the like i might just as well talk of loving the miller who comes once a year to buy our corn pretty loving indeed and both times together you have seen linton hardly four hours in your life now here is the babyish trash going with it to the library and see what your father says to such loving 
 she sprang at her precious epistles but i held them above my head and then she poured out further frantic entreaties that i would burn anything rather than show them and being really fully as inclined to laugh as i esteemed it all girlish at length relented in a measure and asked 
 if i consent to burn them will you promise faithfully neither to send nor receive a letter again nor a book for i perceive you have sent him books nor locks of hair nor rings nor playthings 
 we send playthings cried catherine her pride overcoming her shame 
 nor anything at all then my lady i said unless you will here i go 
 i promise ellen she cried catching my dress oh put them in the fire do do 
 but when i proceeded to open a place with the poker the sacrifice was too painful to be borne she earnestly supplicated that i would spare her one or two 
 one or two ellen to keep for sake 
 i unknotted the handkerchief and commenced dropping them in from an angle and the flame curled up the chimney 
 i will have one you cruel wretch she screamed darting her hand into the fire and drawing forth some half consumed fragments at the expense of her fingers 
 very i will have some to exhibit to papa i answered shaking back the rest into the bundle and turning anew to the door 
 she emptied her blackened pieces into the flames and motioned me to finish the immolation it was done i stirred up the ashes and interred them under a shovelful of coals and she mutely and with a sense of intense injury retired to her private apartment i descended to tell my master that the young qualm of sickness was almost gone but i judged it best for her to lie down a while she dine but she reappeared at tea pale and red about the eyes and marvellously subdued in outward aspect next morning i answered the letter by a slip of paper inscribed master heathcliff is requested to send no more notes to miss linton as she will not receive them and thenceforth the little boy came with vacant pockets

 chapter 
 
 face was a study next day for the secret rather weighed upon her and she found it hard not to look mysterious and important meg observed it but did not trouble herself to make inquiries for she had learned that the best way to manage jo was by the law of contraries so she felt sure of being told everything if she did not ask she was rather surprised therefore when the silence remained unbroken and jo assumed a patronizing air which decidedly aggravated meg who in turn assumed an air of dignified reserve and devoted herself to her mother this left jo to her own devices for mrs march had taken her place as nurse and bade her rest exercise and amuse herself after her long confinement amy being gone laurie was her only refuge and much as she enjoyed his society she rather dreaded him just then for he was an incorrigible tease and she feared he would coax the secret from her 
 she was quite right for the lad no sooner suspected a mystery than he set himself to find it out and led jo a trying life of it he wheedled bribed ridiculed threatened and scolded affected indifference that he might surprise the truth from her declared her knew then that he care and at last by dint of perseverance he satisfied himself that it concerned meg and mr brooke feeling indignant that he was not taken into his confidence he set his wits to work to devise some proper retaliation for the slight 
 meg meanwhile had apparently forgotten the matter and was absorbed in preparations for her return but all of a sudden a change seemed to come over her and for a day or two she was quite unlike herself she started when spoken to blushed when looked at was very quiet and sat over her sewing with a timid troubled look on her face to her inquiries she answered that she was quite well and she silenced by begging to be let alone 
 she feels it in the i going very fast got most of the twittery and cross eat lies awake and mopes in corners i caught her singing that song he gave her and once she said john as you do and then turned as red as a poppy whatever shall we do said jo looking ready for any measures however violent 
 nothing but wait let her alone be kind and patient and coming will settle everything replied her mother 
 a note to you meg all sealed up how odd teddy never seals mine said jo next day as she distributed the contents of the little post office 
 mrs march and jo were deep in their own affairs when a sound from meg made them look up to see her staring at her note with a frightened face 
 my child what is it cried her mother running to her while jo tried to take the paper which had done the mischief 
 all a mistake he send it oh jo how could you do it and meg hid her face in her hands crying as if her heart were quite broken 
 me done nothing she talking about cried jo bewildered 
 mild eyes kindled with anger as she pulled a crumpled note from her pocket and threw it at jo saying reproachfully you wrote it and that bad boy helped you how could you be so rude so mean and cruel to us both 
 jo hardly heard her for she and her mother were reading the note which was written in a peculiar hand 
 
 my dearest margaret 
 i can no longer restrain my passion and must know my fate before i return i dare not tell your parents yet but i think they would consent if they knew that we adored one another mr laurence will help me to some good place and then my sweet girl you will make me happy i implore you to say nothing to your family yet but to send one word of hope through laurie to 
 your devoted john 
 oh the little villain the way he meant to pay me for keeping my word to mother give him a hearty scolding and bring him over to beg pardon cried jo burning to execute immediate justice but her mother held her back saying with a look she seldom wore 
 stop jo you must clear yourself first you have played so many pranks that i am afraid you have had a hand in this 
 on my word mother i i never saw that note before and know anything about it as true as i live said jo so earnestly that they believed her if i had taken part in it have done it better than this and have written a sensible note i should think have known mr brooke write such stuff as that she added scornfully tossing down the paper 
 like his writing faltered meg comparing it with the note in her hand oh meg you answer it cried mrs march quickly 
 yes i did and meg hid her face again overcome with shame 
 a scrape do let me bring that wicked boy over to explain and be lectured i rest till i get hold of him and jo made for the door again 
 hush let me handle this for it is worse than i thought margaret tell me the whole story commanded mrs march sitting down by meg yet keeping hold of jo lest she should fly off 
 i received the first letter from laurie who look as if he knew anything about it began meg without looking up i was worried at first and meant to tell you then i remembered how you liked mr brooke so i thought you mind if i kept my little secret for a few days so silly that i liked to think no one knew and while i was deciding what to say i felt like the girls in books who have such things to do forgive me mother paid for my silliness now i never can look him in the face again 
 what did you say to him asked mrs march 
 i only said i was too young to do anything about it yet that i wish to have secrets from you and he must speak to father i was very grateful for his kindness and would be his friend but nothing more for a long while 
 mrs march smiled as if well pleased and jo clapped her hands exclaiming with a laugh you are almost equal to caroline percy who was a pattern of prudence tell on meg what did he say to that 
 he writes in a different way entirely telling me that he never sent any love letter at all and is very sorry that my roguish sister jo should take liberties with our names very kind and respectful but think how dreadful for me 
 meg leaned against her mother looking the image of despair and jo tramped about the room calling laurie names all of a sudden she stopped caught up the two notes and after looking at them closely said decidedly i believe brooke ever saw either of these letters teddy wrote both and keeps yours to crow over me with because i tell him my secret 
 have any secrets jo tell it to mother and keep out of trouble as i should have done said meg warningly 
 bless you child mother told me 
 that will do jo comfort meg while you go and get laurie i shall sift the matter to the bottom and put a stop to such pranks at once away ran jo and mrs march gently told meg mr real feelings now dear what are your own do you love him enough to wait till her can make a home for you or will you keep yourself quite free for the present 
 been so scared and worried i want to have anything to do with lovers for a long while perhaps never 
 answered meg petulantly if john know anything about this nonsense tell him and make jo and laurie hold their tongues i be deceived and plagued and made a fool of a shame 
 seeing usually gentle temper was roused and her pride hurt by this mischievous joke mrs march soothed her by promises of entire silence and great discretion for the future the instant step was heard in the hall meg fled into the study and mrs march received the culprit alone jo had not told him why he was wanted fearing he come but he knew the minute he saw mrs face and stood twirling his hat with a guilty air which convicted him at once jo was dismissed but chose to march up and down the hall like a sentinel having some fear that the prisoner might bolt the sound of voices in the parlor rose and fell for half an hour but what happened during that interview the girls never knew 
 when they were called in laurie was standing by their mother with such a penitent face that jo forgave him on the spot but did not think it wise to betray the fact meg received his humble apology and was much comforted by the assurance that brooke knew nothing of the joke 
 never tell him to my dying day wild horses drag it out of me so forgive me meg and do anything to show how sorry i am he added looking very much ashamed of himself 
 try but it was a very ungentlemanly thing to do i think you could be so sly and malicious laurie replied meg trying to hid her maidenly confusion under a gravely reproachful air 
 it was altogether abominable and i deserve to be spoken to for a month but you will though you and laurie folded his hands together with such and imploring gesture as he spoke in his irresistibly persuasive tone that it was impossible to frown upon him in spite of his scandalous behavior 
 meg pardoned him and mrs grave face relaxed in spite of her efforts to keep sober when she heard him declare that he would atone for his sins by all sorts of penances and abase himself like a worm before the injured damsel 
 jo stood aloof meanwhile trying to harden her heart against him and succeeding only in primming up her face into an expression of entire disapprobation laurie looked at her once or twice but as she showed no sign of relenting he felt injured and turned his back on her till the others were done with him when he made her a low bow and walked off without a word 
 as soon as he had gone she wished she had been more forgiving and when meg and her mother went upstairs she felt lonely and longed for teddy after resisting for some time she yielded to the impulse and armed with a book to return went over to the big house 
 is mr laurence in asked jo of a housemaid who was coming downstairs 
 yes miss but i believe seeable just yet 
 why not is he ill 
 la no miss but had a scene with mr laurie who is in one of his tantrums about something which vexes the old gentleman so i go nigh him 
 where is laurie 
 shut up in his room and he answer though been i know to become of the dinner for ready and no one to eat it 
 go and see what the matter is not afraid of either of them 
 up went jo and knocked smartly on the door of little study 
 stop that or open the door and make you called out the young gentleman in a threatening tone 
 jo immediately knocked again the door flew open and in she bounced before laurie could recover from his surprise seeing that he really was out of temper jo who knew how to manage him assumed a contrite expression and going artistically down upon her knees said meekly please forgive me for being so cross i came to make it up and go away till i have 
 all right get up and be a goose jo was the cavalier reply to her petition 
 thank you i will could i ask the matter you look exactly easy in your mind 
 been shaken and i bear it growled laurie indignantly 
 who did it demanded jo 
 grandfather if it had been anyone else have 
 and the injured youth finished his sentence by an energetic gesture of the right arm 
 nothing i often shake you and you mind said jo soothingly 
 pooh a girl and fun but allow no man to shake me 
 i think anyone would care to try it if you looked as much like a thundercloud as you do now why were you treated so 
 just because i say what your mother wanted me for promised not to tell and of course i going to break my word 
 you satisfy your grandpa in any other way 
 no he would have the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth have told my part of the scrape if i could without bringing meg in as i i held my tongue and bore the scolding till the old gentleman collared me then i bolted for fear i should forget myself 
 it nice but sorry i know so go down and make up help you 
 hanged if i do not going to be lectured and pummelled by everyone just for a bit of a frolic i was sorry about meg and begged pardon like a man but i do it again when i in the wrong 
 he know that 
 he ought to trust me and not act as if i was a baby no use jo got to learn that able to take care of myself and need apron string to hold on by what pepper pots you are sighed jo how do you mean to settle this affair 
 well he ought to beg pardon and believe me when i say i tell him what the about 
 bless you he do that 
 i go down till he does 
 now teddy be sensible let it pass and explain what i can you stay here so the use of being melodramatic 
 i intend to stay here long anyway slip off and take a journey somewhere and when grandpa misses me come round fast enough 
 i dare say but you ought not to go and worry him 
 preach go to washington and see brooke gay there and enjoy myself after the troubles 
 what fun have i wish i could run off too said jo forgetting her part of mentor in lively visions of martial life at the capital 
 come on then why not you go and surprise your father and stir up old brooke it would be a glorious joke do it jo leave a letter saying we are all right and trot off at once got money enough it will do you good and no harm as you go to your father 
 for a moment jo looked as if she would agree for wild as the plan was it just suited her she was tired of care and confinement longed for change and thoughts of her father blended temptingly with the novel charms of camps and hospitals liberty and fun her eyes kindled as they turned wistfully toward the window but they fell on the old house opposite and she shook her head with sorrowful decision 
 if i was a boy run away together and have a capital time but as a miserable girl i must be proper and stop at home tempt me teddy a crazy plan 
 the fun of it began laurie who had got a willful fit on him and was possessed to break out of bounds in some way 
 hold your tongue cried jo covering her ears prunes and prisms are my doom and i may as well make up my mind to it i came here to moralize not to hear things that make me skip to think of 
 i know meg would such a proposal but i thought you had more spirit began laurie insinuatingly 
 bad boy be quiet sit down and think of your own sins go making me add to mine if i get your grandpa to apologize for the shaking will you give up running away asked jo seriously 
 yes but you do it answered laurie who wished to make up but felt that his outraged dignity must be appeased first 
 if i can manage the young one i can the old one muttered jo as she walked away leaving laurie bent over a railroad map with his head propped up on both hands 
 come in and mr gruff voice sounded gruffer than ever as jo tapped at his door 
 only me sir come to return a book she said blandly as she entered 
 want any more asked the old gentleman looking grim and vexed but trying not to show it 
 yes please i like old sam so well i think try the second volume returned jo hoping to propitiate him by accepting a second dose of johnson as he had recommended that lively work 
 the shaggy eyebrows unbent a little as he rolled the steps toward the shelf where the johnsonian literature was placed jo skipped up and sitting on the top step affected to be searching for her book but was really wondering how best to introduce the dangerous object of her visit mr laurence seemed to suspect that something was brewing in her mind for after taking several brisk turns about the room he faced round on her speaking so abruptly that rasselas tumbled face downward on the floor 
 what has that boy been about try to shield him i know he has been in mischief by the way he acted when he came home i get a word from him and when i threatened to shake the truth out of him he bolted upstairs and locked himself into his room 
 he did wrong but we forgave him and all promised not to say a word to anyone began jo reluctantly 
 that do he shall not shelter himself behind a promise from you softhearted girls if done anything amiss he shall confess beg pardon and be punished out with it jo i be kept in the dark 
 mr laurence looked so alarming and spoke so sharply that jo would have gladly run away if she could but she was perched aloft on the steps and he stood at the foot a lion in the path so she had to stay and brave it out 
 indeed sir i cannot tell mother forbade it laurie has confessed asked pardon and been punished quite enough we keep silence to shield him but someone else and it will make more trouble if you interfere please it was partly my fault but all right now so forget it and talk about the rambler or something pleasant 
 hang the rambler come down and give me your word that this boy of mine done anything ungrateful or impertinent if he has after all your kindness to him thrash him with my own hands 
 the threat sounded awful but did not alarm jo for she knew the irascible old gentleman would never lift a finger against his grandson whatever he might say to the contrary she obediently descended and made as light of the prank as she could without betraying meg or forgetting the truth 
 hum ha well if the boy held his tongue because he promised and not from obstinacy forgive him a stubborn fellow and hard to manage said mr laurence rubbing up his hair till it looked as if he had been out in a gale and smoothing the frown from his brow with an air of relief 
 so am i but a kind word will govern me when all the horses and all the men said jo trying to say a kind word for her friend who seemed to get out of one scrape only to fall into another 
 you think not kind to him hey was the sharp answer 
 oh dear no sir you are rather too kind sometimes and then just a trifle hasty when he tries your patience you think you are 
 jo was determined to have it out now and tried to look quite placid though she quaked a little after her bold speech 
 to her great relief and surprise the old gentleman only threw his spectacles onto the table with a rattle and exclaimed frankly right girl i am i love the boy but he tries my patience past bearing and i know how it will end if we go on so 
 tell you run away jo was sorry for that speech the minute it was made she meant to warn him that laurie would not bear much restraint and hoped he would be more forebearing with the lad 
 mr ruddy face changed suddenly and he sat down with a troubled glance at the picture of a handsome man which hung over his table it was father who had run away in his youth and married against the imperious old will jo fancied her remembered and regretted the past and she wished she had held her tongue 
 he do it unless he is very much worried and only threatens it sometimes when he gets tired of studying i often think i should like to especially since my hair was cut so if you ever miss us you may advertise for two boys and look among the ships bound for india 
 she laughed as she spoke and mr laurence looked relieved evidently taking the whole as a joke 
 you hussy how dare you talk in that way your respect for me and your proper bringing up bless the boys and girls what torments they are yet we do without them he said pinching her cheeks go and bring that boy down to his dinner tell him all right and advise him not to put on tragedy airs with his grandfather i bear it 
 he come sir he feels badly because you believe him when he said he tell i think the shaking hurt his feelings very much 
 jo tried to look pathetic but must have failed for mr laurence began to laugh and she knew the day was won 
 sorry for that and ought to thank him for not shaking me i suppose what the dickens does the fellow expect and the old gentleman looked a trifle ashamed of his own testiness 
 if i were you write him an apology sir he says he come down till he has one and talks about washington and goes on in an absurd way a formal apology will make him see how foolish he is and bring him down quite amiable try it he likes fun and this was is better than talking carry it up and teach him his duty 
 mr laurence gave her a sharp look and put on his spectacles saying slowly a sly puss but i mind being managed by you and beth here give me a bit of paper and let us have done with this nonsense 
 the note was written in the terms which one gentleman would use to another after offering some deep insult jo dropped a kiss on the top of mr bald head and ran up to slip the apology under door advising him through the keyhole to be submissive decorous and a few other agreeable impossibilities finding the door locked again she left the note to do its work and was going quietly away when the young gentleman slid down the banisters and waited for her at the bottom saying with his most virtuous expression of countenance what a good fellow you are jo did you get blown up he added laughing 
 no he was pretty mild on the whole 
 ah i got it all round even you cast me off over there and i felt just ready to go to the deuce he began apologetically 
 talk that way turn over a new leaf and begin again teddy my son 
 i keep turning over new leaves and spoiling them as i used to spoil my copybooks and i make so many beginnings there never will be an end he said dolefully 
 go and eat your dinner feel better after it men always croak when they are hungry and jo whisked out at the front door after that 
 a label on my sect answered laurie quoting amy as he went to partake of humble pie dutifully with his grandfather who was quite saintly in temper and overwhelmingly respectful in manner all the rest of the day 
 everyone thought the matter ended and the little cloud blown over but the mischief was done for though others forgot it meg remembered she never alluded to a certain person but she thought of him a good deal dreamed dreams more than ever and once jo rummaging her desk for stamps found a bit of paper scribbled over with the words mrs john brooke whereat she groaned tragically and cast it into the fire feeling that prank had hastened the evil day for her

 mild eyes kindled with anger as she pulled a crumpled note from her pocket and threw it at jo saying reproachfully you wrote it and that bad boy helped you how could you be so rude so mean and cruel to us both 
 jo hardly heard her for she and her mother were reading the note which was written in a peculiar hand 
 
 my dearest margaret 
 i can no longer restrain my passion and must know my fate before i return i dare not tell your parents yet but i think they would consent if they knew that we adored one another mr laurence will help me to some good place and then my sweet girl you will make me happy i implore you to say nothing to your family yet but to send one word of hope through laurie to 
 your devoted john 
 oh the little villain the way he meant to pay me for keeping my word to mother give him a hearty scolding and bring him over to beg pardon cried jo burning to execute immediate justice but her mother held her back saying with a look she seldom wore 
 stop jo you must clear yourself first you have played so many pranks that i am afraid you have had a hand in this 
 on my word mother i i never saw that note before and know anything about it as true as i live said jo so earnestly that they believed her if i had taken part in it have done it better than this and have written a sensible note i should think have known mr brooke write such stuff as that she added scornfully tossing down the paper 
 like his writing faltered meg comparing it with the note in her hand oh meg you answer it cried mrs march quickly 
 yes i did and meg hid her face again overcome with shame 
 a scrape do let me bring that wicked boy over to explain and be lectured i rest till i get hold of him and jo made for the door again 
 hush let me handle this for it is worse than i thought margaret tell me the whole story commanded mrs march sitting down by meg yet keeping hold of jo lest she should fly off 
 i received the first letter from laurie who look as if he knew anything about it began meg without looking up i was worried at first and meant to tell you then i remembered how you liked mr brooke so i thought you mind if i kept my little secret for a few days so silly that i liked to think no one knew and while i was deciding what to say i felt like the girls in books who have such things to do forgive me mother paid for my silliness now i never can look him in the face again 
 what did you say to him asked mrs march 
 i only said i was too young to do anything about it yet that i wish to have secrets from you and he must speak to father i was very grateful for his kindness and would be his friend but nothing more for a long while 
 mrs march smiled as if well pleased and jo clapped her hands exclaiming with a laugh you are almost equal to caroline percy who was a pattern of prudence tell on meg what did he say to that 
 he writes in a different way entirely telling me that he never sent any love letter at all and is very sorry that my roguish sister jo should take liberties with our names very kind and respectful but think how dreadful for me 
 meg leaned against her mother looking the image of despair and jo tramped about the room calling laurie names all of a sudden she stopped caught up the two notes and after looking at them closely said decidedly i believe brooke ever saw either of these letters teddy wrote both and keeps yours to crow over me with because i tell him my secret 
 have any secrets jo tell it to mother and keep out of trouble as i should have done said meg warningly 
 bless you child mother told me 
 that will do jo comfort meg while you go and get laurie i shall sift the matter to the bottom and put a stop to such pranks at once away ran jo and mrs march gently told meg mr real feelings now dear what are your own do you love him enough to wait till her can make a home for you or will you keep yourself quite free for the present 
 been so scared and worried i want to have anything to do with lovers for a long while perhaps never 
 answered meg petulantly if john know anything about this nonsense tell him and make jo and laurie hold their tongues i be deceived and plagued and made a fool of a shame 
 seeing usually gentle temper was roused and her pride hurt by this mischievous joke mrs march soothed her by promises of entire silence and great discretion for the future the instant step was heard in the hall meg fled into the study and mrs march received the culprit alone jo had not told him why he was wanted fearing he come but he knew the minute he saw mrs face and stood twirling his hat with a guilty air which convicted him at once jo was dismissed but chose to march up and down the hall like a sentinel having some fear that the prisoner might bolt the sound of voices in the parlor rose and fell for half an hour but what happened during that interview the girls never knew 
 when they were called in laurie was standing by their mother with such a penitent face that jo forgave him on the spot but did not think it wise to betray the fact meg received his humble apology and was much comforted by the assurance that brooke knew nothing of the joke 
 never tell him to my dying day wild horses drag it out of me so forgive me meg and do anything to show how sorry i am he added looking very much ashamed of himself 
 try but it was a very ungentlemanly thing to do i think you could be so sly and malicious laurie replied meg trying to hid her maidenly confusion under a gravely reproachful air 
 it was altogether abominable and i deserve to be spoken to for a month but you will though you and laurie folded his hands together with such and imploring gesture as he spoke in his irresistibly persuasive tone that it was impossible to frown upon him in spite of his scandalous behavior 
 meg pardoned him and mrs grave face relaxed in spite of her efforts to keep sober when she heard him declare that he would atone for his sins by all sorts of penances and abase himself like a worm before the injured damsel 
 jo stood aloof meanwhile trying to harden her heart against him and succeeding only in primming up her face into an expression of entire disapprobation laurie looked at her once or twice but as she showed no sign of relenting he felt injured and turned his back on her till the others were done with him when he made her a low bow and walked off without a word 
 as soon as he had gone she wished she had been more forgiving and when meg and her mother went upstairs she felt lonely and longed for teddy after resisting for some time she yielded to the impulse and armed with a book to return went over to the big house 
 is mr laurence in asked jo of a housemaid who was coming downstairs 
 yes miss but i believe seeable just yet 
 why not is he ill 
 la no miss but had a scene with mr laurie who is in one of his tantrums about something which vexes the old gentleman so i go nigh him 
 where is laurie 
 shut up in his room and he answer though been i know to become of the dinner for ready and no one to eat it 
 go and see what the matter is not afraid of either of them 
 up went jo and knocked smartly on the door of little study 
 stop that or open the door and make you called out the young gentleman in a threatening tone 
 jo immediately knocked again the door flew open and in she bounced before laurie could recover from his surprise seeing that he really was out of temper jo who knew how to manage him assumed a contrite expression and going artistically down upon her knees said meekly please forgive me for being so cross i came to make it up and go away till i have 
 all right get up and be a goose jo was the cavalier reply to her petition 
 thank you i will could i ask the matter you look exactly easy in your mind 
 been shaken and i bear it growled laurie indignantly 
 who did it demanded jo 
 grandfather if it had been anyone else have 
 and the injured youth finished his sentence by an energetic gesture of the right arm 
 nothing i often shake you and you mind said jo soothingly 
 pooh a girl and fun but allow no man to shake me 
 i think anyone would care to try it if you looked as much like a thundercloud as you do now why were you treated so 
 just because i say what your mother wanted me for promised not to tell and of course i going to break my word 
 you satisfy your grandpa in any other way 
 no he would have the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth have told my part of the scrape if i could without bringing meg in as i i held my tongue and bore the scolding till the old gentleman collared me then i bolted for fear i should forget myself 
 it nice but sorry i know so go down and make up help you 
 hanged if i do not going to be lectured and pummelled by everyone just for a bit of a frolic i was sorry about meg and begged pardon like a man but i do it again when i in the wrong 
 he know that 
 he ought to trust me and not act as if i was a baby no use jo got to learn that able to take care of myself and need apron string to hold on by what pepper pots you are sighed jo how do you mean to settle this affair 
 well he ought to beg pardon and believe me when i say i tell him what the about 
 bless you he do that 
 i go down till he does 
 now teddy be sensible let it pass and explain what i can you stay here so the use of being melodramatic 
 i intend to stay here long anyway slip off and take a journey somewhere and when grandpa misses me come round fast enough 
 i dare say but you ought not to go and worry him 
 preach go to washington and see brooke gay there and enjoy myself after the troubles 
 what fun have i wish i could run off too said jo forgetting her part of mentor in lively visions of martial life at the capital 
 come on then why not you go and surprise your father and stir up old brooke it would be a glorious joke do it jo leave a letter saying we are all right and trot off at once got money enough it will do you good and no harm as you go to your father 
 for a moment jo looked as if she would agree for wild as the plan was it just suited her she was tired of care and confinement longed for change and thoughts of her father blended temptingly with the novel charms of camps and hospitals liberty and fun her eyes kindled as they turned wistfully toward the window but they fell on the old house opposite and she shook her head with sorrowful decision 
 if i was a boy run away together and have a capital time but as a miserable girl i must be proper and stop at home tempt me teddy a crazy plan 
 the fun of it began laurie who had got a willful fit on him and was possessed to break out of bounds in some way 
 hold your tongue cried jo covering her ears prunes and prisms are my doom and i may as well make up my mind to it i came here to moralize not to hear things that make me skip to think of 
 i know meg would such a proposal but i thought you had more spirit began laurie insinuatingly 
 bad boy be quiet sit down and think of your own sins go making me add to mine if i get your grandpa to apologize for the shaking will you give up running away asked jo seriously 
 yes but you do it answered laurie who wished to make up but felt that his outraged dignity must be appeased first 
 if i can manage the young one i can the old one muttered jo as she walked away leaving laurie bent over a railroad map with his head propped up on both hands 
 come in and mr gruff voice sounded gruffer than ever as jo tapped at his door 
 only me sir come to return a book she said blandly as she entered 
 want any more asked the old gentleman looking grim and vexed but trying not to show it 
 yes please i like old sam so well i think try the second volume returned jo hoping to propitiate him by accepting a second dose of johnson as he had recommended that lively work 
 the shaggy eyebrows unbent a little as he rolled the steps toward the shelf where the johnsonian literature was placed jo skipped up and sitting on the top step affected to be searching for her book but was really wondering how best to introduce the dangerous object of her visit mr laurence seemed to suspect that something was brewing in her mind for after taking several brisk turns about the room he faced round on her speaking so abruptly that rasselas tumbled face downward on the floor 
 what has that boy been about try to shield him i know he has been in mischief by the way he acted when he came home i get a word from him and when i threatened to shake the truth out of him he bolted upstairs and locked himself into his room 
 he did wrong but we forgave him and all promised not to say a word to anyone began jo reluctantly 
 that do he shall not shelter himself behind a promise from you softhearted girls if done anything amiss he shall confess beg pardon and be punished out with it jo i be kept in the dark 
 mr laurence looked so alarming and spoke so sharply that jo would have gladly run away if she could but she was perched aloft on the steps and he stood at the foot a lion in the path so she had to stay and brave it out 
 indeed sir i cannot tell mother forbade it laurie has confessed asked pardon and been punished quite enough we keep silence to shield him but someone else and it will make more trouble if you interfere please it was partly my fault but all right now so forget it and talk about the rambler or something pleasant 
 hang the rambler come down and give me your word that this boy of mine done anything ungrateful or impertinent if he has after all your kindness to him thrash him with my own hands 
 the threat sounded awful but did not alarm jo for she knew the irascible old gentleman would never lift a finger against his grandson whatever he might say to the contrary she obediently descended and made as light of the prank as she could without betraying meg or forgetting the truth 
 hum ha well if the boy held his tongue because he promised and not from obstinacy forgive him a stubborn fellow and hard to manage said mr laurence rubbing up his hair till it looked as if he had been out in a gale and smoothing the frown from his brow with an air of relief 
 so am i but a kind word will govern me when all the horses and all the men said jo trying to say a kind word for her friend who seemed to get out of one scrape only to fall into another 
 you think not kind to him hey was the sharp answer 
 oh dear no sir you are rather too kind sometimes and then just a trifle hasty when he tries your patience you think you are 
 jo was determined to have it out now and tried to look quite placid though she quaked a little after her bold speech 
 to her great relief and surprise the old gentleman only threw his spectacles onto the table with a rattle and exclaimed frankly right girl i am i love the boy but he tries my patience past bearing and i know how it will end if we go on so 
 tell you run away jo was sorry for that speech the minute it was made she meant to warn him that laurie would not bear much restraint and hoped he would be more forebearing with the lad 
 mr ruddy face changed suddenly and he sat down with a troubled glance at the picture of a handsome man which hung over his table it was father who had run away in his youth and married against the imperious old will jo fancied her remembered and regretted the past and she wished she had held her tongue 
 he do it unless he is very much worried and only threatens it sometimes when he gets tired of studying i often think i should like to especially since my hair was cut so if you ever miss us you may advertise for two boys and look among the ships bound for india 
 she laughed as she spoke and mr laurence looked relieved evidently taking the whole as a joke 
 you hussy how dare you talk in that way your respect for me and your proper bringing up bless the boys and girls what torments they are yet we do without them he said pinching her cheeks go and bring that boy down to his dinner tell him all right and advise him not to put on tragedy airs with his grandfather i bear it 
 he come sir he feels badly because you believe him when he said he tell i think the shaking hurt his feelings very much 
 jo tried to look pathetic but must have failed for mr laurence began to laugh and she knew the day was won 
 sorry for that and ought to thank him for not shaking me i suppose what the dickens does the fellow expect and the old gentleman looked a trifle ashamed of his own testiness 
 if i were you write him an apology sir he says he come down till he has one and talks about washington and goes on in an absurd way a formal apology will make him see how foolish he is and bring him down quite amiable try it he likes fun and this was is better than talking carry it up and teach him his duty 
 mr laurence gave her a sharp look and put on his spectacles saying slowly a sly puss but i mind being managed by you and beth here give me a bit of paper and let us have done with this nonsense 
 the note was written in the terms which one gentleman would use to another after offering some deep insult jo dropped a kiss on the top of mr bald head and ran up to slip the apology under door advising him through the keyhole to be submissive decorous and a few other agreeable impossibilities finding the door locked again she left the note to do its work and was going quietly away when the young gentleman slid down the banisters and waited for her at the bottom saying with his most virtuous expression of countenance what a good fellow you are jo did you get blown up he added laughing 
 no he was pretty mild on the whole 
 ah i got it all round even you cast me off over there and i felt just ready to go to the deuce he began apologetically 
 talk that way turn over a new leaf and begin again teddy my son 
 i keep turning over new leaves and spoiling them as i used to spoil my copybooks and i make so many beginnings there never will be an end he said dolefully 
 go and eat your dinner feel better after it men always croak when they are hungry and jo whisked out at the front door after that 
 a label on my sect answered laurie quoting amy as he went to partake of humble pie dutifully with his grandfather who was quite saintly in temper and overwhelmingly respectful in manner all the rest of the day 
 everyone thought the matter ended and the little cloud blown over but the mischief was done for though others forgot it meg remembered she never alluded to a certain person but she thought of him a good deal dreamed dreams more than ever and once jo rummaging her desk for stamps found a bit of paper scribbled over with the words mrs john brooke whereat she groaned tragically and cast it into the fire feeling that prank had hastened the evil day for her

lionfish nov chapter secretcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 shocking business shocking miracle none of them died never heard the like by thunder it was lucky you were there snape 
 
 thank you minister 
 
 order of merlin second class say first class if i can wangle it 
 
 thank you very much indeed minister 
 
 nasty cut got there work i suppose 
 
 as a matter of fact it was potter weasley and granger minister 
 
 no 
 
 black had bewitched them i saw it immediately a confundus charm to judge by their behavior they seemed to think there was a possibility he was innocent they responsible for their actions on the other hand their interference might have permitted black to escape they obviously thought they were going to catch black got away with a great deal before now afraid given them a rather high opinion of themselves and of course potter has always been allowed an extraordinary amount of license by the headmaster 
 
 ah well snape harry potter you know all got a bit of a blind spot where concerned 
 
 and yet is it good for him to be given so much special treatment personally i try and treat him like any other student and any other student would be suspended at the very least for leading his friends into such danger consider minister against all school rules after all the precautions put in place for his protection at night consorting with a werewolf and a murderer and i have reason to believe he has been visiting hogsmeade illegally too 
 
 well well we shall see snape we shall see the boy has undoubtedly been foolish 
 
 harry lay listening with his eyes tight shut he felt very groggy the words he was hearing seemed to be traveling very slowly from his ears to his brain so that it was difficult to understand his limbs felt like lead his eyelids too heavy to lift he wanted to lie here on this comfortable bed forever 
 
 what amazes me most is the behavior of the dementors really no idea what made them retreat snape 
 
 no minister by the time i had come round they were heading back to their positions at the entrances 
 
 extraordinary and yet black and harry and the girl 
 
 all unconscious by the time i reached them i bound and gagged black naturally conjured stretchers and brought them all straight back to the castle 
 
 there was a pause brain seemed to be moving a little faster and as it did a gnawing sensation grew in the pit of his stomach 
 
 he opened his eyes 
 
 everything was slightly blurred somebody had removed his glasses he was lying in the dark hospital wing at the very end of the ward he could make out madam pomfrey with her back to him bending over a bed harry squinted red hair was visible beneath madam arm 
 
 harry moved his head over on the pillow in the bed to his right lay hermione moonlight was falling across her bed her eyes were open too she looked petrified and when she saw that harry was awake pressed a finger to her lips then pointed to the hospital wing door it was ajar and the voices of cornelius fudge and snape were coming through it from the corridor outside 
 
 madam pomfrey now came walking briskly up the dark ward to bed he turned to took at her she was carrying the largest block of chocolate he had ever seen in his life it looked like a small boulder 
 
 ah awake she said briskly she placed the chocolate on bedside table and began breaking it apart with a small hammer 
 
 ron said harry and hermione together 
 
 live said madam pomfrey grimly as for you two be staying here until satisfied potter what do you think doing 
 
 harry was sitting up putting his glasses back on and picking up his wand 
 
 i need to see the headmaster he said 
 
 potter said madam pomfrey soothingly all right got black locked away upstairs the dementors will be performing the kiss any moment now 
 
 what 
 
 harry jumped up out of bed hermione had done the same but his shout had been heard in the corridor outside next second cornelius fudge and snape had entered the ward 
 
 harry harry this said fudge looking agitated you should be in bed has he had any chocolate he asked madam pomfrey anxiously 
 
 minister listen harry said sirius innocent peter pettigrew faked his own death we saw him tonight you let the dementors do that thing to sirius 
 
 but fudge was shaking his head with a small smile on his face 
 
 harry harry very confused been through a dreadful ordeal lie back down now got everything under control 
 
 you harry yelled got the wrong man 
 
 minister listen please hermione said she had hurried to side and was gazing imploringly into face i saw him too it was rat an animagus pettigrew i mean and 
 
 you see minister said snape confunded both of them done a very good job on them 
 
 not confunded harry roared 
 
 minister professor said madam pomfrey angrily i must insist that you leave potter is my patient and he should not be distressed 
 
 not distressed trying to tell them what happened harry said furiously if just listen 
 
 but madam pomfrey suddenly stuffed a large chunk of chocolate into harrys mouth he choked and she seized the opportunity to force him back onto the bed 
 
 now please minister these children need care please leave 
 
 the door opened again it was dumbledore harry swallowed his mouthful of chocolate with great difficulty and got up again 
 
 professor dumbledore sirius black 
 
 for sake said madam pomfrey hysterically is this a hospital wing or not headmaster i must insist 
 
 my apologies poppy but i need a word with mr potter and miss granger said dumbledore calmly i have just been talking to sirius black 
 
 i suppose told you the same fairy tale planted in mind spat snape something about a rat and pettigrew being alive 
 
 that indeed is story said dumbledore surveying snape closely through his spectacles 
 
 and does my evidence count for nothing snarled snape peter pettigrew was not in the shrieking shack nor did i see any sign of him on the grounds 
 
 that was because you were knocked out professor said hermione earnestly you arrive in time to hear 
 
 miss granger hold your tongue 
 
 now snape said fudge startled the young lady is disturbed in her mind we must make allowances 
 
 i would like to speak to harry and hermione alone said dumbledore abruptly cornelius severus poppy please leave us 
 
 headmaster sputtered madam pomfrey they need treatment they need rest 
 
 this cannot wait said dumbledore i must insist 
 
 madam pomfrey pursed her lips and strode away into her office at the end of the ward slamming the door behind her fudge consulted the large gold pocket watch dangling from his waistcoat 
 
 the dementors should have arrived by now he said go and meet them dumbledore see you upstairs 
 
 he crossed to the door and held it open for snape but snape moved 
 
 you surely believe a word of story snape whispered his eyes fixed on face 
 
 i wish to speak to harry and hermione alone dumbledore repeated 
 
 snape took a step toward dumbledore 
 
 sirius black showed he was capable of murder at the age of sixteen he breathed you forgotten that headmaster you forgotten that he once tried to kill me 
 
 my memory is as good as it ever was severus said dumbledore quietly 
 
 snape turned on his heel and marched through the door fudge was still holding it closed behind them and dumbledore turned to harry and hermione they both burst into speech at the same time 
 
 professor telling the truth we saw pettigrew he escaped when professor lupin turned into a werewolf 
 
 a rat 
 
 front paw i mean finger he cut it off 
 
 pettigrew attacked ron it sirius 
 
 but dumbledore held up his hand to stem the flood of explanations 
 
 it is your turn to listen and i beg you will not interrupt me because there is very little time he said quietly there is not a shred of proof to support story except your word and the word of two wizards will not convince anybody a street full of eyewitnesses swore they saw sirius murder pettigrew i myself gave evidence to the ministry that sirius had been the potters 
 
 professor lupin can tell you harry said unable to stop himself 
 
 professor lupin is currently deep in the forest unable to tell anyone anything by the time he is human again it will be too late sirius will be worse than dead i might add that werewolves are so mistrusted by most of our kind that his support will count for very little and the fact that he and sirius are old friends 
 
 but 
 
 listen to me harry it is too late you understand me you must see that professor version of events is far more convincing than yours 
 
 he hates sirius hermione said desperately all because of some stupid trick sirius played on him 
 
 sirius has not acted like an innocent man the attack on the fat lady entering gryffindor tower with a knife without pettigrew alive or dead we have no chance of overturning sentence 
 
 but you believe us 
 
 yes i do said dumbledore quietly but i have no power to make other men see the truth or to overrule the minister of magic 
 
 harry stared up into the grave face and felt as though the ground beneath him were falling sharply away he had grown used to the idea that dumbledore could solve anything he had expected dumbledore to pull some amazing solution out of the air but no their last hope was gone 
 
 what we need said dumbledore slowly and his light blue eyes moved from harry to hermione is more time 
 
 but hermione began and then her eyes became very round oh 
 
 now pay attention said dumbledore speaking very low and very clearly sirius is locked in professor office on the seventh floor thirteenth window from the right of the west tower if all goes well you will be able to save more than one innocent life tonight but remember this both of you you must not be seen miss granger you know the law you know what is at stakeyou must not be seen 
 
 harry have a clue what was going on dumbledore had turned on his heel and looked back as he reached the door 
 
 i am going to lock you in it is he consulted his watch five minutes to midnight miss granger three turns should do it good luck 
 
 good luck harry repeated as the door closed behind dumbledore three turns he talking about what are we supposed to do 
 
 but hermione was fumbling with the neck of her robes pulling from beneath them a very long very fine gold chain 
 
 harry come here she said urgently quick 
 
 harry moved toward her completely bewildered she was holding the chain out he saw a tiny sparkling hourglass hanging from it 
 
 here 
 
 she had thrown the chain around his neck too 
 
 ready she said breathlessly 
 
 what are we doing harry said completely lost 
 
 hermione turned the hourglass over three times 
 
 the dark ward dissolved harry had the sensation that he was flying very fast backward a blur of colors and shapes rushed past him his ears were pounding he tried to yell but hear his own voice 
 
 and then he felt solid ground beneath his feet and everything came into focus again 
 
 he was standing next to hermione in the deserted entrance hall and a stream of golden sunlight was falling across the paved floor from the open front doors he looked wildly around at hermione the chain of the hourglass cutting into his neck 
 
 hermione what 
 
 in here hermione seized arm and dragged him across the hall to the door of a broom closet she opened it pushed him inside among the buckets and mops then slammed the door behind them 
 
 what how hermione what happened 
 
 gone back in time hermione whispered lifting the chain off neck in the darkness three hours back 
 
 harry found his own leg and gave it a very hard pinch it hurt a lot which seemed to rule out the possibility that he was having a very bizarre dream 
 
 but 
 
 shh listen coming i think i think it might be us hermione had her ear pressed against the cupboard door 
 
 footsteps across the hall yes i think us going down to 
 
 are you telling me harry whispered that here in this cupboard and out there too 
 
 yes said hermione her ear still glued to the cupboard door sure us it sound like more than three people and walking slowly because under the invisibility cloak 
 
 she broke off still listening intently 
 
 gone down the front steps 
 
 hermione sat down on an upturned bucket looking desperately anxious but harry wanted a few questions answered 
 
 where did you get that hourglass thing 
 
 called a hermione whispered and i got it from professor mcgonagall on our first day back been using it all year to get to all my lessons professor mcgonagall made me swear i tell anyone she had to write all sorts of letters to the ministry of magic so i could have one she had to tell them that i was a model student and that never ever use it for anything except my studies been turning it back so i could do hours over again how been doing several lessons at once see but 
 
 harry i understand what dumbledore wants us to do why did he tell us to go back three hours that going to help sirius 
 
 harry stared at her shadowy face 
 
 there must be something that happened around now he wants us to change he said slowly what happened we were walking down to three hours ago 
 
 this is three hours ago and we are walking down to said hermione we just heard ourselves leaving 
 
 harry frowned he felt as though he were screwing up his whole brain in concentration 
 
 dumbledore just said just said we could save more than one innocent life and then it hit him hermione going to save buckbeak 
 
 but how will that help sirius 
 
 dumbledore said he just told us where the window is the window of office where got sirius locked up got to fly buckbeak up to the window and rescue sirius sirius can escape on buckbeak they can escape together 
 
 from what harry could see of face she looked terrified 
 
 if we manage that without being seen be a miracle 
 
 well got to try we said harry he stood up andvpressed his ear against the door sound like there come on go 
 
 harry pushed open the closet door the entrance hall was deserted as quietly and quickly as they could they darted out of the closet and down the stone steps the shadows were already lengthening the tops of the trees in the forbidden forest gilded once more with gold 
 
 if looking out of the window hermione squeaked looking up at the castle behind them 
 
 run for it said harry determinedly straight into the forest all right have to hide behind a tree or something and keep a lookout 
 
 okay but go around by the greenhouses said hermione breathlessly we need to keep out of sight of front door or see us we must be nearly at by now 
 
 still working out what she meant harry set off at a sprint hermione behind him they tore across the vegetable gardens to the greenhouses paused for a moment behind them then set off again fast as they could skirting around the whomping willow tearing toward the shelter of the forest 
 
 safe in the shadows of the trees harry turned around seconds later hermione arrived beside him panting 
 
 right she gasped we need to sneak over to keep out of sight harry 
 
 they made their way silently through the trees keeping to the very edge of the forest then as they glimpsed the front of house they heard a knock upon his door they moved quickly behind a wide oak trunk and peered out from either side hagrid had appeared in his doorway shaking and white looking around to see who had knocked and harry heard his own voice 
 
 us wearing the invisibility cloak let us in and we can take it off 
 
 yeh come hagrid whispered he stood back then shut the door quickly 
 
 this is the weirdest thing ever done harry said fervently 
 
 move along a bit hermione whispered we need to get nearer to buckbeak 
 
 they crept through the trees until they saw the nervous hippogriff tethered to the fence around pumpkin patch 
 
 now harry whispered 
 
 no said hermione if we steal him now those committee people will think hagrid set him free got to wait until seen tied outside 
 
 going to give us about sixty seconds said harry this was starting to seem impossible 
 
 at that moment there was a crash of breaking china from inside cabin 
 
 hagrid breaking the milk jug hermione whispered going to find scabbers in a moment 
 
 sure enough a few minutes later they heard shriek of surprise 
 
 hermione said harry suddenly what if we we just run in there and grab pettigrew 
 
 no said hermione in a terrified whisper you understand breaking one of the most important wizarding laws supposed to change time nobody you heard dumbledore if seen 
 
 only be seen by ourselves and hagrid 
 
 harry what do you think do if you saw yourself bursting into house said hermione 
 
 think gone mad said harry or think there was some dark magic going on 
 
 exactly you understand you might even attack yourself you see professor mcgonagall told me what awful things have happened when wizards have meddled with time loads of them ended up killing their past or future selves by mistake 
 
 okay said harry it was just an idea i just thought 
 
 but hermione nudged him and pointed toward the castle harry moved his head a few inches to get a clear view of the distant front doors dumbledore fudge the old committee member and macnair the executioner were coming down the steps 
 
 about to come out hermione breathed 
 
 and sure enough moments later back door opened and harry saw himself ron and hermione walking out of it with hagrid it was without a doubt the strangest sensation of his life standing behind the tree and watching himself in the pumpkin patch 
 
 okay beaky okay hagrid said to buckbeak then he turned to harry ron and hermione go on get goin 
 
 hagrid we 
 
 tell them what really happened 
 
 they kill him 
 
 go bad enough without you lot in trouble an all 
 
 harry watched the hermione in the pumpkin patch throw the invisibility cloak over him and ron 
 
 go quick don listen 
 
 there was a knock on front door the execution party had arrived hagrid turned around and headed back into his cabin leaving the back door ajar harry watched the grass flatten in patches all around the cabin and heard three pairs of feet retreating he ron and hermione had gone but the harry and hermione hidden in the trees could now hear what was happening inside the cabin through the back door 
 
 where is the beast came the cold voice of macnair 
 
 out outside hagrid croaked 
 
 harry pulled his head out of sight as face appeared at window staring out at buckbeak then they heard fudge 
 
 we er have to read you the official notice of execution hagrid make it quick and then you and macnair need to sign it macnair supposed to listen too procedure 
 
 face vanished from the window it was now or never 
 
 wait here harry whispered to hermione do it 
 
 as voice started again harry darted out from behind his tree vaulted the fence into the pumpkin patch and approached buckbeak 
 
 it is the decision of the committee for the disposal of dangerous creatures that the hippogriff buckbeak hereafter called the condemned shall he executed on the sixth of june at sundown 
 
 careful not to blink harry stared up into fierce orange eyes once more and bowed buckbeak sank to his scaly knees and then stood up again harry began to fumble with the knot of rope tying buckbeak to the fence 
 
 sentenced to execution by beheading to be carried out by the appointed executioner walden macnair 
 
 come on buckbeak harry murmured come on going to help you quietly quietly 
 
 as witnessed below hagrid you sign here 
 
 harry threw all his weight onto the rope but buckbeak had dug in his front feet 
 
 well get this over with said the reedy voice of the committee member from inside cabin hagrid perhaps it will be better if you stay inside 
 
 no i i wan ter be with him i don wan him ter be alone 
 
 footsteps echoed from within the cabin 
 
 buckbeak move harry hissed 
 
 harry tugged harder on the rope around neck the hippogriff began to walk rustling its wings irritably they were still ten feet away from the forest in plain view of back door one moment please macnair came voice you need to sign too the footsteps stopped harry heaved on the rope buckbeak snapped his beak and walked a little faster 
 
 white face was sticking out from behind a tree 
 
 harry hurry she mouthed 
 
 harry could still hear voice talking from within the cabin he gave the rope another wrench buckbeak broke into a grudging trot they had reached the trees 
 
 quick quick hermione moaned darting out from behind her tree seizing the rope too and adding her weight to make buckbeak move faster harry looked over his shoulder they were now blocked from sight they see garden at all 
 
 stop he whispered to hermione they might hear us 
 
 back door had opened with a bang harry hermione and buckbeak stood quite still even the hippogriff seemed to be listening intently silence then 
 
 where is it said the reedy voice of the committee member where is the beast 
 
 it was tied here said the executioner furiously i saw it just here 
 
 how extraordinary said dumbledore there was a note of amusement in his voice 
 
 beaky said hagrid huskily 
 
 there was a swishing noise and the thud of an axe the executioner seemed to have swung it into the fence in anger and then came the howling and this time they could hear words through his sobs 
 
 gone gone bless his little beak gone musta pulled himself free beaky yeh clever boy 
 
 buckbeak started to strain against the rope trying to get back to hagrid harry and hermione tightened their grip and dug their heels into the forest floor to stop him 
 
 someone untied him the executioner was snarling we should search the grounds the forest 
 
 macnair if buckbeak has indeed been stolen do you really think the thief will have led him away on foot said dumbledore still sounding amused search the skies if you will hagrid i could do with a cup of tea or a large brandy 
 
 o o course professor said hagrid who sounded weak with happiness come in come in 
 
 harry and hermione listened closely they heard footsteps the soft cursing of the executioner the snap of the door and then silence once more 
 
 now what whispered harry looking around 
 
 have to hide in here said hermione who looked very shaken we need to wait until gone back to the castle then we wait until safe to fly buckbeak up to window he be there for another couple of hours oh this is going to be difficult 
 
 she looked nervously over her shoulder into the depths of the forest the sun was setting now 
 
 going to have to move said harry thinking hard got to be able to see the whomping willow or we know going on 
 
 okay said hermione getting a firmer grip on rope but got to keep out of sight harry remember 
 
 they moved around the edge of the forest darkness falling thickly around them until they were hidden behind a clump of trees through which they could make out the willow 
 
 ron said harry suddenly 
 
 a dark figure was sprinting across the lawn and its shout echoed through the still night air 
 
 get away from him get away scabbers come here 
 
 and then they saw two more figures materialize out of nowhere harry watched himself and hermione chasing afte 
 
 r ron then he saw ron dive 
 
 gotcha get off you stinking cat 
 
 sirius said harry the great shape of the dog had bounded out from the roots of the willow they saw him bowl harry over then seize on 
 
 looks even worse from here it said harry watching the dog pulling ron into the roots ouch look i just got walloped by the tree and so did you this is weirdc 
 
 the whomping willow was creaking and lashing out with its lower branches they could see themselves darting here and there trying to reach the trunk and then the tree froze 
 
 that was crookshanks pressing the knot said hermione 
 
 and there we go harry muttered in 
 
 the moment they disappeared the tree began to move again seconds later they heard footsteps quite close by dumbledore macnair fudge and the old committee member were making their way up to the castle 
 
 right after gone down into the passage said hermione if only dumbledore had come with us 
 
 macnair and fudge come too said harry bitterly i bet you anything fudge told macnair to murder sirius on the spot 
 
 they watched the four men climb the castle steps and disappear from view for a few minutes the scene was deserted then 
 
 here comes lupin said harry as they saw another figure sprinting down the stone steps and halting toward the willow harry looked up at the sky clouds were obscuring the moon completely 
 
 they watched lupin seize a broken branch from the ground and prod the knot on the trunk the tree stopped fighting and lupin too disappeared into the gap in its roots 
 
 if only grabbed the cloak said harry just lying there 
 
 he turned to hermione 
 
 if i just dashed out now and grabbed it never be able to get it and 
 
 harry we be seen 
 
 how can you stand this he asked hermione fiercely just standing here and watching it happen he hesitated going to grab the cloak 
 
 harry no 
 
 hermione seized the back of robes not a moment too soon just then they heard a burst of song it was hagrid making his way up to the castle singing at the top of his voice and weaving slightly as he walked a large bottle was swinging from his hands 
 
 see hermione whispered see what would have happened got to keep out of sight no buckbeak 
 
 the hippogriff was making frantic attempts to get to hagrid again harry seized his rope too straining to hold buckbeak back they watched hagrid meander tipsily up to the castle he was gone buckbeak stopped fighting to get away his head drooped sadly 
 
 
 
 barely two minutes later the castle doors flew open yet again and snape came charging out of them running toward the willow 
 
 fists clenched as they watched snape skid to a halt next to the tree looking around he grabbed the cloak and held it up 
 
 get your filthy hands off it harry snarled under his breath 
 
 shh 
 
 snape seized the branch lupin had used to freeze the tree prodded the knot and vanished from view as he put on the cloak 
 
 so it said hermione quietly all down there and now just got to wait until we come back up again 
 
 she took the end of rope and tied it securely around the nearest tree then sat down on the dry ground arms around her knees 
 
 harry something i understand why the dementors get sirius i remember them coming and then i think i passed out there were so many of them 
 
 harry sat down too he explained what seen how as the nearest dementor had lowered its mouth to a large silver something had come galloping across the lake and forced the dementors to retreat 
 
 mouth was slightly open by the time harry had finished 
 
 but what was it 
 
 only one thing it could have been to make the dementors go said harry a real patronus a powerful one 
 
 but who conjured it 
 
 harry say anything he was thinking back to the person seen on the other bank of the lake he knew who he thought it had been but how could it have been 
 
 you see what they looked like said hermione eagerly was it one of the teachers 
 
 no said harry he a teacher 
 
 but it must have been a really powerful wizard to drive all those dementors away if the patronus was shining so brightly it light him up you see 
 
 yeah i saw him said harry slowly but maybe i imagined it i thinking straight i passed out right afterward 
 
 who did you think it was 
 
 i think harry swallowed knowing how strange this was going to sound i think it was my dad 
 
 harry glanced up at hermione and saw that her mouth was fully open now she was gazing at him with a mixture of alarm and pity 
 
 harry your well dead she said quietly 
 
 i know that said harry quickly 
 
 you think you saw his ghost 
 
 i know no he looked solid 
 
 but then 
 
 maybe i was seeing things said harry but from what i could see it looked like him got photos of him 
 
 hermione was still looking at him as though worried about his sanity i know it sounds crazy said harry flatly he turned to took at buckbeak who was digging his beak into the ground apparently searching for worms but he really watching buckbeak 
 
 he was thinking about his father and about his three oldest friends moony wormtail padfoot and prongs had all four of them been out on the grounds tonight wormtail had reappeared this evening when everyone had thought he was dead was it so impossible his father had done the same had he been seeing things across the take the figure had been too far away to see distinctly yet he had felt sure for a moment before lost consciousness 
 
 the leaves overhead rustled faintly in the breeze the moon drifted in and out of sight behind the shifting clouds hermione sat with her face turned toward the willow waiting 
 
 and then at last after over an hour 
 
 here we come hermione whispered 
 
 she and harry got to their feet buckbeak raised his head they saw lupin ron and pettigrew clambering awkwardly out of the hole in the roots then came hermione then the unconscious snape drifting weirdly upward next came harry and black they all began to walk toward the castle 
 
 heart was starting to beat very fast he glanced up at the sky any moment now that cloud was going to move aside and show the moon 
 
 harry hermione muttered as though she knew exactly what he was thinking got to stay put we be seen nothing we can do 
 
 so just going to let pettigrew escape all over again said harry quietly 
 
 how do you expect to find a rat in the dark snapped hermione nothing we can do we came back to help sirius not supposed to be doing anything else 
 
 all right 
 
 the moon slid out from behind its cloud they saw the tiny figures across the grounds stop then they saw movement 
 
 there goes lupin hermione whispered transforming 
 
 hermione said harry suddenly got to move 
 
 we i keep telling you 
 
 not to interfere going to run into the forest right at us 
 
 hermione gasped 
 
 quick she moaned dashing to untie buckbeak quick where are we going to go where are we going to hide the dementors will be coming any moment 
 
 back to harry said empty now come on 
 
 they ran as fast as they could buckbeak cantering along behind them they could hear the werewolf howling behind them 
 
 the cabin was in sight harry skidded to the door wrenched it open and hermione and buckbeak flashed past him harry threw himself in after them and bolted the door fang the boarhound barked loudly 
 
 shh fang us said hermione hurrying over and scratching his ears to quieten him that was really close she said to harry 
 
 yeah 
 
 harry was looking out of the window it was much harder to see what was going on from here buckbeak seemed very happy to find himself back inside house he lay down in front of the fire folded his wings contentedly and seemed ready for a good nap 
 
 i think better go outside again you know said harry slowly i see going on we know when time 
 
 hermione looked up her expression was suspicious 
 
 not going to try and interfere said harry quickly but if we see going on we going to know when time to rescue sirius 
 
 well okay then wait here with buckbeak but harry be careful a werewolf out there and the dementors 
 
 harry stepped outside again and edged around the cabin he could hear yelping in the distance that meant the dementors were closing in on sirius he and hermione would be running to him any moment 
 
 harry stared out toward the lake his heart doing a kind of drumroll in his chest whoever had sent that patronus would be appearing at any moment 
 
 for a fraction of a second he stood irresolute in front of door you must not be seen but he want to be seen he wanted to do the seeing he had to know 
 
 and there were the dementors they were emerging out of the darkness from every direction gliding around the edges of the lake they were moving away from where harry stood to the opposite bank he have to get near them 
 
 harry began to run he had no thought in his head except his father if it was him if it really was him he had to know had to find out 
 
 the lake was coming nearer and nearer but there was no sign of anybody on the opposite bank he could see tiny glimmers of silver his own attempts at a patronus 
 
 there was a bush at the very edge of the water harry threw himself behind it peering desperately through the leaves on the opposite bank the glimmers of silver were suddenly extinguished a terrified excitement shot through him any moment now 
 
 come on he muttered staring about where are you dad come on 
 
 but no one came harry raised his head to look at the circle of dementors across the lake one of them was lowering its hood it was time for the rescuer to appear but no one was coming to help this time 
 
 and then it hit him he understood he seen his father he had seen himself 
 
 harry flung himself out from behind the bush and pulled out his wand 
 
 expecto patronum he yelled 
 
 and out of the end of his wand burst not a shapeless cloud of mist but a blinding dazzling silver animal he screwed up his eyes trying to see what it was it looked like a horse it was galloping silently away from him across the black surface of the lake he saw it lower its head and charge at the swarming dementors now it was galloping around and around the black shapes on the ground and the dementors were falling back scattering retreating into the darkness they were gone 
 
 the patronus turned it was cantering back toward harry across the still surface of the water it a horse it a unicorn either it was a stag it was shining brightly as the moon above it was coming back to him 
 
 it stopped on the bank its hooves made no mark on the soft ground as it stared at harry with its large silver eyes slowly it bowed its antlered head and harry realized prongs he whispered 
 
 but as his trembling fingertips stretched toward the creature it vanished 
 
 harry stood there hand still outstretched then with a great leap of his heart he heard hooves behind him he whirled around and saw hermione dashing toward him dragging buckbeak behind her 
 
 what did you do she said fiercely you said you were only going to keep a lookout 
 
 i just saved all our lives said harry get behind here behind this bush explain 
 
 hermione listened to what had just happened with her mouth open yet again 
 
 did anyone see you 
 
 yes you been listening i saw me but i thought i was my dad okay 
 
 harry i believe it you conjured up a patronus that drove away all those dementors very very advanced magic 
 
 i knew i could do it this time said harry because already done it does that make sense 
 
 i know harry look at snape 
 
 together they peered around the bush at the other bank snape had regained consciousness he was conjuring stretchers and lifting the limp forms of harry hermione and black onto them a fourth stretcher no doubt bearing ron was already floating at his side then wand held out in front of him he moved them away toward the castle 
 
 right nearly time said hermione tensely looking at her watch got about minutes until dumbledore locks the door to the hospital wing got to rescue sirius and get back into the ward before anybody realizes missing 
 
 they waited watching the moving clouds reflected in the lake while the bush next to them whispered in the breeze buckbeak bored was ferreting for worms again 
 
 do you reckon up there yet said harry checking his watch he looked up at the castle and began counting the windows to the right of the west tower 
 
 look hermione whispered that coming back out of the castle 
 
 harry stared through the darkness the man was hurrying across the grounds toward one of the entrances something shiny glinted in his belt 
 
 macnair said harry the executioner gone to get the dementors this is it hermione 
 
 hermione put her hands on back and harry gave her a leg up then he placed his foot on one of the lower branches of the bush and climbed up in front of her he pulled rope back over his neck and tied it to the other side of his collar like reins 
 
 ready he whispered to hermione better hold on to me 
 
 he nudged sides with his heels 
 
 buckbeak soared straight into the dark air harry gripped his flanks with his knees feeling the great wings rising powerfully beneath them hermione was holding harry very tight around the waist he could hear her muttering oh no i like this oh i really like this 
 
 harry urged buckbeak forward they were gliding quietly toward the upper floors of the castle harry pulled hard on the side of the rope and buckbeak turned harry was trying to count the windows flashing past 
 
 whoa he said pulling backward as hard as he could 
 
 buckbeak slowed down and they found themselves at a stop unless you counted the fact that they kept rising up and down several feet as the hippogriff beat his wings to remain airborne 
 
 there harry said spotting sirius as they rose up beside the window he reached out and as wings fell was able to tap sharply on the glass 
 
 black looked up harry saw his jaw drop he leapt from his chair hurried to the window and tried to open it but it was locked 
 
 stand back hermione called to him and she took out her wand still gripping the back of robes with her left hand 
 
 alohomora 
 
 the window sprang open 
 
 how how said black weakly staring at the hippogriff 
 
 get on not much time said harry gripping buckbeak firmly on either side of his sleek neck to hold him steady got to get out of here the dementors are coming gone to get them 
 
 black placed a hand on either side of the window frame and heaved his head and shoulders out of it it was very lucky he was so thin in seconds he had managed to fling one leg over back and pull himself onto the hippogriff behind hermione 
 
 okay buckbeak up said harry shaking the rope up to the tower come on 
 
 the hippogriff gave one sweep of its mighty wings and they were soaring upward again high as the top of the west tower buckbeak landed with a clatter on the battlements and harry and hermione slid off him at once 
 
 sirius better go quick harry panted reach office any moment find out gone 
 
 buckbeak pawed the ground tossing his sharp head 
 
 what happened to the other boy ron croaked sirius 
 
 going to be okay still out of it but madam pomfrey says be able to make him better quick go 
 
 but black was still staring down at harry 
 
 how can i ever thank 
 
 go harry and hermione shouted together 
 
 black wheeled buckbeak around facing the open sky 
 
 see each other again he said you are truly your son harry 
 
 he squeezed sides with his heels harry and hermione jumped back as the enormous wings rose once more the hippogriff took off into the air he and his rider became smaller and smaller as harry gazed after them then a cloud drifted across the moon they were gone 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the prisoner of azkaban 
 

lionfish nov chapter secretcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 shocking business shocking miracle none of them died never heard the like by thunder it was lucky you were there snape 
 
 thank you minister 
 
 order of merlin second class say first class if i can wangle it 
 
 thank you very much indeed minister 
 
 nasty cut got there work i suppose 
 
 as a matter of fact it was potter weasley and granger minister 
 
 no 
 
 black had bewitched them i saw it immediately a confundus charm to judge by their behavior they seemed to think there was a possibility he was innocent they responsible for their actions on the other hand their interference might have permitted black to escape they obviously thought they were going to catch black got away with a great deal before now afraid given them a rather high opinion of themselves and of course potter has always been allowed an extraordinary amount of license by the headmaster 
 
 ah well snape harry potter you know all got a bit of a blind spot where concerned 
 
 and yet is it good for him to be given so much special treatment personally i try and treat him like any other student and any other student would be suspended at the very least for leading his friends into such danger consider minister against all school rules after all the precautions put in place for his protection at night consorting with a werewolf and a murderer and i have reason to believe he has been visiting hogsmeade illegally too 
 
 well well we shall see snape we shall see the boy has undoubtedly been foolish 
 
 harry lay listening with his eyes tight shut he felt very groggy the words he was hearing seemed to be traveling very slowly from his ears to his brain so that it was difficult to understand his limbs felt like lead his eyelids too heavy to lift he wanted to lie here on this comfortable bed forever 
 
 what amazes me most is the behavior of the dementors really no idea what made them retreat snape 
 
 no minister by the time i had come round they were heading back to their positions at the entrances 
 
 extraordinary and yet black and harry and the girl 
 
 all unconscious by the time i reached them i bound and gagged black naturally conjured stretchers and brought them all straight back to the castle 
 
 there was a pause brain seemed to be moving a little faster and as it did a gnawing sensation grew in the pit of his stomach 
 
 he opened his eyes 
 
 everything was slightly blurred somebody had removed his glasses he was lying in the dark hospital wing at the very end of the ward he could make out madam pomfrey with her back to him bending over a bed harry squinted red hair was visible beneath madam arm 
 
 harry moved his head over on the pillow in the bed to his right lay hermione moonlight was falling across her bed her eyes were open too she looked petrified and when she saw that harry was awake pressed a finger to her lips then pointed to the hospital wing door it was ajar and the voices of cornelius fudge and snape were coming through it from the corridor outside 
 
 madam pomfrey now came walking briskly up the dark ward to bed he turned to took at her she was carrying the largest block of chocolate he had ever seen in his life it looked like a small boulder 
 
 ah awake she said briskly she placed the chocolate on bedside table and began breaking it apart with a small hammer 
 
 ron said harry and hermione together 
 
 live said madam pomfrey grimly as for you two be staying here until satisfied potter what do you think doing 
 
 harry was sitting up putting his glasses back on and picking up his wand 
 
 i need to see the headmaster he said 
 
 potter said madam pomfrey soothingly all right got black locked away upstairs the dementors will be performing the kiss any moment now 
 
 what 
 
 harry jumped up out of bed hermione had done the same but his shout had been heard in the corridor outside next second cornelius fudge and snape had entered the ward 
 
 harry harry this said fudge looking agitated you should be in bed has he had any chocolate he asked madam pomfrey anxiously 
 
 minister listen harry said sirius innocent peter pettigrew faked his own death we saw him tonight you let the dementors do that thing to sirius 
 
 but fudge was shaking his head with a small smile on his face 
 
 harry harry very confused been through a dreadful ordeal lie back down now got everything under control 
 
 you harry yelled got the wrong man 
 
 minister listen please hermione said she had hurried to side and was gazing imploringly into face i saw him too it was rat an animagus pettigrew i mean and 
 
 you see minister said snape confunded both of them done a very good job on them 
 
 not confunded harry roared 
 
 minister professor said madam pomfrey angrily i must insist that you leave potter is my patient and he should not be distressed 
 
 not distressed trying to tell them what happened harry said furiously if just listen 
 
 but madam pomfrey suddenly stuffed a large chunk of chocolate into harrys mouth he choked and she seized the opportunity to force him back onto the bed 
 
 now please minister these children need care please leave 
 
 the door opened again it was dumbledore harry swallowed his mouthful of chocolate with great difficulty and got up again 
 
 professor dumbledore sirius black 
 
 for sake said madam pomfrey hysterically is this a hospital wing or not headmaster i must insist 
 
 my apologies poppy but i need a word with mr potter and miss granger said dumbledore calmly i have just been talking to sirius black 
 
 i suppose told you the same fairy tale planted in mind spat snape something about a rat and pettigrew being alive 
 
 that indeed is story said dumbledore surveying snape closely through his spectacles 
 
 and does my evidence count for nothing snarled snape peter pettigrew was not in the shrieking shack nor did i see any sign of him on the grounds 
 
 that was because you were knocked out professor said hermione earnestly you arrive in time to hear 
 
 miss granger hold your tongue 
 
 now snape said fudge startled the young lady is disturbed in her mind we must make allowances 
 
 i would like to speak to harry and hermione alone said dumbledore abruptly cornelius severus poppy please leave us 
 
 headmaster sputtered madam pomfrey they need treatment they need rest 
 
 this cannot wait said dumbledore i must insist 
 
 madam pomfrey pursed her lips and strode away into her office at the end of the ward slamming the door behind her fudge consulted the large gold pocket watch dangling from his waistcoat 
 
 the dementors should have arrived by now he said go and meet them dumbledore see you upstairs 
 
 he crossed to the door and held it open for snape but snape moved 
 
 you surely believe a word of story snape whispered his eyes fixed on face 
 
 i wish to speak to harry and hermione alone dumbledore repeated 
 
 snape took a step toward dumbledore 
 
 sirius black showed he was capable of murder at the age of sixteen he breathed you forgotten that headmaster you forgotten that he once tried to kill me 
 
 my memory is as good as it ever was severus said dumbledore quietly 
 
 snape turned on his heel and marched through the door fudge was still holding it closed behind them and dumbledore turned to harry and hermione they both burst into speech at the same time 
 
 professor telling the truth we saw pettigrew he escaped when professor lupin turned into a werewolf 
 
 a rat 
 
 front paw i mean finger he cut it off 
 
 pettigrew attacked ron it sirius 
 
 but dumbledore held up his hand to stem the flood of explanations 
 
 it is your turn to listen and i beg you will not interrupt me because there is very little time he said quietly there is not a shred of proof to support story except your word and the word of two wizards will not convince anybody a street full of eyewitnesses swore they saw sirius murder pettigrew i myself gave evidence to the ministry that sirius had been the potters 
 
 professor lupin can tell you harry said unable to stop himself 
 
 professor lupin is currently deep in the forest unable to tell anyone anything by the time he is human again it will be too late sirius will be worse than dead i might add that werewolves are so mistrusted by most of our kind that his support will count for very little and the fact that he and sirius are old friends 
 
 but 
 
 listen to me harry it is too late you understand me you must see that professor version of events is far more convincing than yours 
 
 he hates sirius hermione said desperately all because of some stupid trick sirius played on him 
 
 sirius has not acted like an innocent man the attack on the fat lady entering gryffindor tower with a knife without pettigrew alive or dead we have no chance of overturning sentence 
 
 but you believe us 
 
 yes i do said dumbledore quietly but i have no power to make other men see the truth or to overrule the minister of magic 
 
 harry stared up into the grave face and felt as though the ground beneath him were falling sharply away he had grown used to the idea that dumbledore could solve anything he had expected dumbledore to pull some amazing solution out of the air but no their last hope was gone 
 
 what we need said dumbledore slowly and his light blue eyes moved from harry to hermione is more time 
 
 but hermione began and then her eyes became very round oh 
 
 now pay attention said dumbledore speaking very low and very clearly sirius is locked in professor office on the seventh floor thirteenth window from the right of the west tower if all goes well you will be able to save more than one innocent life tonight but remember this both of you you must not be seen miss granger you know the law you know what is at stakeyou must not be seen 
 
 harry have a clue what was going on dumbledore had turned on his heel and looked back as he reached the door 
 
 i am going to lock you in it is he consulted his watch five minutes to midnight miss granger three turns should do it good luck 
 
 good luck harry repeated as the door closed behind dumbledore three turns he talking about what are we supposed to do 
 
 but hermione was fumbling with the neck of her robes pulling from beneath them a very long very fine gold chain 
 
 harry come here she said urgently quick 
 
 harry moved toward her completely bewildered she was holding the chain out he saw a tiny sparkling hourglass hanging from it 
 
 here 
 
 she had thrown the chain around his neck too 
 
 ready she said breathlessly 
 
 what are we doing harry said completely lost 
 
 hermione turned the hourglass over three times 
 
 the dark ward dissolved harry had the sensation that he was flying very fast backward a blur of colors and shapes rushed past him his ears were pounding he tried to yell but hear his own voice 
 
 and then he felt solid ground beneath his feet and everything came into focus again 
 
 he was standing next to hermione in the deserted entrance hall and a stream of golden sunlight was falling across the paved floor from the open front doors he looked wildly around at hermione the chain of the hourglass cutting into his neck 
 
 hermione what 
 
 in here hermione seized arm and dragged him across the hall to the door of a broom closet she opened it pushed him inside among the buckets and mops then slammed the door behind them 
 
 what how hermione what happened 
 
 gone back in time hermione whispered lifting the chain off neck in the darkness three hours back 
 
 harry found his own leg and gave it a very hard pinch it hurt a lot which seemed to rule out the possibility that he was having a very bizarre dream 
 
 but 
 
 shh listen coming i think i think it might be us hermione had her ear pressed against the cupboard door 
 
 footsteps across the hall yes i think us going down to 
 
 are you telling me harry whispered that here in this cupboard and out there too 
 
 yes said hermione her ear still glued to the cupboard door sure us it sound like more than three people and walking slowly because under the invisibility cloak 
 
 she broke off still listening intently 
 
 gone down the front steps 
 
 hermione sat down on an upturned bucket looking desperately anxious but harry wanted a few questions answered 
 
 where did you get that hourglass thing 
 
 called a hermione whispered and i got it from professor mcgonagall on our first day back been using it all year to get to all my lessons professor mcgonagall made me swear i tell anyone she had to write all sorts of letters to the ministry of magic so i could have one she had to tell them that i was a model student and that never ever use it for anything except my studies been turning it back so i could do hours over again how been doing several lessons at once see but 
 
 harry i understand what dumbledore wants us to do why did he tell us to go back three hours that going to help sirius 
 
 harry stared at her shadowy face 
 
 there must be something that happened around now he wants us to change he said slowly what happened we were walking down to three hours ago 
 
 this is three hours ago and we are walking down to said hermione we just heard ourselves leaving 
 
 harry frowned he felt as though he were screwing up his whole brain in concentration 
 
 dumbledore just said just said we could save more than one innocent life and then it hit him hermione going to save buckbeak 
 
 but how will that help sirius 
 
 dumbledore said he just told us where the window is the window of office where got sirius locked up got to fly buckbeak up to the window and rescue sirius sirius can escape on buckbeak they can escape together 
 
 from what harry could see of face she looked terrified 
 
 if we manage that without being seen be a miracle 
 
 well got to try we said harry he stood up andvpressed his ear against the door sound like there come on go 
 
 harry pushed open the closet door the entrance hall was deserted as quietly and quickly as they could they darted out of the closet and down the stone steps the shadows were already lengthening the tops of the trees in the forbidden forest gilded once more with gold 
 
 if looking out of the window hermione squeaked looking up at the castle behind them 
 
 run for it said harry determinedly straight into the forest all right have to hide behind a tree or something and keep a lookout 
 
 okay but go around by the greenhouses said hermione breathlessly we need to keep out of sight of front door or see us we must be nearly at by now 
 
 still working out what she meant harry set off at a sprint hermione behind him they tore across the vegetable gardens to the greenhouses paused for a moment behind them then set off again fast as they could skirting around the whomping willow tearing toward the shelter of the forest 
 
 safe in the shadows of the trees harry turned around seconds later hermione arrived beside him panting 
 
 right she gasped we need to sneak over to keep out of sight harry 
 
 they made their way silently through the trees keeping to the very edge of the forest then as they glimpsed the front of house they heard a knock upon his door they moved quickly behind a wide oak trunk and peered out from either side hagrid had appeared in his doorway shaking and white looking around to see who had knocked and harry heard his own voice 
 
 us wearing the invisibility cloak let us in and we can take it off 
 
 yeh come hagrid whispered he stood back then shut the door quickly 
 
 this is the weirdest thing ever done harry said fervently 
 
 move along a bit hermione whispered we need to get nearer to buckbeak 
 
 they crept through the trees until they saw the nervous hippogriff tethered to the fence around pumpkin patch 
 
 now harry whispered 
 
 no said hermione if we steal him now those committee people will think hagrid set him free got to wait until seen tied outside 
 
 going to give us about sixty seconds said harry this was starting to seem impossible 
 
 at that moment there was a crash of breaking china from inside cabin 
 
 hagrid breaking the milk jug hermione whispered going to find scabbers in a moment 
 
 sure enough a few minutes later they heard shriek of surprise 
 
 hermione said harry suddenly what if we we just run in there and grab pettigrew 
 
 no said hermione in a terrified whisper you understand breaking one of the most important wizarding laws supposed to change time nobody you heard dumbledore if seen 
 
 only be seen by ourselves and hagrid 
 
 harry what do you think do if you saw yourself bursting into house said hermione 
 
 think gone mad said harry or think there was some dark magic going on 
 
 exactly you understand you might even attack yourself you see professor mcgonagall told me what awful things have happened when wizards have meddled with time loads of them ended up killing their past or future selves by mistake 
 
 okay said harry it was just an idea i just thought 
 
 but hermione nudged him and pointed toward the castle harry moved his head a few inches to get a clear view of the distant front doors dumbledore fudge the old committee member and macnair the executioner were coming down the steps 
 
 about to come out hermione breathed 
 
 and sure enough moments later back door opened and harry saw himself ron and hermione walking out of it with hagrid it was without a doubt the strangest sensation of his life standing behind the tree and watching himself in the pumpkin patch 
 
 okay beaky okay hagrid said to buckbeak then he turned to harry ron and hermione go on get goin 
 
 hagrid we 
 
 tell them what really happened 
 
 they kill him 
 
 go bad enough without you lot in trouble an all 
 
 harry watched the hermione in the pumpkin patch throw the invisibility cloak over him and ron 
 
 go quick don listen 
 
 there was a knock on front door the execution party had arrived hagrid turned around and headed back into his cabin leaving the back door ajar harry watched the grass flatten in patches all around the cabin and heard three pairs of feet retreating he ron and hermione had gone but the harry and hermione hidden in the trees could now hear what was happening inside the cabin through the back door 
 
 where is the beast came the cold voice of macnair 
 
 out outside hagrid croaked 
 
 harry pulled his head out of sight as face appeared at window staring out at buckbeak then they heard fudge 
 
 we er have to read you the official notice of execution hagrid make it quick and then you and macnair need to sign it macnair supposed to listen too procedure 
 
 face vanished from the window it was now or never 
 
 wait here harry whispered to hermione do it 
 
 as voice started again harry darted out from behind his tree vaulted the fence into the pumpkin patch and approached buckbeak 
 
 it is the decision of the committee for the disposal of dangerous creatures that the hippogriff buckbeak hereafter called the condemned shall he executed on the sixth of june at sundown 
 
 careful not to blink harry stared up into fierce orange eyes once more and bowed buckbeak sank to his scaly knees and then stood up again harry began to fumble with the knot of rope tying buckbeak to the fence 
 
 sentenced to execution by beheading to be carried out by the appointed executioner walden macnair 
 
 come on buckbeak harry murmured come on going to help you quietly quietly 
 
 as witnessed below hagrid you sign here 
 
 harry threw all his weight onto the rope but buckbeak had dug in his front feet 
 
 well get this over with said the reedy voice of the committee member from inside cabin hagrid perhaps it will be better if you stay inside 
 
 no i i wan ter be with him i don wan him ter be alone 
 
 footsteps echoed from within the cabin 
 
 buckbeak move harry hissed 
 
 harry tugged harder on the rope around neck the hippogriff began to walk rustling its wings irritably they were still ten feet away from the forest in plain view of back door one moment please macnair came voice you need to sign too the footsteps stopped harry heaved on the rope buckbeak snapped his beak and walked a little faster 
 
 white face was sticking out from behind a tree 
 
 harry hurry she mouthed 
 
 harry could still hear voice talking from within the cabin he gave the rope another wrench buckbeak broke into a grudging trot they had reached the trees 
 
 quick quick hermione moaned darting out from behind her tree seizing the rope too and adding her weight to make buckbeak move faster harry looked over his shoulder they were now blocked from sight they see garden at all 
 
 stop he whispered to hermione they might hear us 
 
 back door had opened with a bang harry hermione and buckbeak stood quite still even the hippogriff seemed to be listening intently silence then 
 
 where is it said the reedy voice of the committee member where is the beast 
 
 it was tied here said the executioner furiously i saw it just here 
 
 how extraordinary said dumbledore there was a note of amusement in his voice 
 
 beaky said hagrid huskily 
 
 there was a swishing noise and the thud of an axe the executioner seemed to have swung it into the fence in anger and then came the howling and this time they could hear words through his sobs 
 
 gone gone bless his little beak gone musta pulled himself free beaky yeh clever boy 
 
 buckbeak started to strain against the rope trying to get back to hagrid harry and hermione tightened their grip and dug their heels into the forest floor to stop him 
 
 someone untied him the executioner was snarling we should search the grounds the forest 
 
 macnair if buckbeak has indeed been stolen do you really think the thief will have led him away on foot said dumbledore still sounding amused search the skies if you will hagrid i could do with a cup of tea or a large brandy 
 
 o o course professor said hagrid who sounded weak with happiness come in come in 
 
 harry and hermione listened closely they heard footsteps the soft cursing of the executioner the snap of the door and then silence once more 
 
 now what whispered harry looking around 
 
 have to hide in here said hermione who looked very shaken we need to wait until gone back to the castle then we wait until safe to fly buckbeak up to window he be there for another couple of hours oh this is going to be difficult 
 
 she looked nervously over her shoulder into the depths of the forest the sun was setting now 
 
 going to have to move said harry thinking hard got to be able to see the whomping willow or we know going on 
 
 okay said hermione getting a firmer grip on rope but got to keep out of sight harry remember 
 
 they moved around the edge of the forest darkness falling thickly around them until they were hidden behind a clump of trees through which they could make out the willow 
 
 ron said harry suddenly 
 
 a dark figure was sprinting across the lawn and its shout echoed through the still night air 
 
 get away from him get away scabbers come here 
 
 and then they saw two more figures materialize out of nowhere harry watched himself and hermione chasing afte 
 
 r ron then he saw ron dive 
 
 gotcha get off you stinking cat 
 
 sirius said harry the great shape of the dog had bounded out from the roots of the willow they saw him bowl harry over then seize on 
 
 looks even worse from here it said harry watching the dog pulling ron into the roots ouch look i just got walloped by the tree and so did you this is weirdc 
 
 the whomping willow was creaking and lashing out with its lower branches they could see themselves darting here and there trying to reach the trunk and then the tree froze 
 
 that was crookshanks pressing the knot said hermione 
 
 and there we go harry muttered in 
 
 the moment they disappeared the tree began to move again seconds later they heard footsteps quite close by dumbledore macnair fudge and the old committee member were making their way up to the castle 
 
 right after gone down into the passage said hermione if only dumbledore had come with us 
 
 macnair and fudge come too said harry bitterly i bet you anything fudge told macnair to murder sirius on the spot 
 
 they watched the four men climb the castle steps and disappear from view for a few minutes the scene was deserted then 
 
 here comes lupin said harry as they saw another figure sprinting down the stone steps and halting toward the willow harry looked up at the sky clouds were obscuring the moon completely 
 
 they watched lupin seize a broken branch from the ground and prod the knot on the trunk the tree stopped fighting and lupin too disappeared into the gap in its roots 
 
 if only grabbed the cloak said harry just lying there 
 
 he turned to hermione 
 
 if i just dashed out now and grabbed it never be able to get it and 
 
 harry we be seen 
 
 how can you stand this he asked hermione fiercely just standing here and watching it happen he hesitated going to grab the cloak 
 
 harry no 
 
 hermione seized the back of robes not a moment too soon just then they heard a burst of song it was hagrid making his way up to the castle singing at the top of his voice and weaving slightly as he walked a large bottle was swinging from his hands 
 
 see hermione whispered see what would have happened got to keep out of sight no buckbeak 
 
 the hippogriff was making frantic attempts to get to hagrid again harry seized his rope too straining to hold buckbeak back they watched hagrid meander tipsily up to the castle he was gone buckbeak stopped fighting to get away his head drooped sadly 
 
 
 
 barely two minutes later the castle doors flew open yet again and snape came charging out of them running toward the willow 
 
 fists clenched as they watched snape skid to a halt next to the tree looking around he grabbed the cloak and held it up 
 
 get your filthy hands off it harry snarled under his breath 
 
 shh 
 
 snape seized the branch lupin had used to freeze the tree prodded the knot and vanished from view as he put on the cloak 
 
 so it said hermione quietly all down there and now just got to wait until we come back up again 
 
 she took the end of rope and tied it securely around the nearest tree then sat down on the dry ground arms around her knees 
 
 harry something i understand why the dementors get sirius i remember them coming and then i think i passed out there were so many of them 
 
 harry sat down too he explained what seen how as the nearest dementor had lowered its mouth to a large silver something had come galloping across the lake and forced the dementors to retreat 
 
 mouth was slightly open by the time harry had finished 
 
 but what was it 
 
 only one thing it could have been to make the dementors go said harry a real patronus a powerful one 
 
 but who conjured it 
 
 harry say anything he was thinking back to the person seen on the other bank of the lake he knew who he thought it had been but how could it have been 
 
 you see what they looked like said hermione eagerly was it one of the teachers 
 
 no said harry he a teacher 
 
 but it must have been a really powerful wizard to drive all those dementors away if the patronus was shining so brightly it light him up you see 
 
 yeah i saw him said harry slowly but maybe i imagined it i thinking straight i passed out right afterward 
 
 who did you think it was 
 
 i think harry swallowed knowing how strange this was going to sound i think it was my dad 
 
 harry glanced up at hermione and saw that her mouth was fully open now she was gazing at him with a mixture of alarm and pity 
 
 harry your well dead she said quietly 
 
 i know that said harry quickly 
 
 you think you saw his ghost 
 
 i know no he looked solid 
 
 but then 
 
 maybe i was seeing things said harry but from what i could see it looked like him got photos of him 
 
 hermione was still looking at him as though worried about his sanity i know it sounds crazy said harry flatly he turned to took at buckbeak who was digging his beak into the ground apparently searching for worms but he really watching buckbeak 
 
 he was thinking about his father and about his three oldest friends moony wormtail padfoot and prongs had all four of them been out on the grounds tonight wormtail had reappeared this evening when everyone had thought he was dead was it so impossible his father had done the same had he been seeing things across the take the figure had been too far away to see distinctly yet he had felt sure for a moment before lost consciousness 
 
 the leaves overhead rustled faintly in the breeze the moon drifted in and out of sight behind the shifting clouds hermione sat with her face turned toward the willow waiting 
 
 and then at last after over an hour 
 
 here we come hermione whispered 
 
 she and harry got to their feet buckbeak raised his head they saw lupin ron and pettigrew clambering awkwardly out of the hole in the roots then came hermione then the unconscious snape drifting weirdly upward next came harry and black they all began to walk toward the castle 
 
 heart was starting to beat very fast he glanced up at the sky any moment now that cloud was going to move aside and show the moon 
 
 harry hermione muttered as though she knew exactly what he was thinking got to stay put we be seen nothing we can do 
 
 so just going to let pettigrew escape all over again said harry quietly 
 
 how do you expect to find a rat in the dark snapped hermione nothing we can do we came back to help sirius not supposed to be doing anything else 
 
 all right 
 
 the moon slid out from behind its cloud they saw the tiny figures across the grounds stop then they saw movement 
 
 there goes lupin hermione whispered transforming 
 
 hermione said harry suddenly got to move 
 
 we i keep telling you 
 
 not to interfere going to run into the forest right at us 
 
 hermione gasped 
 
 quick she moaned dashing to untie buckbeak quick where are we going to go where are we going to hide the dementors will be coming any moment 
 
 back to harry said empty now come on 
 
 they ran as fast as they could buckbeak cantering along behind them they could hear the werewolf howling behind them 
 
 the cabin was in sight harry skidded to the door wrenched it open and hermione and buckbeak flashed past him harry threw himself in after them and bolted the door fang the boarhound barked loudly 
 
 shh fang us said hermione hurrying over and scratching his ears to quieten him that was really close she said to harry 
 
 yeah 
 
 harry was looking out of the window it was much harder to see what was going on from here buckbeak seemed very happy to find himself back inside house he lay down in front of the fire folded his wings contentedly and seemed ready for a good nap 
 
 i think better go outside again you know said harry slowly i see going on we know when time 
 
 hermione looked up her expression was suspicious 
 
 not going to try and interfere said harry quickly but if we see going on we going to know when time to rescue sirius 
 
 well okay then wait here with buckbeak but harry be careful a werewolf out there and the dementors 
 
 harry stepped outside again and edged around the cabin he could hear yelping in the distance that meant the dementors were closing in on sirius he and hermione would be running to him any moment 
 
 harry stared out toward the lake his heart doing a kind of drumroll in his chest whoever had sent that patronus would be appearing at any moment 
 
 for a fraction of a second he stood irresolute in front of door you must not be seen but he want to be seen he wanted to do the seeing he had to know 
 
 and there were the dementors they were emerging out of the darkness from every direction gliding around the edges of the lake they were moving away from where harry stood to the opposite bank he have to get near them 
 
 harry began to run he had no thought in his head except his father if it was him if it really was him he had to know had to find out 
 
 the lake was coming nearer and nearer but there was no sign of anybody on the opposite bank he could see tiny glimmers of silver his own attempts at a patronus 
 
 there was a bush at the very edge of the water harry threw himself behind it peering desperately through the leaves on the opposite bank the glimmers of silver were suddenly extinguished a terrified excitement shot through him any moment now 
 
 come on he muttered staring about where are you dad come on 
 
 but no one came harry raised his head to look at the circle of dementors across the lake one of them was lowering its hood it was time for the rescuer to appear but no one was coming to help this time 
 
 and then it hit him he understood he seen his father he had seen himself 
 
 harry flung himself out from behind the bush and pulled out his wand 
 
 expecto patronum he yelled 
 
 and out of the end of his wand burst not a shapeless cloud of mist but a blinding dazzling silver animal he screwed up his eyes trying to see what it was it looked like a horse it was galloping silently away from him across the black surface of the lake he saw it lower its head and charge at the swarming dementors now it was galloping around and around the black shapes on the ground and the dementors were falling back scattering retreating into the darkness they were gone 
 
 the patronus turned it was cantering back toward harry across the still surface of the water it a horse it a unicorn either it was a stag it was shining brightly as the moon above it was coming back to him 
 
 it stopped on the bank its hooves made no mark on the soft ground as it stared at harry with its large silver eyes slowly it bowed its antlered head and harry realized prongs he whispered 
 
 but as his trembling fingertips stretched toward the creature it vanished 
 
 harry stood there hand still outstretched then with a great leap of his heart he heard hooves behind him he whirled around and saw hermione dashing toward him dragging buckbeak behind her 
 
 what did you do she said fiercely you said you were only going to keep a lookout 
 
 i just saved all our lives said harry get behind here behind this bush explain 
 
 hermione listened to what had just happened with her mouth open yet again 
 
 did anyone see you 
 
 yes you been listening i saw me but i thought i was my dad okay 
 
 harry i believe it you conjured up a patronus that drove away all those dementors very very advanced magic 
 
 i knew i could do it this time said harry because already done it does that make sense 
 
 i know harry look at snape 
 
 together they peered around the bush at the other bank snape had regained consciousness he was conjuring stretchers and lifting the limp forms of harry hermione and black onto them a fourth stretcher no doubt bearing ron was already floating at his side then wand held out in front of him he moved them away toward the castle 
 
 right nearly time said hermione tensely looking at her watch got about minutes until dumbledore locks the door to the hospital wing got to rescue sirius and get back into the ward before anybody realizes missing 
 
 they waited watching the moving clouds reflected in the lake while the bush next to them whispered in the breeze buckbeak bored was ferreting for worms again 
 
 do you reckon up there yet said harry checking his watch he looked up at the castle and began counting the windows to the right of the west tower 
 
 look hermione whispered that coming back out of the castle 
 
 harry stared through the darkness the man was hurrying across the grounds toward one of the entrances something shiny glinted in his belt 
 
 macnair said harry the executioner gone to get the dementors this is it hermione 
 
 hermione put her hands on back and harry gave her a leg up then he placed his foot on one of the lower branches of the bush and climbed up in front of her he pulled rope back over his neck and tied it to the other side of his collar like reins 
 
 ready he whispered to hermione better hold on to me 
 
 he nudged sides with his heels 
 
 buckbeak soared straight into the dark air harry gripped his flanks with his knees feeling the great wings rising powerfully beneath them hermione was holding harry very tight around the waist he could hear her muttering oh no i like this oh i really like this 
 
 harry urged buckbeak forward they were gliding quietly toward the upper floors of the castle harry pulled hard on the side of the rope and buckbeak turned harry was trying to count the windows flashing past 
 
 whoa he said pulling backward as hard as he could 
 
 buckbeak slowed down and they found themselves at a stop unless you counted the fact that they kept rising up and down several feet as the hippogriff beat his wings to remain airborne 
 
 there harry said spotting sirius as they rose up beside the window he reached out and as wings fell was able to tap sharply on the glass 
 
 black looked up harry saw his jaw drop he leapt from his chair hurried to the window and tried to open it but it was locked 
 
 stand back hermione called to him and she took out her wand still gripping the back of robes with her left hand 
 
 alohomora 
 
 the window sprang open 
 
 how how said black weakly staring at the hippogriff 
 
 get on not much time said harry gripping buckbeak firmly on either side of his sleek neck to hold him steady got to get out of here the dementors are coming gone to get them 
 
 black placed a hand on either side of the window frame and heaved his head and shoulders out of it it was very lucky he was so thin in seconds he had managed to fling one leg over back and pull himself onto the hippogriff behind hermione 
 
 okay buckbeak up said harry shaking the rope up to the tower come on 
 
 the hippogriff gave one sweep of its mighty wings and they were soaring upward again high as the top of the west tower buckbeak landed with a clatter on the battlements and harry and hermione slid off him at once 
 
 sirius better go quick harry panted reach office any moment find out gone 
 
 buckbeak pawed the ground tossing his sharp head 
 
 what happened to the other boy ron croaked sirius 
 
 going to be okay still out of it but madam pomfrey says be able to make him better quick go 
 
 but black was still staring down at harry 
 
 how can i ever thank 
 
 go harry and hermione shouted together 
 
 black wheeled buckbeak around facing the open sky 
 
 see each other again he said you are truly your son harry 
 
 he squeezed sides with his heels harry and hermione jumped back as the enormous wings rose once more the hippogriff took off into the air he and his rider became smaller and smaller as harry gazed after them then a cloud drifted across the moon they were gone

 harry ron and hermione went up to the owlery that evening to find pigwidgeon so that harry could send sirius a letter telling him that he had managed to get past his dragon unscathed on the way harry filled ron in on everything sirius had told him about karkaroff though shocked at first to hear that karkaroff had been a death eater by the time they entered the owlery ron was saying that they ought to have suspected it all along 
 
 fits it he said remember what malfoy said on the train about his dad being friends with karkaroff now we know where they knew each other they were probably running around in masks together at the world tell you one thing though harry if it was karkaroff who put your name in the goblet going to be feeling really stupid now he work did it you only got a scratch come here do it 
 
 pigwidgeon was so overexcited at the idea of a delivery he was flying around and around head hooting incessantly ron snatched pigwidgeon out of the air and held him still while harry attached the letter to his leg 
 
 no way any of the other tasks are going to be that dangerous how could they be ron went on as he carried pigwidgeon to the window you know what i reckon you could win this tournament harry serious 
 
 harry knew that ron was only saying this to make up for his behavior of the last few weeks but he appreciated it all the same hermione however leaned against the owlery wall folded her arms and frowned at ron 
 
 got a long way to go before he finishes this tournament she said seriously if that was the first task i hate to think coming next 
 
 right little ray of sunshine you said ron you and professor trelawney should get together sometime 
 
 he threw pigwidgeon out of the window pigwidgeon plummeted twelve feet before managing to pull himself back up again the letter attached to his leg was much longer and heavier than usual harry been able to resist giving sirius a account of exactly how he had swerved circled and dodged the horntail they watched pigwidgeon disappear into the darkness and then ron said well better get downstairs for your surprise party harry fred and george should have nicked enough food from the kitchens by now 
 
 sure enough when they entered the gryffindor common room it exploded with cheers and yells again there were mountains of cakes and flagons of pumpkin juice and butterbeer on every surface lee jordan had let off some fireworks so that the air was thick with stars and sparks and dean thomas who was very good at drawing had put up some impressive new banners most of which depicted harry zooming around the head on his firebolt though a couple showed cedric with his head on fire 
 
 harry helped himself to food he had almost forgotten what it was like to feel properly hungry and sat down with ron and hermione he believe how happy he felt he had ron back on his side gotten through the first task and he have to face the second one for three months 
 
 blimey this is heavy said lee jordan picking up the golden egg which harry had left on a table and weighing it in his hands open it harry go on just see inside it 
 
 supposed to work out the clue on his own hermione said swiftly in the tournament rules 
 
 i was supposed to work out how to get past the dragon on my own too harry muttered so only hermione could hear him and she grinned rather guiltily 
 
 yeah go on harry open it several people echoed 
 
 lee passed harry the egg and harry dug his fingernails into the groove that ran all the way around it and prised it open 
 
 it was hollow and completely empty but the moment harry opened it the most horrible noise a loud and screechy wailing filled the room the nearest thing to it harry had ever heard was the ghost orchestra at nearly headless deathday party who had all been playing the musical saw 
 
 shut it fred bellowed his hands over his ears 
 
 what was that said seamus finnigan staring at the egg as harry slammed it shut again sounded like a bansheemaybe got to get past one of those next harry 
 
 it was someone being tortured said neville who had gone very white and spilled sausage rolls all over the floor going to have to fight the cruciatus curse 
 
 be a prat neville illegal said george they use the cruciatus curse on the champions i thought it sounded a bit like percy singingmaybe got to attack him while in the shower harry 
 
 want a jam tart hermione said fred 
 
 hermione looked doubtfully at the plate he was offering her fred grinned 
 
 all right he said i done anything to them the custard creams got to watch 
 
 neville who had just bitten into a custard cream choked and spat it out fred laughed 
 
 just my little joke neville 
 
 hermione took a jam tart then she said did you get all this from the kitchens fred 
 
 yep said fred grinning at her he put on a squeak and imitated a anything we can get you sir anything at all dead helpfulget me a roast ox if i said i was peckish 
 
 how do you get in there hermione said in an innocently casual sort of voice 
 
 easy said fred concealed door behind a painting of a bowl of fruit just tickle the pear and it giggles and he stopped and looked suspiciously at her why 
 
 nothing said hermione quickly 
 
 going to try and lead the out on strike now are you said george going to give up all the leaflet stuff and try and stir them up into rebellion 
 
 several people chortled hermione answer 
 
 you go upsetting them and telling them got to take clothes and salaries said fred warningly put them off their cooking 
 
 just then neville caused a slight diversion by turning into a large canary 
 
 oh sorry neville fred shouted over all the laughter i forgot it was the custard creams we hexed 
 
 within a minute however neville had molted and once his feathers had fallen off he reappeared looking entirely normal he even joined in laughing 
 
 canary creams fred shouted to the excitable crowd george and i invented them seven sickles each a bargain 
 
 it was nearly one in the morning when harry finally went up to the dormitory with ron neville seamus and dean before he pulled the curtains of his shut harry set his tiny model of the hungarian horntail on the table next to his bed where it yawned curled up and closed its eyes really harry thought as he pulled the hangings on his closed hagrid had a pointthey were all right really dragons 
 
 
 
 the start of december brought wind and sleet to hogwarts drafty though the castle always was in winter harry was glad of its fires and thick walls every time he passed the durmstrang ship on the lake which was pitching in the high winds its black sails billowing against the dark skies he thought the beauxbatons caravan was likely to be pretty chilly too hagrid he noticed was keeping madame horses well provided with their preferred drink of whiskey the fumes wafting from the trough in the comer of their paddock was enough to make the entire care of magical creatures class this was unhelpful as they were still tending the horrible skrewts and needed their wits about them 
 
 not sure whether they hibernate or not hagrid told the shivering class in the windy pumpkin patch next lesson thought jus try an see if they fancied a jus settle em down in these boxes 
 
 there were now only ten skrewts left apparently their desire to kill one another had not been exercised out of them each of them was now approaching six feet in length their thick gray armor their powerful scuttling legs their ends their stings and their suckers combined to make the skrewts the most repulsive things harry had ever seen the class looked dispiritedly at the enormous boxes hagrid had brought out all lined with pillows and fluffy blankets 
 
 jus lead em in here hagrid said an put the lids on and see what happens 
 
 but the skrewts it transpired did not hibernate and did not appreciate being forced into boxes and nailed in hagrid was soon yelling don panic now don panic while the skrewts rampaged around the pumpkin patch now strewn with the smoldering wreckage of the boxes most of the class malfoy crabbe and goyle in the lead had fled into cabin through the back door and barricaded themselves in harry ron and hermione however were among those who remained outside trying to help hagrid together they managed to restrain and tie up nine of the skrewts though at the cost of numerous burns and cuts finally only one skrewt was left 
 
 don frighten him now hagrid shouted as ron and harry used their wands to shoot jets of fiery sparks at the skrewt which was advancing menacingly on them its sting arched quivering over its back jus try an slip the rope round his sting so he won hurt any o the others 
 
 yeah we want that ron shouted angrily as he and harry backed into the wall of cabin still holding the skrewt off with their sparks 
 
 well well wellthis does look like fun 
 
 rita skeeter was leaning on garden fence looking in at the mayhem she was wearing a thick magenta cloak with a furry purple collar today and her handbag was over her arm 
 
 hagrid launched himself forward on top of the skrewt that was cornering harry and ron and flattened it a blast of fire shot out of its end withering the pumpkin plants nearby 
 
 you hagrid asked rita skeeter as he slipped a loop of rope around the sting and tightened it 
 
 rita skeeter daily prophet reporter rita replied beaming at him her gold teeth glinted 
 
 thought dumbledore said you weren allowed inside the school anymore said hagrid frowning slightly as he got off the slightly squashed skrewt and started tugging it over to its fellows 
 
 rita acted as though she heard what hagrid had said 
 
 what are these fascinating creatures called she asked beaming still more widely 
 
 skrewts grunted hagrid 
 
 really said rita apparently full of lively interest never heard of them beforewhere do they come from 
 
 harry noticed a dull red flush rising up out of wild black beard and his heart sank where had hagrid got the skrewts from hermione who seemed to be thinking along these lines said quickly very interesting they they harry 
 
 what oh yeahouchinteresting said harry as she stepped on his foot 
 
 ah here harry said rita skeeter as she looked around so you like care of magical creatures do you one of your favorite lessons 
 
 yes said harry stoutly hagrid beamed at him 
 
 lovely said rita really lovely been teaching long she added to hagrid 
 
 harry noticed her eyes travel over dean who had a nasty cut across one cheek lavender whose robes were badly singed seamus who was nursing several burnt fingers and then to the cabin windows where most of the class stood their noses pressed against the glass waiting to see if the coast was clear 
 
 this is me second year said hagrid 
 
 lovelyi suppose like to give an interview would you share some of your experience of magical creatures the prophet does a zoological column every wednesday as sure you know we could feature these er scoots 
 
 skrewts hagrid said eagerly er yeah why not 
 
 harry had a very bad feeling about this but there was no way of communicating it to hagrid without rita skeeter seeing so he had to stand and watch in silence as hagrid and rita skeeter made arrangements to meet in the three broomsticks for a good long interview later that week then the bell rang up at the castle signaling the end of the lesson 
 
 well harry rita skeeter called merrily to him as he set off with ron and hermione until friday night then hagrid 
 
 twist everything he says harry said under his breath 
 
 just as long as he import those skrewts illegally or anything said hermione desperately they looked at one another it was exactly the sort of thing hagrid might do 
 
 been in loads of trouble before and dumbledores never sacked him said ron consolingly worst that can happen is have to get rid of the skrewts sorrydid i say worst i meant best 
 
 harry and hermione laughed and feeling slightly more cheerful went off to lunch 
 
 harry thoroughly enjoyed double divination that afternoon they were still doing star charts and predictions but now that he and ron were friends once more the whole thing seemed very funny again professor trelawney who had been so pleased with the pair of them when they had been predicting their own horrific deaths quickly became irritated as they sniggered through her explanation of the various ways in which pluto could disrupt everyday life 
 
 i would think she said in a mystical whisper that did not conceal her obvious annoyance that some of us she stared very meaningfully at harry might be a little less frivolous had they seen what i have seen during my crystal gazing last night as i sat here absorbed in my needlework the urge to consult the orb overpowered me i arose i settled myself before it and i gazed into its crystalline depthsand what do you think i saw gazing back at me 
 
 an ugly old bat in outsize specs ron muttered under his breath 
 
 harry fought hard to keep his face straight 
 
 death my dears 
 
 parvati and lavender both put their hands over their mouths looking horrified 
 
 yes said professor trelawney nodding impressively it comes ever closer it circles overhead like a vulture ever lowerever lower over the castle 
 
 she stared pointedly at harry who yawned very widely and obviously 
 
 be a bit more impressive if she done it about eighty times before harry said as they finally regained the fresh air of the staircase beneath professor room but if dropped dead every time told me going to be a medical miracle 
 
 be a sort of ghost said ron chortling as they passed the bloody baron going in the opposite direction his wide eyes staring sinisterly at least we get homework i hope hermione got loads off professor vector i love not working when she is 
 
 but hermione at dinner nor was she in the library when they went to look for her afterward the only person in there was viktor krum ron hovered behind the bookshelves for a while watching krum debating in whispers with harry whether he should ask for an autograph but then ron realized that six or seven girls were lurking in the next row of books debating exactly the same thing and he lost his enthusiasm for the idea 
 
 wonder where got to ron said as he and harry went back to gryffindor tower 
 
 dunnobalderdash 
 
 but the fat lady had barely begun to swing forward when the sound of racing feet behind them announced arrival 
 
 harry she panted skidding to a halt beside him the fat lady stared down at her eyebrows raised harry got to come got to come the most amazing happened please 
 
 she seized arm and started to try to drag him back along the corridor 
 
 the matter harry said 
 
 show you when we get there oh come on quick 
 
 harry looked around at ron he looked back at harry intrigued 
 
 okay harry said starting off back down the corridor with hermione ron hurrying to keep up 
 
 oh mind me the fat lady called irritably after them apologize for bothering me just hang here wide open until you get back shall i 
 
 yeah thanks ron shouted over his shoulder 
 
 hermione where are we going harry asked after she had led them down through six floors and started down the marble staircase into the entrance hall 
 
 see see in a minute said hermione excitedly 
 
 she turned left at the bottom of the staircase and hurried toward the door through which cedric diggory had gone the night after the goblet of fire had regurgitated his and names harry had never been through here before he and ron followed hermione down a flight of stone steps but instead of ending up in a gloomy underground passage like the one that led to dungeon they found themselves in a broad stone corridor brightly lit with torches and decorated with cheerful paintings that were mainly of food 
 
 oh hang on said harry slowly halfway down the corridor wait a minute hermione 
 
 what she turned around to look at him anticipation all over her face 
 
 i know what this is about said harry 
 
 he nudged ron and pointed to the painting just behind hermione it showed a gigantic silver fruit bowl 
 
 hermione said ron cottoning on trying to rope us into that spew stuff again 
 
 no no not she said hastily and not spew ron 
 
 changed the name have you said ron frowning at her what are we now then the liberation front not barging into that kitchen and trying to make them stop work not doing it 
 
 not asking you to hermione said impatiently i came down here just now to talk to them all and i found oh come on harry i want to show you 
 
 she seized his arm again pulled him in front of the picture of the giant fruit bowl stretched out her forefinger and tickled the huge green pear it began to squirm chuckling and suddenly turned into a large green door handle hermione seized it pulled the door open and pushed harry hard in the back forcing him inside 
 
 he had one brief glimpse of an enormous room large as the great hall above it with mounds of glittering brass pots and pans heaped around the stone walls and a great brick fireplace at the other end when something small hurtled toward him from the middle of the room squealing harry potter sir harry potter 
 
 next second all the wind had been knocked out of him as the squealing elf hit him hard in the midriff hugging him so tightly he thought his ribs would break 
 
 harry gasped 
 
 it is dobby sir it is squealed the voice from somewhere around his navel dobby has been hoping and hoping to see harry potter sir and harry potter has come to see him sir 
 
 dobby let go and stepped back a few paces beaming up at harry his enormous green eyes brimming with tears of happiness he looked almost exactly as harry remembered him the nose the batlike ears the long fingers and feet all except the clothes which were very different 
 
 when dobby had worked for the malfoys he had always worn the same filthy old pillowcase now however he was wearing the strangest assortment of garments harry had ever seen he had done an even worse job of dressing himself than the wizards at the world cup he was wearing a tea cozy for a hat on which he had pinned a number of bright badges a tie patterned with horseshoes over a bare chest a pair of what looked like soccer shorts and odd socks one of these harry saw was the black one harry had removed from his own foot and tricked mr malfoy into giving dobby thereby setting dobby free the other was covered in pink and orange stripes 
 
 dobby you doing here harry said in amazement 
 
 dobby has come to work at hogwarts sir dobby squealed excitedly professor dumbledore gave dobby and winky jobs sir 
 
 winky said harry here too 
 
 yes sir yes said dobby and he seized hand and pulled him off into the kitchen between the four long wooden tables that stood there each of these tables harry noticed as he passed them was positioned exactly beneath the four house tables above in the great hall at the moment they were clear of food dinner having finished but he supposed that an hour ago they had been laden with dishes that were then sent up through the ceiling to their counterparts above 
 
 at least a hundred little elves were standing around the kitchen beaming bowing and curtsying as dobby led harry past them they were all wearing the same uniform a tea towel stamped with the hogwarts crest and tied as had been like a toga 
 
 dobby stopped in front of the brick fireplace and pointed 
 
 winky sir he said 
 
 winky was sitting on a stool by the fire unlike dobby she had obviously not foraged for clothes she was wearing a neat little skirt and blouse with a matching blue hat which had holes in it for her large ears however while every one of strange collection of garments was so clean and well cared for that it looked winky was plainly not taking care other clothes at all there were soup stains all down her blouse and a burn in her skirt 
 
 hello winky said harry 
 
 lip quivered then she burst into tears which spilled out of her great brown eyes and splashed down her front just as they had done at the quidditch world cup 
 
 oh dear said hermione she and ron had followed harry and dobby to the end of the kitchen winky cry please 
 
 but winky cried harder than ever dobby on the other hand beamed up at harry 
 
 would harry potter like a cup of tea he squeaked loudly over sobs 
 
 er yeah okay said harry 
 
 instantly about six came trotting up behind him bearing a large silver tray laden with a teapot cups for harry ron and hermione a milk jug and a large plate of biscuits 
 
 good service ron said in an impressed voice hermione frowned at him but the elves all looked delighted they bowed very low and retreated 
 
 how long have you been here dobby harry asked as dobby handed around the tea 
 
 only a week harry potter sir said dobby happily dobby came to see professor dumbledore sir you see sir it is very difficult for a who has been dismissed to get a new position sir very difficult indeed 
 
 at this winky howled even harder her of a nose dribbling all down her front though she made no effort to stem the flow 
 
 dobby has traveled the country for two whole years sir trying to find work dobby squeaked but dobby found work sir because dobby wants paying now 
 
 the all around the kitchen who had been listening and watching with interest all looked away at these words as though dobby had said something rude and embarrassing hermione however said good for you dobby 
 
 thank you miss said dobby grinning toothily at her but most wizards want a who wants paying miss not the point of a they says and they slammed the door in face dobby likes work but he wants to wear clothes and he wants to be paid harry likes being free 
 
 the hogwarts had now started edging away from dobby as though he were carrying something contagious winky however remained where she was though there was a definite increase in the volume other crying 
 
 and then harry potter dobby goes to visit winky and finds out winky has been freed too sir said dobby delightedly 
 
 at this winky flung herself forward off her stool and lay on the flagged stone floor beating her tiny fists upon it and positively screaming with misery hermione hastily dropped down to her knees beside her and tried to comfort her but nothing she said made the slightest difference dobby continued with his story shouting shrilly over screeches 
 
 and then dobby had the idea harry potter sir why dobby and winky find work together dobby says where is there enough work for two says winky and dobby thinks and it comes to him sir hogwarts so dobby and winky came to see professor dumbledore sir and professor dumbledore took us on 
 
 dobby beamed very brightly and happy tears welled in his eyes again 
 
 and professor dumbledore says he will pay dobby sir if dobby wants paying and so dobby is a free elf sir and dobby gets a galleon a week and one day off a month 
 
 not very much hermione shouted indignantly from the floor over continued screaming and 
 
 professor dumbledore offered dobby ten galleons a week and weekends off said dobby suddenly giving a little shiver as though the prospect of so much leisure and riches were frightening but dobby beat him down likes freedom miss but he wanting too much miss he likes work better 
 
 and how much is professor dumbledore paying you winky hermione asked kindly 
 
 if she had thought this would cheer up winky she was wildly mistaken winky did stop crying but when she sat up she was glaring at hermione through her massive brown eyes her whole face sopping wet and suddenly furious 
 
 winky is a disgraced elf but winky is not yet getting paid she squeaked winky is not sunk so low as that winky is properly ashamed of being freed 
 
 ashamed said hermione blankly but winky come on mr crouch who should be ashamed not you you do anything wrong he was really horrible to you 
 
 but at these words winky clapped her hands over the holes in her hat flattening her ears so that she hear a word and screeched you is not insulting my master miss you is not insulting mr crouch mr crouch is a good wizard miss mr crouch is right to sack bad winky 
 
 winky is having trouble adjusting harry potter squeaked dobby confidentially winky forgets she is not bound to mr crouch anymore she is allowed to speak her mind now but she do it 
 
 speak their minds about their masters then harry asked 
 
 oh no sir no said dobby looking suddenly serious tis part of the enslavement sir we keeps their secrets and our silence sir we upholds the honor and we never speaks ill of them though professor dumbledore told dobby he does not insist upon this professor dumbledore said we is free to to 
 
 dobby looked suddenly nervous and beckoned harry closer harry bent forward dobby whispered he said we is free to call him a a barmy old codger if we likes sir 
 
 dobby gave a frightened sort of giggle 
 
 but dobby is not wanting to harry potter he said talking normally again and shaking his head so that his ears flapped dobby likes professor dumbledore very much sir and is proud to keep his secrets and our silence for him 
 
 but you can say what you like about the malfoys now harry asked him grinning 
 
 a slightly fearful look came into immense eyes 
 
 dobby dobby could he said doubtfully he squared his small shoulders dobby could tell harry potter that his old masters were were bad dark wizards 
 
 dobby stood for a moment quivering all over by his own daring then he rushed over to the nearest table and began banging his head on it very hard squealing bad dobby bad dobby 
 
 harry seized dobby by the back of his tie and pulled him away from the table 
 
 thank you harry potter thank you said dobby breathlessly rubbing his head 
 
 you just need a bit of practice harry said 
 
 practice squealed winky furiously you is ought to be ashamed of yourself dobby talking that way about your masters 
 
 they my masters anymore winky said dobby defiantly dobby care what they think anymore 
 
 oh you is a bad elf dobby moaned winky tears leaking down her face once more my poor mr crouch what is he doing without winky he is needing me he is needing my help i is looking after the crouches all my life and my mother is doing it before me and my grandmother is doing it before heroh what is they saying if they knew winky was freed oh the shame the shame she buried her face in her skirt again and bawled 
 
 winky said hermione firmly quite sure mr crouch is getting along perfectly well without you seen him you know 
 
 you is seeing my master said winky breathlessly raising her tearstained face out of her skirt once more and goggling at hermione you is seeing him here at hogwarts 
 
 yes said hermione he and mr bagman are judges in the triwizard tournament 
 
 mr bagman comes too squeaked winky and to harry s great surprise and and too by the looks on their faces she looked angry again mr bagman is a bad wizard a very bad wizard my master liking him oh no not at all 
 
 bagman bad said harry 
 
 oh yes winky said nodding her head furiously my master is telling winky some things but winky is not sayingwinky winky keeps her secrets 
 
 she dissolved yet again in tears they could hear her sobbing into her skirt poor master poor master no winky to help him no more 
 
 they get another sensible word out of winky they left her to her crying and finished their tea while dobby chatted happily about his life as a free elf and his plans for his wages 
 
 dobby is going to buy a sweater next harry potter he said happily pointing at his bare chest 
 
 tell you what dobby said ron who seemed to have taken a great liking to the elf give you the one my mum knits me this christmas i always get one from her you mind maroon do you 
 
 dobby was delighted 
 
 we might have to shrink it a bit to fit you ron told him but go well with your tea cozy 
 
 as they prepared to take their leave many of the surrounding elves pressed in upon them offering snacks to take back upstairs hermione refused with a pained look at the way the elves kept bowing and curtsying but harry and ron loaded their pockets with cream cakes and pies 
 
 thanks a lot harry said to the elves who had all clustered around the door to say good night see you dobby 
 
 harry pottercan dobby come and see you sometimes sir dobby asked tentatively 
 
 course you can said harry and dobby beamed 
 
 you know what said ron once he hermione and harry had left the kitchens behind and were climbing the steps into the entrance hall again all these years been really impressed with fred and george nicking food from the kitchens well not exactly difficult is it they wait to give it away 
 
 i think this is the best thing that could have happened to those elves you know said hermione leading the way back up the marble staircase dobby coming to work here i mean the other elves will see how happy he is being free and slowly dawn on them that they want that too 
 
 hope they look too closely at winky said harry 
 
 oh cheer up said hermione though she sounded a bit doubtful once the worn off and got used to hogwarts see how much better off she is without that crouch man 
 
 she seems to love him said ron thickly he had just started on a cream cake think much of bagman though does she said harry wonder what crouch says at home about him 
 
 probably says not a very good head of department said hermione and face got a point he 
 
 still rather work for him than old crouch said ron at least got a sense of humor 
 
 let percy hear you saying that hermione said smiling slightly 
 
 yeah well percy want to work for anyone with a sense of humor would he said ron now starting on a chocolate eclair percy recognize a joke if it danced naked in front of him wearing tea cozy

 harry ron and hermione went up to the owlery that evening to find pigwidgeon so that harry could send sirius a letter telling him that he had managed to get past his dragon unscathed on the way harry filled ron in on everything sirius had told him about karkaroff though shocked at first to hear that karkaroff had been a death eater by the time they entered the owlery ron was saying that they ought to have suspected it all along

 sure enough when they entered the gryffindor common room it exploded with cheers and yells again there were mountains of cakes and flagons of pumpkin juice and butterbeer on every surface lee jordan had let off some fireworks so that the air was thick with stars and sparks and dean thomas who was very good at drawing had put up some impressive new banners most of which depicted harry zooming around the head on his firebolt though a couple showed cedric with his head on fire 
 
 harry helped himself to food he had almost forgotten what it was like to feel properly hungry and sat down with ron and hermione he believe how happy he felt he had ron back on his side gotten through the first task and he have to face the second one for three months 
 
 blimey this is heavy said lee jordan picking up the golden egg which harry had left on a table and weighing it in his hands open it harry go on just see inside it 
 
 supposed to work out the clue on his own hermione said swiftly in the tournament rules 
 
 i was supposed to work out how to get past the dragon on my own too harry muttered so only hermione could hear him and she grinned rather guiltily 
 
 yeah go on harry open it several people echoed 
 
 lee passed harry the egg and harry dug his fingernails into the groove that ran all the way around it and prised it open 
 
 it was hollow and completely empty but the moment harry opened it the most horrible noise a loud and screechy wailing filled the room the nearest thing to it harry had ever heard was the ghost orchestra at nearly headless deathday party who had all been playing the musical saw 
 
 shut it fred bellowed his hands over his ears 
 
 what was that said seamus finnigan staring at the egg as harry slammed it shut again sounded like a bansheemaybe got to get past one of those next harry 
 
 it was someone being tortured said neville who had gone very white and spilled sausage rolls all over the floor going to have to fight the cruciatus curse 
 
 be a prat neville illegal said george they use the cruciatus curse on the champions i thought it sounded a bit like percy singingmaybe got to attack him while in the shower harry 
 
 want a jam tart hermione said fred 
 
 hermione looked doubtfully at the plate he was offering her fred grinned 
 
 all right he said i done anything to them the custard creams got to watch 
 
 neville who had just bitten into a custard cream choked and spat it out fred laughed 
 
 just my little joke neville 
 
 hermione took a jam tart then she said did you get all this from the kitchens fred 
 
 yep said fred grinning at her he put on a squeak and imitated a anything we can get you sir anything at all dead helpfulget me a roast ox if i said i was peckish 
 
 how do you get in there hermione said in an innocently casual sort of voice 
 
 easy said fred concealed door behind a painting of a bowl of fruit just tickle the pear and it giggles and he stopped and looked suspiciously at her why 
 
 nothing said hermione quickly 
 
 going to try and lead the out on strike now are you said george going to give up all the leaflet stuff and try and stir them up into rebellion 
 
 several people chortled hermione answer 
 
 you go upsetting them and telling them got to take clothes and salaries said fred warningly put them off their cooking 
 
 just then neville caused a slight diversion by turning into a large canary 
 
 oh sorry neville fred shouted over all the laughter i forgot it was the custard creams we hexed 
 
 within a minute however neville had molted and once his feathers had fallen off he reappeared looking entirely normal he even joined in laughing 
 
 canary creams fred shouted to the excitable crowd george and i invented them seven sickles each a bargain 
 
 it was nearly one in the morning when harry finally went up to the dormitory with ron neville seamus and dean before he pulled the curtains of his shut harry set his tiny model of the hungarian horntail on the table next to his bed where it yawned curled up and closed its eyes really harry thought as he pulled the hangings on his closed hagrid had a pointthey were all right really dragons 
 
 
 
 the start of december brought wind and sleet to hogwarts drafty though the castle always was in winter harry was glad of its fires and thick walls every time he passed the durmstrang ship on the lake which was pitching in the high winds its black sails billowing against the dark skies he thought the beauxbatons caravan was likely to be pretty chilly too hagrid he noticed was keeping madame horses well provided with their preferred drink of whiskey the fumes wafting from the trough in the comer of their paddock was enough to make the entire care of magical creatures class this was unhelpful as they were still tending the horrible skrewts and needed their wits about them 
 
 not sure whether they hibernate or not hagrid told the shivering class in the windy pumpkin patch next lesson thought jus try an see if they fancied a jus settle em down in these boxes 
 
 there were now only ten skrewts left apparently their desire to kill one another had not been exercised out of them each of them was now approaching six feet in length their thick gray armor their powerful scuttling legs their ends their stings and their suckers combined to make the skrewts the most repulsive things harry had ever seen the class looked dispiritedly at the enormous boxes hagrid had brought out all lined with pillows and fluffy blankets 
 
 jus lead em in here hagrid said an put the lids on and see what happens 
 
 but the skrewts it transpired did not hibernate and did not appreciate being forced into boxes and nailed in hagrid was soon yelling don panic now don panic while the skrewts rampaged around the pumpkin patch now strewn with the smoldering wreckage of the boxes most of the class malfoy crabbe and goyle in the lead had fled into cabin through the back door and barricaded themselves in harry ron and hermione however were among those who remained outside trying to help hagrid together they managed to restrain and tie up nine of the skrewts though at the cost of numerous burns and cuts finally only one skrewt was left 
 
 don frighten him now hagrid shouted as ron and harry used their wands to shoot jets of fiery sparks at the skrewt which was advancing menacingly on them its sting arched quivering over its back jus try an slip the rope round his sting so he won hurt any o the others 
 
 yeah we want that ron shouted angrily as he and harry backed into the wall of cabin still holding the skrewt off with their sparks 
 
 well well wellthis does look like fun 
 
 rita skeeter was leaning on garden fence looking in at the mayhem she was wearing a thick magenta cloak with a furry purple collar today and her handbag was over her arm 
 
 hagrid launched himself forward on top of the skrewt that was cornering harry and ron and flattened it a blast of fire shot out of its end withering the pumpkin plants nearby 
 
 you hagrid asked rita skeeter as he slipped a loop of rope around the sting and tightened it 
 
 rita skeeter daily prophet reporter rita replied beaming at him her gold teeth glinted 
 
 thought dumbledore said you weren allowed inside the school anymore said hagrid frowning slightly as he got off the slightly squashed skrewt and started tugging it over to its fellows 
 
 rita acted as though she heard what hagrid had said 
 
 what are these fascinating creatures called she asked beaming still more widely 
 
 skrewts grunted hagrid 
 
 really said rita apparently full of lively interest never heard of them beforewhere do they come from 
 
 harry noticed a dull red flush rising up out of wild black beard and his heart sank where had hagrid got the skrewts from hermione who seemed to be thinking along these lines said quickly very interesting they they harry 
 
 what oh yeahouchinteresting said harry as she stepped on his foot 
 
 ah here harry said rita skeeter as she looked around so you like care of magical creatures do you one of your favorite lessons 
 
 yes said harry stoutly hagrid beamed at him 
 
 lovely said rita really lovely been teaching long she added to hagrid 
 
 harry noticed her eyes travel over dean who had a nasty cut across one cheek lavender whose robes were badly singed seamus who was nursing several burnt fingers and then to the cabin windows where most of the class stood their noses pressed against the glass waiting to see if the coast was clear 
 
 this is me second year said hagrid 
 
 lovelyi suppose like to give an interview would you share some of your experience of magical creatures the prophet does a zoological column every wednesday as sure you know we could feature these er scoots 
 
 skrewts hagrid said eagerly er yeah why not 
 
 harry had a very bad feeling about this but there was no way of communicating it to hagrid without rita skeeter seeing so he had to stand and watch in silence as hagrid and rita skeeter made arrangements to meet in the three broomsticks for a good long interview later that week then the bell rang up at the castle signaling the end of the lesson 
 
 well harry rita skeeter called merrily to him as he set off with ron and hermione until friday night then hagrid 
 
 twist everything he says harry said under his breath 
 
 just as long as he import those skrewts illegally or anything said hermione desperately they looked at one another it was exactly the sort of thing hagrid might do 
 
 been in loads of trouble before and dumbledores never sacked him said ron consolingly worst that can happen is have to get rid of the skrewts sorrydid i say worst i meant best 
 
 harry and hermione laughed and feeling slightly more cheerful went off to lunch 
 
 harry thoroughly enjoyed double divination that afternoon they were still doing star charts and predictions but now that he and ron were friends once more the whole thing seemed very funny again professor trelawney who had been so pleased with the pair of them when they had been predicting their own horrific deaths quickly became irritated as they sniggered through her explanation of the various ways in which pluto could disrupt everyday life 
 
 i would think she said in a mystical whisper that did not conceal her obvious annoyance that some of us she stared very meaningfully at harry might be a little less frivolous had they seen what i have seen during my crystal gazing last night as i sat here absorbed in my needlework the urge to consult the orb overpowered me i arose i settled myself before it and i gazed into its crystalline depthsand what do you think i saw gazing back at me 
 
 an ugly old bat in outsize specs ron muttered under his breath 
 
 harry fought hard to keep his face straight 
 
 death my dears 
 
 parvati and lavender both put their hands over their mouths looking horrified 
 
 yes said professor trelawney nodding impressively it comes ever closer it circles overhead like a vulture ever lowerever lower over the castle 
 
 she stared pointedly at harry who yawned very widely and obviously 
 
 be a bit more impressive if she done it about eighty times before harry said as they finally regained the fresh air of the staircase beneath professor room but if dropped dead every time told me going to be a medical miracle 
 
 be a sort of ghost said ron chortling as they passed the bloody baron going in the opposite direction his wide eyes staring sinisterly at least we get homework i hope hermione got loads off professor vector i love not working when she is 
 
 but hermione at dinner nor was she in the library when they went to look for her afterward the only person in there was viktor krum ron hovered behind the bookshelves for a while watching krum debating in whispers with harry whether he should ask for an autograph but then ron realized that six or seven girls were lurking in the next row of books debating exactly the same thing and he lost his enthusiasm for the idea 
 
 wonder where got to ron said as he and harry went back to gryffindor tower 
 
 dunnobalderdash 
 
 but the fat lady had barely begun to swing forward when the sound of racing feet behind them announced arrival 
 
 harry she panted skidding to a halt beside him the fat lady stared down at her eyebrows raised harry got to come got to come the most amazing happened please 
 
 she seized arm and started to try to drag him back along the corridor 
 
 the matter harry said 
 
 show you when we get there oh come on quick 
 
 harry looked around at ron he looked back at harry intrigued 
 
 okay harry said starting off back down the corridor with hermione ron hurrying to keep up 
 
 oh mind me the fat lady called irritably after them apologize for bothering me just hang here wide open until you get back shall i 
 
 yeah thanks ron shouted over his shoulder 
 
 hermione where are we going harry asked after she had led them down through six floors and started down the marble staircase into the entrance hall 
 
 see see in a minute said hermione excitedly 
 
 she turned left at the bottom of the staircase and hurried toward the door through which cedric diggory had gone the night after the goblet of fire had regurgitated his and names harry had never been through here before he and ron followed hermione down a flight of stone steps but instead of ending up in a gloomy underground passage like the one that led to dungeon they found themselves in a broad stone corridor brightly lit with torches and decorated with cheerful paintings that were mainly of food 
 
 oh hang on said harry slowly halfway down the corridor wait a minute hermione 
 
 what she turned around to look at him anticipation all over her face 
 
 i know what this is about said harry 
 
 he nudged ron and pointed to the painting just behind hermione it showed a gigantic silver fruit bowl 
 
 hermione said ron cottoning on trying to rope us into that spew stuff again 
 
 no no not she said hastily and not spew ron 
 
 changed the name have you said ron frowning at her what are we now then the liberation front not barging into that kitchen and trying to make them stop work not doing it 
 
 not asking you to hermione said impatiently i came down here just now to talk to them all and i found oh come on harry i want to show you 
 
 she seized his arm again pulled him in front of the picture of the giant fruit bowl stretched out her forefinger and tickled the huge green pear it began to squirm chuckling and suddenly turned into a large green door handle hermione seized it pulled the door open and pushed harry hard in the back forcing him inside 
 
 he had one brief glimpse of an enormous room large as the great hall above it with mounds of glittering brass pots and pans heaped around the stone walls and a great brick fireplace at the other end when something small hurtled toward him from the middle of the room squealing harry potter sir harry potter 
 
 next second all the wind had been knocked out of him as the squealing elf hit him hard in the midriff hugging him so tightly he thought his ribs would break 
 
 harry gasped 
 
 it is dobby sir it is squealed the voice from somewhere around his navel dobby has been hoping and hoping to see harry potter sir and harry potter has come to see him sir 
 
 dobby let go and stepped back a few paces beaming up at harry his enormous green eyes brimming with tears of happiness he looked almost exactly as harry remembered him the nose the batlike ears the long fingers and feet all except the clothes which were very different 
 
 when dobby had worked for the malfoys he had always worn the same filthy old pillowcase now however he was wearing the strangest assortment of garments harry had ever seen he had done an even worse job of dressing himself than the wizards at the world cup he was wearing a tea cozy for a hat on which he had pinned a number of bright badges a tie patterned with horseshoes over a bare chest a pair of what looked like soccer shorts and odd socks one of these harry saw was the black one harry had removed from his own foot and tricked mr malfoy into giving dobby thereby setting dobby free the other was covered in pink and orange stripes 
 
 dobby you doing here harry said in amazement 
 
 dobby has come to work at hogwarts sir dobby squealed excitedly professor dumbledore gave dobby and winky jobs sir 
 
 winky said harry here too 
 
 yes sir yes said dobby and he seized hand and pulled him off into the kitchen between the four long wooden tables that stood there each of these tables harry noticed as he passed them was positioned exactly beneath the four house tables above in the great hall at the moment they were clear of food dinner having finished but he supposed that an hour ago they had been laden with dishes that were then sent up through the ceiling to their counterparts above 
 
 at least a hundred little elves were standing around the kitchen beaming bowing and curtsying as dobby led harry past them they were all wearing the same uniform a tea towel stamped with the hogwarts crest and tied as had been like a toga 
 
 dobby stopped in front of the brick fireplace and pointed 
 
 winky sir he said 
 
 winky was sitting on a stool by the fire unlike dobby she had obviously not foraged for clothes she was wearing a neat little skirt and blouse with a matching blue hat which had holes in it for her large ears however while every one of strange collection of garments was so clean and well cared for that it looked winky was plainly not taking care other clothes at all there were soup stains all down her blouse and a burn in her skirt 
 
 hello winky said harry 
 
 lip quivered then she burst into tears which spilled out of her great brown eyes and splashed down her front just as they had done at the quidditch world cup 
 
 oh dear said hermione she and ron had followed harry and dobby to the end of the kitchen winky cry please 
 
 but winky cried harder than ever dobby on the other hand beamed up at harry 
 
 would harry potter like a cup of tea he squeaked loudly over sobs 
 
 er yeah okay said harry 
 
 instantly about six came trotting up behind him bearing a large silver tray laden with a teapot cups for harry ron and hermione a milk jug and a large plate of biscuits 
 
 good service ron said in an impressed voice hermione frowned at him but the elves all looked delighted they bowed very low and retreated 
 
 how long have you been here dobby harry asked as dobby handed around the tea 
 
 only a week harry potter sir said dobby happily dobby came to see professor dumbledore sir you see sir it is very difficult for a who has been dismissed to get a new position sir very difficult indeed 
 
 at this winky howled even harder her of a nose dribbling all down her front though she made no effort to stem the flow 
 
 dobby has traveled the country for two whole years sir trying to find work dobby squeaked but dobby found work sir because dobby wants paying now 
 
 the all around the kitchen who had been listening and watching with interest all looked away at these words as though dobby had said something rude and embarrassing hermione however said good for you dobby 
 
 thank you miss said dobby grinning toothily at her but most wizards want a who wants paying miss not the point of a they says and they slammed the door in face dobby likes work but he wants to wear clothes and he wants to be paid harry likes being free 
 
 the hogwarts had now started edging away from dobby as though he were carrying something contagious winky however remained where she was though there was a definite increase in the volume other crying 
 
 and then harry potter dobby goes to visit winky and finds out winky has been freed too sir said dobby delightedly 
 
 at this winky flung herself forward off her stool and lay on the flagged stone floor beating her tiny fists upon it and positively screaming with misery hermione hastily dropped down to her knees beside her and tried to comfort her but nothing she said made the slightest difference dobby continued with his story shouting shrilly over screeches 
 
 and then dobby had the idea harry potter sir why dobby and winky find work together dobby says where is there enough work for two says winky and dobby thinks and it comes to him sir hogwarts so dobby and winky came to see professor dumbledore sir and professor dumbledore took us on 
 
 dobby beamed very brightly and happy tears welled in his eyes again 
 
 and professor dumbledore says he will pay dobby sir if dobby wants paying and so dobby is a free elf sir and dobby gets a galleon a week and one day off a month 
 
 not very much hermione shouted indignantly from the floor over continued screaming and 
 
 professor dumbledore offered dobby ten galleons a week and weekends off said dobby suddenly giving a little shiver as though the prospect of so much leisure and riches were frightening but dobby beat him down likes freedom miss but he wanting too much miss he likes work better 
 
 and how much is professor dumbledore paying you winky hermione asked kindly 
 
 if she had thought this would cheer up winky she was wildly mistaken winky did stop crying but when she sat up she was glaring at hermione through her massive brown eyes her whole face sopping wet and suddenly furious 
 
 winky is a disgraced elf but winky is not yet getting paid she squeaked winky is not sunk so low as that winky is properly ashamed of being freed 
 
 ashamed said hermione blankly but winky come on mr crouch who should be ashamed not you you do anything wrong he was really horrible to you 
 
 but at these words winky clapped her hands over the holes in her hat flattening her ears so that she hear a word and screeched you is not insulting my master miss you is not insulting mr crouch mr crouch is a good wizard miss mr crouch is right to sack bad winky 
 
 winky is having trouble adjusting harry potter squeaked dobby confidentially winky forgets she is not bound to mr crouch anymore she is allowed to speak her mind now but she do it 
 
 speak their minds about their masters then harry asked 
 
 oh no sir no said dobby looking suddenly serious tis part of the enslavement sir we keeps their secrets and our silence sir we upholds the honor and we never speaks ill of them though professor dumbledore told dobby he does not insist upon this professor dumbledore said we is free to to 
 
 dobby looked suddenly nervous and beckoned harry closer harry bent forward dobby whispered he said we is free to call him a a barmy old codger if we likes sir 
 
 dobby gave a frightened sort of giggle 
 
 but dobby is not wanting to harry potter he said talking normally again and shaking his head so that his ears flapped dobby likes professor dumbledore very much sir and is proud to keep his secrets and our silence for him 
 
 but you can say what you like about the malfoys now harry asked him grinning 
 
 a slightly fearful look came into immense eyes 
 
 dobby dobby could he said doubtfully he squared his small shoulders dobby could tell harry potter that his old masters were were bad dark wizards 
 
 dobby stood for a moment quivering all over by his own daring then he rushed over to the nearest table and began banging his head on it very hard squealing bad dobby bad dobby 
 
 harry seized dobby by the back of his tie and pulled him away from the table 
 
 thank you harry potter thank you said dobby breathlessly rubbing his head 
 
 you just need a bit of practice harry said 
 
 practice squealed winky furiously you is ought to be ashamed of yourself dobby talking that way about your masters 
 
 they my masters anymore winky said dobby defiantly dobby care what they think anymore 
 
 oh you is a bad elf dobby moaned winky tears leaking down her face once more my poor mr crouch what is he doing without winky he is needing me he is needing my help i is looking after the crouches all my life and my mother is doing it before me and my grandmother is doing it before heroh what is they saying if they knew winky was freed oh the shame the shame she buried her face in her skirt again and bawled 
 
 winky said hermione firmly quite sure mr crouch is getting along perfectly well without you seen him you know 
 
 you is seeing my master said winky breathlessly raising her tearstained face out of her skirt once more and goggling at hermione you is seeing him here at hogwarts 
 
 yes said hermione he and mr bagman are judges in the triwizard tournament 
 
 mr bagman comes too squeaked winky and to harry s great surprise and and too by the looks on their faces she looked angry again mr bagman is a bad wizard a very bad wizard my master liking him oh no not at all 
 
 bagman bad said harry 
 
 oh yes winky said nodding her head furiously my master is telling winky some things but winky is not sayingwinky winky keeps her secrets 
 
 she dissolved yet again in tears they could hear her sobbing into her skirt poor master poor master no winky to help him no more 
 
 they get another sensible word out of winky they left her to her crying and finished their tea while dobby chatted happily about his life as a free elf and his plans for his wages 
 
 dobby is going to buy a sweater next harry potter he said happily pointing at his bare chest 
 
 tell you what dobby said ron who seemed to have taken a great liking to the elf give you the one my mum knits me this christmas i always get one from her you mind maroon do you 
 
 dobby was delighted 
 
 we might have to shrink it a bit to fit you ron told him but go well with your tea cozy 
 
 as they prepared to take their leave many of the surrounding elves pressed in upon them offering snacks to take back upstairs hermione refused with a pained look at the way the elves kept bowing and curtsying but harry and ron loaded their pockets with cream cakes and pies 
 
 thanks a lot harry said to the elves who had all clustered around the door to say good night see you dobby 
 
 harry pottercan dobby come and see you sometimes sir dobby asked tentatively 
 
 course you can said harry and dobby beamed 
 
 you know what said ron once he hermione and harry had left the kitchens behind and were climbing the steps into the entrance hall again all these years been really impressed with fred and george nicking food from the kitchens well not exactly difficult is it they wait to give it away 
 
 i think this is the best thing that could have happened to those elves you know said hermione leading the way back up the marble staircase dobby coming to work here i mean the other elves will see how happy he is being free and slowly dawn on them that they want that too 
 
 hope they look too closely at winky said harry 
 
 oh cheer up said hermione though she sounded a bit doubtful once the worn off and got used to hogwarts see how much better off she is without that crouch man 
 
 she seems to love him said ron thickly he had just started on a cream cake think much of bagman though does she said harry wonder what crouch says at home about him 
 
 probably says not a very good head of department said hermione and face got a point he 
 
 still rather work for him than old crouch said ron at least got a sense of humor 
 
 let percy hear you saying that hermione said smiling slightly 
 
 yeah well percy want to work for anyone with a sense of humor would he said ron now starting on a chocolate eclair percy recognize a joke if it danced naked in front of him wearing tea cozy 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the goblet of fire 
 

lionfish nov chapter the eye of the snakecontents prev chapter next chapter 
 hermione ploughed her way back to cabin through two feet of snow on sunday morning harry and ron wanted to go with her but their mountain of homework had reached an alarming height again so they remained grudgingly in the common room tying to ignore the gleeful shouts drifting up from the grounds outside where students were enjoying themselves skating on the frozen lake tobogganing and worst of all bewitching snowballs to zoom up to gryffindor tower and rap hard on the windows 
 
 oi bellowed ron finally losing patience and sticking his head out of the window i am a prefect and if one more snowball hits this windowouch 
 
 he withdrew his head sharply his face covered in snow 
 
 fred and george he said bitterly slamming the window behind him gits 
 
 hermione returned from just before lunch shivering slightly her robes damp to the knees 
 
 so said ron looking up when she entered got all his lessons planned for him 
 
 well i tried she said dully sinking into a chair beside harry she pulled out her wand and gave it a complicated little wave so that hot air streamed out of the tip she then pointed this at her robes which began to steam as they dried out he even there when i arrived i was knocking for at least half an hour and then he came stumping out of the forest 
 
 harry groaned the forbidden forest was teeming with the kind of creatures most likely to get hagrid the sack he keeping in there did he say he asked 
 
 no said hermione miserably he says he wants them to be a surprise i tried to explain about umbridge but he just get it he kept saying nobody in their right mind would rather study knarls than chimaerasoh i think got a chimaera she added at the appalled look on harry and faces but not for lack of trying from what he said about how hard it is to get eggs i know how many times i told him be better off following plan i honestly think he listened to half of what i said in a bit of a funny mood you know he still say how he got all those injuries 
 
 reappearance at the staff table at breakfast next day was not greeted by enthusiasm from all students some like fred george and lee roared with delight and sprinted up the aisle between the gryffindor and hufflepuff tables to wring enormous hand others like parvati and lavender exchanged gloomy looks and shook their heads harry knew that many of them preferred professor lessons and the worst of it was that a very small unbiased part of him knew that they had good reason idea of an interesting class was not one where there was a risk that somebody might have their head ripped off 
 
 it was with a certain amount of apprehension that harry ron and hermione headed down to on tuesday heavily muffled against the cold harry was worried not only about what hagrid might have decided to teach them but also about how the rest of the class particularly malfoy and his cronies would behave if umbridge was watching them 
 
 however the high inquisitor was nowhere to be seen as they struggled through the snow towards hagrid who stood waiting for them on the edge of the forest he did not present a reassuring sight the bruises that had been purple on saturday night were now tinged with green and yellow and some of his cuts still seemed to be bleeding harry could not understand this had hagrid perhaps been attacked by some creature whose venom prevented the wounds it inflicted from healing as though to complete the ominous picture hagrid was carrying what looked like half a dead cow over his shoulder 
 
 workin in here today hagrid called happily to the approaching students jerking his head back at the dark trees behind him bit more sheltered anyway they prefer the dark 
 
 what prefers the dark harry heard malfoy say sharply to crabbe and goyle a trace of panic in his voice what did he say prefers the darkdid you hear 
 
 harry remembered the only other occasion on which malfoy had entered the forest before now he had not been very brave then either he smiled to himself after the quidditch match anything that caused malfoy discomfort was all right with him 
 
 ready said hagrid cheerfully looking around at the class right well bin savin a trip inter the forest fer yer fifth year thought go an see these creatures in their natural habitat now what studyin today is pretty rare i reckon probably the person in britain managed ter train em 
 
 and sure trained are you said malfoy the panic in his voice even more pronounced only it be the first time brought wild stuff to class would it 
 
 the slytherins murmured agreement and a few gryffindors looked as though they thought malfoy had a fair point too 
 
 course trained said hagrid scowling and hoisting the dead cow a little higher on his shoulder 
 
 so what happened to your face then demanded malfoy 
 
 mind yer own business said hagrid angrily now if finished askin stupid questions follow me 
 
 he turned and strode straight into the forest nobody seemed much disposed to follow harry glanced at ron and hermione who sighed but nodded and the three of them set off after hagrid leading the rest of the class 
 
 they walked for about ten minutes until they reached a place where the trees stood so closely together that it was as dark as twilight and there was no snow at all on the ground with a grunt hagrid deposited his half a cow on the ground stepped back and turned to face his class most of whom were creeping from tree to tree towards him peering around nervously as though expecting to be set upon at any moment 
 
 gather roun gather roun hagrid encouraged now be attracted by the smell o the meat but going ter give em a call anyway cause like ter know me 
 
 he turned shook his shaggy head to get the hair out of his face and gave an odd shrieking cry that echoed through the dark trees like the call of some monstrous bird nobody laughed most of them looked too scared to make a sound 
 
 hagrid gave the shrieking cry again a minute passed in which the class continued to peer nervously over their shoulders and around trees for a first glimpse of whatever it was that was coming and then as hagrid shook his hair back for a third lime and expanded his enormous chest harry nudged ron and pointed into the black space between two gnarled yew trees 
 
 a pair of blank white shining eyes were growing larger through the gloom and a moment later the dragonish face neck and then skeletal body of a great black winged horse emerged from the darkness it surveyed the class for a few seconds swishing its long black tail then bowed its head and began to tear flesh from the dead cow with its pointed fangs 
 
 a great wave of relief broke over harry here at last was proof that he had not imagined these creatures that they were real hagrid knew about them too he looked eagerly at ron but ron was still staring around into the trees and after a few seconds he whispered why hagrid call again 
 
 most of the rest of the class were wearing expressions as confused and nervously expectant as and were still gazing everywhere but at the horse standing feet from them there were only two other people who seemed to be able to see them a stringy slytherin boy standing just behind goyle was watching the horse eating with an expression of great distaste on his face and neville whose eyes were following the swishing progress of the long black tail 
 
 oh an here comes another one said hagrid proudly as a second black horse appeared out of the dark trees folded its closer to its body and dipped its head to gorge on the meat now put yer hands up who can see em 
 
 immensely pleased to feel that he was at last going to understand the mystery of these horses harry raised his hand hagrid nodded at him 
 
 yeah yeah i knew be able ter harry he said seriously an you too neville eh an 
 
 excuse me said malfoy in a sneering voice but what exactly are we supposed to be seeing 
 
 for an answer hagrid pointed at the cow carcass on the ground the whole class stared at it for a few seconds then several people gasped and parvati squealed harry understood why bits of flesh stripping themselves away from the bones and vanishing into thin air had to look very odd indeed 
 
 doing it parvati demanded in a terrified voice retreating behind the nearest tree eating it 
 
 thestrals said hagrid proudly and hermione gave a soft oh of comprehension at shoulder hogwarts has got a whole herd of em in here now who knows 
 
 but really really unlucky interrupted parvati looking alarmed supposed to bring all sorts of horrible misfortune on people who see them professor trelawney told me once 
 
 no no no said hagrid chuckling jus superstition that is they aren unlucky dead clever an useful course this lot don get a lot o work mainly jus pullin the school carriages unless takin a long journey an don want ter apparatean another couple look 
 
 two more horses came quietly out of the trees one of them passing very close to parvati who shivered and pressed herself closer to the tree saying i think i felt something i think near me 
 
 don worry it won hurt yeh said hagrid patiently righ now who can tell me why some o yeh can see em an some 
 
 hermione raised her hand 
 
 go on then said hagrid beaming at her 
 
 the only people who can see thestrals she said are people who have seen death 
 
 exactly right said hagrid solemnly ten points ter gryffindor now thestrals 
 
 hem hem 
 
 professor umbridge had arrived she was standing a few feet away from harry wearing her green hat and cloak again her clipboard at the ready hagrid who had never heard fake cough before was gazing in some concern at the closest thestral evidently under the impression that it had made the sound 
 
 hem hem 
 
 oh hello hagrid said smiling having located the source of the noise 
 
 you received the note i sent to your cabin this morning said umbridge in the same loud slow voice she had used with him earlier as though she were addressing somebody both foreign and very slow telling you that i would be inspecting your lesson 
 
 oh yeah said hagrid brightly glad yeh found the place all righ well as you can see or i dunnocan you doin thestrals today 
 
 sorry said professor umbridge loudly cupping her hand around her ear and frowning what did you say 
 
 hagrid looked a little confused 
 
 erthestrals he said loudly bigerwinged horses yeh know 
 
 he flapped his gigantic arms hopefully professor umbridge raised her eyebrows at him and muttered as she made a note on her clipboard has to resort to crude sign language 
 
 well anyway said hagrid turning back to the class and looking slightly flustered erm what was i sayin 
 
 appears to have poor short term memory muttered umbridge loudly enough for everyone to hear her draco malfoy looked as though christmas had come a month early hermione on the other hand had turned scarlet with suppressed rage 
 
 oh yeah said hagrid throwing an uneasy glance at clipboard but ploughing on valiantly yeah i was gonna tell yeh how come we got a herd yeah so we started off with a male an five females this one he patted the first horse to have appeared name o tenebrus my special favourite firs one born here in the forest 
 
 are you aware umbridge said loudly interrupting him that the ministry of magic has classified thestrals as dangerous 
 
 heart sank like a stone but hagrid merely chuckled 
 
 thestrals aren dangerous all righ they might take a bite outta yeh if yeh really annoy them 
 
 shows signs of pleasure at idea of violence muttered umbridge scribbling on her clipboard again 
 
 nocome on said hagrid looking a little anxious now i mean a bite if yeh bait it won itbut thestrals have jus got a bad reputation because o the death thingpeople used ter think they were bad omens didn they jus didn understand did they 
 
 umbridge did not answer she finished writing her last note then looked up at hagrid and said again very loudly and slowly please continue teaching as usual i am going to walk she mimed walking malfoy and pansy parkinson were having silent fits of laughter among the students she pointed around at individual members of the class and ask them questions she pointed at her mouth to indicate talking 
 
 hagrid stared at her clearly at a complete loss to understand why she was acting as though he did not understand normal english hermione had tears of fury in her eyes now 
 
 you hag you evil hag she whispered as umbridge walked towards pansy parkinson i know what doing you awiul twisted vicious 
 
 erm anyway said hagrid clearly struggling to regain the flow of his lesson so thestrals yeah well loads o good stuff abou them 
 
 do you find said professor umbridge in a ringing voice to pansy parkinson that you are able to understand professor hagrid when he talks 
 
 just like hermione pansy had tears in her eyes but these were tears of laughter indeed her answer was almost incoherent because she was trying to suppress her giggles 
 
 no because well it sounds like grunting a lot of the time 
 
 umbridge scribbled on her clipboard the few unbruised bits of face flushed but he tried to act as though he had not heard answer 
 
 er yeah good stuff abou thestrals well once tamed like this lot never be lost again mazin sense o direction jus tell em where yeh want ter go 
 
 assuming they can understand you of course said malfoy loudly and pansy parkinson collapsed in a fit of renewed giggles professor umbridge smiled indulgently at them and then turned to neville 
 
 you can see the thestrals longbottom can you she said 
 
 neville nodded 
 
 who did you see die she asked her tone indifferent 
 
 my my grandad said neville 
 
 and what do you think of them she said waving her stubby hand at the horses who by now had stripped a great deal of the carcass down to bone 
 
 erm said neville nervously with a glance at hagrid well er ok 
 
 students are too intimidated to admit they are frightened muttered umbridge making another note on her clipboard 
 
 no said neville looking upset no not scared of them 
 
 quite all right said umbridge patting neville on the shoulder with what she evidently intended to be an understanding smile though it looked more like a leer to harry well hagrid she turned to look up at him again speaking once more in that loud slow voice i think got enough to be getting along with you will receive she mimed taking something from the air in front of her the results of your inspection she pointed at the clipboard in ten days time she held up ten stubby little fingers then her smile wider and more toadlike than ever before beneath her green hat she bustled from their midst leaving malfoy and pansy parkinson in fits of laughter hermione actually shaking with fury and neville looking confused and upset 
 
 that foul lying twisting old gargoyle stormed hermione half an hour later as they made their way back up to the castle through the channels they had made earlier in the snow you see what up to her thing about all over trying to make out some kind of dimwitted troll just because he had a giantess for a motherand oh not fair that really a bad lesson at alli mean all right if it had been skrewts again but thestrals are finein fact for hagrid really good 
 
 umbridge said dangerous said ron 
 
 well like hagrid said they can look after themselves said hermione impatiently and i suppose a teacher like usually show them to us before newt level but well they are very interesting they the way some people can see them and some i wish i could 
 
 do you harry asked her quietly 
 
 she looked suddenly horrorstruck 
 
 oh sorryno of course i was a really stupid thing to say 
 
 ok he said quickly worry 
 
 surprised so many people could see them said ron three in a class 
 
 yeah weasley we were just wondering said a malicious voice unheard by any of them in the muffling snow malfoy crabbe and goyle were walking along right behind them reckon if you saw someone snuff it be able to see the quaffle better 
 
 he crabbe and goyle roared with laughter as they pushed past on their way to the castle then broke into a chorus of weasley is our king ears turned scarlet 
 
 ignore them just ignore them intoned hermione pulling out her wand and performing the charm to produce hot air again so that she could melt them an easier path through the untouched snow between them and the greenhouses 
 
 december arrived bringing with it more snow and a positive avalanche of homework for the ron and prefect duties also became more and more onerous as christmas approached they were called upon to supervise the decoration of the castle you try putting up tinsel when peeves has got the other end and is trying to strangle you with it said ron to watch over first and spending their inside because of the bitter cold and cheeky little you know we definitely that rude when we were in first year said ron and to patrol the corridors in shifts with argus filch who suspected that the holiday spirit might show itself in an outbreak of wizard duels got dung for brains that one said ron furiously they were so busy that hermione had even stopped knitting elf hats and was fretting that she was down to her last three 
 
 all those poor elves i set free yet having to stay here over christmas because there enough hats 
 
 harry who had not had the heart to tell her that dobby was taking everything she made bent lower over his history of magic essay in any case he did not want to think about christmas for the first time in his school career he very much wanted to spend the holidays away from hogwarts between his quidditch ban and worry about whether or not hagrid was going to be put on probation he felt highly resentful towards the place at the moment the only thing he really looked forward to were the da meetings and they would have to stop over the holidays as nearly everybody in the da would be spending the time with their families hermione was going skiing with her parents something that greatly amused ron who had never heard of muggles strapping narrow strips of wood on to their feet to slide down mountains ron was going home to the burrow harry endured several days of envy before ron said in response to harry asking him how he was going to get home for christmas but coming too i say mum wrote and told me to invite you weeks ago 
 
 hermione rolled her eyes but spirits soared the thought of christmas at the burrow was truly wonderful though slightly marred by guilty feeling that he would not be able to spend the holiday with sirius he wondered whether he could possibly persuade mrs weasley to invite his godfather for the festivities even though he doubted whether dumbledore would permit sirius to leave grimmauld place anyway he could not help but think mrs weasley might not want him they were so often at loggerheads sirius had not contacted harry at all since his last appearance in the fire and although harry knew that with umbridge on constant watch it would be unwise to attempt to contact him he did not like to think of sirius alone in his old house perhaps pulling a lonely cracker with kreacher 
 
 harry arrived early in the room of requirement for the last da meeting before the holidays and was very glad he had because when the torches burst into flame he saw that dobby had taken it upon himself to decorate the place for christmas he could tell the elf had done it because nobody else would have strung a hundred golden baubles from the ceiling each showing a picture of face and bearing the legend have a very harry christmas 
 
 harry had only just managed to get the last of them down before the door creaked open and luna lovegood entered looking as dreamy as usual 
 
 hello she said vaguely looking around at what remained of the decorations these are nice did you put them up 
 
 no said harry it was dobby the 
 
 mistletoe said luna dreamily pointing at a large clump of white berries placed almost over head he jumped out from under it good thinking said luna very seriously often infested with nargles 
 
 harry was saved the necessity of asking what nargles are by the arrival of angelina katie and alicia all three of them were breathless and looked very cold 
 
 well said angelina dully pulling off her cloak and throwing it into a corner finally replaced you 
 
 replaced me said harry blankly 
 
 you and fred and george she said impatiently got another seeker 
 
 who said harry quickly 
 
 ginny weasley said katie 
 
 harry gaped at her 
 
 yeah i know said angelina pulling out her wand and flexing her arm but pretty good actually nothing on you of course she said throwing him a very dirty look but as we have you 
 
 harry bit back the retort he was longing to utter did she imagine for a second that he did not regret his expulsion from the team a hundred times more than she did 
 
 and what about the beaters he asked trying to keep his voice even 
 
 andrew kirke said alicia without enthusiasm and jack sloper neither of them are brilliant but compared to the rest of the idiots who turned up 
 
 the arrival of ron hermione and neville brought this depressing discussion to an end and within five minutes the room was full enough to prevent harry seeing burning reproachful looks 
 
 ok he said calling them all to order i thought this evening we should just go over the things done so far because the last meeting before the holidays and no point starting anything new right before a break 
 
 not doing anything new said zacharias smith in a disgruntled whisper loud enough to carry through the room if known that i have come 
 
 all really sorry harry tell you then said fred loudly 
 
 several people sniggered harry saw cho laughing and felt the familiar swooping sensation in his stomach as though he had missed a step going downstairs 
 
 we can practise in pairs said harry start with the impediment jinx for ten minutes then we can get out the cushions and try stunning again 
 
 they all divided up obediently harry partnered neville as usual the room was soon full of intermittent cries of impedimenta people froze for a minute or so during which their partner would stare aimlessly around the room watching other pairs at work then would unfreeze and take their turn at the jinx 
 
 neville had improved beyond all recognition after a while when harry had unfrozen three times in a row he had neville join ron and hermione again so that he could walk around the room and watch the others when he passed cho she beamed at him he resisted the temptation to walk past her several more times 
 
 after ten minutes on the impediment jinx they laid out cushions all over the floor and started practising stunning again space was really too confined to allow them all to work this spell at once half the group observed the others for a while then swapped over 
 
 harry felt himself positively swelling with pride as he watched them all true neville did stun padma patil rather than dean at whom he had been aiming but it was a much closer miss than usual and everybody else had made enormous progress 
 
 at the end of an hour harry called a halt 
 
 getting really good he said beaming around at them when we get back from the holidays we can start doing some of the big stuffmaybe even patronuses 
 
 there was a murmur of excitement the room began to clear in the usual twos and threes most people wished harry a happy christmas as they went feeling cheerful he collected up the cushions with ron and hermione and stacked them neatly away ron and hermione left before he did he hung back a little because cho was still there and he was hoping to receive a merry christmas from her 
 
 no you go on he heard her say to her friend marietta and his heart gave a jolt that seemed to take it into the region of his apple 
 
 he pretended to be straightening the cushion pile he was quite sure they were alone now and waited for her to speak instead he heard a hearty sniff 
 
 he turned and saw cho standing in the middle of the room tears pouring down her face 
 
 wha 
 
 he know what to do she was simply standing there crying silently 
 
 up he said feebly 
 
 she shook her head and wiped her eyes on her sleeve 
 
 she said thickly i suppose just learning all this stuff it just makes me wonder whether if known it all still be alive 
 
 heart sank right back past its usual spot and settled somewhere around his navel he ought to have known she wanted to talk about cedric 
 
 he did know this stuff harry said heavily he was really good at it or he could never have got to the middle of that maze but if voldemort really wants to kill you you stand a chance 
 
 she hiccoughed at the sound of name but stared at harry without flinching 
 
 you survived when you were just a baby she said quietly 
 
 yeah well said harry wearily moving towards the door i dunno why nor does anyone else so nothing to be proud of 
 
 oh go said cho sounding tearful again really sorry to get all upset like this i mean to 
 
 she hiccoughed again she was very pretty even when her eyes were red and puffy harry felt thoroughly miserable have been so pleased with just a merry christmas 
 
 i know it must be horrible for you she said mopping her eyes on her sleeve again me mentioning cedric when you saw him die i suppose you just want to forget about it 
 
 harry did not say anything to this it was quite true but he felt heartless saying it 
 
 a good teacher you know said cho with a watery smile never been able to stun anything before 
 
 thanks said harry awkwardly 
 
 they looked at each other for a long moment harry felt a burning desire to run from the room and at the same time a complete inability to move his feet 
 
 mistletoe said cho quietly pointing at the ceiling over his head 
 
 yeah said harry his mouth was very dry probably full of nargles though 
 
 what are nargles 
 
 no idea said harry she had moved closer his brain seemed to have been stunned have to ask loony luna i mean 
 
 cho made a funny noise halfway between a sob and a laugh she was even nearer to him now he could have counted the freckles on her nose 
 
 i really like you harry 
 
 he could not think a tingling sensation was spreading through him paralysing his arms legs and brain 
 
 she was much too close he could see every tear clinging to her eyelashes 
 
 he returned to the common room half an hour later to find hermione and ron in the best seats by the fire nearly everybody else had gone to bed hermione was writing a very long letter she had already filled half a roll of parchment which was dangling from the edge of the table ron was lying on the hearthrug trying to finish his transfiguration homework 
 
 what kept you he asked as harry sank into the armchair next to 
 
 harry answer he was in a state of shock half of him wanted to tell ron and hermione what had just happened but the other half wanted to take the secret with him to the grave 
 
 are you all right harry hermione asked peering at him over the tip of her quill 
 
 harry gave a shrug in truth he know whether he was all right or not up said ron hoisting himself up on his elbow to get a clearer view of harry happened 
 
 harry quite know how to set about telling them and still sure whether he wanted to just as he had decided not to say anything hermione took matters out of his hands 
 
 is it cho she asked in a businesslike way did she corner you after the meeting 
 
 numbly surprised harry nodded ron sniggered breaking off when hermione caught his eye 
 
 soerwhat did she want he asked in a mock casual voice 
 
 she harry began rather hoarsely he cleared his throat and tried again sheer 
 
 did you kiss asked hermione briskly 
 
 ron sat up so fast he sent his ink bottle flying all over the rug disregarding this completely he stared avidly at harry 
 
 well he demanded 
 
 harry looked from expression of mingled curiosity and hilarity to slight frown and nodded 
 
 ha 
 
 ron made a triumphant gesture with his fist and went into a raucous peal of laughter that made several over beside the window jump a reluctant grin spread over face as he watched ron rolling around on the hearthrug 
 
 hermione gave ron a look or deep disgust and returned to her letter 
 
 well ron said finally looking up at harry how was it 
 
 harry considered for a moment 
 
 wet he said truthfully 
 
 ron made a noise that might have indicated jubilation or disgust it was hard to tell 
 
 because she was crying harry continued heavily 
 
 oh said ron his smile fading slightly are you that bad at kissing 
 
 dunno said harry who considered this and immediately felt rather worried maybe i am 
 
 of course not said hermione absently still scribbling away at her letter 
 
 how do you know said ron very sharply 
 
 because cho spends half her time crying these days said hermione vaguely she does it at mealtimes in the loos all over the place 
 
 think a bit of kissing would cheer her up said ron grinning 
 
 ron said hermione in a dignified voice dipping the point of her quill into her inkpot you are the most insensitive wart i have ever had the misfortune to meet 
 
 that supposed to mean said ron indignantly what sort of person cries while kissing them 
 
 yeah said harry slightly desperately who does 
 
 hermione looked at the pair of them with an almost pitying expression on her face 
 
 you understand how feeling at the moment she asked 
 
 no said harry and ron together 
 
 hermione sighed and laid down her quill 
 
 well obviously feeling very sad because of cedric dying then i expect feeling confused because she liked cedric and now she likes harry and she work out who she likes best then be feeling guilty thinking an insult to memory to be kissing harry at all and be worrying about what everyone else might say about her if she starts going out with harry and she probably work out what her feelings towards harry are anyway because he was the one who was with cedric when cedric died so all very mixed up and painful oh and afraid going to be thrown off the ravenclaw quidditch team because been flying so badly 
 
 a slightly stunned silence greeted the end of this speech then ron said one person feel all that at once explode 
 
 just because got the emotional range of a teaspoon mean we all have said hermione nastily picking up her quill again 
 
 she was the one who started it said harry i just sort of came at meand next thing crying all over mei know what to do 
 
 blame you mate said ron looking alarmed at the very thought 
 
 you just had to be nice to her said hermione looking up anxiously you were you 
 
 well said harry an unpleasant heat creeping up his face i sort ofpatted her on the back a bit 
 
 hermione looked as though she was restraining herself from rolling her eyes with extreme difficulty 
 
 well i suppose it could have been worse she said are you going to see her again 
 
 have to i said harry got da meetings we 
 
 you know what i mean said hermione impatiently 
 
 harry said nothing words opened up a whole new vista of frightening possibilities he tried to imagine going somewhere with chohogsmeade perhapsand being alone with her for hours at a time of course she would have been expecting him to ask her out after what had just happened the thought made his stomach clench painfully 
 
 oh well said hermione distantly buried in her letter once more have plenty of opportunities to ask her 
 
 what if he want to ask her said ron who had been watching harry with an unusually shrewd expression on his face 
 
 be silly said hermione vaguely liked her for ages you harry 
 
 he did not answer yes he had liked cho for ages but whenever he had imagined a scene involving the two of them it had always featured a cho who was enjoying herself as opposed to a cho who was sobbing uncontrollably into his shoulder 
 
 you writing the novel to anyway ron asked hermione trying to read the bit of parchment now trailing on the floor hermione hitched it up out of sight 
 
 viktor 
 
 krum 
 
 how many other viktors do we know 
 
 ron said nothing but looked disgruntled they sat in silence for another twenty minutes ron finishing his transfiguration essay with many snorts of impatience and hermione writing steadily to the very end of the parchment rolling it up carefully and sealing it and harry staring into the fire wishing more than anything that head would appear there and give him some advice about girls but the fire merely crackled lower and lower until the embers crumbled into ash and looking around harry saw that they were yet again the last ones in the common room 
 
 well night said hermione yawning widely as she set off up the girls staircase 
 
 what does she see in krum ron demanded as he and harry climbed the boys stairs 
 
 well said harry considering the matter i older he and an international quidditch player 
 
 yeah but apart from that said ron sounding aggravated i mean a grouchy git he 
 
 bit grouchy yeah said harry whose thoughts were still on cho 
 
 they pulled off their robes and put on pyjamas in silence dean seamus and neville were already asleep harry put his glasses on his bedside table and got into bed but did not pull the hangings closed around his instead he stared at the patch of starry sky visible through the window next to bed if he had known this time last night that in hours time he would have kissed cho chang 
 
 night grunted ron from somewhere to his right 
 
 night said harry 
 
 maybe next time if there was a next time be a bit happier he ought to have asked her out she had probably been expecting it and was now really angry with him or was she lying in bed still crying about cedric he did not know what to think explanation had made it all seem more complicated rather than easier to understand 
 
 what they should teach us here he thought turning over on to his side how girls brains work be more useful than divination anyway 
 
 neville snuffled in his sleep an owl hooted somewhere out in the night 
 
 harry dreamed he was back in the da room cho was accusing him of luring her there under false pretences she said he had promised her a hundred and fifty chocolate frog cards if she showed up harry protested cho shouted cedric gave me loads of chocolate frog cards look and she pulled out fistfuls of cards from inside her robes and threw them into the air then she turned into hermione who said you did promise her you know harry i think better give her something else instead how about your firebolt and harry was protesting that he could not give cho his firebolt because umbridge had it and anyway the whole thing was ridiculous only come to the da room to put up some christmas baubles shaped like head 
 
 the dream changed 
 
 his body felt smooth powerful and flexible he was gliding between shining metal bars across dark cold stone he was flat against the floor sliding along on his belly it was dark yet he could see objects around him shimmering in strange vibrant colours he was turning his head at first glance the corridor was empty but no a man was sitting on the floor ahead his chin drooping on to his chest his outline gleaming in the dark 
 
 harry put out his tongue he tasted the scent on the air he was alive but drowsy sitting in front of a door at the end of the corridor 
 
 harry longed to bite the man but he must master the impulse he had more important work to do 
 
 but the man was stirring a silver cloak fell from his legs as he jumped to his feet and harry saw his vibrant blurred outline towering above him saw a wand withdrawn from a belt he had no choice he reared high from the floor and struck once twice three times plunging his fangs deeply into the flesh feeling his ribs splinter beneath his jaws feeling the warm gush of blood 
 
 the man was yelling in pain then he fell silent he slumped backwards against the wall blood was splattering on to the floor 
 
 his forehead hurt terribly it was aching fit to burst 
 
 harry harry 
 
 he opened his eyes every inch of his body was covered in icy sweat his bed covers were twisted all around him like a he felt as though a poker were being applied to his forehead 
 
 harry 
 
 ron was standing over him looking extremely frightened there were more figures at the foot of bed he clutched his head in his hands the pain was blinding him he rolled right over and vomited over the edge of the mattress 
 
 really ill said a scared voice should we call someone 
 
 harry harry 
 
 he had to tell ron it was very important that he tell him taking great gulps of air harry pushed himself up in bed willing himself not to throw up again the pain him 
 
 your dad he panted his chest heaving your been attacked 
 
 what said ron uncomprehendingly 
 
 your dad been bitten serious there was blood everywhere 
 
 going for help said the same scared voice and harry heard footsteps running out of the dormitory 
 
 harry mate said ron uncertainly you you were just dreaming 
 
 no said harry furiously it was crucial that ron understand 
 
 it a dream not an ordinary dream i was there i saw it i did it 
 
 he could hear seamus and dean muttering but did not care the pain in his forehead was subsiding slightly though he was still sweating and shivering feverishly he retched again and ron leapt backwards out of the way 
 
 harry not well he said shakily gone for help 
 
 fine harry choked wiping his mouth on his pyjamas and shaking uncontrollably nothing wrong with me your dad got to worry aboutwe need to find out where he bleeding like madi wasit was a huge snake 
 
 he tried to get out of bed but ron pushed him back into it dean and seamus were still whispering somewhere nearby whether one minute passed or ten harry did not know he simply sat there shaking feeling the pain recede very slowly from his scar then there were hurried footsteps coming up the stairs and he heard voice again 
 
 over here professor 
 
 professor mcgonagall came hurrying into the dormitory in her tartan dressing gown her glasses perched lopsidedly on the bridge of her bony nose 
 
 what is it potter where does it hurt 
 
 he had never been so pleased to see her it was a member of the order of the phoenix he needed now not someone fussing over him and prescribing useless potions 
 
 dad he said sitting up again been attacked by a snake and serious i saw it happen 
 
 what do you mean you saw it happen said professor mcgonagall her dark eyebrows contracting 
 
 i know i was asleep and then i was there 
 
 you mean you dreamed this 
 
 no said harry angrily would none of them understand i was having a dream at first about something completely different something stupid and then this interrupted it it was real i imagine it mr weasley was asleep on the floor and he was attacked by a gigantic snake there was a load of blood he collapsed got to find out where he is 
 
 professor mcgonagall was gazing at him through her lopsided spectacles as though horrified at what she was seeing 
 
 not lying and not mad harry told her his voice rising to a shout i tell you i saw it happen 
 
 i believe you potter said professor mcgonagall curtly put on your dressing going to see the headmaster 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the order of the phoenix 
 

lionfish nov chapter the eye of the snakecontents prev chapter next chapter 
 hermione ploughed her way back to cabin through two feet of snow on sunday morning harry and ron wanted to go with her but their mountain of homework had reached an alarming height again so they remained grudgingly in the common room tying to ignore the gleeful shouts drifting up from the grounds outside where students were enjoying themselves skating on the frozen lake tobogganing and worst of all bewitching snowballs to zoom up to gryffindor tower and rap hard on the windows 
 
 oi bellowed ron finally losing patience and sticking his head out of the window i am a prefect and if one more snowball hits this windowouch 
 
 he withdrew his head sharply his face covered in snow 
 
 fred and george he said bitterly slamming the window behind him gits 
 
 hermione returned from just before lunch shivering slightly her robes damp to the knees 
 
 so said ron looking up when she entered got all his lessons planned for him 
 
 well i tried she said dully sinking into a chair beside harry she pulled out her wand and gave it a complicated little wave so that hot air streamed out of the tip she then pointed this at her robes which began to steam as they dried out he even there when i arrived i was knocking for at least half an hour and then he came stumping out of the forest 
 
 harry groaned the forbidden forest was teeming with the kind of creatures most likely to get hagrid the sack he keeping in there did he say he asked 
 
 no said hermione miserably he says he wants them to be a surprise i tried to explain about umbridge but he just get it he kept saying nobody in their right mind would rather study knarls than chimaerasoh i think got a chimaera she added at the appalled look on harry and faces but not for lack of trying from what he said about how hard it is to get eggs i know how many times i told him be better off following plan i honestly think he listened to half of what i said in a bit of a funny mood you know he still say how he got all those injuries 
 
 reappearance at the staff table at breakfast next day was not greeted by enthusiasm from all students some like fred george and lee roared with delight and sprinted up the aisle between the gryffindor and hufflepuff tables to wring enormous hand others like parvati and lavender exchanged gloomy looks and shook their heads harry knew that many of them preferred professor lessons and the worst of it was that a very small unbiased part of him knew that they had good reason idea of an interesting class was not one where there was a risk that somebody might have their head ripped off 
 
 it was with a certain amount of apprehension that harry ron and hermione headed down to on tuesday heavily muffled against the cold harry was worried not only about what hagrid might have decided to teach them but also about how the rest of the class particularly malfoy and his cronies would behave if umbridge was watching them 
 
 however the high inquisitor was nowhere to be seen as they struggled through the snow towards hagrid who stood waiting for them on the edge of the forest he did not present a reassuring sight the bruises that had been purple on saturday night were now tinged with green and yellow and some of his cuts still seemed to be bleeding harry could not understand this had hagrid perhaps been attacked by some creature whose venom prevented the wounds it inflicted from healing as though to complete the ominous picture hagrid was carrying what looked like half a dead cow over his shoulder 
 
 workin in here today hagrid called happily to the approaching students jerking his head back at the dark trees behind him bit more sheltered anyway they prefer the dark 
 
 what prefers the dark harry heard malfoy say sharply to crabbe and goyle a trace of panic in his voice what did he say prefers the darkdid you hear 
 
 harry remembered the only other occasion on which malfoy had entered the forest before now he had not been very brave then either he smiled to himself after the quidditch match anything that caused malfoy discomfort was all right with him 
 
 ready said hagrid cheerfully looking around at the class right well bin savin a trip inter the forest fer yer fifth year thought go an see these creatures in their natural habitat now what studyin today is pretty rare i reckon probably the person in britain managed ter train em 
 
 and sure trained are you said malfoy the panic in his voice even more pronounced only it be the first time brought wild stuff to class would it 
 
 the slytherins murmured agreement and a few gryffindors looked as though they thought malfoy had a fair point too 
 
 course trained said hagrid scowling and hoisting the dead cow a little higher on his shoulder 
 
 so what happened to your face then demanded malfoy 
 
 mind yer own business said hagrid angrily now if finished askin stupid questions follow me 
 
 he turned and strode straight into the forest nobody seemed much disposed to follow harry glanced at ron and hermione who sighed but nodded and the three of them set off after hagrid leading the rest of the class 
 
 they walked for about ten minutes until they reached a place where the trees stood so closely together that it was as dark as twilight and there was no snow at all on the ground with a grunt hagrid deposited his half a cow on the ground stepped back and turned to face his class most of whom were creeping from tree to tree towards him peering around nervously as though expecting to be set upon at any moment 
 
 gather roun gather roun hagrid encouraged now be attracted by the smell o the meat but going ter give em a call anyway cause like ter know me 
 
 he turned shook his shaggy head to get the hair out of his face and gave an odd shrieking cry that echoed through the dark trees like the call of some monstrous bird nobody laughed most of them looked too scared to make a sound 
 
 hagrid gave the shrieking cry again a minute passed in which the class continued to peer nervously over their shoulders and around trees for a first glimpse of whatever it was that was coming and then as hagrid shook his hair back for a third lime and expanded his enormous chest harry nudged ron and pointed into the black space between two gnarled yew trees 
 
 a pair of blank white shining eyes were growing larger through the gloom and a moment later the dragonish face neck and then skeletal body of a great black winged horse emerged from the darkness it surveyed the class for a few seconds swishing its long black tail then bowed its head and began to tear flesh from the dead cow with its pointed fangs 
 
 a great wave of relief broke over harry here at last was proof that he had not imagined these creatures that they were real hagrid knew about them too he looked eagerly at ron but ron was still staring around into the trees and after a few seconds he whispered why hagrid call again 
 
 most of the rest of the class were wearing expressions as confused and nervously expectant as and were still gazing everywhere but at the horse standing feet from them there were only two other people who seemed to be able to see them a stringy slytherin boy standing just behind goyle was watching the horse eating with an expression of great distaste on his face and neville whose eyes were following the swishing progress of the long black tail 
 
 oh an here comes another one said hagrid proudly as a second black horse appeared out of the dark trees folded its closer to its body and dipped its head to gorge on the meat now put yer hands up who can see em 
 
 immensely pleased to feel that he was at last going to understand the mystery of these horses harry raised his hand hagrid nodded at him 
 
 yeah yeah i knew be able ter harry he said seriously an you too neville eh an 
 
 excuse me said malfoy in a sneering voice but what exactly are we supposed to be seeing 
 
 for an answer hagrid pointed at the cow carcass on the ground the whole class stared at it for a few seconds then several people gasped and parvati squealed harry understood why bits of flesh stripping themselves away from the bones and vanishing into thin air had to look very odd indeed 
 
 doing it parvati demanded in a terrified voice retreating behind the nearest tree eating it 
 
 thestrals said hagrid proudly and hermione gave a soft oh of comprehension at shoulder hogwarts has got a whole herd of em in here now who knows 
 
 but really really unlucky interrupted parvati looking alarmed supposed to bring all sorts of horrible misfortune on people who see them professor trelawney told me once 
 
 no no no said hagrid chuckling jus superstition that is they aren unlucky dead clever an useful course this lot don get a lot o work mainly jus pullin the school carriages unless takin a long journey an don want ter apparatean another couple look 
 
 two more horses came quietly out of the trees one of them passing very close to parvati who shivered and pressed herself closer to the tree saying i think i felt something i think near me 
 
 don worry it won hurt yeh said hagrid patiently righ now who can tell me why some o yeh can see em an some 
 
 hermione raised her hand 
 
 go on then said hagrid beaming at her 
 
 the only people who can see thestrals she said are people who have seen death 
 
 exactly right said hagrid solemnly ten points ter gryffindor now thestrals 
 
 hem hem 
 
 professor umbridge had arrived she was standing a few feet away from harry wearing her green hat and cloak again her clipboard at the ready hagrid who had never heard fake cough before was gazing in some concern at the closest thestral evidently under the impression that it had made the sound 
 
 hem hem 
 
 oh hello hagrid said smiling having located the source of the noise 
 
 you received the note i sent to your cabin this morning said umbridge in the same loud slow voice she had used with him earlier as though she were addressing somebody both foreign and very slow telling you that i would be inspecting your lesson 
 
 oh yeah said hagrid brightly glad yeh found the place all righ well as you can see or i dunnocan you doin thestrals today 
 
 sorry said professor umbridge loudly cupping her hand around her ear and frowning what did you say 
 
 hagrid looked a little confused 
 
 erthestrals he said loudly bigerwinged horses yeh know 
 
 he flapped his gigantic arms hopefully professor umbridge raised her eyebrows at him and muttered as she made a note on her clipboard has to resort to crude sign language 
 
 well anyway said hagrid turning back to the class and looking slightly flustered erm what was i sayin 
 
 appears to have poor short term memory muttered umbridge loudly enough for everyone to hear her draco malfoy looked as though christmas had come a month early hermione on the other hand had turned scarlet with suppressed rage 
 
 oh yeah said hagrid throwing an uneasy glance at clipboard but ploughing on valiantly yeah i was gonna tell yeh how come we got a herd yeah so we started off with a male an five females this one he patted the first horse to have appeared name o tenebrus my special favourite firs one born here in the forest 
 
 are you aware umbridge said loudly interrupting him that the ministry of magic has classified thestrals as dangerous 
 
 heart sank like a stone but hagrid merely chuckled 
 
 thestrals aren dangerous all righ they might take a bite outta yeh if yeh really annoy them 
 
 shows signs of pleasure at idea of violence muttered umbridge scribbling on her clipboard again 
 
 nocome on said hagrid looking a little anxious now i mean a bite if yeh bait it won itbut thestrals have jus got a bad reputation because o the death thingpeople used ter think they were bad omens didn they jus didn understand did they 
 
 umbridge did not answer she finished writing her last note then looked up at hagrid and said again very loudly and slowly please continue teaching as usual i am going to walk she mimed walking malfoy and pansy parkinson were having silent fits of laughter among the students she pointed around at individual members of the class and ask them questions she pointed at her mouth to indicate talking 
 
 hagrid stared at her clearly at a complete loss to understand why she was acting as though he did not understand normal english hermione had tears of fury in her eyes now 
 
 you hag you evil hag she whispered as umbridge walked towards pansy parkinson i know what doing you awiul twisted vicious 
 
 erm anyway said hagrid clearly struggling to regain the flow of his lesson so thestrals yeah well loads o good stuff abou them 
 
 do you find said professor umbridge in a ringing voice to pansy parkinson that you are able to understand professor hagrid when he talks 
 
 just like hermione pansy had tears in her eyes but these were tears of laughter indeed her answer was almost incoherent because she was trying to suppress her giggles 
 
 no because well it sounds like grunting a lot of the time 
 
 umbridge scribbled on her clipboard the few unbruised bits of face flushed but he tried to act as though he had not heard answer 
 
 er yeah good stuff abou thestrals well once tamed like this lot never be lost again mazin sense o direction jus tell em where yeh want ter go 
 
 assuming they can understand you of course said malfoy loudly and pansy parkinson collapsed in a fit of renewed giggles professor umbridge smiled indulgently at them and then turned to neville 
 
 you can see the thestrals longbottom can you she said 
 
 neville nodded 
 
 who did you see die she asked her tone indifferent 
 
 my my grandad said neville 
 
 and what do you think of them she said waving her stubby hand at the horses who by now had stripped a great deal of the carcass down to bone 
 
 erm said neville nervously with a glance at hagrid well er ok 
 
 students are too intimidated to admit they are frightened muttered umbridge making another note on her clipboard 
 
 no said neville looking upset no not scared of them 
 
 quite all right said umbridge patting neville on the shoulder with what she evidently intended to be an understanding smile though it looked more like a leer to harry well hagrid she turned to look up at him again speaking once more in that loud slow voice i think got enough to be getting along with you will receive she mimed taking something from the air in front of her the results of your inspection she pointed at the clipboard in ten days time she held up ten stubby little fingers then her smile wider and more toadlike than ever before beneath her green hat she bustled from their midst leaving malfoy and pansy parkinson in fits of laughter hermione actually shaking with fury and neville looking confused and upset 
 
 that foul lying twisting old gargoyle stormed hermione half an hour later as they made their way back up to the castle through the channels they had made earlier in the snow you see what up to her thing about all over trying to make out some kind of dimwitted troll just because he had a giantess for a motherand oh not fair that really a bad lesson at alli mean all right if it had been skrewts again but thestrals are finein fact for hagrid really good 
 
 umbridge said dangerous said ron 
 
 well like hagrid said they can look after themselves said hermione impatiently and i suppose a teacher like usually show them to us before newt level but well they are very interesting they the way some people can see them and some i wish i could 
 
 do you harry asked her quietly 
 
 she looked suddenly horrorstruck 
 
 oh sorryno of course i was a really stupid thing to say 
 
 ok he said quickly worry 
 
 surprised so many people could see them said ron three in a class 
 
 yeah weasley we were just wondering said a malicious voice unheard by any of them in the muffling snow malfoy crabbe and goyle were walking along right behind them reckon if you saw someone snuff it be able to see the quaffle better 
 
 he crabbe and goyle roared with laughter as they pushed past on their way to the castle then broke into a chorus of weasley is our king ears turned scarlet 
 
 ignore them just ignore them intoned hermione pulling out her wand and performing the charm to produce hot air again so that she could melt them an easier path through the untouched snow between them and the greenhouses 
 
 december arrived bringing with it more snow and a positive avalanche of homework for the ron and prefect duties also became more and more onerous as christmas approached they were called upon to supervise the decoration of the castle you try putting up tinsel when peeves has got the other end and is trying to strangle you with it said ron to watch over first and spending their inside because of the bitter cold and cheeky little you know we definitely that rude when we were in first year said ron and to patrol the corridors in shifts with argus filch who suspected that the holiday spirit might show itself in an outbreak of wizard duels got dung for brains that one said ron furiously they were so busy that hermione had even stopped knitting elf hats and was fretting that she was down to her last three 
 
 all those poor elves i set free yet having to stay here over christmas because there enough hats 
 
 harry who had not had the heart to tell her that dobby was taking everything she made bent lower over his history of magic essay in any case he did not want to think about christmas for the first time in his school career he very much wanted to spend the holidays away from hogwarts between his quidditch ban and worry about whether or not hagrid was going to be put on probation he felt highly resentful towards the place at the moment the only thing he really looked forward to were the da meetings and they would have to stop over the holidays as nearly everybody in the da would be spending the time with their families hermione was going skiing with her parents something that greatly amused ron who had never heard of muggles strapping narrow strips of wood on to their feet to slide down mountains ron was going home to the burrow harry endured several days of envy before ron said in response to harry asking him how he was going to get home for christmas but coming too i say mum wrote and told me to invite you weeks ago 
 
 hermione rolled her eyes but spirits soared the thought of christmas at the burrow was truly wonderful though slightly marred by guilty feeling that he would not be able to spend the holiday with sirius he wondered whether he could possibly persuade mrs weasley to invite his godfather for the festivities even though he doubted whether dumbledore would permit sirius to leave grimmauld place anyway he could not help but think mrs weasley might not want him they were so often at loggerheads sirius had not contacted harry at all since his last appearance in the fire and although harry knew that with umbridge on constant watch it would be unwise to attempt to contact him he did not like to think of sirius alone in his old house perhaps pulling a lonely cracker with kreacher 
 
 harry arrived early in the room of requirement for the last da meeting before the holidays and was very glad he had because when the torches burst into flame he saw that dobby had taken it upon himself to decorate the place for christmas he could tell the elf had done it because nobody else would have strung a hundred golden baubles from the ceiling each showing a picture of face and bearing the legend have a very harry christmas 
 
 harry had only just managed to get the last of them down before the door creaked open and luna lovegood entered looking as dreamy as usual 
 
 hello she said vaguely looking around at what remained of the decorations these are nice did you put them up 
 
 no said harry it was dobby the 
 
 mistletoe said luna dreamily pointing at a large clump of white berries placed almost over head he jumped out from under it good thinking said luna very seriously often infested with nargles 
 
 harry was saved the necessity of asking what nargles are by the arrival of angelina katie and alicia all three of them were breathless and looked very cold 
 
 well said angelina dully pulling off her cloak and throwing it into a corner finally replaced you 
 
 replaced me said harry blankly 
 
 you and fred and george she said impatiently got another seeker 
 
 who said harry quickly 
 
 ginny weasley said katie 
 
 harry gaped at her 
 
 yeah i know said angelina pulling out her wand and flexing her arm but pretty good actually nothing on you of course she said throwing him a very dirty look but as we have you 
 
 harry bit back the retort he was longing to utter did she imagine for a second that he did not regret his expulsion from the team a hundred times more than she did 
 
 and what about the beaters he asked trying to keep his voice even 
 
 andrew kirke said alicia without enthusiasm and jack sloper neither of them are brilliant but compared to the rest of the idiots who turned up 
 
 the arrival of ron hermione and neville brought this depressing discussion to an end and within five minutes the room was full enough to prevent harry seeing burning reproachful looks 
 
 ok he said calling them all to order i thought this evening we should just go over the things done so far because the last meeting before the holidays and no point starting anything new right before a break 
 
 not doing anything new said zacharias smith in a disgruntled whisper loud enough to carry through the room if known that i have come 
 
 all really sorry harry tell you then said fred loudly 
 
 several people sniggered harry saw cho laughing and felt the familiar swooping sensation in his stomach as though he had missed a step going downstairs 
 
 we can practise in pairs said harry start with the impediment jinx for ten minutes then we can get out the cushions and try stunning again 
 
 they all divided up obediently harry partnered neville as usual the room was soon full of intermittent cries of impedimenta people froze for a minute or so during which their partner would stare aimlessly around the room watching other pairs at work then would unfreeze and take their turn at the jinx 
 
 neville had improved beyond all recognition after a while when harry had unfrozen three times in a row he had neville join ron and hermione again so that he could walk around the room and watch the others when he passed cho she beamed at him he resisted the temptation to walk past her several more times 
 
 after ten minutes on the impediment jinx they laid out cushions all over the floor and started practising stunning again space was really too confined to allow them all to work this spell at once half the group observed the others for a while then swapped over 
 
 harry felt himself positively swelling with pride as he watched them all true neville did stun padma patil rather than dean at whom he had been aiming but it was a much closer miss than usual and everybody else had made enormous progress 
 
 at the end of an hour harry called a halt 
 
 getting really good he said beaming around at them when we get back from the holidays we can start doing some of the big stuffmaybe even patronuses 
 
 there was a murmur of excitement the room began to clear in the usual twos and threes most people wished harry a happy christmas as they went feeling cheerful he collected up the cushions with ron and hermione and stacked them neatly away ron and hermione left before he did he hung back a little because cho was still there and he was hoping to receive a merry christmas from her 
 
 no you go on he heard her say to her friend marietta and his heart gave a jolt that seemed to take it into the region of his apple 
 
 he pretended to be straightening the cushion pile he was quite sure they were alone now and waited for her to speak instead he heard a hearty sniff 
 
 he turned and saw cho standing in the middle of the room tears pouring down her face 
 
 wha 
 
 he know what to do she was simply standing there crying silently 
 
 up he said feebly 
 
 she shook her head and wiped her eyes on her sleeve 
 
 she said thickly i suppose just learning all this stuff it just makes me wonder whether if known it all still be alive 
 
 heart sank right back past its usual spot and settled somewhere around his navel he ought to have known she wanted to talk about cedric 
 
 he did know this stuff harry said heavily he was really good at it or he could never have got to the middle of that maze but if voldemort really wants to kill you you stand a chance 
 
 she hiccoughed at the sound of name but stared at harry without flinching 
 
 you survived when you were just a baby she said quietly 
 
 yeah well said harry wearily moving towards the door i dunno why nor does anyone else so nothing to be proud of 
 
 oh go said cho sounding tearful again really sorry to get all upset like this i mean to 
 
 she hiccoughed again she was very pretty even when her eyes were red and puffy harry felt thoroughly miserable have been so pleased with just a merry christmas 
 
 i know it must be horrible for you she said mopping her eyes on her sleeve again me mentioning cedric when you saw him die i suppose you just want to forget about it 
 
 harry did not say anything to this it was quite true but he felt heartless saying it 
 
 a good teacher you know said cho with a watery smile never been able to stun anything before 
 
 thanks said harry awkwardly 
 
 they looked at each other for a long moment harry felt a burning desire to run from the room and at the same time a complete inability to move his feet 
 
 mistletoe said cho quietly pointing at the ceiling over his head 
 
 yeah said harry his mouth was very dry probably full of nargles though 
 
 what are nargles 
 
 no idea said harry she had moved closer his brain seemed to have been stunned have to ask loony luna i mean 
 
 cho made a funny noise halfway between a sob and a laugh she was even nearer to him now he could have counted the freckles on her nose 
 
 i really like you harry 
 
 he could not think a tingling sensation was spreading through him paralysing his arms legs and brain 
 
 she was much too close he could see every tear clinging to her eyelashes 
 
 he returned to the common room half an hour later to find hermione and ron in the best seats by the fire nearly everybody else had gone to bed hermione was writing a very long letter she had already filled half a roll of parchment which was dangling from the edge of the table ron was lying on the hearthrug trying to finish his transfiguration homework 
 
 what kept you he asked as harry sank into the armchair next to 
 
 harry answer he was in a state of shock half of him wanted to tell ron and hermione what had just happened but the other half wanted to take the secret with him to the grave 
 
 are you all right harry hermione asked peering at him over the tip of her quill 
 
 harry gave a shrug in truth he know whether he was all right or not up said ron hoisting himself up on his elbow to get a clearer view of harry happened 
 
 harry quite know how to set about telling them and still sure whether he wanted to just as he had decided not to say anything hermione took matters out of his hands 
 
 is it cho she asked in a businesslike way did she corner you after the meeting 
 
 numbly surprised harry nodded ron sniggered breaking off when hermione caught his eye 
 
 soerwhat did she want he asked in a mock casual voice 
 
 she harry began rather hoarsely he cleared his throat and tried again sheer 
 
 did you kiss asked hermione briskly 
 
 ron sat up so fast he sent his ink bottle flying all over the rug disregarding this completely he stared avidly at harry 
 
 well he demanded 
 
 harry looked from expression of mingled curiosity and hilarity to slight frown and nodded 
 
 ha 
 
 ron made a triumphant gesture with his fist and went into a raucous peal of laughter that made several over beside the window jump a reluctant grin spread over face as he watched ron rolling around on the hearthrug 
 
 hermione gave ron a look or deep disgust and returned to her letter 
 
 well ron said finally looking up at harry how was it 
 
 harry considered for a moment 
 
 wet he said truthfully 
 
 ron made a noise that might have indicated jubilation or disgust it was hard to tell 
 
 because she was crying harry continued heavily 
 
 oh said ron his smile fading slightly are you that bad at kissing 
 
 dunno said harry who considered this and immediately felt rather worried maybe i am 
 
 of course not said hermione absently still scribbling away at her letter 
 
 how do you know said ron very sharply 
 
 because cho spends half her time crying these days said hermione vaguely she does it at mealtimes in the loos all over the place 
 
 think a bit of kissing would cheer her up said ron grinning 
 
 ron said hermione in a dignified voice dipping the point of her quill into her inkpot you are the most insensitive wart i have ever had the misfortune to meet 
 
 that supposed to mean said ron indignantly what sort of person cries while kissing them 
 
 yeah said harry slightly desperately who does 
 
 hermione looked at the pair of them with an almost pitying expression on her face 
 
 you understand how feeling at the moment she asked 
 
 no said harry and ron together 
 
 hermione sighed and laid down her quill 
 
 well obviously feeling very sad because of cedric dying then i expect feeling confused because she liked cedric and now she likes harry and she work out who she likes best then be feeling guilty thinking an insult to memory to be kissing harry at all and be worrying about what everyone else might say about her if she starts going out with harry and she probably work out what her feelings towards harry are anyway because he was the one who was with cedric when cedric died so all very mixed up and painful oh and afraid going to be thrown off the ravenclaw quidditch team because been flying so badly 
 
 a slightly stunned silence greeted the end of this speech then ron said one person feel all that at once explode 
 
 just because got the emotional range of a teaspoon mean we all have said hermione nastily picking up her quill again 
 
 she was the one who started it said harry i just sort of came at meand next thing crying all over mei know what to do 
 
 blame you mate said ron looking alarmed at the very thought 
 
 you just had to be nice to her said hermione looking up anxiously you were you 
 
 well said harry an unpleasant heat creeping up his face i sort ofpatted her on the back a bit 
 
 hermione looked as though she was restraining herself from rolling her eyes with extreme difficulty 
 
 well i suppose it could have been worse she said are you going to see her again 
 
 have to i said harry got da meetings we 
 
 you know what i mean said hermione impatiently 
 
 harry said nothing words opened up a whole new vista of frightening possibilities he tried to imagine going somewhere with chohogsmeade perhapsand being alone with her for hours at a time of course she would have been expecting him to ask her out after what had just happened the thought made his stomach clench painfully 
 
 oh well said hermione distantly buried in her letter once more have plenty of opportunities to ask her 
 
 what if he want to ask her said ron who had been watching harry with an unusually shrewd expression on his face 
 
 be silly said hermione vaguely liked her for ages you harry 
 
 he did not answer yes he had liked cho for ages but whenever he had imagined a scene involving the two of them it had always featured a cho who was enjoying herself as opposed to a cho who was sobbing uncontrollably into his shoulder 
 
 you writing the novel to anyway ron asked hermione trying to read the bit of parchment now trailing on the floor hermione hitched it up out of sight 
 
 viktor 
 
 krum 
 
 how many other viktors do we know 
 
 ron said nothing but looked disgruntled they sat in silence for another twenty minutes ron finishing his transfiguration essay with many snorts of impatience and hermione writing steadily to the very end of the parchment rolling it up carefully and sealing it and harry staring into the fire wishing more than anything that head would appear there and give him some advice about girls but the fire merely crackled lower and lower until the embers crumbled into ash and looking around harry saw that they were yet again the last ones in the common room 
 
 well night said hermione yawning widely as she set off up the girls staircase 
 
 what does she see in krum ron demanded as he and harry climbed the boys stairs 
 
 well said harry considering the matter i older he and an international quidditch player 
 
 yeah but apart from that said ron sounding aggravated i mean a grouchy git he 
 
 bit grouchy yeah said harry whose thoughts were still on cho 
 
 they pulled off their robes and put on pyjamas in silence dean seamus and neville were already asleep harry put his glasses on his bedside table and got into bed but did not pull the hangings closed around his instead he stared at the patch of starry sky visible through the window next to bed if he had known this time last night that in hours time he would have kissed cho chang 
 
 night grunted ron from somewhere to his right 
 
 night said harry 
 
 maybe next time if there was a next time be a bit happier he ought to have asked her out she had probably been expecting it and was now really angry with him or was she lying in bed still crying about cedric he did not know what to think explanation had made it all seem more complicated rather than easier to understand 
 
 what they should teach us here he thought turning over on to his side how girls brains work be more useful than divination anyway 
 
 neville snuffled in his sleep an owl hooted somewhere out in the night 
 
 harry dreamed he was back in the da room cho was accusing him of luring her there under false pretences she said he had promised her a hundred and fifty chocolate frog cards if she showed up harry protested cho shouted cedric gave me loads of chocolate frog cards look and she pulled out fistfuls of cards from inside her robes and threw them into the air then she turned into hermione who said you did promise her you know harry i think better give her something else instead how about your firebolt and harry was protesting that he could not give cho his firebolt because umbridge had it and anyway the whole thing was ridiculous only come to the da room to put up some christmas baubles shaped like head 
 
 the dream changed 
 
 his body felt smooth powerful and flexible he was gliding between shining metal bars across dark cold stone he was flat against the floor sliding along on his belly it was dark yet he could see objects around him shimmering in strange vibrant colours he was turning his head at first glance the corridor was empty but no a man was sitting on the floor ahead his chin drooping on to his chest his outline gleaming in the dark 
 
 harry put out his tongue he tasted the scent on the air he was alive but drowsy sitting in front of a door at the end of the corridor 
 
 harry longed to bite the man but he must master the impulse he had more important work to do 
 
 but the man was stirring a silver cloak fell from his legs as he jumped to his feet and harry saw his vibrant blurred outline towering above him saw a wand withdrawn from a belt he had no choice he reared high from the floor and struck once twice three times plunging his fangs deeply into the flesh feeling his ribs splinter beneath his jaws feeling the warm gush of blood 
 
 the man was yelling in pain then he fell silent he slumped backwards against the wall blood was splattering on to the floor 
 
 his forehead hurt terribly it was aching fit to burst 
 
 harry harry 
 
 he opened his eyes every inch of his body was covered in icy sweat his bed covers were twisted all around him like a he felt as though a poker were being applied to his forehead 
 
 harry 
 
 ron was standing over him looking extremely frightened there were more figures at the foot of bed he clutched his head in his hands the pain was blinding him he rolled right over and vomited over the edge of the mattress 
 
 really ill said a scared voice should we call someone 
 
 harry harry 
 
 he had to tell ron it was very important that he tell him taking great gulps of air harry pushed himself up in bed willing himself not to throw up again the pain him 
 
 your dad he panted his chest heaving your been attacked 
 
 what said ron uncomprehendingly 
 
 your dad been bitten serious there was blood everywhere 
 
 going for help said the same scared voice and harry heard footsteps running out of the dormitory 
 
 harry mate said ron uncertainly you you were just dreaming 
 
 no said harry furiously it was crucial that ron understand 
 
 it a dream not an ordinary dream i was there i saw it i did it 
 
 he could hear seamus and dean muttering but did not care the pain in his forehead was subsiding slightly though he was still sweating and shivering feverishly he retched again and ron leapt backwards out of the way 
 
 harry not well he said shakily gone for help 
 
 fine harry choked wiping his mouth on his pyjamas and shaking uncontrollably nothing wrong with me your dad got to worry aboutwe need to find out where he bleeding like madi wasit was a huge snake 
 
 he tried to get out of bed but ron pushed him back into it dean and seamus were still whispering somewhere nearby whether one minute passed or ten harry did not know he simply sat there shaking feeling the pain recede very slowly from his scar then there were hurried footsteps coming up the stairs and he heard voice again 
 
 over here professor 
 
 professor mcgonagall came hurrying into the dormitory in her tartan dressing gown her glasses perched lopsidedly on the bridge of her bony nose 
 
 what is it potter where does it hurt 
 
 he had never been so pleased to see her it was a member of the order of the phoenix he needed now not someone fussing over him and prescribing useless potions 
 
 dad he said sitting up again been attacked by a snake and serious i saw it happen 
 
 what do you mean you saw it happen said professor mcgonagall her dark eyebrows contracting 
 
 i know i was asleep and then i was there 
 
 you mean you dreamed this 
 
 no said harry angrily would none of them understand i was having a dream at first about something completely different something stupid and then this interrupted it it was real i imagine it mr weasley was asleep on the floor and he was attacked by a gigantic snake there was a load of blood he collapsed got to find out where he is 
 
 professor mcgonagall was gazing at him through her lopsided spectacles as though horrified at what she was seeing 
 
 not lying and not mad harry told her his voice rising to a shout i tell you i saw it happen 
 
 i believe you potter said professor mcgonagall curtly put on your dressing going to see the headmaster 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the order of the phoenix 
 

lionfish nov chapter the unknowable roomcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 harry wracked his brains over the next week as to how he was to persuade slughorn to hand over the true memory but nothing in the nature of a brain wave occurred and he was reduced to doing what he did increasingly these days when at a loss poring over his potions book hoping that the prince would have scribbled something useful in a margin as he had done so many times before 
 
 you find anything in there said hermione firmly late on sunday evening 
 
 start hermione said harry if it been for the prince ron be sitting here now 
 
 he would if just listened to snape in our first year said hermione dismissively 
 
 harry ignored her he had just found an incantation sectumsempra scrawled in a margin above the intriguing words for enemies and was itching to try it out but thought it best not to in front of hermione instead he surreptitiously folded down the corner of the page 
 
 they were sitting beside the fire in the common room the only other people awake were fellow there had been a certain amount of excitement earlier when they had come back from dinner to find a new sign on the notice board that announced the date for their apparition test those who would be seventeen on or before the first test date the of april had the option of signing up for additional practice sessions which would take place heavily supervised in hogsmeade 
 
 ron had panicked on reading this notice he had still not managed to apparate and feared he would not be ready for the test hermione who had now achieved apparition twice was a little more confident but harry who would not be seventeen for another four months could not take the test whether ready or not 
 
 at least you can apparate though said ron tensely have no trouble come july 
 
 only done it once harry reminded him he had finally managed to disappear and rematerialize inside his hoop during their previous lesson 
 
 having wasted a lot of time worrying aloud about apparition ron was now struggling to finish a viciously difficult essay for snape that harry and hermione had already completed harry fully expected to receive low marks on his because he had disagreed with snape on the best way to tackle dementors but he did not care memory was the most important thing to him now 
 
 telling you the stupid prince going to be able to help you with this harry said hermione more loudly only one way to force someone to do what you want and the imperius curse which is illegal 
 
 yeah i know that thanks said harry not looking up from the book why looking for something different dumbledore says veritaserum do it but there might be something else a potion or a spell 
 
 going about it the wrong way said hermione only you can get the memory dumbledore says that must mean you can persuade slughorn where other people not a question of slipping him a potion anyone could do that 
 
 how do you spell belligerent said ron shaking his quill very hard while staring at his parchment it be bum 
 
 no it said hermione pulling essay toward her and augury begin org either what kind of quill are you using 
 
 one of fred and ones but i think the charm must be wearing off 
 
 yes it must said hermione pointing at the title of his essay because we were asked how deal with dementors not dugbogs and i remember you changing your name to roonil wazlib either 
 
 ah no said ron staring at the parchment say have to write the whole thing out again 
 
 okay we can fix it said hermione pulling the essay toward her and taking out her wand 
 
 i love you hermione said ron sinking back in his chair rubbing his eyes wearily 
 
 hermione turned faintly pink but merely said let lavender hear you saying that 
 
 i said ron into his hands or maybe i will then ditch me 
 
 why you ditch her if you want to finish it asked harry 
 
 you ever chucked anyone have you said ron you and cho just 
 
 sort of fell apart yeah said harry 
 
 wish that would happen with me and lavender said ron gloomily watching hermione silently tapping each of his misspelled words with the end of her wand so that they corrected themselves on the page but the more i hint i want to finish it the tighter she holds on like going out with the giant squid 
 
 there said hermione some twenty minutes later handing back essay 
 
 thanks a million said ron can i borrow your quill for the conclusion harry who had found nothing useful in the notes so far looked around the three of them were now the only ones left in the common room seamus having just gone up to bed cursing snape and his essay the only sounds were the crackling of the fire and ron scratching out one last paragraph on dementors using quill harry had just closed the book yawning when 
 
 crack 
 
 hermione let out a little shriek ron spilled ink all over his freshly completed essay and harry said kreacher 
 
 the bowed low and addressed his own gnarled toes master said he wanted regular reports on what the malfoy boy is doing so kreacher has come to give 
 
 crack 
 
 dobby appeared alongside kreacher his hat askew 
 
 dobby has been helping too harry potter he squeaked casting kreacher a resentful look and kreacher ought to tell dobby when he is coming to see harry potter so they can make their reports together 
 
 what is this asked hermione still looking shocked by these sudden appearances going on harry 
 
 harry hesitated before answering because he had not told hermione about setting kreacher and dobby to tail malfoy were always such a touchy subject with her 
 
 well been following malfoy for me he said 
 
 night and day croaked kreacher 
 
 dobby has not slept for a week harry potter said dobby proudly swaying where he stood 
 
 hermione looked indignant 
 
 you slept dobby but surely harry you tell him not to 
 
 no of course i said harry quickly dobby you can sleep all right but has either of you found out anything he hastened to ask before hermione could intervene again 
 
 master malfoy moves with a nobility that befits his pure blood croaked kreacher at once his features recall the fine bones of my mistress and his manners are those of 
 
 draco malfoy is a bad boy squeaked dobby angrily a bad boy whowho 
 
 he shuddered from the tassel of his tea cozy to the toes of his socks and then ran at the fire as though about to dive into it harry to whom this was not entirely unexpected caught him around the middle and held him fast for a few seconds dobby struggled then went limp 
 
 thank you harry potter he panted dobby still finds it difficult to speak ill of his old masters 
 
 harry released him dobby straightened his tea cozy and said defiantly to kreacher but kreacher should know that draco malfoy is not a good master to a 
 
 yeah we need to hear about you being in love with malfoy harry told kreacher fast forward to where actually been going 
 
 kreacher bowed again looking furious and then said master malfoy eats in the great hall he sleeps in a dormitory in the dungeons he attends his classes in a variety of 
 
 dobby you tell me said harry cutting across kreacher has he been going anywhere he have 
 
 harry potter sir squeaked dobby his great orblike eyes shining in the firelight the malfoy boy is breaking no rules that dobby can discover but he is still keen to avoid detection he has been making regular visits to the seventh floor with a variety of other students who keep watch for him while he enters 
 
 the room of requirement said harry smacking himself hard on the forehead with advanced hermione and ron stared at him where been sneaking off to where doing whatever doing and i bet why been disappearing off the mapcome to think of it never seen the room of requirement on there 
 
 maybe the marauders never knew the room was there said ron 
 
 i think be part of the magic of the room said hermione if you need it to be unplottable it will be 
 
 dobby have you managed to get in to have a look at what doing said harry eagerly 
 
 no harry potter that is impossible said dobby 
 
 no not said harry at once malfoy got into our headquarters there last year so be able to get in and spy on him no problem 
 
 but i think you will harry said hermione slowly malfoy already knew exactly how we were using the room he because that stupid marietta had blabbed he needed the room to become the headquarters of the so it did but you know what the room becomes when malfoy goes in there so you know what to ask it to transform into 
 
 be a way around that said harry dismissively done brilliantly dobby 
 
 done well too said hermione kindly but far from looking grateful kreacher averted his huge bloodshot eyes and croaked at the ceiling the mudblood is speaking to kreacher kreacher will pretend he cannot hear 
 
 get out of it harry snapped at him and kreacher made one last deep bow and disapparated better go and get some sleep too dobby 
 
 thank you harry potter sir squeaked dobby happily and he too vanished 
 
 how good is this said harry enthusiastically turning to ron and hermione the moment the room was again we know where going got him cornered now 
 
 yeah great said ron glumly who was attempting to mop up the sodden mass of ink that had recently been an almost completed essay hermione pulled it toward her and began siphoning the ink off with her wand 
 
 but all this about him going up there with a variety of students said hermione how many people are in on it you think trust lots of them to know what doing 
 
 yeah that is weird said harry frowning i heard him telling crabbe it business what he was doing so he telling all these all these 
 
 voice tailed away he was staring at the fire god been stupid he said quietly obvious it there was a great vat of it down in the dungeon he nicked some any time during that lesson 
 
 nicked what said ron 
 
 polyjuice potion he stole some of the polyjuice potion slughorn showed us in our first potions lesson there a whole variety of students standing guard for malfoy just crabbe and goyle as usual yeah it all fits said harry jumping up and starting to pace in front of the fire stupid enough to do what told even if he tell them what up to but he want them to be seen lurking around outside the room of requirement so got them taking polyjuice to make them look like other people those two girls i saw him with when he missed quidditchha crabbe and goyle 
 
 do you mean to say said hermione in a hushed voice that that little girl whose scales i repaired 
 
 yeah of course said harry loudly staring at her of course malfoy been inside the room at the time so shewhat am i talking dropped the scales to tell malfoy not to come out because there was someone there and there was that girl who dropped the toadspawn too been walking past him all the time and not realizing it 
 
 got crabbe and goyle transforming into girls guffawed ron blimey no wonder they look too happy these days surprised they tell him to stuff it 
 
 well they would they if shown them his dark mark said harry 
 
 hmmm the dark mark we know exists said hermione skeptically rolling up dried essay before it could come to any more harm and handing it to him 
 
 see said harry confidently 
 
 yes we will hermione said getting to her feet and stretching but harry before you get all excited i still think be able to get into the room of requirement without knowing there first and i think you should forget she heaved her bag onto her shoulder and gave him a very serious look that what supposed to be concentrating on is getting that memory from slughorn goodnight 
 
 harry watched her go feeling slightly disgruntled once the door to the girls dormitories had closed behind her he rounded on ron 
 
 what think 
 
 wish i could disapparate like a said ron staring at the spot where dobby had vanished have that apparition test in the bag 
 
 harry did not sleep well that night he lay awake for what felt like hours wondering how malfoy was using the room of requirement and what he harry would see when he went in there the following day for whatever hermione said harry was sure that if malfoy had been able to see the headquarters of the he would be able to see what could it be a meeting place a hideout a store room a workshop mind worked feverishly and his dreams when he finally fell asleep were broken and disturbed by images of malfoy who turned into slughorn who turned into snape 
 
 harry was in a state of great anticipation over breakfast the following morning he had a free period before defense against the dark arts and was determined to spend it trying to get into the room of requirement hermione was rather ostentatiously showing no interest in his whispered plans for forcing entry into the room which irritated harry because he thought she might be a lot of help if she wanted to 
 
 look he said quietly leaning forward and putting a hand on the daily prophet which she had just removed from a post owl to stop her from opening it and vanishing behind it i forgotten about slughorn but i got a clue how to get that memory off him and until i get a brain wave why i find out what doing 
 
 already told you you need to persuade slughorn said hermione not a question of tricking him or bewitching him or dumbledore could have done it in a second instead of messing around outside the room of requirement she jerked the prophet out from under hand and unfolded it to look at the front page you should go and find slughorn and start appealing to his better nature 
 
 anyone we know asked ron as hermione scanned the headlines 
 
 yes said hermione causing both harry and ron to gag on their breakfast but all right not mundungus been arrested and sent to azkaban something to do with impersonating an inferius during an attempted burglary and someone called octavius pepper has vanished oh and how horrible a boy has been arrested for trying to kill his grandparents they think he was under the imperius curse 
 
 they finished their breakfast in silence hermione set off immediately for ancient runes ron for the common room where he still had to finish his conclusion on dementor essay and harry for the corridor on the seventh floor and the stretch of wall opposite the tapestry of barnabas the barmy teaching trolls to do ballet 
 
 harry slipped on his invisibility cloak once he had found an empty passage but he need not have bothered when he reached his destination he found it deserted harry was not sure whether his chances of getting inside the room were better with malfoy inside it or out but at least his first attempt was not going to be complicated by the presence of crabbe or goyle pretending to be an girl 
 
 he closed his eyes as he approached the place where the room of door was concealed he knew what he had to do he had become most accomplished at it last year concentrating with all his might he thought i need to see what doing in here i need to see what doing in here i need to see what doing in here 
 
 three times he walked past the door then his heart pounding with excitement he opened his eyes and faced itbut he was still looking at a stretch of mundanely blank wall 
 
 he moved forward and gave it an experimental push the stone remained solid and unyielding 
 
 okay said harry aloud okay i thought the wrong thing 
 
 he pondered for a moment then set off again eyes closed concentrating as hard as he could 
 
 i need to see the place where malfoy keeps coming secretly i need to see the place where malfoy keeps coming secretly 
 
 after three walks past he opened his eyes expectantly 
 
 there was no door 
 
 oh come off it he told the wall irritably that was a clear instruction fine 
 
 he thought hard for several minutes before striding off once more 
 
 i need you to become the place you become for draco malfoy 
 
 he did not immediately open his eyes when he had finished his patrolling he was listening hard as though he might hear the door pop into existence he heard nothing however except the distant twittering of birds outside he opened his eyes 
 
 there was still no door 
 
 harry swore someone screamed he looked around to see a gaggle of first years running back around the corner apparently under the impression that they had just encountered a particularly ghost 
 
 harry tried every variation of i need to see what draco malfoy is doing inside you that he could think of for a whole hour at the end of which he was forced to concede that hermione might have had a point the room simply did not want to open for him frustrated and annoyed he set off for defense against the dark arts pulling off his invisibility cloak and stuffing it into his bag as he went 
 
 late again potter said snape coldly as harry hurried into the candlelit classroom ten points from gryfrindor harry scowled at snape as he flung himself into the seat beside ron half the class were still on their feet taking out books and organizing their things he could not be much later than any of them 
 
 before we start i want your dementor essays said snape waving his wand carelessly so that scrolls of parchment soared into the air and landed in a neat pile on his desk and i hope for your sakes they are better than the tripe i had to endure on resisting the imperius curse now if you will all open your books to pagewhat is it mr finnigan 
 
 sir said seamus been wondering how do you tell the difference between an inferius and a ghost because there was something in the prophet about an inferius 
 
 no there said snape in a bored voice 
 
 but sir i heard people talking 
 
 if you had actually read the article in question mr finnigan you would have known that the inferius was nothing but a smelly sneak thief by the name of mundungus fletcher 
 
 i thought snape and mundungus were on the same side muttered harry to ron and hermione he be upset mundungus has been arrest 
 
 but potter seems to have a lot to say on the subject said snape pointing suddenly at the back of the room his black eyes fixed on harry let us ask potter how we would tell the difference between an inferius and a ghost 
 
 the whole class looked around at harry who hastily tried to recall what dumbledore had told him the night that they had gone to visit slughorn 
 
 erwellghosts are transparent he said 
 
 oh very good interrupted snape his lip curling yes it in easy to see that nearly six years of magical education have not been wasted on you potter ghosts are transparent 
 
 pansy parkinson let out a giggle several other people were smirking harry took a deep breath and continued calmly though his insides were boiling yeah ghosts are transparent but inferi are dead bodies they so be solid 
 
 a could have told us as much sneered snape the inferius is a corpse that has been reanimated by a dark spells it is not alive it is merely used like a puppet to do the bidding a ghost as i trust that you are all aware by now is the imprint of a departed soul left upon the earth and of course as potter so wisely tells us transparent 
 
 well what harry said is the most useful if trying to tell them apart said ron when we come with one down a dark alley going to be having a look to see if solid we not going to be asking excuse me are you the imprint of a departed soul 
 
 there was a ripple of laughter instantly quelled by the look snape gave the class 
 
 another ten points from gryffindor said snape i would expect nothing more sophisticated from you ronald weasley the boy so solid he cannot apparate half an inch across a room 
 
 no whispered hermione grabbing arm as he opened his mouth furiously no point just end up in detention again leave it 
 
 now open your books to page two hundred and thirteen said snape smirking a little and read the first two paragraphs on the cruciatus curse 
 
 ron was very subdued all through the class when the bell sounded at the end of the lesson lavender caught up with ron and harry hermione mysteriously melted out of sight as she approached and abused snape hotly for his jibe about apparition but this seemed to merely irritate ron and he shook her off by making a detour into the boys bathroom with harry 
 
 right though he said ron after staring into a cracked mirror for a minute or two i dunno whether worth me taking the test i just get the hang of apparition 
 
 you might as well do the extra practice sessions in hogsmeade and see where they get you said harry reasonably be more interesting than trying to get into a stupid hoop anyway then if still notyou knowas good as like to be you can postpone the test do it with me over the summermyrtle this is the boys bathroom 
 
 the ghost of a girl had risen out of the toilet in a cubicle behind them and was now floating in midair staring at them through thick white round glasses 
 
 oh she said glumly you two 
 
 who were you expecting said ron looking at her in the mirror 
 
 nobody said myrtle picking moodily at a spot on her chin he said come back and see me but then you said pop in and visit me too she gave harry a reproachful look and i seen you for months and months learned not to expect too much from boys 
 
 i thought you lived in that girls bathroom said harry who had been careful to give the place a wide berth for some years now 
 
 i do she said with a sulky little shrug but that mean i visit other places i came and saw you in your bath once remember 
 
 vividly said harry 
 
 but i thought he liked me she said plaintively maybe if you two left come back again we had lots in common sure he felt it 
 
 and she looked hopefully toward the door 
 
 when you say you had lots in common said ron sounding rather amused now mean he lives in an too 
 
 no said myrtle defiantly her voice echoing loudly around the old tiled bathroom i mean sensitive people bully him too and he feels lonely and got anybody to talk to and not afraid to show his feelings and cry 
 
 been a boy in here crying said harry curiously a young boy 
 
 never you mind said myrtle her small leaky eyes fixed on ron who was now definitely grinning i promised i tell anyone and take his secret to the 
 
 not the grave surely said ron with a snort the sewers maybe 
 
 myrtle gave a howl of rage and dived back into the toilet causing water to slop over the sides and onto the floor goading myrtle seemed to have put fresh heart into ron 
 
 right he said swinging his schoolbag back over his shoulder do the practice sessions in hogsmeade before i decide about taking the test 
 
 and so the following weekend ron joined hermione and the rest of the sixth years who would turn seventeen in time to take the test in a fortnight harry felt rather jealous watching them all get ready to go into the village he missed making trips there and it was a particularly fine spring day one of the first clear skies they had seen in a long time however he had decided to use the time to attempt another assault on the room of requirement 
 
 do better said hermione when he confided this plan to ron and her in the entrance hall to go straight to office and try and get that memory from him 
 
 been trying said harry crossly which was perfectly true he had lagged behind after every potions lesson that week in an attempt to corner slughorn but the potions master always left the dungeon so fast that harry had not been able to catch him twice harry had gone to his office and knocked but received no reply though on the second occasion he was sure he had heard the quickly stifled sounds of an old gramophone 
 
 he want to talk to me hermione he can tell been trying to get him on his own again and not going to let it happen 
 
 well just got to keep at it you 
 
 the short queue of people waiting to file past filch who was doing his usual prodding act with the secrecy sensor moved forward a few steps and harry did not answer in case he was overheard by the caretaker he wished ron and hermione both luck then turned and climbed the marble staircase again determined whatever hermione said to devote an hour or two to the room of requirement 
 
 once out of sight of the entrance hall harry pulled the map and his invisibility cloak from his bag having concealed himself he tapped the map murmured i solemnly swear that i am up to no good and scanned it carefully 
 
 as it was sunday morning nearly all the students were inside their various common rooms the gryffindors in one tower the ravenclaws in another the slytherins in the dungeons and the hufflepuffs in the basement near the kitchens here and there a stray person meandered around the library or up a corridor there were a few people out in the grounds and there alone in the corridor was gregory goyle there was no sign of the room of requirement but harry was not worried about that if goyle was standing guard outside it the room was open whether the map was aware of it or not he therefore sprinted up the stairs slowing down only when he reached the corner into the corridor when he began to creep very slowly toward the very same little girl clutching her heavy brass scales that hermione had so kindly helped a fortnight before he waited until he was right behind her before bending very low and whispering hello very pretty you 
 
 goyle gave a scream of terror threw the scales up into the air and sprinted away vanishing from sight long before the sound of the scales smashing had stopped echoing around the corridor laughing harry turned to contemplate the blank wall behind which he was sure draco malfoy was now standing frozen aware that someone unwelcome was out there but not daring to make an appearance it gave harry a most agreeable feeling of power as he tried to remember what form of words he had not yet tried 
 
 yet this hopeful mood did not last long half an hour later having tried many more variations of his request to see what malfoy was up to the wall was just as doorless as ever harry felt frustrated beyond belief malfoy might be just feet away from him and there was still not the tiniest shred of evidence as to what he was doing in there losing his patience completely harry ran at the wall and kicked it 
 
 ouch 
 
 he thought he might have broken his toe as he clutched it and hopped on one foot the invisibility cloak slipped off him 
 
 harry 
 
 he spun around and toppled over there to his utter astonishment was tonks walking toward him as though she frequently strolled up this corridor 
 
 you doing here he said scrambling to his feet again why did she always have to find him lying on the floor 
 
 i came to see dumbledore said tonks harry thought she looked terrible thinner than usual her hair lank 
 
 his office here said harry round the other side of the castle behind the gargoyle 
 
 i know said tonks not there apparently gone away again 
 
 has he said harry putting his bruised foot gingerly back on the floor heyyou know where he goes i suppose 
 
 no said tonks 
 
 what did you want to see him about 
 
 nothing in particular said tonks picking apparently unconsciously at the sleeve of her robe i just thought he might know going on heard rumors people getting hurt 
 
 yeah i know all been in the papers said harry that little kid trying to kill his 
 
 the prophets often behind the times said tonks who seem to be listening to him you had any letters from anyone in the order recently 
 
 no one from the order writes to me anymore said harry not since sirius 
 
 he saw that her eyes had filled with tears 
 
 sorry he muttered awkwardly i mean i miss him as well 
 
 what said tonks blankly as though she had not heard him well see you around harry 
 
 and she turned abruptly and walked back down the corridor leaving harry to stare after her after a minute or so he pulled the invisibility cloak on again and resumed his efforts to get into the room of requirement but his heart was not in it finally a hollow feeling in his stomach and the knowledge that ron and hermione would soon be back for lunch made him abandon the attempt and leave the corridor to malfoy who hopefully would be too afraid to leave for some hours to come 
 
 he found ron and hermione in the great hall already halfway through an early lunch 
 
 i did itwell kind of ron told harry enthusiastically when he caught sight of him i was supposed to be apparating to outside madam puddifoots tea shop and i overshot it a bit ended up near scrivenshafts but at least i moved 
 
 good one said harry you do hermione 
 
 oh she was perfect obviously said ron before hermione could answer perfect deliberation divination and desperation or whatever the hell it iswe all went for a quick drink in the three broomsticks after and you heard twycross going on about be surprised if he pop the question soon 
 
 and what about you asked hermione ignoring ron have you been up at the room of requirement all this time 
 
 yep said harry and guess who i ran into up there tonks 
 
 tonks repeated ron and hermione together looking surprised 
 
 yeah she said come to visit dumbledore 
 
 if you ask me said ron once harry had finished describing his conversation with tonks cracking up a bit losing her nerve after what happened at the ministry 
 
 a bit odd said hermione who for some reason looked very concerned supposed to be guarding the school why she suddenly abandoning her post to come and see dumbledore when not even here 
 
 i had a thought said harry tentatively he felt strange about voicing it this was much more territory than his you think she can have been you know in love with sirius 
 
 hermione stared at him 
 
 what on earth makes you say that 
 
 i dunno said harry shrugging but she was nearly crying when i mentioned his name and her patronus is a big thing now i wondered whether it become you know him 
 
 a thought said hermione slowly but i still know why be bursting into the castle to see dumbledore if really why she was here 
 
 goes back to what i said it said ron who was now shoveling mashed potato into his mouth gone a bit funny lost her nerve women he said wisely to harry easily upset 
 
 and yet said hermione coming out of her reverie i doubt find a woman who sulked for half an hour because madam rosmerta laugh at their joke about the hag the healer and the mimbulus mimbletonia 
 
 ron scowled 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the half blood prince 
 

lionfish nov chapter the unknowable roomcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 harry wracked his brains over the next week as to how he was to persuade slughorn to hand over the true memory but nothing in the nature of a brain wave occurred and he was reduced to doing what he did increasingly these days when at a loss poring over his potions book hoping that the prince would have scribbled something useful in a margin as he had done so many times before 
 
 you find anything in there said hermione firmly late on sunday evening 
 
 start hermione said harry if it been for the prince ron be sitting here now 
 
 he would if just listened to snape in our first year said hermione dismissively 
 
 harry ignored her he had just found an incantation sectumsempra scrawled in a margin above the intriguing words for enemies and was itching to try it out but thought it best not to in front of hermione instead he surreptitiously folded down the corner of the page 
 
 they were sitting beside the fire in the common room the only other people awake were fellow there had been a certain amount of excitement earlier when they had come back from dinner to find a new sign on the notice board that announced the date for their apparition test those who would be seventeen on or before the first test date the of april had the option of signing up for additional practice sessions which would take place heavily supervised in hogsmeade 
 
 ron had panicked on reading this notice he had still not managed to apparate and feared he would not be ready for the test hermione who had now achieved apparition twice was a little more confident but harry who would not be seventeen for another four months could not take the test whether ready or not 
 
 at least you can apparate though said ron tensely have no trouble come july 
 
 only done it once harry reminded him he had finally managed to disappear and rematerialize inside his hoop during their previous lesson 
 
 having wasted a lot of time worrying aloud about apparition ron was now struggling to finish a viciously difficult essay for snape that harry and hermione had already completed harry fully expected to receive low marks on his because he had disagreed with snape on the best way to tackle dementors but he did not care memory was the most important thing to him now 
 
 telling you the stupid prince going to be able to help you with this harry said hermione more loudly only one way to force someone to do what you want and the imperius curse which is illegal 
 
 yeah i know that thanks said harry not looking up from the book why looking for something different dumbledore says veritaserum do it but there might be something else a potion or a spell 
 
 going about it the wrong way said hermione only you can get the memory dumbledore says that must mean you can persuade slughorn where other people not a question of slipping him a potion anyone could do that 
 
 how do you spell belligerent said ron shaking his quill very hard while staring at his parchment it be bum 
 
 no it said hermione pulling essay toward her and augury begin org either what kind of quill are you using 
 
 one of fred and ones but i think the charm must be wearing off 
 
 yes it must said hermione pointing at the title of his essay because we were asked how deal with dementors not dugbogs and i remember you changing your name to roonil wazlib either 
 
 ah no said ron staring at the parchment say have to write the whole thing out again 
 
 okay we can fix it said hermione pulling the essay toward her and taking out her wand 
 
 i love you hermione said ron sinking back in his chair rubbing his eyes wearily 
 
 hermione turned faintly pink but merely said let lavender hear you saying that 
 
 i said ron into his hands or maybe i will then ditch me 
 
 why you ditch her if you want to finish it asked harry 
 
 you ever chucked anyone have you said ron you and cho just 
 
 sort of fell apart yeah said harry 
 
 wish that would happen with me and lavender said ron gloomily watching hermione silently tapping each of his misspelled words with the end of her wand so that they corrected themselves on the page but the more i hint i want to finish it the tighter she holds on like going out with the giant squid 
 
 there said hermione some twenty minutes later handing back essay 
 
 thanks a million said ron can i borrow your quill for the conclusion harry who had found nothing useful in the notes so far looked around the three of them were now the only ones left in the common room seamus having just gone up to bed cursing snape and his essay the only sounds were the crackling of the fire and ron scratching out one last paragraph on dementors using quill harry had just closed the book yawning when 
 
 crack 
 
 hermione let out a little shriek ron spilled ink all over his freshly completed essay and harry said kreacher 
 
 the bowed low and addressed his own gnarled toes master said he wanted regular reports on what the malfoy boy is doing so kreacher has come to give 
 
 crack 
 
 dobby appeared alongside kreacher his hat askew 
 
 dobby has been helping too harry potter he squeaked casting kreacher a resentful look and kreacher ought to tell dobby when he is coming to see harry potter so they can make their reports together 
 
 what is this asked hermione still looking shocked by these sudden appearances going on harry 
 
 harry hesitated before answering because he had not told hermione about setting kreacher and dobby to tail malfoy were always such a touchy subject with her 
 
 well been following malfoy for me he said 
 
 night and day croaked kreacher 
 
 dobby has not slept for a week harry potter said dobby proudly swaying where he stood 
 
 hermione looked indignant 
 
 you slept dobby but surely harry you tell him not to 
 
 no of course i said harry quickly dobby you can sleep all right but has either of you found out anything he hastened to ask before hermione could intervene again 
 
 master malfoy moves with a nobility that befits his pure blood croaked kreacher at once his features recall the fine bones of my mistress and his manners are those of 
 
 draco malfoy is a bad boy squeaked dobby angrily a bad boy whowho 
 
 he shuddered from the tassel of his tea cozy to the toes of his socks and then ran at the fire as though about to dive into it harry to whom this was not entirely unexpected caught him around the middle and held him fast for a few seconds dobby struggled then went limp 
 
 thank you harry potter he panted dobby still finds it difficult to speak ill of his old masters 
 
 harry released him dobby straightened his tea cozy and said defiantly to kreacher but kreacher should know that draco malfoy is not a good master to a 
 
 yeah we need to hear about you being in love with malfoy harry told kreacher fast forward to where actually been going 
 
 kreacher bowed again looking furious and then said master malfoy eats in the great hall he sleeps in a dormitory in the dungeons he attends his classes in a variety of 
 
 dobby you tell me said harry cutting across kreacher has he been going anywhere he have 
 
 harry potter sir squeaked dobby his great orblike eyes shining in the firelight the malfoy boy is breaking no rules that dobby can discover but he is still keen to avoid detection he has been making regular visits to the seventh floor with a variety of other students who keep watch for him while he enters 
 
 the room of requirement said harry smacking himself hard on the forehead with advanced hermione and ron stared at him where been sneaking off to where doing whatever doing and i bet why been disappearing off the mapcome to think of it never seen the room of requirement on there 
 
 maybe the marauders never knew the room was there said ron 
 
 i think be part of the magic of the room said hermione if you need it to be unplottable it will be 
 
 dobby have you managed to get in to have a look at what doing said harry eagerly 
 
 no harry potter that is impossible said dobby 
 
 no not said harry at once malfoy got into our headquarters there last year so be able to get in and spy on him no problem 
 
 but i think you will harry said hermione slowly malfoy already knew exactly how we were using the room he because that stupid marietta had blabbed he needed the room to become the headquarters of the so it did but you know what the room becomes when malfoy goes in there so you know what to ask it to transform into 
 
 be a way around that said harry dismissively done brilliantly dobby 
 
 done well too said hermione kindly but far from looking grateful kreacher averted his huge bloodshot eyes and croaked at the ceiling the mudblood is speaking to kreacher kreacher will pretend he cannot hear 
 
 get out of it harry snapped at him and kreacher made one last deep bow and disapparated better go and get some sleep too dobby 
 
 thank you harry potter sir squeaked dobby happily and he too vanished 
 
 how good is this said harry enthusiastically turning to ron and hermione the moment the room was again we know where going got him cornered now 
 
 yeah great said ron glumly who was attempting to mop up the sodden mass of ink that had recently been an almost completed essay hermione pulled it toward her and began siphoning the ink off with her wand 
 
 but all this about him going up there with a variety of students said hermione how many people are in on it you think trust lots of them to know what doing 
 
 yeah that is weird said harry frowning i heard him telling crabbe it business what he was doing so he telling all these all these 
 
 voice tailed away he was staring at the fire god been stupid he said quietly obvious it there was a great vat of it down in the dungeon he nicked some any time during that lesson 
 
 nicked what said ron 
 
 polyjuice potion he stole some of the polyjuice potion slughorn showed us in our first potions lesson there a whole variety of students standing guard for malfoy just crabbe and goyle as usual yeah it all fits said harry jumping up and starting to pace in front of the fire stupid enough to do what told even if he tell them what up to but he want them to be seen lurking around outside the room of requirement so got them taking polyjuice to make them look like other people those two girls i saw him with when he missed quidditchha crabbe and goyle 
 
 do you mean to say said hermione in a hushed voice that that little girl whose scales i repaired 
 
 yeah of course said harry loudly staring at her of course malfoy been inside the room at the time so shewhat am i talking dropped the scales to tell malfoy not to come out because there was someone there and there was that girl who dropped the toadspawn too been walking past him all the time and not realizing it 
 
 got crabbe and goyle transforming into girls guffawed ron blimey no wonder they look too happy these days surprised they tell him to stuff it 
 
 well they would they if shown them his dark mark said harry 
 
 hmmm the dark mark we know exists said hermione skeptically rolling up dried essay before it could come to any more harm and handing it to him 
 
 see said harry confidently 
 
 yes we will hermione said getting to her feet and stretching but harry before you get all excited i still think be able to get into the room of requirement without knowing there first and i think you should forget she heaved her bag onto her shoulder and gave him a very serious look that what supposed to be concentrating on is getting that memory from slughorn goodnight 
 
 harry watched her go feeling slightly disgruntled once the door to the girls dormitories had closed behind her he rounded on ron 
 
 what think 
 
 wish i could disapparate like a said ron staring at the spot where dobby had vanished have that apparition test in the bag 
 
 harry did not sleep well that night he lay awake for what felt like hours wondering how malfoy was using the room of requirement and what he harry would see when he went in there the following day for whatever hermione said harry was sure that if malfoy had been able to see the headquarters of the he would be able to see what could it be a meeting place a hideout a store room a workshop mind worked feverishly and his dreams when he finally fell asleep were broken and disturbed by images of malfoy who turned into slughorn who turned into snape 
 
 harry was in a state of great anticipation over breakfast the following morning he had a free period before defense against the dark arts and was determined to spend it trying to get into the room of requirement hermione was rather ostentatiously showing no interest in his whispered plans for forcing entry into the room which irritated harry because he thought she might be a lot of help if she wanted to 
 
 look he said quietly leaning forward and putting a hand on the daily prophet which she had just removed from a post owl to stop her from opening it and vanishing behind it i forgotten about slughorn but i got a clue how to get that memory off him and until i get a brain wave why i find out what doing 
 
 already told you you need to persuade slughorn said hermione not a question of tricking him or bewitching him or dumbledore could have done it in a second instead of messing around outside the room of requirement she jerked the prophet out from under hand and unfolded it to look at the front page you should go and find slughorn and start appealing to his better nature 
 
 anyone we know asked ron as hermione scanned the headlines 
 
 yes said hermione causing both harry and ron to gag on their breakfast but all right not mundungus been arrested and sent to azkaban something to do with impersonating an inferius during an attempted burglary and someone called octavius pepper has vanished oh and how horrible a boy has been arrested for trying to kill his grandparents they think he was under the imperius curse 
 
 they finished their breakfast in silence hermione set off immediately for ancient runes ron for the common room where he still had to finish his conclusion on dementor essay and harry for the corridor on the seventh floor and the stretch of wall opposite the tapestry of barnabas the barmy teaching trolls to do ballet 
 
 harry slipped on his invisibility cloak once he had found an empty passage but he need not have bothered when he reached his destination he found it deserted harry was not sure whether his chances of getting inside the room were better with malfoy inside it or out but at least his first attempt was not going to be complicated by the presence of crabbe or goyle pretending to be an girl 
 
 he closed his eyes as he approached the place where the room of door was concealed he knew what he had to do he had become most accomplished at it last year concentrating with all his might he thought i need to see what doing in here i need to see what doing in here i need to see what doing in here 
 
 three times he walked past the door then his heart pounding with excitement he opened his eyes and faced itbut he was still looking at a stretch of mundanely blank wall 
 
 he moved forward and gave it an experimental push the stone remained solid and unyielding 
 
 okay said harry aloud okay i thought the wrong thing 
 
 he pondered for a moment then set off again eyes closed concentrating as hard as he could 
 
 i need to see the place where malfoy keeps coming secretly i need to see the place where malfoy keeps coming secretly 
 
 after three walks past he opened his eyes expectantly 
 
 there was no door 
 
 oh come off it he told the wall irritably that was a clear instruction fine 
 
 he thought hard for several minutes before striding off once more 
 
 i need you to become the place you become for draco malfoy 
 
 he did not immediately open his eyes when he had finished his patrolling he was listening hard as though he might hear the door pop into existence he heard nothing however except the distant twittering of birds outside he opened his eyes 
 
 there was still no door 
 
 harry swore someone screamed he looked around to see a gaggle of first years running back around the corner apparently under the impression that they had just encountered a particularly ghost 
 
 harry tried every variation of i need to see what draco malfoy is doing inside you that he could think of for a whole hour at the end of which he was forced to concede that hermione might have had a point the room simply did not want to open for him frustrated and annoyed he set off for defense against the dark arts pulling off his invisibility cloak and stuffing it into his bag as he went 
 
 late again potter said snape coldly as harry hurried into the candlelit classroom ten points from gryfrindor harry scowled at snape as he flung himself into the seat beside ron half the class were still on their feet taking out books and organizing their things he could not be much later than any of them 
 
 before we start i want your dementor essays said snape waving his wand carelessly so that scrolls of parchment soared into the air and landed in a neat pile on his desk and i hope for your sakes they are better than the tripe i had to endure on resisting the imperius curse now if you will all open your books to pagewhat is it mr finnigan 
 
 sir said seamus been wondering how do you tell the difference between an inferius and a ghost because there was something in the prophet about an inferius 
 
 no there said snape in a bored voice 
 
 but sir i heard people talking 
 
 if you had actually read the article in question mr finnigan you would have known that the inferius was nothing but a smelly sneak thief by the name of mundungus fletcher 
 
 i thought snape and mundungus were on the same side muttered harry to ron and hermione he be upset mundungus has been arrest 
 
 but potter seems to have a lot to say on the subject said snape pointing suddenly at the back of the room his black eyes fixed on harry let us ask potter how we would tell the difference between an inferius and a ghost 
 
 the whole class looked around at harry who hastily tried to recall what dumbledore had told him the night that they had gone to visit slughorn 
 
 erwellghosts are transparent he said 
 
 oh very good interrupted snape his lip curling yes it in easy to see that nearly six years of magical education have not been wasted on you potter ghosts are transparent 
 
 pansy parkinson let out a giggle several other people were smirking harry took a deep breath and continued calmly though his insides were boiling yeah ghosts are transparent but inferi are dead bodies they so be solid 
 
 a could have told us as much sneered snape the inferius is a corpse that has been reanimated by a dark spells it is not alive it is merely used like a puppet to do the bidding a ghost as i trust that you are all aware by now is the imprint of a departed soul left upon the earth and of course as potter so wisely tells us transparent 
 
 well what harry said is the most useful if trying to tell them apart said ron when we come with one down a dark alley going to be having a look to see if solid we not going to be asking excuse me are you the imprint of a departed soul 
 
 there was a ripple of laughter instantly quelled by the look snape gave the class 
 
 another ten points from gryffindor said snape i would expect nothing more sophisticated from you ronald weasley the boy so solid he cannot apparate half an inch across a room 
 
 no whispered hermione grabbing arm as he opened his mouth furiously no point just end up in detention again leave it 
 
 now open your books to page two hundred and thirteen said snape smirking a little and read the first two paragraphs on the cruciatus curse 
 
 ron was very subdued all through the class when the bell sounded at the end of the lesson lavender caught up with ron and harry hermione mysteriously melted out of sight as she approached and abused snape hotly for his jibe about apparition but this seemed to merely irritate ron and he shook her off by making a detour into the boys bathroom with harry 
 
 right though he said ron after staring into a cracked mirror for a minute or two i dunno whether worth me taking the test i just get the hang of apparition 
 
 you might as well do the extra practice sessions in hogsmeade and see where they get you said harry reasonably be more interesting than trying to get into a stupid hoop anyway then if still notyou knowas good as like to be you can postpone the test do it with me over the summermyrtle this is the boys bathroom 
 
 the ghost of a girl had risen out of the toilet in a cubicle behind them and was now floating in midair staring at them through thick white round glasses 
 
 oh she said glumly you two 
 
 who were you expecting said ron looking at her in the mirror 
 
 nobody said myrtle picking moodily at a spot on her chin he said come back and see me but then you said pop in and visit me too she gave harry a reproachful look and i seen you for months and months learned not to expect too much from boys 
 
 i thought you lived in that girls bathroom said harry who had been careful to give the place a wide berth for some years now 
 
 i do she said with a sulky little shrug but that mean i visit other places i came and saw you in your bath once remember 
 
 vividly said harry 
 
 but i thought he liked me she said plaintively maybe if you two left come back again we had lots in common sure he felt it 
 
 and she looked hopefully toward the door 
 
 when you say you had lots in common said ron sounding rather amused now mean he lives in an too 
 
 no said myrtle defiantly her voice echoing loudly around the old tiled bathroom i mean sensitive people bully him too and he feels lonely and got anybody to talk to and not afraid to show his feelings and cry 
 
 been a boy in here crying said harry curiously a young boy 
 
 never you mind said myrtle her small leaky eyes fixed on ron who was now definitely grinning i promised i tell anyone and take his secret to the 
 
 not the grave surely said ron with a snort the sewers maybe 
 
 myrtle gave a howl of rage and dived back into the toilet causing water to slop over the sides and onto the floor goading myrtle seemed to have put fresh heart into ron 
 
 right he said swinging his schoolbag back over his shoulder do the practice sessions in hogsmeade before i decide about taking the test 
 
 and so the following weekend ron joined hermione and the rest of the sixth years who would turn seventeen in time to take the test in a fortnight harry felt rather jealous watching them all get ready to go into the village he missed making trips there and it was a particularly fine spring day one of the first clear skies they had seen in a long time however he had decided to use the time to attempt another assault on the room of requirement 
 
 do better said hermione when he confided this plan to ron and her in the entrance hall to go straight to office and try and get that memory from him 
 
 been trying said harry crossly which was perfectly true he had lagged behind after every potions lesson that week in an attempt to corner slughorn but the potions master always left the dungeon so fast that harry had not been able to catch him twice harry had gone to his office and knocked but received no reply though on the second occasion he was sure he had heard the quickly stifled sounds of an old gramophone 
 
 he want to talk to me hermione he can tell been trying to get him on his own again and not going to let it happen 
 
 well just got to keep at it you 
 
 the short queue of people waiting to file past filch who was doing his usual prodding act with the secrecy sensor moved forward a few steps and harry did not answer in case he was overheard by the caretaker he wished ron and hermione both luck then turned and climbed the marble staircase again determined whatever hermione said to devote an hour or two to the room of requirement 
 
 once out of sight of the entrance hall harry pulled the map and his invisibility cloak from his bag having concealed himself he tapped the map murmured i solemnly swear that i am up to no good and scanned it carefully 
 
 as it was sunday morning nearly all the students were inside their various common rooms the gryffindors in one tower the ravenclaws in another the slytherins in the dungeons and the hufflepuffs in the basement near the kitchens here and there a stray person meandered around the library or up a corridor there were a few people out in the grounds and there alone in the corridor was gregory goyle there was no sign of the room of requirement but harry was not worried about that if goyle was standing guard outside it the room was open whether the map was aware of it or not he therefore sprinted up the stairs slowing down only when he reached the corner into the corridor when he began to creep very slowly toward the very same little girl clutching her heavy brass scales that hermione had so kindly helped a fortnight before he waited until he was right behind her before bending very low and whispering hello very pretty you 
 
 goyle gave a scream of terror threw the scales up into the air and sprinted away vanishing from sight long before the sound of the scales smashing had stopped echoing around the corridor laughing harry turned to contemplate the blank wall behind which he was sure draco malfoy was now standing frozen aware that someone unwelcome was out there but not daring to make an appearance it gave harry a most agreeable feeling of power as he tried to remember what form of words he had not yet tried 
 
 yet this hopeful mood did not last long half an hour later having tried many more variations of his request to see what malfoy was up to the wall was just as doorless as ever harry felt frustrated beyond belief malfoy might be just feet away from him and there was still not the tiniest shred of evidence as to what he was doing in there losing his patience completely harry ran at the wall and kicked it 
 
 ouch 
 
 he thought he might have broken his toe as he clutched it and hopped on one foot the invisibility cloak slipped off him 
 
 harry 
 
 he spun around and toppled over there to his utter astonishment was tonks walking toward him as though she frequently strolled up this corridor 
 
 you doing here he said scrambling to his feet again why did she always have to find him lying on the floor 
 
 i came to see dumbledore said tonks harry thought she looked terrible thinner than usual her hair lank 
 
 his office here said harry round the other side of the castle behind the gargoyle 
 
 i know said tonks not there apparently gone away again 
 
 has he said harry putting his bruised foot gingerly back on the floor heyyou know where he goes i suppose 
 
 no said tonks 
 
 what did you want to see him about 
 
 nothing in particular said tonks picking apparently unconsciously at the sleeve of her robe i just thought he might know going on heard rumors people getting hurt 
 
 yeah i know all been in the papers said harry that little kid trying to kill his 
 
 the prophets often behind the times said tonks who seem to be listening to him you had any letters from anyone in the order recently 
 
 no one from the order writes to me anymore said harry not since sirius 
 
 he saw that her eyes had filled with tears 
 
 sorry he muttered awkwardly i mean i miss him as well 
 
 what said tonks blankly as though she had not heard him well see you around harry 
 
 and she turned abruptly and walked back down the corridor leaving harry to stare after her after a minute or so he pulled the invisibility cloak on again and resumed his efforts to get into the room of requirement but his heart was not in it finally a hollow feeling in his stomach and the knowledge that ron and hermione would soon be back for lunch made him abandon the attempt and leave the corridor to malfoy who hopefully would be too afraid to leave for some hours to come 
 
 he found ron and hermione in the great hall already halfway through an early lunch 
 
 i did itwell kind of ron told harry enthusiastically when he caught sight of him i was supposed to be apparating to outside madam puddifoots tea shop and i overshot it a bit ended up near scrivenshafts but at least i moved 
 
 good one said harry you do hermione 
 
 oh she was perfect obviously said ron before hermione could answer perfect deliberation divination and desperation or whatever the hell it iswe all went for a quick drink in the three broomsticks after and you heard twycross going on about be surprised if he pop the question soon 
 
 and what about you asked hermione ignoring ron have you been up at the room of requirement all this time 
 
 yep said harry and guess who i ran into up there tonks 
 
 tonks repeated ron and hermione together looking surprised 
 
 yeah she said come to visit dumbledore 
 
 if you ask me said ron once harry had finished describing his conversation with tonks cracking up a bit losing her nerve after what happened at the ministry 
 
 a bit odd said hermione who for some reason looked very concerned supposed to be guarding the school why she suddenly abandoning her post to come and see dumbledore when not even here 
 
 i had a thought said harry tentatively he felt strange about voicing it this was much more territory than his you think she can have been you know in love with sirius 
 
 hermione stared at him 
 
 what on earth makes you say that 
 
 i dunno said harry shrugging but she was nearly crying when i mentioned his name and her patronus is a big thing now i wondered whether it become you know him 
 
 a thought said hermione slowly but i still know why be bursting into the castle to see dumbledore if really why she was here 
 
 goes back to what i said it said ron who was now shoveling mashed potato into his mouth gone a bit funny lost her nerve women he said wisely to harry easily upset 
 
 and yet said hermione coming out of her reverie i doubt find a woman who sulked for half an hour because madam rosmerta laugh at their joke about the hag the healer and the mimbulus mimbletonia 
 
 ron scowled 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the half blood prince 
 

lionfish nov chapter the tale of the three brotherscontents prev chapter next chapter 
 
 harry turned to look at ron and hermione neither of them seemed to have understood what xenophilius had said either 
 
 the deathly hallows 
 
 thats right said xenophilius you havent heard of them im not surprised very very few wizards believe witness that young man at your brothers wedding he nodded at ron who attacked me for sporting the symbol of a dark wizard such ignorance there is nothing dark about the hallows c at least not in that crude sense one simply uses the symbol to reveal oneself to other believers in the hope that they might help one with the quest 
 
 he stirred several lumps of sugar into his gurdyroot infusion and drank some 
 
 im sorry said harry i still dont really understand 
 
 to be polite he took a sip from his cup too and almost gagged the stuff was quite disgusting as though someone had liquidized every flavor beans 
 
 well you see believers seek the deathly hallows said xenophilius smacking his lips in apparent appreciation of the gurdyroot infusion 
 
 but what are the deathly hallows asked hermione 
 
 xenophilius set aside his empty teacup 
 
 i assume that you are familiar with the tale of the three brothers 
 
 harry said no but ron and hermione both said yes xenophilius nodded gravely 
 
 well well mr potter the whole thing starts with the tale of the three brothers i have a copy somewhere 
 
 he glanced vaguely around the room at the piles of parchment and books but hermione said ive got a copy mr lovegood ive got it right here 
 
 and she pulled out the tales of beedle the bard from the small beaded bag 
 
 the original inquired xenophilius sharply and when she nodded he said well then why dont you read it out aloud much the best way to make sure we all understand 
 
 er all right said hermione nervously she opened the book and harry saw that the symbol they were investigating headed the top of the page as she gave a little cough and began to read 
 
 
 
 
 there were once three brothers who were traveling along a lonely winding road at twilight c 
 
 
 
 
 midnight our mum always told us said ron who had stretched out arms behind his head to listen hermione shot him a look of annoyance 
 
 sorry i just think its a bit spookier if its midnight said ron 
 
 yeah because we really need a bit more fear in our lives said harry before he could stop himself xenophilius did not seem to be paying much attention but was staring out of the window at the sky go on hermione 
 
 
 
 
 in time the brothers reached a river too deep to wade through and too dangerous to swim across however these brothers were learned in the magical arts and so they simply waved their wands and made a bridge appear across the treacherous water they were halfway across it when they found their path blocked by a hooded figure 
 
 and death spoke to them c 
 
 
 
 
 sorry interjected harry but death spoke to them 
 
 its a fairy tale harry 
 
 right sorry go on 
 
 
 
 
 and death spoke to them he was angry that he had been cheated out of the three new victims for travelers usually drowned in the river but death was cunning he pretended to congratulate the three brothers upon their magic and said that each had earned a prize for having been clever enough to evade him 
 
 so the oldest brother who was a combative man asked for a wand more powerful than any in existence a wand that must always win duels for its owner a wand worthy of a wizard who had conquered death so death crossed to an elder tree on the banks of the river fashioned a wand from a branch that hung there and gave it to the oldest brother 
 
 then the second brother who was an arrogant man decided that he wanted to humiliate death still further and asked for the power to recall others from death so death picked up a stone from the riverbank and gave it to the second brother and told him that the stone would have the power to bring back the dead 
 
 and then death asked the third and youngest brother what he would like the youngest brother was the humblest and also the wisest of the brothers and he did not trust death so he asked for something that would enable him to go forth from that place without being followed by death and death most unwillingly handed over his own cloak of invisibility 
 
 
 
 
 deaths got an invisibility cloak harry interrupted again 
 
 so he can sneak up on people said ron sometimes he gets bored of running at them flapping his arms and shrieking sorry hermione 
 
 
 
 
 then death stood aside and allowed the three brothers to continue on their way and they did so talking with wonder of the adventure they had had and admiring deaths gifts 
 
 in due course the brothers separated each for his own destination 
 
 the first brother traveled on for a week more and reaching a distant village sought out a fellow wizard with whom he had a quarrel naturally with the elder wand as his weapon he could not fail to win the duel that followed leaving his enemy dead upon the floor the oldest brother proceeded to an inn where he boasted loudly of the powerful wand he had snatched from death himself and of how it made him invincible 
 
 that very night another wizard crept upon the oldest brother as he lay upon his bed the thief took the wand and for good measure slit the oldest brothers throat 
 
 and so death took the first brother for his own 
 
 meanwhile the second brother journeyed to his own home where he lived alone here he took out the stone that had the power to recall the dead and turned it thrice in his hand to his amazement and his delight the figure of the girl he had once hoped to marry before her untimely death appeared at once before him 
 
 yet she was sad and cold separated from him as by a veil though she had returned to the mortal world she did not truly belong there and suffered finally the second brother driven mad with hopeless longing killed himself so as to truly join her 
 
 and so death took the second brother from his own 
 
 but though death searched for the third brother for many years he was never able to find him it was only when he had attained a great age that the youngest brother finally took off the cloak of invisibility and gave it to his son and the he greeted death as an old friend and went with him gladly and equals they departed this life 
 
 
 
 
 hermione closed the book it was a moment or two before xenophilius seemed to realize that she had stopped reading then he withdrew his gaze from the window and said well there you are 
 
 sorry said hermione sounding confused 
 
 those are the deathly hallows said xenophilius 
 
 he picked up a quill from a packed table at his elbow and pulled a torn piece of parchment from between more books 
 
 the elder wand he said and drew a straight vertical line upon the parchment the resurrection stone he said and added a circle on top of the line the cloak of invisibility he finished enclosing both line and circle in a triangle to make the symbols that so intrigued hermione together he said the deathly hallows 
 
 but theres no mention of the words deathly hallows in the story said hermione 
 
 well of course not said xenophilius maddeningly smug that is a childrens tale told to amuse rather than to instruct those of us who understand these matters however recognize that the ancient story refers to three objects or hallows which if united will make the possessor master of death 
 
 there was a short silence in which xenophilius glanced out of the window already the sun was low in the sky 
 
 luna ought to have enough plimpies soon he said quietly 
 
 when you say master of death c said ron 
 
 master said xenophilius waving an airy hand conqueror vanquisher whichever term you prefer 
 
 but then do you mean said hermione slowly and harry could tell that she was trying to keep any trace of skepticism out of her voice that you believe these objects c these hallows c really exist 
 
 xenophilius raised his eyebrows again 
 
 well of course 
 
 but said hermione and harry could hear her restraint starting to crack mr lovegood how can you possibly believe c 
 
 luna has told me all about you young lady said xenophilius you are i gather not unintelligent but painfully limited narrow 
 
 perhaps you ought to try on the hat hermione said ron nodding toward the ludicrous headdress his voice shook with the strain of not laughing 
 
 mr lovegood hermione began again we all know that there are such things as invisibility cloaks they are rare but they exist but c 
 
 ah but the third hallow is a true cloak of invisibility miss granger i mean to say it is not a traveling cloak imbued with a disillusionment charm or carrying a bedazzling hex or else woven from demiguise hair which will hide one initially but fade with the years until it turns opaque we are talking about a cloak that really and truly renders the wearer completely invisible and endures eternally giving constant and impenetrable concealment no matter what spells are cast at it how many cloaks have you ever seen like that miss granger 
 
 hermione opened her mouth to answer then closed it again looking more confused than ever she harry and ron glanced at one another and harry knew that they were all thinking the same thing it so happened that a cloak exactly like the one xenophilius had just described was in the room with them at that very moment 
 
 exactly said xenophilius as if he had defeated them all in reasoned argument none of you have ever seen such a thing the possessor would be immeasurably rich would he not 
 
 he glanced out of the window again the sky was now tinged with the faintest trace of pink 
 
 all right said hermione disconcerted say the cloak existed what about that stone mr lovegood the thing you call the resurrection stone 
 
 what of it 
 
 well how can that be real 
 
 prove that is not said xenophilius 
 
 hermione looked outraged 
 
 but thats c im sorry but thats completely ridiculous how can i possibly prove it doesnt exist do you expect me to get hold of c of all the pebbles in the world and test them i mean you could claim that anythings real if the only basis for believing in it is that nobodys proved it doesnt exist 
 
 yes you could said xenophilius i am glad to see that you are opening your mind a little 
 
 so the elder wand said harry quickly before hermione could retort you think that exists too 
 
 oh well in that case there is endless evidence said xenophilius the elder wand is the hallow that is most easily traced because of the way in which it passes from hand to hand 
 
 which is what asked harry 
 
 which is that the possessor of the wand must capture it from its previous owner if he is to be truly master of it said xenophilius surely you have heard of the way the wand came to egbert the egregious after his slaughter of emeric the evil of how godelot died in his own cellar after his son hereward took the wand from him of the dreadful loxias who took the wand from baraabas deverill whom he had killed the bloody trail of the elder wand is splattered across the pages of wizarding history 
 
 harry glanced at hermione she was frowning at xenophilius but she did not contradict him 
 
 so where do you think the elder wand is now asked ron 
 
 alas who knows said xenophilius as he gazed out of the window who knows where the elder wand lies hidden the trail goes cold with arcus and livius who can say which of them really defeated loxias and which took the wand and who can say who may have defeated them history alas does not tell us 
 
 there was a pause finally hermione asked stiffly mr lovegood does the peverell family have anything to do with the deathly hallows 
 
 xenophilius looked taken aback as something shifted in harrys memory but he could not locate it peverell he had heard that name before 
 
 but you have been misleading me young woman said xenophilius now sitting up much straighter in his chair and goggling at hermione i thought you were new to the hallows quest many of us questers believe that the peverells have everything c everything c to do with the hallows 
 
 who are the peverells asked ron 
 
 that was the name on the grave with the mark on it in godrics hollow said hermione still watching xenophilius ignotus peverell 
 
 exactly said xenophilius his forefinger raised pedantically the sign of the death hallows on ignotuss grave is conclusive proof 
 
 of what asked ron 
 
 why that the three brothers in the story were actually the three peverell brothers antioch cadmus and ignotus that they were the original owners of the hallows 
 
 with another glance at the window he got to his feet picked up the tray and headed for the spiral staircase 
 
 you will stay for dinner he called as he vanished downstairs again everybody always requests our recipe for freshwater plimply soup 
 
 probably to show the poisoning department at st mungos said ron under his breath 
 
 harry waited until they could hear xenophilius moving about in the kitchen downstairs before speaking 
 
 what do you think he asked hermione 
 
 oh harry she said wearily its a pile of utter rubbish this cant be what the sign really means this must just be his weird take on it what a waste of time 
 
 i spose this is the man who brought us snorkacks said ron 
 
 you didnt believe it either harry asked him 
 
 nah that storys just one of those things you tell kids to teach them lessons isnt it dont go looking for trouble dont go pick fights dont go messing around with stuff thats best left alone just keep your head down mind your own business and youll be okay come to think of it ron added maybe that storys why elder wands are supposed to be unlucky 
 
 what are you talking about 
 
 one of those superstitions isnt it witches will marry muggles jinx by twilight undone by midnight wand of cider never prosper you must have heard them my mums full of them 
 
 harry and i were raised by muggles hermione reminded him we were taught different superstitions she sighed deeply as a rather pungent smell drifted up from the kitchen the one good thing about her exasperation with xenophilius was that it seemed to have made her forget that she was annoyed at ron i think youre right she told him its just a morality tale its obvious which gift is best which one youd choose c 
 
 the three of them spoke at the same time hermione said the cloak ron said the wand and harry said the stone 
 
 they looked at each other half surprised half amused 
 
 youre supposed to say the cloak ron told hermione but you wouldnt need to be invisible if you had the wand an unbeatable wand hermione come on 
 
 weve already got an invisibility cloak said harry and its helped us rather a lot in case you hadnt noticed said hermione whereas the wand would be bound to attract troublec 
 
 only if you shouted about it argued ron only if you were prat enough to go dancing around waving it over your head and singing ive got an unbeatable want come and have a go if you think youre hard enough as long as you kept your trap shut c 
 
 yes but could you keep your trap shut said hermione looking skeptical you know the only true thing he said to us was that there have been stories about wands for hundreds of years 
 
 there have asked harry 
 
 hermione looked exasperated the expression was so endearingly familiar that harry and ron grinned at each other 
 
 the deathstick the wand of destiny they crop up under different names through the centuries usually in the possession of some dark wizard whos boasting about them 
 
 professor binns mentioned some of them but c oh its all nonsense wands are only as powerful as the wizards who use them some wizards just like to boast that theirs are bigger and better than other peoples 
 
 but how do you know said harry that those wants c the deathstick and the wand of destiny c arent the same want surfacing over the centuries under different names 
 
 what if theyre all really the elder wand made by death said ron harry laughed the strange idea that had occurred to him was after all ridiculous his wand he reminded himself had been of holly not elder and it had been made by ollivander whatever it had done that night voldemort had pursued him across the skies and if it had been unbeatable how could it have been broken so why would you take the stone ron asked him well if you could bring people back we could have parents neither ron nor hermione smiled 
 
 but according to beedle the bard they wouldnt want to come back would they said harry thinking about the tail they had just heard i dont suppose there have been loads of other stories about a stone that can raise the dead have there he asked hermione no she replied sadly i dont think anyone except mr lovegood could kid themselves thats possible beedle probably took the idea from the sorcerers stone you know instead of a stone to make you immortal a stone to reverse death the smell from the kitchen was getting stronger it was something like burning underpants harry wondered whether it would be possible to eat enough of whatever xenophilius was cooking to spare his feelings 
 
 what about the cloak though said ron slowly dont you realize hes right ive got so used to harrys cloak and how good it is i never stopped to think ive never heard of one like harrys its infallible weve never been spotted under it c 
 
 of course not c were invisible when were under it ron 
 
 but all the stuff he said about other cloaks and theyre not exactly ten a kanut you know is true its never occurred to me before but ive heard stuff about charms wearing off cloaks when they get old or them being ripped apart by spells so theyve got holes harrys was owned by his dad so its not exactly new is it but its just perfect 
 
 yes all right but ron the stone 
 
 as they argued in whispers harry moved around the room only half listening reaching the spiral stair he raised his eyes absently to the next level and was distracted at once his own face was looking back at him from the ceiling of the room above after a moments bewilderment he realized that it was not a mirror but a painting curious he began to clime the stairs 
 
 harry what are you doing i dont think you should look around when hes not here but harry had already reached the next level luna had decorated her bedroom ceiling with five beautifully painted faces harry ron hermione ginny and neville they were not moving as the portraits at hogwarts moved but there was a certain magic about them all the same harry thought they breathed what appeared to be a fine golden chains wove around the pictures linking them together but after examining them for a minute or so harry realized that the chains were actually one work repeated a thousand times in golden ink friends friends friends 
 
 harry felt a great rush of affection for luna he looked around the room there was a large photograph beside the bed of a young luna and a woman who looked very like her they were hugging luna looked rather in this picture than harry had ever seen her in life the picture was dusty this struck harry as slightly odd he stared around something was wrong the pale blue carpet was also thick with dust there were no clothes in the wardrobe whose doors stood ajar the bed had a cold unfriendly look as though it had not been slept in for weeks a single cobweb stretched over the nearest window across the blood red sky 
 
 whats wrong hermione asked as harry descended the staircase but before he could respond xenophilius reached the top of the stairs from the kitchen now holding a tray laden with bowls 
 
 mr lovegood said harry wheres luna 
 
 excuse me 
 
 wheres luna 
 
 xenophilius halted on the top step 
 
 i c ive already told you she is down at the botions bridge fishing for plimpies 
 
 so why have you only laid that tray for four 
 
 xenophilius tried to speak but no sound came out the only noise was the continued chugging of the printing press and a slight rattle from the tray as xenophiliuss hands shook 
 
 i dont think lunas been here for weeks said harry her clothes are gone her bed hasnt been slept in where is she and why do you keep looking out of the window 
 
 xenophilius dropped the tray the bowls bounced and smashed harry ron and hermione drew their wands xenophilius froze his hand about to enter his pocket at that moment the printing press have a huge bank and numerous quibblers came streaming across the floor from underneath the tablecloth the press fell silent at last hermione stooped down and picked up one of the magazines her wand still pointing at mr lovegood 
 
 harry look at this he strode over to her as quickly as he could through all the clutter 
 
 the front of the quibbler carried his own picture emblazoned with the words undesirable number one and captioned with the reward money 
 
 the quibblers going for a new angle then harry asked coldly his mind working very fast is that what you were doing when you went into the garden mr lovegood 
 
 sending an owl to the ministry 
 
 xenophilius licked his lips they took my luna he whispered because of what ive been writing they took my luna and i dont know where she is what theyve done to her but they might give her back to me if i c if ic 
 
 hand over harry hermione finished for him 
 
 no deal said ron flatly get out of the way were leaving 
 
 xenophilius looked ghastly a century old his lips drawn back into a dreadful leer 
 
 they will be here any moment i must save luna i cannot lose luna you must not leave 
 
 he spread his arms in front of the staircase and harry had a sudden vision of his mother doing the same thing in front of his crib 
 
 dont make us hurt you harry said get out of the way mr lovegood 
 
 harry hermione screamed 
 
 figures on broomsticks were flying past the windows as the three of them looked away from him xenophilius drew his wand harry realized their mistake just in time he launched himself sideways shoving ron and hermione out of harms way as xenophiliuss stunning spell soared across the room and hit the erumpent horn 
 
 there was a colossal explosion the sound of it seemed to blow the room apart 
 
 fragments of wood and paper and rubble flew in all directions along with an impenetrable cloud of thick white dust harry flew through the air then crashed to the floor unable to see as debris rained upon him his arms over his head he heard hermiones scream rons yell and a series of sickening metallic thuds which told him that xenophilius had been blasted off his feet and fallen backward down the spiral stairs 
 
 half buried in rubble harry tried to raise himself he could barely breathe or see for dust 
 
 half of the ceiling had fall in and the end of lunas bead was hanging through the hole 
 
 the bust of rowena ravenclaw lay beside him with half its face missing fragments of torn parchment were floating through the air and most of the printing press lay on its side blocking the top of the staircase to the kitchen then another white shape moved close by and hermione coated in dust like a second statue pressed his finger to her lips 
 
 the door downstairs crashed open 
 
 didnt i tell you there was no need to hurry travers said a rough voice didnt i tell you this nutter was just raving as usual there was a bang and a scream of pain from xenophilius 
 
 nonoupstairspotter 
 
 i told you last week lovegood we werent coming back for anything less than some solid information remember last week when you wanted to swap your daughter for that stupid bleeding headdress and the week before c another bang another squeal c when you thought wed give her back if you offered us proof there are cumple c bang c headedcbangc snorkacks 
 
 no c no c i beg of you sobbed xenophilius it really is potter really 
 
 and now it turns out you only called us here to try and blow us up roared the death eater and there was a volley of bangs interspersed with squeals of agony from xenophilius 
 
 the place looks like its about to fall in selwyn said a cool second voice echoing up the mangled staircase the stairs are completely blocked could try clearing it might bring the place down 
 
 you lying piece of filth shouted the wizard named selwyn 
 
 you have never seen potter in your life have you thought youd lure us here to kill us did you and you think youll get your girl back like this 
 
 i sweari swearpotters upstairs 
 
 homenum revelio said the voice at the foot of the stairs harry heard hermione gasp and he had the odd sensation something was swooping low over him immersing his body in its shadow 
 
 theres someone up there all right selwyn said the second man sharply 
 
 its potter i tell you its potter sobbed xenophilius pleasepleasegive me luna just let me have luna 
 
 you can have your little girl lovegood said selwyn if you get up those stairs and bring me down harry potter but if this is a plot if its a trick if youve got an accomplice waiting up there to ambush us well see if we can spare a bit of your daughter for you to bury 
 
 xenophilius gave a wail of fear and despair there were scurryings and scrapings 
 
 xenophilius was trying to get through the debris on the stairs 
 
 come on harry whispered weve got to get out of here 
 
 he started to dig himself out under cover of all the noise xenophilius was making on the staircase ron was buried the deepest harry and hermione climbed as quietly as they could over all the wreckage to where he lay trying to prise a heavy chest of drawers off his legs while xenophilius banging and scraping drew nearer and nearer hermione managed to free ron with the use of a hover charm 
 
 all right breathed hermione as the broken printing press blocking the top of the stairs begin to tremble xenophilius was feet away from them she was still white with dust 
 
 do you trust me harry 
 
 harry nodded 
 
 okay then hermione whispered give me the invisibility cloak ron youre going to put it on 
 
 me but harry c 
 
 please ron harry hold on tight to my hand ron grab my shoulder 
 
 harry held out his left hand ron vanished beneath the cloak the printing press blocking the stairs was vibrating xenophilius was trying to shift it using a hover charm harry did not know what hermione was waiting for 
 
 hold tight she whispered hold tightany second 
 
 xenophiliuss face appeared over the top of the sideboard 
 
 obliviate cried hermione pointing her want first into his face then at the floor beneath them deprimo 
 
 she had blasted a hole in the sitting room floor they fell like boulders harry still holding onto her hand for dear life there was a scream from below and he glimpsed two men trying to get out of the way as vast quantities of rubble and broken furniture rained all around them from the shattered ceiling hermione twisted in midair and thundering of the collapsing house rang in harrys ears as she dragged him once more into darkness 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the deathly hallows 
 

lionfish nov chapter the tale of the three brotherscontents prev chapter next chapter 
 
 harry turned to look at ron and hermione neither of them seemed to have understood what xenophilius had said either 
 
 the deathly hallows 
 
 thats right said xenophilius you havent heard of them im not surprised very very few wizards believe witness that young man at your brothers wedding he nodded at ron who attacked me for sporting the symbol of a dark wizard such ignorance there is nothing dark about the hallows c at least not in that crude sense one simply uses the symbol to reveal oneself to other believers in the hope that they might help one with the quest 
 
 he stirred several lumps of sugar into his gurdyroot infusion and drank some 
 
 im sorry said harry i still dont really understand 
 
 to be polite he took a sip from his cup too and almost gagged the stuff was quite disgusting as though someone had liquidized every flavor beans 
 
 well you see believers seek the deathly hallows said xenophilius smacking his lips in apparent appreciation of the gurdyroot infusion 
 
 but what are the deathly hallows asked hermione 
 
 xenophilius set aside his empty teacup 
 
 i assume that you are familiar with the tale of the three brothers 
 
 harry said no but ron and hermione both said yes xenophilius nodded gravely 
 
 well well mr potter the whole thing starts with the tale of the three brothers i have a copy somewhere 
 
 he glanced vaguely around the room at the piles of parchment and books but hermione said ive got a copy mr lovegood ive got it right here 
 
 and she pulled out the tales of beedle the bard from the small beaded bag 
 
 the original inquired xenophilius sharply and when she nodded he said well then why dont you read it out aloud much the best way to make sure we all understand 
 
 er all right said hermione nervously she opened the book and harry saw that the symbol they were investigating headed the top of the page as she gave a little cough and began to read 
 
 
 
 
 there were once three brothers who were traveling along a lonely winding road at twilight c 
 
 
 
 
 midnight our mum always told us said ron who had stretched out arms behind his head to listen hermione shot him a look of annoyance 
 
 sorry i just think its a bit spookier if its midnight said ron 
 
 yeah because we really need a bit more fear in our lives said harry before he could stop himself xenophilius did not seem to be paying much attention but was staring out of the window at the sky go on hermione 
 
 
 
 
 in time the brothers reached a river too deep to wade through and too dangerous to swim across however these brothers were learned in the magical arts and so they simply waved their wands and made a bridge appear across the treacherous water they were halfway across it when they found their path blocked by a hooded figure 
 
 and death spoke to them c 
 
 
 
 
 sorry interjected harry but death spoke to them 
 
 its a fairy tale harry 
 
 right sorry go on 
 
 
 
 
 and death spoke to them he was angry that he had been cheated out of the three new victims for travelers usually drowned in the river but death was cunning he pretended to congratulate the three brothers upon their magic and said that each had earned a prize for having been clever enough to evade him 
 
 so the oldest brother who was a combative man asked for a wand more powerful than any in existence a wand that must always win duels for its owner a wand worthy of a wizard who had conquered death so death crossed to an elder tree on the banks of the river fashioned a wand from a branch that hung there and gave it to the oldest brother 
 
 then the second brother who was an arrogant man decided that he wanted to humiliate death still further and asked for the power to recall others from death so death picked up a stone from the riverbank and gave it to the second brother and told him that the stone would have the power to bring back the dead 
 
 and then death asked the third and youngest brother what he would like the youngest brother was the humblest and also the wisest of the brothers and he did not trust death so he asked for something that would enable him to go forth from that place without being followed by death and death most unwillingly handed over his own cloak of invisibility 
 
 
 
 
 deaths got an invisibility cloak harry interrupted again 
 
 so he can sneak up on people said ron sometimes he gets bored of running at them flapping his arms and shrieking sorry hermione 
 
 
 
 
 then death stood aside and allowed the three brothers to continue on their way and they did so talking with wonder of the adventure they had had and admiring deaths gifts 
 
 in due course the brothers separated each for his own destination 
 
 the first brother traveled on for a week more and reaching a distant village sought out a fellow wizard with whom he had a quarrel naturally with the elder wand as his weapon he could not fail to win the duel that followed leaving his enemy dead upon the floor the oldest brother proceeded to an inn where he boasted loudly of the powerful wand he had snatched from death himself and of how it made him invincible 
 
 that very night another wizard crept upon the oldest brother as he lay upon his bed the thief took the wand and for good measure slit the oldest brothers throat 
 
 and so death took the first brother for his own 
 
 meanwhile the second brother journeyed to his own home where he lived alone here he took out the stone that had the power to recall the dead and turned it thrice in his hand to his amazement and his delight the figure of the girl he had once hoped to marry before her untimely death appeared at once before him 
 
 yet she was sad and cold separated from him as by a veil though she had returned to the mortal world she did not truly belong there and suffered finally the second brother driven mad with hopeless longing killed himself so as to truly join her 
 
 and so death took the second brother from his own 
 
 but though death searched for the third brother for many years he was never able to find him it was only when he had attained a great age that the youngest brother finally took off the cloak of invisibility and gave it to his son and the he greeted death as an old friend and went with him gladly and equals they departed this life 
 
 
 
 
 hermione closed the book it was a moment or two before xenophilius seemed to realize that she had stopped reading then he withdrew his gaze from the window and said well there you are 
 
 sorry said hermione sounding confused 
 
 those are the deathly hallows said xenophilius 
 
 he picked up a quill from a packed table at his elbow and pulled a torn piece of parchment from between more books 
 
 the elder wand he said and drew a straight vertical line upon the parchment the resurrection stone he said and added a circle on top of the line the cloak of invisibility he finished enclosing both line and circle in a triangle to make the symbols that so intrigued hermione together he said the deathly hallows 
 
 but theres no mention of the words deathly hallows in the story said hermione 
 
 well of course not said xenophilius maddeningly smug that is a childrens tale told to amuse rather than to instruct those of us who understand these matters however recognize that the ancient story refers to three objects or hallows which if united will make the possessor master of death 
 
 there was a short silence in which xenophilius glanced out of the window already the sun was low in the sky 
 
 luna ought to have enough plimpies soon he said quietly 
 
 when you say master of death c said ron 
 
 master said xenophilius waving an airy hand conqueror vanquisher whichever term you prefer 
 
 but then do you mean said hermione slowly and harry could tell that she was trying to keep any trace of skepticism out of her voice that you believe these objects c these hallows c really exist 
 
 xenophilius raised his eyebrows again 
 
 well of course 
 
 but said hermione and harry could hear her restraint starting to crack mr lovegood how can you possibly believe c 
 
 luna has told me all about you young lady said xenophilius you are i gather not unintelligent but painfully limited narrow 
 
 perhaps you ought to try on the hat hermione said ron nodding toward the ludicrous headdress his voice shook with the strain of not laughing 
 
 mr lovegood hermione began again we all know that there are such things as invisibility cloaks they are rare but they exist but c 
 
 ah but the third hallow is a true cloak of invisibility miss granger i mean to say it is not a traveling cloak imbued with a disillusionment charm or carrying a bedazzling hex or else woven from demiguise hair which will hide one initially but fade with the years until it turns opaque we are talking about a cloak that really and truly renders the wearer completely invisible and endures eternally giving constant and impenetrable concealment no matter what spells are cast at it how many cloaks have you ever seen like that miss granger 
 
 hermione opened her mouth to answer then closed it again looking more confused than ever she harry and ron glanced at one another and harry knew that they were all thinking the same thing it so happened that a cloak exactly like the one xenophilius had just described was in the room with them at that very moment 
 
 exactly said xenophilius as if he had defeated them all in reasoned argument none of you have ever seen such a thing the possessor would be immeasurably rich would he not 
 
 he glanced out of the window again the sky was now tinged with the faintest trace of pink 
 
 all right said hermione disconcerted say the cloak existed what about that stone mr lovegood the thing you call the resurrection stone 
 
 what of it 
 
 well how can that be real 
 
 prove that is not said xenophilius 
 
 hermione looked outraged 
 
 but thats c im sorry but thats completely ridiculous how can i possibly prove it doesnt exist do you expect me to get hold of c of all the pebbles in the world and test them i mean you could claim that anythings real if the only basis for believing in it is that nobodys proved it doesnt exist 
 
 yes you could said xenophilius i am glad to see that you are opening your mind a little 
 
 so the elder wand said harry quickly before hermione could retort you think that exists too 
 
 oh well in that case there is endless evidence said xenophilius the elder wand is the hallow that is most easily traced because of the way in which it passes from hand to hand 
 
 which is what asked harry 
 
 which is that the possessor of the wand must capture it from its previous owner if he is to be truly master of it said xenophilius surely you have heard of the way the wand came to egbert the egregious after his slaughter of emeric the evil of how godelot died in his own cellar after his son hereward took the wand from him of the dreadful loxias who took the wand from baraabas deverill whom he had killed the bloody trail of the elder wand is splattered across the pages of wizarding history 
 
 harry glanced at hermione she was frowning at xenophilius but she did not contradict him 
 
 so where do you think the elder wand is now asked ron 
 
 alas who knows said xenophilius as he gazed out of the window who knows where the elder wand lies hidden the trail goes cold with arcus and livius who can say which of them really defeated loxias and which took the wand and who can say who may have defeated them history alas does not tell us 
 
 there was a pause finally hermione asked stiffly mr lovegood does the peverell family have anything to do with the deathly hallows 
 
 xenophilius looked taken aback as something shifted in harrys memory but he could not locate it peverell he had heard that name before 
 
 but you have been misleading me young woman said xenophilius now sitting up much straighter in his chair and goggling at hermione i thought you were new to the hallows quest many of us questers believe that the peverells have everything c everything c to do with the hallows 
 
 who are the peverells asked ron 
 
 that was the name on the grave with the mark on it in godrics hollow said hermione still watching xenophilius ignotus peverell 
 
 exactly said xenophilius his forefinger raised pedantically the sign of the death hallows on ignotuss grave is conclusive proof 
 
 of what asked ron 
 
 why that the three brothers in the story were actually the three peverell brothers antioch cadmus and ignotus that they were the original owners of the hallows 
 
 with another glance at the window he got to his feet picked up the tray and headed for the spiral staircase 
 
 you will stay for dinner he called as he vanished downstairs again everybody always requests our recipe for freshwater plimply soup 
 
 probably to show the poisoning department at st mungos said ron under his breath 
 
 harry waited until they could hear xenophilius moving about in the kitchen downstairs before speaking 
 
 what do you think he asked hermione 
 
 oh harry she said wearily its a pile of utter rubbish this cant be what the sign really means this must just be his weird take on it what a waste of time 
 
 i spose this is the man who brought us snorkacks said ron 
 
 you didnt believe it either harry asked him 
 
 nah that storys just one of those things you tell kids to teach them lessons isnt it dont go looking for trouble dont go pick fights dont go messing around with stuff thats best left alone just keep your head down mind your own business and youll be okay come to think of it ron added maybe that storys why elder wands are supposed to be unlucky 
 
 what are you talking about 
 
 one of those superstitions isnt it witches will marry muggles jinx by twilight undone by midnight wand of cider never prosper you must have heard them my mums full of them 
 
 harry and i were raised by muggles hermione reminded him we were taught different superstitions she sighed deeply as a rather pungent smell drifted up from the kitchen the one good thing about her exasperation with xenophilius was that it seemed to have made her forget that she was annoyed at ron i think youre right she told him its just a morality tale its obvious which gift is best which one youd choose c 
 
 the three of them spoke at the same time hermione said the cloak ron said the wand and harry said the stone 
 
 they looked at each other half surprised half amused 
 
 youre supposed to say the cloak ron told hermione but you wouldnt need to be invisible if you had the wand an unbeatable wand hermione come on 
 
 weve already got an invisibility cloak said harry and its helped us rather a lot in case you hadnt noticed said hermione whereas the wand would be bound to attract troublec 
 
 only if you shouted about it argued ron only if you were prat enough to go dancing around waving it over your head and singing ive got an unbeatable want come and have a go if you think youre hard enough as long as you kept your trap shut c

 but how do you know said harry that those wants c the deathstick and the wand of destiny c arent the same want surfacing over the centuries under different names 
 
 what if theyre all really the elder wand made by death said ron harry laughed the strange idea that had occurred to him was after all ridiculous his wand he reminded himself had been of holly not elder and it had been made by ollivander whatever it had done that night voldemort had pursued him across the skies and if it had been unbeatable how could it have been broken so why would you take the stone ron asked him well if you could bring people back we could have parents neither ron nor hermione smiled

 yes all right but ron the stone 
 
 as they argued in whispers harry moved around the room only half listening reaching the spiral stair he raised his eyes absently to the next level and was distracted at once his own face was looking back at him from the ceiling of the room above after a moments bewilderment he realized that it was not a mirror but a painting curious he began to clime the stairs 
 
 harry what are you doing i dont think you should look around when hes not here but harry had already reached the next level luna had decorated her bedroom ceiling with five beautifully painted faces harry ron hermione ginny and neville they were not moving as the portraits at hogwarts moved but there was a certain magic about them all the same harry thought they breathed what appeared to be a fine golden chains wove around the pictures linking them together but after examining them for a minute or so harry realized that the chains were actually one work repeated a thousand times in golden ink friends friends friends 
 
 harry felt a great rush of affection for luna he looked around the room there was a large photograph beside the bed of a young luna and a woman who looked very like her they were hugging luna looked rather in this picture than harry had ever seen her in life the picture was dusty this struck harry as slightly odd he stared around something was wrong the pale blue carpet was also thick with dust there were no clothes in the wardrobe whose doors stood ajar the bed had a cold unfriendly look as though it had not been slept in for weeks a single cobweb stretched over the nearest window across the blood red sky 
 
 whats wrong hermione asked as harry descended the staircase but before he could respond xenophilius reached the top of the stairs from the kitchen now holding a tray laden with bowls 
 
 mr lovegood said harry wheres luna 
 
 excuse me 
 
 wheres luna 
 
 xenophilius halted on the top step 
 
 i c ive already told you she is down at the botions bridge fishing for plimpies 
 
 so why have you only laid that tray for four 
 
 xenophilius tried to speak but no sound came out the only noise was the continued chugging of the printing press and a slight rattle from the tray as xenophiliuss hands shook 
 
 i dont think lunas been here for weeks said harry her clothes are gone her bed hasnt been slept in where is she and why do you keep looking out of the window 
 
 xenophilius dropped the tray the bowls bounced and smashed harry ron and hermione drew their wands xenophilius froze his hand about to enter his pocket at that moment the printing press have a huge bank and numerous quibblers came streaming across the floor from underneath the tablecloth the press fell silent at last hermione stooped down and picked up one of the magazines her wand still pointing at mr lovegood 
 
 harry look at this he strode over to her as quickly as he could through all the clutter 
 
 the front of the quibbler carried his own picture emblazoned with the words undesirable number one and captioned with the reward money 
 
 the quibblers going for a new angle then harry asked coldly his mind working very fast is that what you were doing when you went into the garden mr lovegood 
 
 sending an owl to the ministry 
 
 xenophilius licked his lips they took my luna he whispered because of what ive been writing they took my luna and i dont know where she is what theyve done to her but they might give her back to me if i c if ic 
 
 hand over harry hermione finished for him 
 
 no deal said ron flatly get out of the way were leaving 
 
 xenophilius looked ghastly a century old his lips drawn back into a dreadful leer 
 
 they will be here any moment i must save luna i cannot lose luna you must not leave 
 
 he spread his arms in front of the staircase and harry had a sudden vision of his mother doing the same thing in front of his crib 
 
 dont make us hurt you harry said get out of the way mr lovegood 
 
 harry hermione screamed 
 
 figures on broomsticks were flying past the windows as the three of them looked away from him xenophilius drew his wand harry realized their mistake just in time he launched himself sideways shoving ron and hermione out of harms way as xenophiliuss stunning spell soared across the room and hit the erumpent horn 
 
 there was a colossal explosion the sound of it seemed to blow the room apart 
 
 fragments of wood and paper and rubble flew in all directions along with an impenetrable cloud of thick white dust harry flew through the air then crashed to the floor unable to see as debris rained upon him his arms over his head he heard hermiones scream rons yell and a series of sickening metallic thuds which told him that xenophilius had been blasted off his feet and fallen backward down the spiral stairs 
 
 half buried in rubble harry tried to raise himself he could barely breathe or see for dust 
 
 half of the ceiling had fall in and the end of lunas bead was hanging through the hole 
 
 the bust of rowena ravenclaw lay beside him with half its face missing fragments of torn parchment were floating through the air and most of the printing press lay on its side blocking the top of the staircase to the kitchen then another white shape moved close by and hermione coated in dust like a second statue pressed his finger to her lips 
 
 the door downstairs crashed open 
 
 didnt i tell you there was no need to hurry travers said a rough voice didnt i tell you this nutter was just raving as usual there was a bang and a scream of pain from xenophilius 
 
 nonoupstairspotter 
 
 i told you last week lovegood we werent coming back for anything less than some solid information remember last week when you wanted to swap your daughter for that stupid bleeding headdress and the week before c another bang another squeal c when you thought wed give her back if you offered us proof there are cumple c bang c headedcbangc snorkacks 
 
 no c no c i beg of you sobbed xenophilius it really is potter really 
 
 and now it turns out you only called us here to try and blow us up roared the death eater and there was a volley of bangs interspersed with squeals of agony from xenophilius 
 
 the place looks like its about to fall in selwyn said a cool second voice echoing up the mangled staircase the stairs are completely blocked could try clearing it might bring the place down 
 
 you lying piece of filth shouted the wizard named selwyn 
 
 you have never seen potter in your life have you thought youd lure us here to kill us did you and you think youll get your girl back like this 
 
 i sweari swearpotters upstairs 
 
 homenum revelio said the voice at the foot of the stairs harry heard hermione gasp and he had the odd sensation something was swooping low over him immersing his body in its shadow 
 
 theres someone up there all right selwyn said the second man sharply 
 
 its potter i tell you its potter sobbed xenophilius pleasepleasegive me luna just let me have luna 
 
 you can have your little girl lovegood said selwyn if you get up those stairs and bring me down harry potter but if this is a plot if its a trick if youve got an accomplice waiting up there to ambush us well see if we can spare a bit of your daughter for you to bury 
 
 xenophilius gave a wail of fear and despair there were scurryings and scrapings 
 
 xenophilius was trying to get through the debris on the stairs 
 
 come on harry whispered weve got to get out of here 
 
 he started to dig himself out under cover of all the noise xenophilius was making on the staircase ron was buried the deepest harry and hermione climbed as quietly as they could over all the wreckage to where he lay trying to prise a heavy chest of drawers off his legs while xenophilius banging and scraping drew nearer and nearer hermione managed to free ron with the use of a hover charm 
 
 all right breathed hermione as the broken printing press blocking the top of the stairs begin to tremble xenophilius was feet away from them she was still white with dust 
 
 do you trust me harry 
 
 harry nodded 
 
 okay then hermione whispered give me the invisibility cloak ron youre going to put it on 
 
 me but harry c 
 
 please ron harry hold on tight to my hand ron grab my shoulder 
 
 harry held out his left hand ron vanished beneath the cloak the printing press blocking the stairs was vibrating xenophilius was trying to shift it using a hover charm harry did not know what hermione was waiting for 
 
 hold tight she whispered hold tightany second 
 
 xenophiliuss face appeared over the top of the sideboard 
 
 obliviate cried hermione pointing her want first into his face then at the floor beneath them deprimo 
 
 she had blasted a hole in the sitting room floor they fell like boulders harry still holding onto her hand for dear life there was a scream from below and he glimpsed two men trying to get out of the way as vast quantities of rubble and broken furniture rained all around them from the shattered ceiling hermione twisted in midair and thundering of the collapsing house rang in harrys ears as she dragged him once more into darkness

 fairy tales of hans christian andersen 
 little flowers 
 by hans christian andersen 
 
 my poor flowers are quite dead said little ida they were so 
 pretty yesterday evening and now all the leaves are hanging down 
 quite withered what do they do that for she asked of the student 
 who sat on the sofa she liked him very much he could tell the most 
 amusing stories and cut out the prettiest pictures hearts and 
 ladies dancing castles with doors that opened as well as flowers he 
 was a delightful student why do the flowers look so faded 
 she asked again and pointed to her nosegay which was quite withered 
 
 you know what is the matter with them said the student 
 the flowers were at a ball last night and therefore it is no wonder 
 they hang their heads 
 
 but flowers cannot dance cried little ida 
 
 yes indeed they can replied the student when it grows 
 dark and everybody is asleep they jump about quite merrily they 
 have a ball almost every night 
 
 can children go to these balls 
 
 yes said the student little daisies and lilies of the valley 
 
 where do the beautiful flowers dance asked little ida 
 
 have you not often seen the large castle outside the gates of the 
 town where the king lives in summer and where the beautiful garden 
 is full of flowers and have you not fed the swans with bread when 
 they swam towards you well the flowers have capital balls there 
 believe me 
 
 i was in the garden out there yesterday with my mother said 
 ida but all the leaves were off the trees and there was not a 
 single flower left where are they i used to see so many in the 
 summer 
 
 they are in the castle replied the student you must know that 
 as soon as the king and all the court are gone into the town the 
 flowers run out of the garden into the castle and you should see 
 how merry they are the two most beautiful roses seat themselves on 
 the throne and are called the king and queen then all the red 
 cockscombs range themselves on each side and bow these are the 
 after that the pretty flowers come in and there 
 is a grand ball the blue violets represent little naval cadets and 
 dance with hyacinths and crocuses which they call young ladies the 
 tulips and are the old ladies who sit and watch the 
 dancing so that everything may be conducted with order and 
 propriety 
 
 but said little ida is there no one there to hurt the flowers 
 for dancing in the castle 
 
 no one knows anything about it said the student the old 
 steward of the castle who has to watch there at night sometimes 
 comes in but he carries a great bunch of keys and as soon as the 
 flowers hear the keys rattle they run and hide themselves behind 
 the long curtains and stand quite still just peeping their heads 
 out then the old steward says i smell flowers here but he 
 cannot see them 
 
 oh how capital said little ida clapping her hands should i 
 be able to see these flowers 
 
 yes said the student mind you think of it the next time you 
 go out no doubt you will see them if you peep through the window 
 i did so and i saw a long yellow lily lying stretched out on 
 the sofa she was a court lady 
 
 can the flowers from the botanical gardens go to these balls 
 asked ida it is such a distance 
 
 oh yes said the student whenever they like for they can 
 fly have you not seen those beautiful red white and yellow 
 butterflies that look like flowers they were flowers once they have 
 flown off their stalks into the air and flap their leaves as if 
 they were little wings to make them fly then if they behave well 
 they obtain permission to fly about during the day instead of being 
 obliged to sit still on their stems at home and so in time their 
 leaves become real wings it may be however that the flowers in 
 the botanical gardens have never been to the palace and 
 therefore they know nothing of the merry doings at night which 
 take place there i will tell you what to do and the botanical 
 professor who lives close by here will be so surprised you know him very well do you not well next time you go into his garden you must tell one of the flowers that there is going to be a grand ball at the castle then that flower will tell all the others and they will 
 fly away to the castle as soon as possible and when the professor 
 walks into his garden there will not be a single flower left how 
 he will wonder what has become of them 
 
 but how can one flower tell another flowers cannot speak 
 
 no certainly not replied the student but they can make 
 signs have you not often seen that when the wind blows they nod at 
 one another and rustle all their green leaves 
 
 can the professor understand the signs asked ida 
 
 yes to be sure he can he went one morning into his garden 
 and saw a stinging nettle making signs with its leaves to a 
 beautiful red carnation it was saying you are so pretty i like you 
 very much but the professor did not approve of such nonsense so 
 he clapped his hands on the nettle to stop it then the leaves 
 which are its fingers stung him so sharply that he has never ventured 
 to touch a nettle since 
 
 oh how funny said ida and she laughed 
 
 how can anyone put such notions into a head said a 
 tiresome lawyer who had come to pay a visit and sat on the sofa 
 he did not like the student and would grumble when he saw him cutting out droll or amusing pictures sometimes it would be a man hanging on a gibbet and holding a heart in his hand as if he had been stealing hearts sometimes it was an old witch riding through the air on a broom and carrying her husband on her nose but the lawyer did not like such jokes and he would say as he had just said how can anyone put such nonsense into a head what absurd fancies there are 
 
 but to little ida all these stories which the student told her 
 about the flowers seemed very droll and she thought over them a 
 great deal the flowers did hang their heads because they had been 
 dancing all night and were very tired and most likely they were ill 
 then she took them into the room where a number of toys lay on a 
 pretty little table and the whole of the table drawer besides was 
 full of beautiful things her doll sophy lay in the bed asleep 
 and little ida said to her you must really get up sophy and be 
 content to lie in the drawer the poor flowers are ill and 
 they must lie in your bed then perhaps they will get well again 
 so she took the doll out who looked quite cross and said not a 
 single word for she was angry at being turned out of her bed ida 
 placed the flowers in the bed and drew the quilt over them 
 then she told them to lie quite still and be good while she made some tea for them so that they might be quite well and able to get up 
 the next morning and she drew the curtains close round the little 
 bed so that the sun might not shine in their eyes during the whole 
 evening she could not help thinking of what the student had told 
 her and before she went to bed herself she was obliged to peep 
 behind the curtains into the garden where all her beautiful 
 flowers grew hyacinths and tulips and many others then she 
 whispered to them quite softly i know you are going to a ball 
 but the flowers appeared as if they did not understand and 
 not a leaf moved still ida felt quite sure she knew all about it she 
 lay awake a long time after she was in bed thinking how pretty it 
 must be to see all the beautiful flowers dancing in the garden 
 
 i wonder if my flowers have really been there she said to 
 herself and then she fell asleep in the night she awoke she had 
 been dreaming of the flowers and of the student as well as of the 
 tiresome lawyer who found fault with him it was quite still in 
 bedroom the burnt on the table and her father and 
 mother were asleep i wonder if my flowers are still lying in 
 bed she thought to herself how much i should like to know she 
 raised herself a little and glanced at the door of the room where all 
 her flowers and playthings lay it was partly open and as she 
 listened it seemed as if some one in the room was playing the 
 piano but softly and more prettily than she had ever before heard it 
 
 now all the flowers are certainly dancing in there she thought oh 
 how much i should like to see them but she did not dare move for 
 fear of disturbing her father and mother if they would only come 
 in here she thought but they did not come and the music 
 continued to play so beautifully and was so pretty that she could 
 resist no longer she crept out of her little bed went softly to 
 the door and looked into the room oh what a splendid sight there 
 was to be sure there was no burning but the room appeared quite light for the moon shone through the window upon the floor and made it almost like day all the hyacinths and tulips stood in two long rows down the room not a single flower remained in the window and the were all empty the flowers were dancing gracefully on the floor making turns and holding each other by their long green leaves as they swung round at the piano sat a 
 large yellow lily which little ida was sure she had seen in the 
 summer for she remembered the student saying she was very much like miss lina one of friends they all laughed at him then but now it seemed to little ida as if the tall yellow flower was really 
 like the young lady she had just the same manners while playing 
 bending her long yellow face from side to side and nodding in time to the beautiful music then she saw a large purple crocus jump into 
 the middle of the table where the playthings stood go up to the 
 bedstead and draw back the curtains there lay the sick 
 flowers but they got up directly and nodded to the others as a 
 sign that they wished to dance with them the old rough doll with the 
 broken mouth stood up and bowed to the pretty flowers they did not look ill at all now but jumped about and were very merry yet none of them noticed little ida presently it seemed as if something fell from the table ida looked that way and saw a slight carnival rod 
 jumping down among the flowers as if it belonged to them it was 
 however very smooth and neat and a little wax doll with a broad 
 brimmed hat on her head like the one worn by the lawyer sat upon it 
 the carnival rod hopped about among the flowers on its three red 
 stilted feet and stamped quite loud when it danced the mazurka the 
 flowers could not perform this dance they were too light to stamp 
 in that manner all at once the wax doll which rode on the carnival 
 rod seemed to grow larger and taller and it turned round and said 
 to the paper flowers how can you put such things in a 
 head they are all foolish fancies and then the doll was exactly 
 like the lawyer with the broad brimmed hat and looked as yellow and 
 as cross as he did but the paper dolls struck him on his thin legs 
 and he shrunk up again and became quite a little wax doll this was 
 very amusing and ida could not help laughing the carnival rod went 
 on dancing and the lawyer was obliged to dance also it was no use 
 he might make himself great and tall or remain a little wax doll with 
 a large black hat still he must dance then at last the other flowers 
 interceded for him especially those who had lain in the bed 
 and the carnival rod gave up his dancing at the same moment a loud 
 knocking was heard in the drawer where doll sophy lay with many other toys then the rough doll ran to the end of the table laid 
 himself flat down upon it and began to pull the drawer out a little 
 way 
 
 then sophy raised himself and looked round quite astonished 
 there must be a ball here said sophy why did not 
 somebody tell me 
 
 will you dance with me said the rough doll 
 
 you are the right sort to dance with certainly said she 
 turning her back upon him 
 
 then she seated herself on the edge of the drawer and thought 
 that perhaps one of the flowers would ask her to dance but none of 
 them came then she coughed hem hem but for all that not one came the shabby doll now danced quite alone and not very 
 badly after all as none of the flowers seemed to notice sophy she 
 let herself down from the drawer to the floor so as to make a very 
 great noise all the flowers came round her directly and asked if she 
 had hurt herself especially those who had lain in her bed but she 
 was not hurt at all and flowers thanked her for the use of 
 the nice bed and were very kind to her they led her into the 
 middle of the room where the moon shone and danced with her while all the other flowers formed a circle round them then sophy was very happy and said they might keep her bed she did not mind lying in the drawer at all but the flowers thanked her very much and 
 said 
 
 we cannot live long morning we shall be quite dead 
 and you must tell little ida to bury us in the garden near to the 
 grave of the canary then in the summer we shall wake up and be 
 more beautiful than ever 
 
 no you must not die said sophy as she kissed the flowers 
 then the door of the room opened and a number of beautiful 
 flowers danced in ida could not imagine where they could come from unless they were the flowers from the garden first came two lovely roses with little golden crowns on their heads these were the king and queen beautiful stocks and carnations followed bowing to every one present they had also music with them large poppies and peonies had for instruments and blew into them till they were quite red in the face the bunches of blue hyacinths and the 
 little white snowdrops jingled their flowers as if they 
 were real bells then came many more flowers blue violets purple 
 daisies and lilies of the valley and they all danced 
 together and kissed each other it was very beautiful to behold 
 
 at last the flowers wished each other then little 
 ida crept back into her bed again and dreamt of all she had seen 
 when she arose the next morning she went quickly to the little table 
 to see if the flowers were still there she drew aside the curtains of 
 the little bed there they all lay but quite faded much more so than 
 the day before sophy was lying in the drawer where ida had placed 
 her but she looked very sleepy 
 
 do you remember what the flowers told you to say to me said 
 little ida but sophy looked quite stupid and said not a single word 
 you are not kind at all said ida and yet they all danced with 
 you 
 
 then she took a little paper box on which were painted 
 beautiful birds and laid the dead flowers in it 
 
 this shall be your pretty coffin she said and by and by when 
 my cousins come to visit me they shall help me to bury you out in the garden so that next summer you may grow up again more beautiful than ever 
 
 her cousins were two boys whose names were james and adolphus their father had given them each a bow and arrow and they had brought them to show ida she told them about the poor flowers which were dead and as soon as they obtained permission they went with her to bury them the two boys walked first with their crossbows on their shoulders and little ida followed carrying the pretty box containing the dead flowers they dug a little grave in the garden ida kissed her flowers and then laid them with the box in the earth james and adolphus then fired their crossbows over the grave as they had neither guns nor cannons

 broken mouth stood up and bowed to the pretty flowers they did not look ill at all now but jumped about and were very merry yet none of them noticed little ida presently it seemed as if something fell from the table ida looked that way and saw a slight carnival rod 
 jumping down among the flowers as if it belonged to them it was 
 however very smooth and neat and a little wax doll with a broad 
 brimmed hat on her head like the one worn by the lawyer sat upon it 
 the carnival rod hopped about among the flowers on its three red 
 stilted feet and stamped quite loud when it danced the mazurka the 
 flowers could not perform this dance they were too light to stamp 
 in that manner all at once the wax doll which rode on the carnival 
 rod seemed to grow larger and taller and it turned round and said 
 to the paper flowers how can you put such things in a 
 head they are all foolish fancies and then the doll was exactly 
 like the lawyer with the broad brimmed hat and looked as yellow and 
 as cross as he did but the paper dolls struck him on his thin legs 
 and he shrunk up again and became quite a little wax doll this was 
 very amusing and ida could not help laughing the carnival rod went 
 on dancing and the lawyer was obliged to dance also it was no use 
 he might make himself great and tall or remain a little wax doll with 
 a large black hat still he must dance then at last the other flowers 
 interceded for him especially those who had lain in the bed 
 and the carnival rod gave up his dancing at the same moment a loud 
 knocking was heard in the drawer where doll sophy lay with many other toys then the rough doll ran to the end of the table laid 
 himself flat down upon it and began to pull the drawer out a little 
 way 
 
 then sophy raised himself and looked round quite astonished 
 there must be a ball here said sophy why did not 
 somebody tell me 
 
 will you dance with me said the rough doll 
 
 you are the right sort to dance with certainly said she 
 turning her back upon him 
 
 then she seated herself on the edge of the drawer and thought 
 that perhaps one of the flowers would ask her to dance but none of 
 them came then she coughed hem hem but for all that not one came the shabby doll now danced quite alone and not very 
 badly after all as none of the flowers seemed to notice sophy she 
 let herself down from the drawer to the floor so as to make a very 
 great noise all the flowers came round her directly and asked if she 
 had hurt herself especially those who had lain in her bed but she 
 was not hurt at all and flowers thanked her for the use of 
 the nice bed and were very kind to her they led her into the 
 middle of the room where the moon shone and danced with her while all the other flowers formed a circle round them then sophy was very happy and said they might keep her bed she did not mind lying in the drawer at all but the flowers thanked her very much and 
 said 
 
 we cannot live long morning we shall be quite dead 
 and you must tell little ida to bury us in the garden near to the 
 grave of the canary then in the summer we shall wake up and be 
 more beautiful than ever 
 
 no you must not die said sophy as she kissed the flowers 
 then the door of the room opened and a number of beautiful 
 flowers danced in ida could not imagine where they could come from unless they were the flowers from the garden first came two lovely roses with little golden crowns on their heads these were the king and queen beautiful stocks and carnations followed bowing to every one present they had also music with them large poppies and peonies had for instruments and blew into them till they were quite red in the face the bunches of blue hyacinths and the 
 little white snowdrops jingled their flowers as if they 
 were real bells then came many more flowers blue violets purple 
 daisies and lilies of the valley and they all danced 
 together and kissed each other it was very beautiful to behold 
 
 at last the flowers wished each other then little 
 ida crept back into her bed again and dreamt of all she had seen 
 when she arose the next morning she went quickly to the little table 
 to see if the flowers were still there she drew aside the curtains of 
 the little bed there they all lay but quite faded much more so than 
 the day before sophy was lying in the drawer where ida had placed 
 her but she looked very sleepy 
 
 do you remember what the flowers told you to say to me said 
 little ida but sophy looked quite stupid and said not a single word 
 you are not kind at all said ida and yet they all danced with 
 you 
 
 then she took a little paper box on which were painted 
 beautiful birds and laid the dead flowers in it 
 
 this shall be your pretty coffin she said and by and by when 
 my cousins come to visit me they shall help me to bury you out in the garden so that next summer you may grow up again more beautiful than ever 
 
 her cousins were two boys whose names were james and adolphus their father had given them each a bow and arrow and they had brought them to show ida she told them about the poor flowers which were dead and as soon as they obtained permission they went with her to bury them the two boys walked first with their crossbows on their shoulders and little ida followed carrying the pretty box containing the dead flowers they dug a little grave in the garden ida kissed her flowers and then laid them with the box in the earth james and adolphus then fired their crossbows over the grave as they had neither guns nor cannons

 on returning to gorki after having seen prince andrew pierre ordered his groom to get the horses ready and to call him early in the morning and then immediately fell asleep behind a partition in a corner boris had given up to him 
 before he was thoroughly awake next morning everybody had already left the hut the panes were rattling in the little windows and his groom was shaking him 
 your excellency your excellency your excellency he kept repeating pertinaciously while he shook pierre by the shoulder without looking at him having apparently lost hope of getting him to wake up 
 what has it begun is it time pierre asked waking up 
 hear the firing said the groom a discharged soldier all the gentlemen have gone out and his serene highness himself rode past long ago 
 pierre dressed hastily and ran out to the porch outside all was bright fresh dewy and cheerful the sun just bursting forth from behind a cloud that had concealed it was shining with rays still half broken by the clouds over the roofs of the street opposite on the dust of the road on the walls of the houses on the windows the fence and on horses standing before the hut the roar of guns sounded more distinct outside an adjutant accompanied by a cossack passed by at a sharp trot 
 time count time cried the adjutant 
 telling the groom to follow him with the horses pierre went down the street to the knoll from which he had looked at the field of battle the day before a crowd of military men was assembled there members of the staff could be heard conversing in french and gray head in a white cap with a red band was visible his gray nape sunk between his shoulders he was looking through a field glass down the highroad before him 
 mounting the steps to the knoll pierre looked at the scene before him spellbound by beauty it was the same panorama he had admired from that spot the day before but now the whole place was full of troops and covered by smoke clouds from the guns and the slanting rays of the bright sun rising slightly to the left behind pierre cast upon it through the clear morning air penetrating streaks of rosy golden tinted light and long dark shadows the forest at the farthest extremity of the panorama seemed carved in some precious stone of a color its undulating outline was silhouetted against the horizon and was pierced beyond valuevo by the smolensk highroad crowded with troops nearer at hand glittered golden cornfields interspersed with copses there were troops to be seen everywhere in front and to the right and left all this was vivid majestic and unexpected but what impressed pierre most of all was the view of the battlefield itself of borodino and the hollows on both sides of the kolocha 
 above the kolocha in borodino and on both sides of it especially to the left where the voyna flowing between its marshy banks falls into the kolocha a mist had spread which seemed to melt to dissolve and to become translucent when the brilliant sun appeared and magically colored and outlined everything the smoke of the guns mingled with this mist and over the whole expanse and through that mist the rays of the morning sun were reflected flashing back like lightning from the water from the dew and from the bayonets of the troops crowded together by the riverbanks and in borodino a white church could be seen through the mist and here and there the roofs of huts in borodino as well as dense masses of soldiers or green ammunition chests and ordnance and all this moved or seemed to move as the smoke and mist spread out over the whole space just as in the hollow near borodino so along the entire line outside and above it and especially in the woods and fields to the left in the valleys and on the summits of the high ground clouds of powder smoke seemed continually to spring up out of nothing now singly now several at a time some translucent others dense which swelling growing rolling and blending extended over the whole expanse 
 these puffs of smoke and strange to say the sound of sound of the firing produced the chief beauty of the spectacle 
 puff suddenly a round compact cloud of smoke was seen merging from violet into gray and milky white and boom came the report a second later 
 puff puff and two clouds arose pushing one another and blending together and boom boom came the sounds confirming what the eye had seen 
 pierre glanced round at the first cloud which he had seen as a round compact ball and in its place already were balloons of smoke floating to one side and puff with a pause puff puff three and then four more appeared and then from each with the same interval boom boom boom came the fine firm precise sounds in reply it seemed as if those smoke clouds sometimes ran and sometimes stood still while woods fields and glittering bayonets ran past them from the left over fields and bushes those large balls of smoke were continually appearing followed by their solemn reports while nearer still in the hollows and woods there burst from the muskets small cloudlets that had no time to become balls but had their little echoes in just the same way came the frequent crackle of musketry but it was irregular and feeble in comparison with the reports of the cannon 
 pierre wished to be there with that smoke those shining bayonets that movement and those sounds he turned to look at kutuzov and his suite to compare his impressions with those of others they were all looking at the field of battle as he was and as it seemed to him with the same feelings all their faces were now shining with that latent warmth of feeling pierre had noticed the day before and had fully understood after his talk with prince andrew 
 go my dear fellow go and christ be with you kutuzov was saying to a general who stood beside him not taking his eye from the battlefield 
 having received this order the general passed by pierre on his way down the knoll 
 to the crossing said the general coldly and sternly in reply to one of the staff who asked where he was going 
 go there too i too thought pierre and followed the general 
 the general mounted a horse a cossack had brought him pierre went to his groom who was holding his horses and asking which was the quietest clambered onto it seized it by the mane and turning out his toes pressed his heels against its sides and feeling that his spectacles were slipping off but unable to let go of the mane and reins he galloped after the general causing the staff officers to smile as they watched him from the knoll

 occupying self with obscure depths 
 hardly was m leblanc seated when he turned his eyes towards the pallets which were empty 
 how is the poor little wounded girl he inquired 
 bad replied jondrette with a and grateful smile very bad my worthy sir 
 her elder sister has taken her to the bourbe to have her hurt dressed 
 you will see them presently they will be back immediately 
 madame fabantou seems to me to be better went on m leblanc casting his eyes on the eccentric costume of the jondrette woman as she stood between him and the door as though already guarding the exit and gazed at him in an attitude of menace and almost of combat 
 she is dying said jondrette 
 but what do you expect sir she has so much courage that woman has 
 not a woman an ox 
 the jondrette touched by his compliment deprecated it with the affected airs of a flattered monster 
 you are always too good to me monsieur jondrette 
 jondrette said m leblanc i thought your name was fabantou 
 fabantou alias jondrette replied the husband hurriedly an artistic sobriquet 
 and launching at his wife a shrug of the shoulders which m leblanc did not catch he continued with an emphatic and caressing inflection of voice 
 ah we have had a happy life together this poor darling and i what would there be left for us if we had not that 
 we are so wretched my respectable sir 
 we have arms but there is no work 
 we have the will no work 
 i know how the government arranges that but on my word of honor sir i am not jacobin sir i am not a bousingot i wish them any evil but if i were the ministers on my most sacred word things would be different 
 here for instance i wanted to have my girls taught the trade of makers you will say to me 
 what a trade 
 yes 
 a trade 
 a simple trade a what a fall my benefactor 
 what a degradation when one has been what we have been 
 alas 
 there is nothing left to us of our days of prosperity 
 one thing only a picture of which i think a great deal but which i am willing to part with for i must live 
 item one must live 
 a democrat 
 while jondrette thus talked with an apparent incoherence which detracted nothing from the thoughtful and sagacious expression of his physiognomy marius raised his eyes and perceived at the other end of the room a person whom he had not seen before a man had just entered so softly that the door had not been heard to turn on its hinges 
 this man wore a violet knitted vest which was old worn spotted cut and gaping at every fold wide trousers of cotton velvet wooden shoes on his feet no shirt had his neck bare his bare arms tattooed and his face smeared with black 
 he had seated himself in silence on the nearest bed and as he was behind jondrette he could only be indistinctly seen 
 that sort of magnetic instinct which turns aside the gaze caused m leblanc to turn round almost at the same moment as marius he could not refrain from a gesture of surprise which did not escape jondrette 
 ah 
 i see exclaimed jondrette buttoning up his coat with an air of complaisance you are looking at your overcoat 
 it fits me my faith but it fits me 
 who is that man said m leblanc 
 him ejaculated jondrette a neighbor of mine 
 pay any attention to him 
 the neighbor was a individual 
 however manufactories of chemical products abound in the faubourg many of the workmen might have black faces 
 besides this m whole person was expressive of candid and intrepid confidence 
 he went on 
 excuse me what were you saying m fabantou 
 i was telling you sir and dear protector replied jondrette placing his elbows on the table and contemplating m leblanc with steady and tender eyes not unlike the eyes of the i was telling you that i have a picture to sell 
 a slight sound came from the door 
 a second man had just entered and seated himself on the bed behind jondrette 
 like the first his arms were bare and he had a mask of ink or lampblack 
 although this man had literally glided into the room he had not been able to prevent m leblanc catching sight of him 
 mind them said jondrette they are people who belong in the house 
 so i was saying that there remains in my possession a valuable picture 
 but stop sir take a look at it 
 he rose went to the wall at the foot of which stood the panel which we have already mentioned and turned it round still leaving it supported against the wall 
 it really was something which resembled a picture and which the candle illuminated somewhat 
 marius could make nothing out of it as jondrette stood between the picture and him he only saw a coarse daub and a sort of principal personage colored with the harsh crudity of foreign canvasses and screen paintings 
 what is that asked m leblanc 
 jondrette exclaimed 
 a painting by a master a picture of great value my benefactor i am as much attached to it as i am to my two daughters it recalls souvenirs to me 
 but i have told you and i will not take it back that i am so wretched that i will part with it 
 either by chance or because he had begun to feel a dawning uneasiness m glance returned to the bottom of the room as he examined the picture 
 there were now four men three seated on the bed one standing near the all four with bare arms and motionless with faces smeared with black 
 one of those on the bed was leaning against the wall with closed eyes and it might have been supposed that he was asleep he was old his white hair contrasting with his blackened face produced a horrible effect 
 the other two seemed to be young one wore a beard the other wore his hair long 
 none of them had on shoes those who did not wear socks were barefooted 
 jondrette noticed that m eye was fixed on these men 
 they are friends 
 they are neighbors said he 
 their faces are black because they work in charcoal 
 they are trouble yourself about them my benefactor but buy my picture have pity on my misery 
 i will not ask you much for it 
 how much do you think it is worth 
 well said m leblanc looking jondrette full in the eye and with the manner of a man who is on his guard it is some signboard for a tavern and is worth about three francs 
 jondrette replied sweetly 
 have you your with you 
 i should be satisfied with a thousand crowns 
 m leblanc sprang up placed his back against the wall and cast a rapid glance around the room 
 he had jondrette on his left on the side next the window and the jondrette woman and the four men on his right on the side next the door 
 the four men did not stir and did not even seem to be looking on 
 jondrette had again begun to speak in a plaintive tone with so vague an eye and so lamentable an intonation that m leblanc might have supposed that what he had before him was a man who had simply gone mad with misery 
 if you do not buy my picture my dear benefactor said jondrette i shall be left without resources there will be nothing left for me but to throw myself into the river 
 when i think that i wanted to have my two girls taught the trade the making of boxes for new gifts 
 well 
 a table with a board at the end to keep the glasses from falling off is required then a special stove is needed a pot with three compartments for the different degrees of strength of the paste according as it is to be used for wood paper or stuff a to cut the cardboard a mould to adjust it a hammer to nail the steels pincers how the devil do i know what all 
 and all that in order to earn four sous a day 
 and you have to work fourteen hours a day and each box passes through the hands thirteen times and you wet the paper 
 and you spot anything 
 and you must keep the paste hot 
 the devil i tell you 
 four sous a day how do you suppose a man is to live 
 as he spoke jondrette did not look at m leblanc who was observing him m eye was fixed on jondrette and eye was fixed on the door 
 marius eager attention was transferred from one to the other m leblanc seemed to be asking himself 
 is this man an idiot jondrette repeated two or three distinct times with all manner of varying inflections of the whining and supplicating order there is nothing left for me but to throw myself into the river i went down three steps at the side of the bridge of austerlitz the other day for that purpose 
 all at once his dull eyes lighted up with a hideous flash the little man drew himself up and became terrible took a step toward m leblanc and cried in a voice of thunder 
 that has nothing to do with the question 
 do you know me

 that sort of magnetic instinct which turns aside the gaze caused m leblanc to turn round almost at the same moment as marius he could not refrain from a gesture of surprise which did not escape jondrette 
 ah 
 i see exclaimed jondrette buttoning up his coat with an air of complaisance you are looking at your overcoat 
 it fits me my faith but it fits me 
 who is that man said m leblanc 
 him ejaculated jondrette a neighbor of mine 
 pay any attention to him 
 the neighbor was a individual 
 however manufactories of chemical products abound in the faubourg many of the workmen might have black faces 
 besides this m whole person was expressive of candid and intrepid confidence 
 he went on 
 excuse me what were you saying m fabantou 
 i was telling you sir and dear protector replied jondrette placing his elbows on the table and contemplating m leblanc with steady and tender eyes not unlike the eyes of the i was telling you that i have a picture to sell 
 a slight sound came from the door 
 a second man had just entered and seated himself on the bed behind jondrette 
 like the first his arms were bare and he had a mask of ink or lampblack 
 although this man had literally glided into the room he had not been able to prevent m leblanc catching sight of him 
 mind them said jondrette they are people who belong in the house 
 so i was saying that there remains in my possession a valuable picture 
 but stop sir take a look at it 
 he rose went to the wall at the foot of which stood the panel which we have already mentioned and turned it round still leaving it supported against the wall 
 it really was something which resembled a picture and which the candle illuminated somewhat 
 marius could make nothing out of it as jondrette stood between the picture and him he only saw a coarse daub and a sort of principal personage colored with the harsh crudity of foreign canvasses and screen paintings 
 what is that asked m leblanc 
 jondrette exclaimed 
 a painting by a master a picture of great value my benefactor i am as much attached to it as i am to my two daughters it recalls souvenirs to me 
 but i have told you and i will not take it back that i am so wretched that i will part with it 
 either by chance or because he had begun to feel a dawning uneasiness m glance returned to the bottom of the room as he examined the picture 
 there were now four men three seated on the bed one standing near the all four with bare arms and motionless with faces smeared with black 
 one of those on the bed was leaning against the wall with closed eyes and it might have been supposed that he was asleep he was old his white hair contrasting with his blackened face produced a horrible effect 
 the other two seemed to be young one wore a beard the other wore his hair long 
 none of them had on shoes those who did not wear socks were barefooted 
 jondrette noticed that m eye was fixed on these men 
 they are friends 
 they are neighbors said he 
 their faces are black because they work in charcoal 
 they are trouble yourself about them my benefactor but buy my picture have pity on my misery 
 i will not ask you much for it 
 how much do you think it is worth 
 well said m leblanc looking jondrette full in the eye and with the manner of a man who is on his guard it is some signboard for a tavern and is worth about three francs 
 jondrette replied sweetly 
 have you your with you 
 i should be satisfied with a thousand crowns 
 m leblanc sprang up placed his back against the wall and cast a rapid glance around the room 
 he had jondrette on his left on the side next the window and the jondrette woman and the four men on his right on the side next the door 
 the four men did not stir and did not even seem to be looking on 
 jondrette had again begun to speak in a plaintive tone with so vague an eye and so lamentable an intonation that m leblanc might have supposed that what he had before him was a man who had simply gone mad with misery 
 if you do not buy my picture my dear benefactor said jondrette i shall be left without resources there will be nothing left for me but to throw myself into the river 
 when i think that i wanted to have my two girls taught the trade the making of boxes for new gifts 
 well 
 a table with a board at the end to keep the glasses from falling off is required then a special stove is needed a pot with three compartments for the different degrees of strength of the paste according as it is to be used for wood paper or stuff a to cut the cardboard a mould to adjust it a hammer to nail the steels pincers how the devil do i know what all 
 and all that in order to earn four sous a day 
 and you have to work fourteen hours a day and each box passes through the hands thirteen times and you wet the paper 
 and you spot anything 
 and you must keep the paste hot 
 the devil i tell you 
 four sous a day how do you suppose a man is to live 
 as he spoke jondrette did not look at m leblanc who was observing him m eye was fixed on jondrette and eye was fixed on the door 
 marius eager attention was transferred from one to the other m leblanc seemed to be asking himself 
 is this man an idiot jondrette repeated two or three distinct times with all manner of varying inflections of the whining and supplicating order there is nothing left for me but to throw myself into the river i went down three steps at the side of the bridge of austerlitz the other day for that purpose 
 all at once his dull eyes lighted up with a hideous flash the little man drew himself up and became terrible took a step toward m leblanc and cried in a voice of thunder 
 that has nothing to do with the question 
 do you know me

 chapter xxxi 
 
 having descended the hill the general after whom pierre was galloping turned sharply to the left and pierre losing sight of him galloped in among some ranks of infantry marching ahead of him he tried to pass either in front of them or to the right or left but there were soldiers everywhere all with expression and busy with some unseen but evidently important task they all gazed with the same dissatisfied and inquiring expression at this stout man in a white hat who for some unknown reason threatened to trample them under his hoofs 
 why ride into the middle of the battalion one of them shouted at him 
 another prodded his horse with the butt end of a musket and pierre bending over his saddlebow and hardly able to control his shying horse galloped ahead of the soldiers where there was a free space 
 there was a bridge ahead of him where other soldiers stood firing pierre rode up to them without being aware of it he had come to the bridge across the kolocha between gorki and borodino which the french having occupied borodino were attacking in the first phase of the battle pierre saw that there was a bridge in front of him and that soldiers were doing something on both sides of it and in the meadow among the rows of hay which he had taken no notice of amid the smoke of the campfires the day before but despite the incessant firing going on there he had no idea that this was the field of battle he did not notice the sound of the bullets whistling from every side or the projectiles that flew over him did not see the enemy on the other side of the river and for a long time did not notice the killed and wounded though many fell near him he looked about him with a smile which did not leave his face 
 that fellow in front of the line shouted somebody at him again 
 to the left keep to the right the men shouted to him 
 pierre went to the right and unexpectedly encountered one of adjutants whom he knew the adjutant looked angrily at him evidently also intending to shout at him but on recognizing him he nodded 
 how have you got here he said and galloped on 
 pierre feeling out of place there having nothing to do and afraid of getting in way again galloped after the adjutant 
 happening here may i come with you he asked 
 one moment one moment replied the adjutant and riding up to a stout colonel who was standing in the meadow he gave him some message and then addressed pierre 
 why have you come here count he asked with a smile still inquisitive 
 yes yes assented pierre 
 but the adjutant turned his horse about and rode on 
 here tolerable said he but with bagration on the left flank getting it frightfully hot 
 really said pierre where is that 
 come along with me to our knoll we can get a view from there and in our battery it is still bearable said the adjutant will you come 
 yes come with you replied pierre looking round for his groom 
 it was only now that he noticed wounded men staggering along or being carried on stretchers on that very meadow he had ridden over the day before a soldier was lying athwart the rows of scented hay with his head thrown awkwardly back and his shako off 
 why they carried him away pierre was about to ask but seeing the stern expression of the adjutant who was also looking that way he checked himself 
 pierre did not find his groom and rode along the hollow with the adjutant to redoubt his horse lagged behind the and jolted him at every step 
 you seem to be used to riding count remarked the adjutant 
 no not that but her action seems so jerky said pierre in a puzzled tone 
 why wounded said the adjutant in the off foreleg above the knee a bullet no doubt i congratulate you count on your baptism of fire 
 having ridden in the smoke past the sixth corps behind the artillery which had been moved forward and was in action deafening them with the noise of firing they came to a small wood there it was cool and quiet with a scent of autumn pierre and the adjutant dismounted and walked up the hill on foot 
 is the general here asked the adjutant on reaching the knoll 
 he was here a minute ago but has just gone that way someone told him pointing to the right 
 the adjutant looked at pierre as if puzzled what to do with him now 
 trouble about me said pierre go up onto the knoll if i may 
 yes do see everything from there and less dangerous and come for you 
 pierre went to the battery and the adjutant rode on they did not meet again and only much later did pierre learn that he lost an arm that day 
 the knoll to which pierre ascended was that famous one afterwards known to the russians as the knoll battery or redoubt and to the french as la grande redoute la fatale redoute la redoute du centre around which tens of thousands fell and which the french regarded as the key to the whole position 
 this redoubt consisted of a knoll on three sides of which trenches had been dug within the entrenchment stood ten guns that were being fired through openings in the earthwork 
 in line with the knoll on both sides stood other guns which also fired incessantly a little behind the guns stood infantry when ascending that knoll pierre had no notion that this spot on which small trenches had been dug and from which a few guns were firing was the most important point of the battle 
 on the contrary just because he happened to be there he thought it one of the least significant parts of the field 
 having reached the knoll pierre sat down at one end of a trench surrounding the battery and gazed at what was going on around him with an unconsciously happy smile occasionally he rose and walked about the battery still with that same smile trying not to obstruct the soldiers who were loading hauling the guns and continually running past him with bags and charges the guns of that battery were being fired continually one after another with a deafening roar enveloping the whole neighborhood in powder smoke 
 in contrast with the dread felt by the infantrymen placed in support here in the battery where a small number of men busy at their work were separated from the rest by a trench everyone experienced a common and as it were family feeling of animation 
 the intrusion of nonmilitary figure in a white hat made an unpleasant impression at first the soldiers looked askance at him with surprise and even alarm as they went past him the senior artillery officer a tall pockmarked man moved over to pierre as if to see the action of the farthest gun and looked at him with curiosity 
 a young officer quite a boy still and evidently only just out of the cadet college who was zealously commanding the two guns entrusted to him addressed pierre sternly 
 sir he said permit me to ask you to stand aside you must not be here 
 the soldiers shook their heads disapprovingly as they looked at pierre but when they had convinced themselves that this man in the white hat was doing no harm but either sat quietly on the slope of the trench with a shy smile or politely making way for the soldiers paced up and down the battery under fire as calmly as if he were on a boulevard their feeling of hostile distrust gradually began to change into a kindly and bantering sympathy such as soldiers feel for their dogs cocks goats and in general for the animals that live with the regiment the men soon accepted pierre into their family adopted him gave him a nickname our gentleman and made kindly fun of him among themselves 
 a shell tore up the earth two paces from pierre and he looked around with a smile as he brushed from his clothes some earth it had thrown up 
 and it not afraid sir really now a soldier asked pierre with a grin that disclosed a set of sound white teeth 
 are you afraid then said pierre 
 what else do you expect answered the soldier she has no mercy you know when she comes spluttering down out go your innards one help being afraid he said laughing 
 several of the men with bright kindly faces stopped beside pierre they seemed not to have expected him to talk like anybody else and the discovery that he did so delighted them 
 the business of us soldiers but in a gentleman wonderful a gentleman for you 
 to your places cried the young officer to the men gathered round pierre 
 the young officer was evidently exercising his duties for the first or second time and therefore treated both his superiors and the men with great precision and formality 
 the booming cannonade and the fusillade of musketry were growing more intense over the whole field especially to the left where fleches were but where pierre was the smoke of the firing made it almost impossible to distinguish anything moreover his whole attention was engrossed by watching the family circle separated from all else formed by the men in the battery his first unconscious feeling of joyful animation produced by the sights and sounds of the battlefield was now replaced by another especially since he had seen that soldier lying alone in the hayfield now seated on the slope of the trench he observed the faces of those around him 
 by ten some twenty men had already been carried away from the battery two guns were smashed and cannon balls fell more and more frequently on the battery and spent bullets buzzed and whistled around but the men in the battery seemed not to notice this and merry voices and jokes were heard on all sides 
 a live one shouted a man as a whistling shell approached 
 not this way to the infantry added another with loud laughter seeing the shell fly past and fall into the ranks of the supports 
 are you bowing to a friend eh remarked another chaffing a peasant who ducked low as a cannon ball flew over 
 several soldiers gathered by the wall of the trench looking out to see what was happening in front 
 withdrawn the front line it has retired said they pointing over the earthwork 
 mind your own business an old sergeant shouted at them if retired because work for them to do farther back 
 and the sergeant taking one of the men by the shoulders gave him a shove with his knee this was followed by a burst of laughter 
 to the fifth gun wheel it up came shouts from one side 
 now then all together like bargees rose the merry voices of those who were moving the gun 
 oh she nearly knocked our hat off cried the humorist showing his teeth chaffing pierre awkward baggage he added reproachfully to a cannon ball that struck a cannon wheel and a leg 
 now then you foxes said another laughing at some militiamen who stooping low entered the battery to carry away the wounded man 
 so this gruel to your taste oh you crows scared they shouted at the militiamen who stood hesitating before the man whose leg had been torn off 
 there lads oh oh they mimicked the peasants they like it at all 
 pierre noticed that after every ball that hit the redoubt and after every loss the liveliness increased more and more 
 as the flames of the fire hidden within come more and more vividly and rapidly from an approaching thundercloud so as if in opposition to what was taking place the lightning of hidden fire growing more and more intense glowed in the faces of these men 
 pierre did not look out at the battlefield and was not concerned to know what was happening there he was entirely absorbed in watching this fire which burned ever more brightly and which he felt was flaming up in the same way in his own soul 
 at ten the infantry that had been among the bushes in front of the battery and along the kamenka streamlet retreated from the battery they could be seen running back past it carrying their wounded on their muskets a general with his suite came to the battery and after speaking to the colonel gave pierre an angry look and went away again having ordered the infantry supports behind the battery to lie down so as to be less exposed to fire after this from amid the ranks of infantry to the right of the battery came the sound of a drum and shouts of command and from the battery one saw how those ranks of infantry moved forward 
 pierre looked over the wall of the trench and was particularly struck by a pale young officer who letting his sword hang down was walking backwards and kept glancing uneasily around 
 the ranks of the infantry disappeared amid the smoke but their shout and rapid musketry firing could still be heard a few minutes later crowds of wounded men and came back from that direction projectiles began to fall still more frequently in the battery several men were lying about who had not been removed around the cannon the men moved still more briskly and busily no one any longer took notice of pierre once or twice he was shouted at for being in the way the senior officer moved with big rapid strides from one gun to another with a frowning face the young officer with his face still more flushed commanded the men more scrupulously than ever the soldiers handed up the charges turned loaded and did their business with strained smartness they gave little jumps as they walked as though they were on springs 
 the stormcloud had come upon them and in every face the fire which pierre had watched kindle burned up brightly pierre standing beside the commanding officer the young officer his hand to his shako ran up to his superior 
 i have the honor to report sir that only eight rounds are left are we to continue firing he asked 
 grapeshot the senior shouted without answering the question looking over the wall of the trench 
 suddenly something happened the young officer gave a gasp and bending double sat down on the ground like a bird shot on the wing everything became strange confused and misty in eyes 
 one cannon ball after another whistled by and struck the earthwork a soldier or a gun pierre who had not noticed these sounds before now heard nothing else on the right of the battery soldiers shouting hurrah were running not forwards but backwards it seemed to pierre 
 a cannon ball struck the very end of the earth work by which he was standing crumbling down the earth a black ball flashed before his eyes and at the same instant plumped into something some militiamen who were entering the battery ran back 
 all with grapeshot shouted the officer 
 the sergeant ran up to the officer and in a frightened whisper informed him as a butler at dinner informs his master that there is no more of some wine asked for that there were no more charges 
 the scoundrels what are they doing shouted the officer turning to pierre 
 the face was red and perspiring and his eyes glittered under his frowning brow 
 run to the reserves and bring up the ammunition boxes he yelled angrily avoiding pierre with his eyes and speaking to his men 
 go said pierre 
 the officer without answering him strode across to the opposite side 
 fire wait he shouted 
 the man who had been ordered to go for ammunition stumbled against pierre 
 eh sir this is no place for you said he and ran down the slope 
 pierre ran after him avoiding the spot where the young officer was sitting 
 one cannon ball another and a third flew over him falling in front beside and behind him pierre ran down the slope where am i going he suddenly asked himself when he was already near the green ammunition wagons he halted irresolutely not knowing whether to return or go on suddenly a terrible concussion threw him backwards to the ground at the same instant he was dazzled by a great flash of flame and immediately a deafening roar crackling and whistling made his ears tingle 
 when he came to himself he was sitting on the ground leaning on his hands the ammunition wagons he had been approaching no longer existed only charred green boards and rags littered the scorched grass and a horse dangling fragments of its shaft behind it galloped past while another horse lay like pierre on the ground uttering prolonged and piercing cries

 the trap 
 the door of the garret had just opened abruptly and allowed a view of three men clad in blue linen blouses and masked with masks of black paper 
 the first was thin and had a long cudgel the second who was a sort of colossus carried by the middle of the handle with the blade downward a for slaughtering cattle 
 the third a man with shoulders not so slender as the first held in his hand an enormous key stolen from the door of some prison 
 it appeared that the arrival of these men was what jondrette had been waiting for 
 a rapid dialogue ensued between him and the man with the cudgel the thin one 
 is everything ready said jondrette 
 yes replied the thin man 
 where is montparnasse 
 the young principal actor stopped to chat with your girl 
 which 
 the eldest 
 is there a carriage at the door 
 yes 
 is the team harnessed 
 yes 
 with two good horses 
 excellent 
 is it waiting where i ordered 
 yes 
 good said jondrette 
 m leblanc was very pale 
 he was scrutinizing everything around him in the den like a man who understands what he has fallen into and his head directed in turn toward all the heads which surrounded him moved on his neck with an astonished and attentive slowness but there was nothing in his air which resembled fear 
 he had improvised an intrenchment out of the table and the man who but an instant previously had borne merely the appearance of a kindly old man had suddenly become a sort of athlete and placed his robust fist on the back of his chair with a formidable and surprising gesture 
 this old man who was so firm and so brave in the presence of such a danger seemed to possess one of those natures which are as courageous as they are kind both easily and simply the father of a woman whom we love is never a stranger to us marius felt proud of that unknown man 
 three of the men of whom jondrette had said 
 they are had armed themselves from the pile of old iron one with a heavy pair of shears the second with the third with a hammer and had placed themselves across the entrance without uttering a syllable 
 the old man had remained on the bed and had merely opened his eyes 
 the jondrette woman had seated herself beside him 
 marius decided that in a few seconds more the moment for intervention would arrive and he raised his right hand towards the ceiling in the direction of the corridor in readiness to discharge his pistol 
 jondrette having terminated his colloquy with the man with the cudgel turned once more to m leblanc and repeated his question accompanying it with that low repressed and terrible laugh which was peculiar to him 
 so you do not recognize me 
 m leblanc looked him full in the face and replied 
 no 
 then jondrette advanced to the table 
 he leaned across the candle crossing his arms putting his angular and ferocious jaw close to m calm face and advancing as far as possible without forcing m leblanc to retreat and in this posture of a wild beast who is about to bite he exclaimed 
 my name is not fabantou my name is not jondrette my name is thenardier 
 i am the of montfermeil do you understand 
 thenardier 
 now do you know me 
 an almost imperceptible flush crossed m brow and he replied with a voice which neither trembled nor rose above its ordinary level with his accustomed placidity 
 no more than before 
 marius did not hear this reply 
 any one who had seen him at that moment through the darkness would have perceived that he was haggard stupid at the moment when jondrette said my name is thenardier marius had trembled in every limb and had leaned against the wall as though he felt the cold of a steel blade through his heart 
 then his right arm all ready to discharge the signal shot dropped slowly and at the moment when jondrette repeated thenardier do you understand faltering fingers had come near letting the pistol fall jondrette by revealing his identity had not moved m leblanc but he had quite upset marius 
 that name of thenardier with which m leblanc did not seem to be acquainted marius knew well let the reader recall what that name meant to him 
 that name he had worn on his heart inscribed in his testament he bore it at the bottom of his mind in the depths of his memory in that sacred injunction 
 a certain thenardier saved my life if my son encounters him he will do him all the good that lies in his power 
 that name it will be remembered was one of the pieties of his soul he mingled it with the name of his father in his worship 
 what 
 this man was that thenardier that of montfermeil whom he had so long and so vainly sought 
 he had found him at last and how 
 his saviour was a ruffian that man to whose service marius was burning to devote himself was a monster 
 that liberator of colonel pontmercy was on the point of committing a crime whose scope marius did not as yet clearly comprehend but which resembled an assassination and against whom great god what a fatality 
 what a bitter mockery of fate 
 his father had commanded him from the depths of his coffin to do all the good in his power to this thenardier and for four years marius had cherished no other thought than to acquit this debt of his and at the moment when he was on the eve of having a brigand seized in the very act of crime by justice destiny cried to him 
 this is thenardier 
 he could at last repay this man for his life saved amid a of on the heroic field of waterloo and repay it with the scaffold he had sworn to himself that if ever he found that thenardier he would address him only by throwing himself at his feet and now he actually had found him but it was only to deliver him over to the executioner 
 his father said to him 
 succor thenardier and he replied to that adored and sainted voice by crushing thenardier he was about to offer to his father in his grave the spectacle of that man who had torn him from death at the peril of his own life executed on the place through the means of his son of that marius to whom he had entrusted that man by his will and what a mockery to have so long worn on his breast his last commands written in his own hand only to act in so horribly contrary a sense 
 but on the other hand now look on that trap and not prevent it 
 condemn the victim and to spare the assassin could one be held to any gratitude towards so miserable a wretch all the ideas which marius had cherished for the last four years were pierced through and through as it were by this unforeseen blow 
 he shuddered 
 everything depended on him 
 unknown to themselves he held in his hand all those beings who were moving about there before his eyes 
 if he fired his pistol m leblanc was saved and thenardier lost if he did not fire m leblanc would be sacrificed and who knows 
 thenardier would escape 
 should he dash down the one or allow the other to fall 
 remorse awaited him in either case 
 what was he to do 
 what should he choose 
 be false to the most imperious souvenirs to all those solemn vows to himself to the most sacred duty to the most venerated text 
 should he ignore his testament or allow the perpetration of a crime on the one hand it seemed to him that he heard his ursule supplicating for her father and on the other the colonel commending thenardier to his care 
 he felt that he was going mad 
 his knees gave way beneath him 
 and he had not even the time for deliberation so great was the fury with which the scene before his eyes was hastening to its catastrophe 
 it was like a whirlwind of which he had thought himself the master and which was now sweeping him away he was on the verge of swooning 
 in the meantime thenardier whom we shall henceforth call by no other name was pacing up and down in front of the table in a sort of frenzy and wild triumph 
 he seized the candle in his fist and set it on the with so violent a bang that the wick came near being extinguished and the tallow bespattered the wall 
 then he turned to m leblanc with a horrible look and spit out these words 
 done for 
 smoked brown 
 cooked 
 spitchcocked 
 and again he began to march back and forth in full eruption 
 ah he cried so found you again at last mister philanthropist mister threadbare millionnaire 
 mister giver of dolls you old ninny ah so you recognize me 
 no it you who came to montfermeil to my inn eight years ago on christmas eve it you who carried off that child from me the lark 
 it you who had a yellow no nor a package of duds in your hand as you had this morning here say wife it seems to be his mania to carry packets of woollen stockings into houses 
 old charity monger get out with you are you a hosier mister millionnaire 
 you give away your stock in trade to the poor holy man 
 what bosh merry andrew ah and you recognize me 
 well i recognize you that i do i recognized you the very moment you poked your snout in here ah find out presently that it all roses to thrust yourself in that fashion into houses under the pretext that they are taverns in wretched clothes with the air of a poor man to whom one would give a sou to deceive persons to play the generous to take away their means of livelihood and to make threats in the woods and you call things quits because afterwards when people are ruined you bring a coat that is too large and two miserable hospital blankets you old blackguard you 
 he paused and seemed to be talking to himself for a moment one would have said that his wrath had fallen into some hole like the rhone then as though he were concluding aloud the things which he had been saying to himself in a whisper he smote the table with his fist and shouted 
 and with his air 
 and apostrophizing m leblanc 
 parbleu 
 you made game of me in the past 
 you are the cause of all my misfortunes 
 for fifteen hundred francs you got a girl whom i had and who certainly belonged to rich people and who had already brought in a great deal of money and from whom i might have extracted enough to live on all my life 
 a girl who would have made up to me for everything that i lost in that vile where there was nothing but one continual row and where like a fool i ate up my last farthing 
 oh 
 i wish all the wine folks drank in my house had been poison to those who drank it well never mind 
 say now 
 you must have thought me ridiculous when you went off with the lark 
 you had your cudgel in the forest you were the stronger 
 revenge 
 the one to hold the trumps in a sorry case my good fellow 
 oh but i can laugh 
 really i laugh 
 he fall into the trap i told him that i was an actor that my name was fabantou that i had played comedy with mamselle mars with mamselle muche that my landlord insisted on being paid tomorrow the th of february and he even notice that the th of january and not the th of february is the time when the quarter runs out 
 absurd idiot and the four miserable philippes which he has brought me 
 scoundrel he the heart even to go as high as a hundred francs 
 and how he swallowed my platitudes 
 that did amuse me 
 i said to myself blockhead come got you 
 i lick your paws this morning but gnaw your heart this evening 
 thenardier paused 
 he was out of breath 
 his little narrow chest panted like a forge bellows 
 his eyes were full of the ignoble happiness of a feeble cruel and cowardly creature which finds that it can at last harass what it has feared and insult what it has flattered the joy of a dwarf who should be able to set his heel on the head of goliath the joy of a jackal which is beginning to rend a sick bull so nearly dead that he can no longer defend himself but sufficiently alive to suffer still 
 m leblanc did not interrupt him but said to him when he paused 
 i do not know what you mean to say 
 you are mistaken in me 
 i am a very poor man and anything but a millionnaire 
 i do not know you you are mistaking me for some other person 
 ah roared thenardier hoarsely a pretty lie 
 you stick to that pleasantry do you 
 floundering my old buck ah 
 you remember 
 you see who i am 
 excuse me sir said m leblanc with a politeness of accent which at that moment seemed peculiarly strange and powerful i see that you are a villain 
 who has not remarked the fact that odious creatures possess a susceptibility of their own that monsters are ticklish 
 at this word villain the female thenardier sprang from the bed thenardier grasped his chair as though he were about to crush it in his hands you stir he shouted to his wife and turning to m leblanc 
 villain 
 yes i know that you call us that you rich gentlemen stop true that i became bankrupt that i am in hiding that i have no bread that i have not a single sou that i am a villain three days since i have had anything to eat so a villain ah you folks warm your feet you have sakoski boots you have wadded like archbishops you lodge on the first floor in houses that have porters you eat truffles you eat asparagus at forty francs the bunch in the month of january and green peas you gorge yourselves and when you want to know whether it is cold you look in the papers to see what the engineer thermometer says about it 
 we it is we who are thermometers we need to go out and look on the quay at the corner of the tour de to find out the number of degrees of cold we feel our blood congealing in our veins and the ice forming round our hearts and we say 
 there is no god 
 and you come to our caverns yes our caverns for the purpose of calling us villains but devour you 
 but devour you poor little things just see here mister millionnaire 
 i have been a solid man i have held a license i have been an elector i am a bourgeois that i am 
 and quite possible that you are not 
 here thenardier took a step towards the men who stood near the door and added with a shudder 
 when i think that he has dared to come here and talk to me like a cobbler 
 then addressing m leblanc with a fresh outburst of frenzy 
 and listen to this also mister philanthropist 
 not a suspicious character not a bit of it 
 not a man whose name nobody knows and who comes and abducts children from houses an old french soldier i ought to have been decorated i was at waterloo so i was 
 and in the battle i saved a general called the comte of i know what 
 he told me his name but his beastly voice was so weak that i hear 
 all i caught was merci thanks rather have had his name than his thanks that would have helped me to find him again 
 the picture that you see here and which was painted by david at you know what it represents 
 it represents me 
 david wished to immortalize that feat of prowess 
 i have that general on my back and i am carrying him through the the history of it that general never did a single thing for me he was no better than the rest 
 but none the less i saved his life at the risk of my own and i have the certificate of the fact in my pocket i am a soldier of waterloo by all the furies 
 and now that i have had the goodness to tell you all this have an end of it i want money i want a deal of money i must have an enormous lot of money or exterminate you by the thunder of the good god 
 marius had regained some measure of control over his anguish and was listening 
 the last possibility of doubt had just vanished it certainly was the thenardier of the will 
 marius shuddered at that reproach of ingratitude directed against his father and which he was on the point of so fatally justifying 
 his perplexity was redoubled 
 moreover there was in all these words of thenardier in his accent in his gesture in his glance which darted flames at every word there was in this explosion of an evil nature disclosing everything in that mixture of braggadocio and abjectness of pride and pettiness of rage and folly in that chaos of real griefs and false sentiments in that immodesty of a malicious man tasting the voluptuous delights of violence in that shameless nudity of a repulsive soul in that conflagration of all sufferings combined with all hatreds something which was as hideous as evil and as as the truth 
 the picture of the master the painting by david which he had proposed that m leblanc should purchase was nothing else as the reader has divined than the sign of his tavern painted as it will be remembered by himself the only relic which he had preserved from his shipwreck at montfermeil 
 as he had ceased to intercept marius visual ray marius could examine this thing and in the daub he actually did recognize a battle a background of smoke and a man carrying another man it was the group composed of pontmercy and thenardier the sergeant the rescuer the colonel rescued 
 marius was like a drunken man this picture restored his father to life in some sort it was no longer the signboard of the at montfermeil it was a resurrection a tomb had yawned a phantom had risen there 
 marius heard his heart beating in his temples he had the cannon of waterloo in his ears his bleeding father vaguely depicted on that sinister panel terrified him and it seemed to him that the misshapen spectre was gazing intently at him 
 when thenardier had recovered his breath he turned his bloodshot eyes on m leblanc and said to him in a low curt voice 
 what have you to say before we put the handcuffs on you 
 m leblanc held his peace 
 in the midst of this silence a cracked voice launched this lugubrious sarcasm from the corridor 
 if any wood to be split there 
 it was the man with the axe who was growing merry 
 at the same moment an enormous bristling and clayey face made its appearance at the door with a hideous laugh which exhibited not teeth but fangs 
 it was the face of the man with the axe 
 why have you taken off your mask cried thenardier in a rage 
 for fun retorted the man 
 for the last few minutes m leblanc had appeared to be watching and following all the movements of thenardier who blinded and dazzled by his own rage was stalking to and fro in the den with full confidence that the door was guarded and of holding an unarmed man fast he being armed himself of being nine against one supposing that the female thenardier counted for but one man 
 during his address to the man with the he had turned his back to m leblanc 
 m leblanc seized this moment overturned the chair with his foot and the table with his fist and with one bound with prodigious agility before thenardier had time to turn round he had reached the window to open it to scale the frame to bestride it was the work of a second only 
 he was half out when six robust fists seized him and dragged him back energetically into the hovel 
 these were the three who had flung themselves upon him at the same time the thenardier woman had wound her hands in his hair 
 at the trampling which ensued the other ruffians rushed up from the corridor 
 the old man on the bed who seemed under the influence of wine descended from the pallet and came reeling up with a hammer in his hand 
 one of the whose smirched face was lighted up by the candle and in whom marius recognized in spite of his daubing panchaud alias printanier alias bigrenaille lifted above m head a sort of bludgeon made of two balls of lead at the two ends of a bar of iron 
 marius could not resist this sight 
 my father he thought forgive me 
 and his finger sought the trigger of his pistol 
 the shot was on the point of being discharged when voice shouted 
 harm him 
 this desperate attempt of the victim far from exasperating thenardier had calmed him 
 there existed in him two men the ferocious man and the adroit man 
 up to that moment in the excess of his triumph in the presence of the prey which had been brought down and which did not stir the ferocious man had prevailed when the victim struggled and tried to resist the adroit man reappeared and took the upper hand 
 hurt him he repeated and without suspecting it his first success was to arrest the pistol in the act of being discharged and to paralyze marius in whose opinion the urgency of the case disappeared and who in the face of this new phase saw no inconvenience in waiting a while longer 
 who knows whether some chance would not arise which would deliver him from the horrible alternative of allowing father to perish or of destroying the saviour 
 a herculean struggle had begun 
 with one blow full in the chest m leblanc had sent the old man tumbling rolling in the middle of the room then with two backward sweeps of his hand he had overthrown two more assailants and he held one under each of his knees the wretches were rattling in the throat beneath this pressure as under a granite millstone but the other four had seized the formidable old man by both arms and the back of his neck and were holding him doubled up over the two on the floor 
 thus the master of some and mastered by the rest crushing those beneath him and stifling under those on top of him endeavoring in vain to shake off all the efforts which were heaped upon him m leblanc disappeared under the horrible group of ruffians like the wild boar beneath a howling pile of dogs and hounds 
 they succeeded in overthrowing him upon the bed nearest the window and there they held him in awe 
 the thenardier woman had not released her clutch on his hair 
 you mix yourself up in this affair said thenardier tear your shawl 
 the thenardier obeyed as the female wolf obeys the male wolf with a growl 
 now said thenardier search him you other fellows 
 m leblanc seemed to have renounced the idea of resistance 
 they searched him 
 he had nothing on his person except a leather purse containing six francs and his handkerchief 
 thenardier put the handkerchief into his own pocket 
 what 
 no he demanded 
 no nor watch replied one of the 
 never mind murmured the masked man who carried the big key in the voice of a ventriloquist a tough old fellow 
 thenardier went to the corner near the door picked up a bundle of ropes and threw them at the men 
 tie him to the leg of the bed said he 
 and catching sight of the old man who had been stretched across the room by the blow from m fist and who made no movement he added 
 is boulatruelle dead 
 no replied bigrenaille drunk 
 sweep him into a corner said thenardier 
 two of the pushed the drunken man into the corner near the heap of old iron with their feet 
 babet said thenardier in a low tone to the man with the cudgel why did you bring so many they were not needed 
 what can you do replied the man with the cudgel they all wanted to be in it 
 this is a bad season 
 no business going on 
 the pallet on which m leblanc had been thrown was a sort of hospital bed elevated on four coarse wooden legs roughly hewn 
 m leblanc let them take their own course 
 the ruffians bound him securely in an upright attitude with his feet on the ground at the head of the bed the end which was most remote from the window and nearest to the fireplace 
 when the last knot had been tied thenardier took a chair and seated himself almost facing m leblanc 
 thenardier no longer looked like himself in the course of a few moments his face had passed from unbridled violence to tranquil and cunning sweetness 
 marius found it difficult to recognize in that polished smile of a man in official life the almost bestial mouth which had been foaming but a moment before he gazed with amazement on that fantastic and alarming metamorphosis and he felt as a man might feel who should behold a tiger converted into a lawyer 
 monsieur said thenardier 
 and dismissing with a gesture the ruffians who still kept their hands on m leblanc 
 stand off a little and let me have a talk with the gentleman 
 all retired towards the door 
 he went on 
 monsieur you did wrong to try to jump out of the window you might have broken your leg 
 now if you will permit me we will converse quietly 
 in the first place i must communicate to you an observation which i have made which is that you have not uttered the faintest cry 
 thenardier was right this detail was correct although it had escaped marius in his agitation 
 m leblanc had barely pronounced a few words without raising his voice and even during his struggle with the six ruffians near the window he had preserved the most profound and singular silence 
 thenardier continued 
 mon dieu 
 you might have shouted stop thief a bit and i should not have thought it improper 
 murder that too is said occasionally and so far as i am concerned i should not have taken it in bad part 
 it is very natural that you should make a little row when you find yourself with persons who inspire you with sufficient confidence 
 you might have done that and no one would have troubled you on that account 
 you would not even have been gagged 
 and i will tell you why 
 this room is very private its only recommendation but it has that in its favor you might fire off a mortar and it would produce about as much noise at the nearest police station as the snores of a drunken man here a cannon would make a boum and the thunder would make a pouf a handy lodging 
 but in short you did not shout and it is better so 
 i present you my compliments and i will tell you the conclusion that i draw from that fact 
 my dear sir when a man shouts who comes 
 the police 
 and after the police justice 
 well 
 you have not made an outcry that is because you care to have the police and the courts come in any more than we do it is have long suspected have some interest in hiding something 
 on our side we have the same interest so we can come to an understanding 
 as he spoke thus it seemed as though thenardier who kept his eyes fixed on m leblanc were trying to plunge the sharp points which darted from the pupils into the very conscience of his prisoner moreover his language which was stamped with a sort of moderated subdued insolence and crafty insolence was reserved and almost choice and in that rascal who had been nothing but a robber a short time previously one now felt the man who had studied for the priesthood 
 the silence preserved by the prisoner that precaution which had been carried to the point of forgetting all anxiety for his own life that resistance opposed to the first impulse of nature which is to utter a cry all this it must be confessed now that his attention had been called to it troubled marius and affected him with painful astonishment 
 observation still further obscured for marius the dense mystery which enveloped that grave and singular person on whom courfeyrac had bestowed the sobriquet of monsieur leblanc 
 but whoever he was bound with ropes surrounded with executioners half plunged so to speak in a grave which was closing in upon him to the extent of a degree with every moment that passed in the presence of wrath as in the presence of his sweetness this man remained impassive and marius could not refrain from admiring at such a moment the superbly melancholy visage 
 here evidently was a soul which was inaccessible to terror and which did not know the meaning of despair 
 here was one of those men who command amazement in desperate circumstances extreme as was the crisis inevitable as was the catastrophe there was nothing here of the agony of the drowning man who opens his eyes under the water 
 thenardier rose in an unpretending manner went to the fireplace shoved aside the screen which he leaned against the neighboring pallet and thus unmasked the brazier full of glowing coals in which the prisoner could plainly see the chisel and spotted here and there with tiny scarlet stars 
 then thenardier returned to his seat beside m leblanc 
 i continue said he 
 we can come to an understanding let us arrange this matter in an amicable way 
 i was wrong to lose my temper just now i know what i was thinking of i went a great deal too far i said extravagant things 
 for example because you are a millionnaire i told you that i exacted money a lot of money a deal of money 
 that would not be reasonable mon dieu in spite of your riches you have expenses of your own who has not 
 i want to ruin you i am not a greedy fellow after all 
 i am not one of those people who because they have the advantage of the position profit by the fact to make themselves ridiculous 
 why taking things into consideration and making a sacrifice on my side 
 i only want two hundred thousand francs

 chapter xx 
 
 the trap 
 the door of the garret had just opened abruptly and allowed a view of three men clad in blue linen blouses and masked with masks of black paper 
 the first was thin and had a long cudgel the second who was a sort of colossus carried by the middle of the handle with the blade downward a for slaughtering cattle 
 the third a man with shoulders not so slender as the first held in his hand an enormous key stolen from the door of some prison 
 it appeared that the arrival of these men was what jondrette had been waiting for 
 a rapid dialogue ensued between him and the man with the cudgel the thin one 
 is everything ready said jondrette 
 yes replied the thin man 
 where is montparnasse 
 the young principal actor stopped to chat with your girl 
 which 
 the eldest 
 is there a carriage at the door 
 yes 
 is the team harnessed 
 yes 
 with two good horses 
 excellent 
 is it waiting where i ordered 
 yes 
 good said jondrette 
 m leblanc was very pale 
 he was scrutinizing everything around him in the den like a man who understands what he has fallen into and his head directed in turn toward all the heads which surrounded him moved on his neck with an astonished and attentive slowness but there was nothing in his air which resembled fear 
 he had improvised an intrenchment out of the table and the man who but an instant previously had borne merely the appearance of a kindly old man had suddenly become a sort of athlete and placed his robust fist on the back of his chair with a formidable and surprising gesture 
 this old man who was so firm and so brave in the presence of such a danger seemed to possess one of those natures which are as courageous as they are kind both easily and simply the father of a woman whom we love is never a stranger to us marius felt proud of that unknown man 
 three of the men of whom jondrette had said 
 they are had armed themselves from the pile of old iron one with a heavy pair of shears the second with the third with a hammer and had placed themselves across the entrance without uttering a syllable 
 the old man had remained on the bed and had merely opened his eyes 
 the jondrette woman had seated herself beside him 
 marius decided that in a few seconds more the moment for intervention would arrive and he raised his right hand towards the ceiling in the direction of the corridor in readiness to discharge his pistol 
 jondrette having terminated his colloquy with the man with the cudgel turned once more to m leblanc and repeated his question accompanying it with that low repressed and terrible laugh which was peculiar to him 
 so you do not recognize me 
 m leblanc looked him full in the face and replied 
 no 
 then jondrette advanced to the table 
 he leaned across the candle crossing his arms putting his angular and ferocious jaw close to m calm face and advancing as far as possible without forcing m leblanc to retreat and in this posture of a wild beast who is about to bite he exclaimed 
 my name is not fabantou my name is not jondrette my name is thenardier 
 i am the of montfermeil do you understand 
 thenardier 
 now do you know me 
 an almost imperceptible flush crossed m brow and he replied with a voice which neither trembled nor rose above its ordinary level with his accustomed placidity 
 no more than before 
 marius did not hear this reply 
 any one who had seen him at that moment through the darkness would have perceived that he was haggard stupid at the moment when jondrette said my name is thenardier marius had trembled in every limb and had leaned against the wall as though he felt the cold of a steel blade through his heart

 in the meantime thenardier whom we shall henceforth call by no other name was pacing up and down in front of the table in a sort of frenzy and wild triumph 
 he seized the candle in his fist and set it on the with so violent a bang that the wick came near being extinguished and the tallow bespattered the wall 
 then he turned to m leblanc with a horrible look and spit out these words 
 done for 
 smoked brown 
 cooked 
 spitchcocked 
 and again he began to march back and forth in full eruption 
 ah he cried so found you again at last mister philanthropist mister threadbare millionnaire 
 mister giver of dolls you old ninny ah so you recognize me 
 no it you who came to montfermeil to my inn eight years ago on christmas eve it you who carried off that child from me the lark 
 it you who had a yellow no nor a package of duds in your hand as you had this morning here say wife it seems to be his mania to carry packets of woollen stockings into houses 
 old charity monger get out with you are you a hosier mister millionnaire 
 you give away your stock in trade to the poor holy man 
 what bosh merry andrew ah and you recognize me 
 well i recognize you that i do i recognized you the very moment you poked your snout in here ah find out presently that it all roses to thrust yourself in that fashion into houses under the pretext that they are taverns in wretched clothes with the air of a poor man to whom one would give a sou to deceive persons to play the generous to take away their means of livelihood and to make threats in the woods and you call things quits because afterwards when people are ruined you bring a coat that is too large and two miserable hospital blankets you old blackguard you 
 he paused and seemed to be talking to himself for a moment one would have said that his wrath had fallen into some hole like the rhone then as though he were concluding aloud the things which he had been saying to himself in a whisper he smote the table with his fist and shouted 
 and with his air 
 and apostrophizing m leblanc 
 parbleu 
 you made game of me in the past 
 you are the cause of all my misfortunes 
 for fifteen hundred francs you got a girl whom i had and who certainly belonged to rich people and who had already brought in a great deal of money and from whom i might have extracted enough to live on all my life 
 a girl who would have made up to me for everything that i lost in that vile where there was nothing but one continual row and where like a fool i ate up my last farthing 
 oh 
 i wish all the wine folks drank in my house had been poison to those who drank it well never mind 
 say now 
 you must have thought me ridiculous when you went off with the lark 
 you had your cudgel in the forest you were the stronger 
 revenge 
 the one to hold the trumps in a sorry case my good fellow 
 oh but i can laugh 
 really i laugh 
 he fall into the trap i told him that i was an actor that my name was fabantou that i had played comedy with mamselle mars with mamselle muche that my landlord insisted on being paid tomorrow the th of february and he even notice that the th of january and not the th of february is the time when the quarter runs out 
 absurd idiot and the four miserable philippes which he has brought me 
 scoundrel he the heart even to go as high as a hundred francs 
 and how he swallowed my platitudes 
 that did amuse me 
 i said to myself blockhead come got you 
 i lick your paws this morning but gnaw your heart this evening 
 thenardier paused 
 he was out of breath 
 his little narrow chest panted like a forge bellows 
 his eyes were full of the ignoble happiness of a feeble cruel and cowardly creature which finds that it can at last harass what it has feared and insult what it has flattered the joy of a dwarf who should be able to set his heel on the head of goliath the joy of a jackal which is beginning to rend a sick bull so nearly dead that he can no longer defend himself but sufficiently alive to suffer still 
 m leblanc did not interrupt him but said to him when he paused 
 i do not know what you mean to say 
 you are mistaken in me 
 i am a very poor man and anything but a millionnaire 
 i do not know you you are mistaking me for some other person 
 ah roared thenardier hoarsely a pretty lie 
 you stick to that pleasantry do you 
 floundering my old buck ah 
 you remember 
 you see who i am 
 excuse me sir said m leblanc with a politeness of accent which at that moment seemed peculiarly strange and powerful i see that you are a villain 
 who has not remarked the fact that odious creatures possess a susceptibility of their own that monsters are ticklish 
 at this word villain the female thenardier sprang from the bed thenardier grasped his chair as though he were about to crush it in his hands you stir he shouted to his wife and turning to m leblanc 
 villain 
 yes i know that you call us that you rich gentlemen stop true that i became bankrupt that i am in hiding that i have no bread that i have not a single sou that i am a villain three days since i have had anything to eat so a villain ah you folks warm your feet you have sakoski boots you have wadded like archbishops you lodge on the first floor in houses that have porters you eat truffles you eat asparagus at forty francs the bunch in the month of january and green peas you gorge yourselves and when you want to know whether it is cold you look in the papers to see what the engineer thermometer says about it 
 we it is we who are thermometers we need to go out and look on the quay at the corner of the tour de to find out the number of degrees of cold we feel our blood congealing in our veins and the ice forming round our hearts and we say 
 there is no god 
 and you come to our caverns yes our caverns for the purpose of calling us villains but devour you 
 but devour you poor little things just see here mister millionnaire 
 i have been a solid man i have held a license i have been an elector i am a bourgeois that i am 
 and quite possible that you are not 
 here thenardier took a step towards the men who stood near the door and added with a shudder 
 when i think that he has dared to come here and talk to me like a cobbler 
 then addressing m leblanc with a fresh outburst of frenzy 
 and listen to this also mister philanthropist 
 not a suspicious character not a bit of it 
 not a man whose name nobody knows and who comes and abducts children from houses an old french soldier i ought to have been decorated i was at waterloo so i was 
 and in the battle i saved a general called the comte of i know what 
 he told me his name but his beastly voice was so weak that i hear 
 all i caught was merci thanks rather have had his name than his thanks that would have helped me to find him again 
 the picture that you see here and which was painted by david at you know what it represents 
 it represents me 
 david wished to immortalize that feat of prowess 
 i have that general on my back and i am carrying him through the the history of it that general never did a single thing for me he was no better than the rest 
 but none the less i saved his life at the risk of my own and i have the certificate of the fact in my pocket i am a soldier of waterloo by all the furies 
 and now that i have had the goodness to tell you all this have an end of it i want money i want a deal of money i must have an enormous lot of money or exterminate you by the thunder of the good god 
 marius had regained some measure of control over his anguish and was listening 
 the last possibility of doubt had just vanished it certainly was the thenardier of the will 
 marius shuddered at that reproach of ingratitude directed against his father and which he was on the point of so fatally justifying 
 his perplexity was redoubled 
 moreover there was in all these words of thenardier in his accent in his gesture in his glance which darted flames at every word there was in this explosion of an evil nature disclosing everything in that mixture of braggadocio and abjectness of pride and pettiness of rage and folly in that chaos of real griefs and false sentiments in that immodesty of a malicious man tasting the voluptuous delights of violence in that shameless nudity of a repulsive soul in that conflagration of all sufferings combined with all hatreds something which was as hideous as evil and as as the truth 
 the picture of the master the painting by david which he had proposed that m leblanc should purchase was nothing else as the reader has divined than the sign of his tavern painted as it will be remembered by himself the only relic which he had preserved from his shipwreck at montfermeil 
 as he had ceased to intercept marius visual ray marius could examine this thing and in the daub he actually did recognize a battle a background of smoke and a man carrying another man it was the group composed of pontmercy and thenardier the sergeant the rescuer the colonel rescued 
 marius was like a drunken man this picture restored his father to life in some sort it was no longer the signboard of the at montfermeil it was a resurrection a tomb had yawned a phantom had risen there 
 marius heard his heart beating in his temples he had the cannon of waterloo in his ears his bleeding father vaguely depicted on that sinister panel terrified him and it seemed to him that the misshapen spectre was gazing intently at him 
 when thenardier had recovered his breath he turned his bloodshot eyes on m leblanc and said to him in a low curt voice 
 what have you to say before we put the handcuffs on you 
 m leblanc held his peace 
 in the midst of this silence a cracked voice launched this lugubrious sarcasm from the corridor 
 if any wood to be split there 
 it was the man with the axe who was growing merry 
 at the same moment an enormous bristling and clayey face made its appearance at the door with a hideous laugh which exhibited not teeth but fangs 
 it was the face of the man with the axe 
 why have you taken off your mask cried thenardier in a rage 
 for fun retorted the man 
 for the last few minutes m leblanc had appeared to be watching and following all the movements of thenardier who blinded and dazzled by his own rage was stalking to and fro in the den with full confidence that the door was guarded and of holding an unarmed man fast he being armed himself of being nine against one supposing that the female thenardier counted for but one man 
 during his address to the man with the he had turned his back to m leblanc 
 m leblanc seized this moment overturned the chair with his foot and the table with his fist and with one bound with prodigious agility before thenardier had time to turn round he had reached the window to open it to scale the frame to bestride it was the work of a second only 
 he was half out when six robust fists seized him and dragged him back energetically into the hovel 
 these were the three who had flung themselves upon him at the same time the thenardier woman had wound her hands in his hair 
 at the trampling which ensued the other ruffians rushed up from the corridor 
 the old man on the bed who seemed under the influence of wine descended from the pallet and came reeling up with a hammer in his hand 
 one of the whose smirched face was lighted up by the candle and in whom marius recognized in spite of his daubing panchaud alias printanier alias bigrenaille lifted above m head a sort of bludgeon made of two balls of lead at the two ends of a bar of iron 
 marius could not resist this sight 
 my father he thought forgive me 
 and his finger sought the trigger of his pistol 
 the shot was on the point of being discharged when voice shouted 
 harm him 
 this desperate attempt of the victim far from exasperating thenardier had calmed him 
 there existed in him two men the ferocious man and the adroit man 
 up to that moment in the excess of his triumph in the presence of the prey which had been brought down and which did not stir the ferocious man had prevailed when the victim struggled and tried to resist the adroit man reappeared and took the upper hand 
 hurt him he repeated and without suspecting it his first success was to arrest the pistol in the act of being discharged and to paralyze marius in whose opinion the urgency of the case disappeared and who in the face of this new phase saw no inconvenience in waiting a while longer 
 who knows whether some chance would not arise which would deliver him from the horrible alternative of allowing father to perish or of destroying the saviour 
 a herculean struggle had begun 
 with one blow full in the chest m leblanc had sent the old man tumbling rolling in the middle of the room then with two backward sweeps of his hand he had overthrown two more assailants and he held one under each of his knees the wretches were rattling in the throat beneath this pressure as under a granite millstone but the other four had seized the formidable old man by both arms and the back of his neck and were holding him doubled up over the two on the floor 
 thus the master of some and mastered by the rest crushing those beneath him and stifling under those on top of him endeavoring in vain to shake off all the efforts which were heaped upon him m leblanc disappeared under the horrible group of ruffians like the wild boar beneath a howling pile of dogs and hounds 
 they succeeded in overthrowing him upon the bed nearest the window and there they held him in awe 
 the thenardier woman had not released her clutch on his hair 
 you mix yourself up in this affair said thenardier tear your shawl 
 the thenardier obeyed as the female wolf obeys the male wolf with a growl 
 now said thenardier search him you other fellows 
 m leblanc seemed to have renounced the idea of resistance 
 they searched him 
 he had nothing on his person except a leather purse containing six francs and his handkerchief 
 thenardier put the handkerchief into his own pocket 
 what 
 no he demanded 
 no nor watch replied one of the 
 never mind murmured the masked man who carried the big key in the voice of a ventriloquist a tough old fellow 
 thenardier went to the corner near the door picked up a bundle of ropes and threw them at the men 
 tie him to the leg of the bed said he 
 and catching sight of the old man who had been stretched across the room by the blow from m fist and who made no movement he added 
 is boulatruelle dead 
 no replied bigrenaille drunk 
 sweep him into a corner said thenardier 
 two of the pushed the drunken man into the corner near the heap of old iron with their feet 
 babet said thenardier in a low tone to the man with the cudgel why did you bring so many they were not needed 
 what can you do replied the man with the cudgel they all wanted to be in it 
 this is a bad season 
 no business going on 
 the pallet on which m leblanc had been thrown was a sort of hospital bed elevated on four coarse wooden legs roughly hewn 
 m leblanc let them take their own course 
 the ruffians bound him securely in an upright attitude with his feet on the ground at the head of the bed the end which was most remote from the window and nearest to the fireplace 
 when the last knot had been tied thenardier took a chair and seated himself almost facing m leblanc 
 thenardier no longer looked like himself in the course of a few moments his face had passed from unbridled violence to tranquil and cunning sweetness 
 marius found it difficult to recognize in that polished smile of a man in official life the almost bestial mouth which had been foaming but a moment before he gazed with amazement on that fantastic and alarming metamorphosis and he felt as a man might feel who should behold a tiger converted into a lawyer 
 monsieur said thenardier 
 and dismissing with a gesture the ruffians who still kept their hands on m leblanc 
 stand off a little and let me have a talk with the gentleman 
 all retired towards the door 
 he went on 
 monsieur you did wrong to try to jump out of the window you might have broken your leg 
 now if you will permit me we will converse quietly 
 in the first place i must communicate to you an observation which i have made which is that you have not uttered the faintest cry 
 thenardier was right this detail was correct although it had escaped marius in his agitation 
 m leblanc had barely pronounced a few words without raising his voice and even during his struggle with the six ruffians near the window he had preserved the most profound and singular silence 
 thenardier continued 
 mon dieu 
 you might have shouted stop thief a bit and i should not have thought it improper 
 murder that too is said occasionally and so far as i am concerned i should not have taken it in bad part 
 it is very natural that you should make a little row when you find yourself with persons who inspire you with sufficient confidence 
 you might have done that and no one would have troubled you on that account 
 you would not even have been gagged 
 and i will tell you why 
 this room is very private its only recommendation but it has that in its favor you might fire off a mortar and it would produce about as much noise at the nearest police station as the snores of a drunken man here a cannon would make a boum and the thunder would make a pouf a handy lodging 
 but in short you did not shout and it is better so 
 i present you my compliments and i will tell you the conclusion that i draw from that fact 
 my dear sir when a man shouts who comes 
 the police 
 and after the police justice 
 well 
 you have not made an outcry that is because you care to have the police and the courts come in any more than we do it is have long suspected have some interest in hiding something 
 on our side we have the same interest so we can come to an understanding 
 as he spoke thus it seemed as though thenardier who kept his eyes fixed on m leblanc were trying to plunge the sharp points which darted from the pupils into the very conscience of his prisoner moreover his language which was stamped with a sort of moderated subdued insolence and crafty insolence was reserved and almost choice and in that rascal who had been nothing but a robber a short time previously one now felt the man who had studied for the priesthood 
 the silence preserved by the prisoner that precaution which had been carried to the point of forgetting all anxiety for his own life that resistance opposed to the first impulse of nature which is to utter a cry all this it must be confessed now that his attention had been called to it troubled marius and affected him with painful astonishment 
 observation still further obscured for marius the dense mystery which enveloped that grave and singular person on whom courfeyrac had bestowed the sobriquet of monsieur leblanc 
 but whoever he was bound with ropes surrounded with executioners half plunged so to speak in a grave which was closing in upon him to the extent of a degree with every moment that passed in the presence of wrath as in the presence of his sweetness this man remained impassive and marius could not refrain from admiring at such a moment the superbly melancholy visage 
 here evidently was a soul which was inaccessible to terror and which did not know the meaning of despair 
 here was one of those men who command amazement in desperate circumstances extreme as was the crisis inevitable as was the catastrophe there was nothing here of the agony of the drowning man who opens his eyes under the water 
 thenardier rose in an unpretending manner went to the fireplace shoved aside the screen which he leaned against the neighboring pallet and thus unmasked the brazier full of glowing coals in which the prisoner could plainly see the chisel and spotted here and there with tiny scarlet stars 
 then thenardier returned to his seat beside m leblanc 
 i continue said he 
 we can come to an understanding let us arrange this matter in an amicable way 
 i was wrong to lose my temper just now i know what i was thinking of i went a great deal too far i said extravagant things 
 for example because you are a millionnaire i told you that i exacted money a lot of money a deal of money 
 that would not be reasonable mon dieu in spite of your riches you have expenses of your own who has not 
 i want to ruin you i am not a greedy fellow after all 
 i am not one of those people who because they have the advantage of the position profit by the fact to make themselves ridiculous 
 why taking things into consideration and making a sacrifice on my side 
 i only want two hundred thousand francs

 beside himself with terror pierre jumped up and ran back to the battery as to the only refuge from the horrors that surrounded him 
 on entering the earthwork he noticed that there were men doing something there but that no shots were being fired from the battery he had no time to realize who these men were he saw the senior officer lying on the earth wall with his back turned as if he were examining something down below and that one of the soldiers he had noticed before was struggling forward shouting brothers and trying to free himself from some men who were holding him by the arm he also saw something else that was strange 
 but he had not time to realize that the colonel had been killed that the soldier shouting brothers was a prisoner and that another man had been bayoneted in the back before his eyes for hardly had he run into the redoubt before a thin perspiring man in a blue uniform rushed on him sword in hand shouting something instinctively guarding against the shock for they had been running together at full speed before they saw one another pierre put out his hands and seized the man a french officer by the shoulder with one hand and by the throat with the other the officer dropping his sword seized pierre by his collar 
 for some seconds they gazed with frightened eyes at one unfamiliar faces and both were perplexed at what they had done and what they were to do next am i taken prisoner or have i taken him prisoner each was thinking but the french officer was evidently more inclined to think he had been taken prisoner because strong hand impelled by instinctive fear squeezed his throat ever tighter and tighter the frenchman was about to say something when just above their heads terrible and low a cannon ball whistled and it seemed to pierre that the french head had been torn off so swiftly had he ducked it 
 pierre too bent his head and let his hands fall without further thought as to who had taken whom prisoner the frenchman ran back to the battery and pierre ran down the slope stumbling over the dead and wounded who it seemed to him caught at his feet but before he reached the foot of the knoll he was met by a dense crowd of russian soldiers who stumbling tripping up and shouting ran merrily and wildly toward the battery this was the attack for which ermolov claimed the credit declaring that only his courage and good luck made such a feat possible it was the attack in which he was said to have thrown some st crosses he had in his pocket into the battery for the first soldiers to take who got there

 book wicked poor man 
 chapter xx 
 
 m leblanc uttered not a word 
 thenardier went on 
 you see that i put not a little water in my wine very moderate i know the state of your fortune but i do know that you stick at money and a benevolent man like yourself can certainly give two hundred thousand francs to the father of a family who is out of luck 
 certainly you are reasonable too you imagined that i should take all the trouble i have and organized this affair this evening which has been labor well bestowed in the opinion of these gentlemen merely to wind up by asking you for enough to go and drink red wine at fifteen sous and eat veal at two hundred thousand surely worth all that this trifle once out of your pocket i guarantee you that the end of the matter and that you have no further demands to fear you will say to me 
 but i two hundred thousand francs about me 
 oh 
 not extortionate 
 i demand that i only ask one thing of you 
 have the goodness to write what i am about to dictate to you 
 here thenardier paused then he added emphasizing his words and casting a smile in the direction of the brazier 
 i warn you that i shall not admit that you know how to write 
 a grand inquisitor might have envied that smile 
 thenardier pushed the table close to m leblanc and took an inkstand a pen and a sheet of paper from the drawer which he left half open and in which gleamed the long blade of the knife 
 he placed the sheet of paper before m leblanc 
 write said he 
 the prisoner spoke at last 
 how do you expect me to write 
 i am bound 
 true excuse me ejaculated thenardier you are quite right 
 and turning to bigrenaille 
 untie the right arm 
 panchaud alias printanier alias bigrenaille executed order 
 when the right arm was free thenardier dipped the pen in the ink and presented it to him 
 understand thoroughly sir that you are in our power at our discretion that no human power can get you out of this and that we shall be really grieved if we are forced to proceed to disagreeable extremities i know neither your name nor your address but i warn you that you will remain bound until the person charged with carrying the letter which you are about to write shall have returned 
 now be so good as to write 
 what demanded the prisoner 
 i will dictate 
 m leblanc took the pen 
 thenardier began to dictate 
 my daughter 
 the prisoner shuddered and raised his eyes to thenardier 
 put down my dear daughter said thenardier 
 m leblanc obeyed 
 thenardier continued 
 come instantly 
 he paused 
 you address her as thou do you not 
 who asked m leblanc 
 parbleu cried thenardier the little one the lark 
 m leblanc replied without the slightest apparent emotion 
 i do not know what you mean 
 go on nevertheless ejaculated thenardier and he continued to dictate 
 come immediately i am in absolute need of thee 
 the person who will deliver this note to thee is instructed to conduct thee to me i am waiting for thee 
 come with confidence 
 m leblanc had written the whole of this 
 thenardier resumed 
 ah erase come with confidence that might lead her to suppose that everything was not as it should be and that distrust is possible 
 m leblanc erased the three words 
 now pursued thenardier sign it 
 your name 
 the prisoner laid down the pen and demanded 
 for whom is this letter 
 you know well retorted thenardier for the little one i just told you so 
 it was evident that thenardier avoided naming the young girl in question 
 he said the lark he said the little one but he did not pronounce her precaution of a clever man guarding his secret from his accomplices 
 to mention the name was to deliver the whole affair into their hands and to tell them more about it than there was any need of their knowing 
 he went on 
 sign 
 what is your name 
 urbain fabre said the prisoner 
 thenardier with the movement of a cat dashed his hand into his pocket and drew out the handkerchief which had been seized on m leblanc he looked for the mark on it and held it close to the candle 
 u f it 
 urbain fabre 
 well sign it u f 
 the prisoner signed 
 as two hands are required to fold the letter give it to me i will fold it 
 that done thenardier resumed 
 address it mademoiselle fabre at your house 
 i know that you live a long distance from here near because you go to mass there every day but i know in what street i see that you understand your situation 
 as you have not lied about your name you will not lie about your address 
 write it yourself 
 the prisoner paused thoughtfully for a moment then he took the pen and wrote 
 mademoiselle fabre at m urbain rue no 
 thenardier seized the letter with a sort of feverish convulsion 
 wife he cried 
 the thenardier woman hastened to him 
 the letter 
 you know what you have to do 
 there is a carriage at the door 
 set out at once and return ditto 
 and addressing the man with the 
 since you have taken off your accompany the mistress you will get up behind the fiacre 
 you know where you left the team 
 yes said the man 
 and depositing his axe in a corner he followed madame thenardier 
 as they set off thenardier thrust his head through the door and shouted into the corridor 
 above all things lose the letter remember that you carry two hundred thousand francs with you 
 the hoarse voice replied 
 be easy 
 i have it in my bosom 
 a minute had not elapsed when the sound of the cracking of a whip was heard which rapidly retreated and died away 
 good growled thenardier 
 going at a fine pace at such a gallop the bourgeoise will be back inside of an hour 
 he drew a chair close to the fireplace folding his arms and presenting his muddy boots to the brazier 
 my feet are cold said he 
 only five ruffians now remained in the den with thenardier and the prisoner 
 these men through the black masks or paste which covered their faces and made of them at pleasure negroes or demons had a stupid and gloomy air and it could be felt that they perpetrated a crime like a bit of work tranquilly without either wrath or mercy with a sort of ennui 
 they were crowded together in one corner like brutes and remained silent 
 thenardier warmed his feet 
 the prisoner had relapsed into his taciturnity 
 a sombre calm had succeeded to the wild uproar which had filled the garret but a few moments before 
 the candle on which a large stranger had formed cast but a dim light in the immense hovel the brazier had grown dull and all those monstrous heads cast misshapen shadows on the walls and ceiling 
 no sound was audible except the quiet breathing of the old drunken man who was fast asleep 
 marius waited in a state of anxiety that was augmented by every trifle the enigma was more impenetrable than ever 
 who was this little one whom thenardier had called the lark was she his ursule the prisoner had not seemed to be affected by that word the lark and had replied in the most natural manner in the world 
 i do not know what you mean 
 on the other hand the two letters u f were explained they meant urbain fabre and ursule was no longer named ursule 
 this was what marius perceived most clearly of all 
 a sort of horrible fascination held him nailed to his post from which he was observing and commanding this whole scene there he stood almost incapable of movement or reflection as though annihilated by the abominable things viewed at such close quarters he waited in the hope of some incident no matter of what nature since he could not collect his thoughts and did not know upon what course to decide 
 in any case he said if she is the lark i shall see her for the thenardier woman is to bring her hither 
 that will be the end and then i will give my life and my blood if necessary but i will deliver her 
 nothing shall stop me 
 nearly half an hour passed in this manner 
 thenardier seemed to be absorbed in gloomy reflections the prisoner did not stir still marius fancied that at intervals and for the last few moments he had heard a faint dull noise in the direction of the prisoner 
 all at once thenardier addressed the prisoner 
 by the way monsieur fabre i might as well say it to you at once 
 these few words appeared to be the beginning of an explanation marius strained his ears 
 my wife will be back shortly get impatient 
 i think that the lark really is your daughter and it seems to me quite natural that you should keep her 
 only listen to me a bit 
 my wife will go and hunt her up with your letter 
 i told my wife to dress herself in the way she did so that your young lady might make no difficulty about following her 
 they will both enter the carriage with my comrade behind 
 somewhere outside the barrier there is a trap harnessed to two very good horses 
 your young lady will be taken to it she will alight from the fiacre 
 my comrade will enter the other vehicle with her and my wife will come back here to tell us done 
 as for the young lady no harm will be done to her the trap will conduct her to a place where she will be quiet and just as soon as you have handed over to me those little two hundred thousand francs she will be returned to you 
 if you have me arrested my comrade will give a turn of his thumb to the lark all 
 the prisoner uttered not a syllable 
 after a pause thenardier continued 
 very simple as you see 
 be no harm done unless you wish that there should be harm done 
 telling you how things stand i warn you so that you may be prepared 
 he paused 
 the prisoner did not break the silence and thenardier resumed 
 as soon as my wife returns and says to me 
 the lark is on the way we will release you and you will be free to go and sleep at home you see that our intentions are not evil 
 terrible images passed through marius mind 
 what 
 that young girl whom they were abducting was not to be brought back one of those monsters was to bear her off into the darkness whither 
 and what if it were she 
 it was clear that it was she 
 marius felt his heart stop beating 
 what was he to do 
 discharge the pistol 
 place all those scoundrels in the hands of justice 
 but the horrible man with the would none the less be out of reach with the young girl and marius reflected on words of which he perceived the bloody significance 
 if you have me arrested my comrade will give a turn of his thumb to the lark 
 now it was not alone by the testament it was by his own love it was by the peril of the one he loved that he felt himself restrained 
 this frightful situation which had already lasted above half an hour was changing its aspect every moment 
 marius had sufficient strength of mind to review in succession all the most conjectures seeking hope and finding none 
 the tumult of his thoughts contrasted with the funereal silence of the den 
 in the midst of this silence the door at the bottom of the staircase was heard to open and shut again 
 the prisoner made a movement in his bonds 
 the bourgeoise said thenardier 
 he had hardly uttered the words when the thenardier woman did in fact rush hastily into the room red panting breathless with flaming eyes and cried as she smote her huge hands on her thighs simultaneously 
 false address 
 the ruffian who had gone with her made his appearance behind her and picked up his axe again 
 she resumed 
 nobody there 
 rue no no monsieur urbain fabre they know not what it means 
 she paused choking then went on 
 monsieur thenardier 
 that old fellow has duped you 
 you are too good you see 
 if it had been me have chopped the beast in four quarters to begin with 
 and if he had acted ugly have boiled him alive 
 he would have been obliged to speak and say where the girl is and where he keeps his shiners 
 the way i should have managed matters 
 people are perfectly right when they say that men are a deal stupider than women 
 nobody at no nothing but a big carriage gate 
 no monsieur fabre in the rue and after all that racing and fee to the coachman and all 
 i spoke to both the porter and the portress a fine stout woman and they know nothing about him 
 marius breathed freely once more 
 she ursule or the lark he no longer knew what to call her was safe 
 while his exasperated wife vociferated thenardier had seated himself on the table 
 for several minutes he uttered not a word but swung his right foot which hung down and stared at the brazier with an air of savage revery 
 finally he said to the prisoner with a slow and singularly ferocious tone 
 a false address 
 what did you expect to gain by that 
 to gain time cried the prisoner in a thundering voice and at the same instant he shook off his bonds they were cut the prisoner was only attached to the bed now by one leg 
 before the seven men had time to collect their senses and dash forward he had bent down into the fireplace had stretched out his hand to the brazier and had then straightened himself up again and now thenardier the female thenardier and the ruffians huddled in amazement at the extremity of the hovel stared at him in stupefaction as almost free and in a formidable attitude he brandished above his head the chisel which emitted a threatening glow 
 the judicial examination to which the ambush in the gorbeau house eventually gave rise established the fact that a large sou piece cut and worked in a peculiar fashion was found in the garret when the police made their descent on it 
 this sou piece was one of those marvels of industry which are engendered by the patience of the galleys in the shadows and for the shadows marvels which are nothing else than instruments of escape these hideous and delicate products of wonderful art are to jewellers work what the metaphors of slang are to poetry 
 there are benvenuto cellinis in the galleys just as there are villons in language the unhappy wretch who aspires to deliverance finds means sometimes without tools sometimes with a common knife to saw a sou into two thin plates to hollow out these plates without affecting the coinage stamp and to make a furrow on the edge of the sou in such a manner that the plates will adhere again this can be screwed together and unscrewed at will it is a box in this box he hides a and this properly handled cuts chains and bars of iron the unfortunate convict is supposed to possess merely a sou not at all he possesses liberty 
 it was a large sou of this sort which during the subsequent search of the police was found under the bed near the window 
 they also found a tiny saw of blue steel which would fit the sou 
 it is probable that the prisoner had this sou piece on his person at the moment when the ruffians searched him that he contrived to conceal it in his hand and that afterward having his right hand free he unscrewed it and used it as a saw to cut the cords which fastened him which would explain the faint noise and almost imperceptible movements which marius had observed 
 as he had not been able to bend down for fear of betraying himself he had not cut the bonds of his left leg 
 the ruffians had recovered from their first surprise 
 be easy said bigrenaille to thenardier 
 he still holds by one leg and he get away 
 answer for that 
 i tied that paw for him 
 in the meanwhile the prisoner had begun to speak 
 you are wretches but my life is not worth the trouble of defending it 
 when you think that you can make me speak that you can make me write what i do not choose to write that you can make me say what i do not choose to say 
 he stripped up his left sleeve and added 
 see here 
 at the same moment he extended his arm and laid the glowing chisel which he held in his left hand by its wooden handle on his bare flesh 
 the crackling of the burning flesh became audible and the odor peculiar to chambers of torture filled the hovel 
 marius reeled in utter horror the very ruffians shuddered hardly a muscle of the old face contracted and while the iron sank into the smoking wound impassive and almost august he fixed on thenardier his beautiful glance in which there was no hatred and where suffering vanished in serene majesty 
 with grand and lofty natures the revolts of the flesh and the senses when subjected to physical suffering cause the soul to spring forth and make it appear on the brow just as rebellions among the soldiery force the captain to show himself 
 wretches said he have no more fear of me than i have for you 
 and tearing the chisel from the wound he hurled it through the window which had been left open the horrible glowing tool disappeared into the night whirling as it flew and fell far away on the snow 
 the prisoner resumed 
 do what you please with me 
 he was disarmed 
 seize him said thenardier 
 two of the ruffians laid their hands on his shoulder and the masked man with the voice took up his station in front of him ready to smash his skull at the slightest movement 
 at the same time marius heard below him at the base of the partition but so near that he could not see who was speaking this colloquy conducted in a low tone 
 there is only one thing left to do 
 cut his throat 
 it 
 it was the husband and wife taking counsel together 
 thenardier walked slowly towards the table opened the drawer and took out the knife 
 marius fretted with the handle of his pistol unprecedented perplexity 
 for the last hour he had had two voices in his conscience the one enjoining him to respect his testament the other crying to him to rescue the prisoner these two voices continued uninterruptedly that struggle which tormented him to agony 
 up to that moment he had cherished a vague hope that he should find some means of reconciling these two duties but nothing within the limits of possibility had presented itself 
 however the peril was urgent the last bounds of delay had been reached thenardier was standing thoughtfully a few paces distant from the prisoner 
 marius cast a wild glance about him the last mechanical resource of despair 
 all at once a shudder ran through him 
 at his feet on the table a bright ray of light from the full moon illuminated and seemed to point out to him a sheet of paper on this paper he read the following line written that very morning in large letters by the eldest of the thenardier girls 
 the bobbies are here 
 an idea a flash crossed marius mind this was the expedient of which he was in search the solution of that frightful problem which was torturing him of sparing the assassin and saving the victim 
 he knelt down on his commode stretched out his arm seized the sheet of paper softly detached a bit of plaster from the wall wrapped the paper round it and tossed the whole through the crevice into the middle of the den 
 it was high time 
 thenardier had conquered his last fears or his last scruples and was advancing on the prisoner 
 something is falling cried the thenardier woman 
 what is it asked her husband 
 the woman darted forward and picked up the bit of plaster she handed it to her husband 
 where did this come from demanded thenardier 
 pardie ejaculated his wife where do you suppose it came from through the window of course 
 i saw it pass said bigrenaille 
 thenardier rapidly unfolded the paper and held it close to the candle 
 in handwriting 
 the devil 
 he made a sign to his wife who hastily drew near and showed her the line written on the sheet of paper then he added in a subdued voice 
 quick 
 the ladder 
 leave the bacon in the mousetrap and decamp 
 without cutting that throat asked the thenardier woman 
 we the time 
 through what resumed bigrenaille 
 through the window replied thenardier 
 since ponine has thrown the stone through the window it indicates that the house is not watched on that side 
 the mask with the voice deposited his huge key on the floor raised both arms in the air and opened and clenched his fists three times rapidly without uttering a word 
 this was the signal like the signal for clearing the decks for action on board ship 
 the ruffians who were holding the prisoner released him in the twinkling of an eye the rope ladder was unrolled outside the window and solidly fastened to the sill by the two iron hooks 
 the prisoner paid no attention to what was going on around him he seemed to be dreaming or praying 
 as soon as the ladder was arranged thenardier cried 
 come the bourgeoise first 
 and he rushed headlong to the window 
 but just as he was about to throw his leg over bigrenaille seized him roughly by the collar 
 not much come now you old dog after us 
 after us yelled the ruffians 
 you are children said thenardier we are losing time the police are on our heels 
 well said the ruffians draw lots to see who shall go down first 
 thenardier exclaimed 
 are you mad 
 are you crazy 
 what a pack of boobies 
 you want to waste time do you 
 draw lots do you 
 by a wet finger by a short straw 
 with written names 
 thrown into a hat 
 would you like my hat cried a voice on the threshold 
 all wheeled round 
 it was javert 
 he had his hat in his hand and was holding it out to them with a smile

 book wicked poor man 
 chapter xx 
 
 m leblanc uttered not a word 
 thenardier went on 
 you see that i put not a little water in my wine very moderate i know the state of your fortune but i do know that you stick at money and a benevolent man like yourself can certainly give two hundred thousand francs to the father of a family who is out of luck 
 certainly you are reasonable too you imagined that i should take all the trouble i have and organized this affair this evening which has been labor well bestowed in the opinion of these gentlemen merely to wind up by asking you for enough to go and drink red wine at fifteen sous and eat veal at two hundred thousand surely worth all that this trifle once out of your pocket i guarantee you that the end of the matter and that you have no further demands to fear you will say to me 
 but i two hundred thousand francs about me 
 oh 
 not extortionate 
 i demand that i only ask one thing of you 
 have the goodness to write what i am about to dictate to you 
 here thenardier paused then he added emphasizing his words and casting a smile in the direction of the brazier 
 i warn you that i shall not admit that you know how to write 
 a grand inquisitor might have envied that smile 
 thenardier pushed the table close to m leblanc and took an inkstand a pen and a sheet of paper from the drawer which he left half open and in which gleamed the long blade of the knife 
 he placed the sheet of paper before m leblanc 
 write said he 
 the prisoner spoke at last 
 how do you expect me to write 
 i am bound 
 true excuse me ejaculated thenardier you are quite right 
 and turning to bigrenaille 
 untie the right arm 
 panchaud alias printanier alias bigrenaille executed order 
 when the right arm was free thenardier dipped the pen in the ink and presented it to him 
 understand thoroughly sir that you are in our power at our discretion that no human power can get you out of this and that we shall be really grieved if we are forced to proceed to disagreeable extremities i know neither your name nor your address but i warn you that you will remain bound until the person charged with carrying the letter which you are about to write shall have returned 
 now be so good as to write 
 what demanded the prisoner 
 i will dictate 
 m leblanc took the pen 
 thenardier began to dictate 
 my daughter 
 the prisoner shuddered and raised his eyes to thenardier 
 put down my dear daughter said thenardier 
 m leblanc obeyed 
 thenardier continued 
 come instantly 
 he paused 
 you address her as thou do you not 
 who asked m leblanc 
 parbleu cried thenardier the little one the lark 
 m leblanc replied without the slightest apparent emotion 
 i do not know what you mean 
 go on nevertheless ejaculated thenardier and he continued to dictate 
 come immediately i am in absolute need of thee 
 the person who will deliver this note to thee is instructed to conduct thee to me i am waiting for thee 
 come with confidence 
 m leblanc had written the whole of this 
 thenardier resumed 
 ah erase come with confidence that might lead her to suppose that everything was not as it should be and that distrust is possible 
 m leblanc erased the three words 
 now pursued thenardier sign it 
 your name 
 the prisoner laid down the pen and demanded 
 for whom is this letter 
 you know well retorted thenardier for the little one i just told you so 
 it was evident that thenardier avoided naming the young girl in question 
 he said the lark he said the little one but he did not pronounce her precaution of a clever man guarding his secret from his accomplices 
 to mention the name was to deliver the whole affair into their hands and to tell them more about it than there was any need of their knowing 
 he went on 
 sign 
 what is your name 
 urbain fabre said the prisoner 
 thenardier with the movement of a cat dashed his hand into his pocket and drew out the handkerchief which had been seized on m leblanc he looked for the mark on it and held it close to the candle 
 u f it 
 urbain fabre 
 well sign it u f 
 the prisoner signed 
 as two hands are required to fold the letter give it to me i will fold it 
 that done thenardier resumed 
 address it mademoiselle fabre at your house 
 i know that you live a long distance from here near because you go to mass there every day but i know in what street i see that you understand your situation 
 as you have not lied about your name you will not lie about your address 
 write it yourself 
 the prisoner paused thoughtfully for a moment then he took the pen and wrote 
 mademoiselle fabre at m urbain rue no 
 thenardier seized the letter with a sort of feverish convulsion 
 wife he cried 
 the thenardier woman hastened to him 
 the letter 
 you know what you have to do 
 there is a carriage at the door 
 set out at once and return ditto 
 and addressing the man with the 
 since you have taken off your accompany the mistress you will get up behind the fiacre 
 you know where you left the team 
 yes said the man 
 and depositing his axe in a corner he followed madame thenardier 
 as they set off thenardier thrust his head through the door and shouted into the corridor 
 above all things lose the letter remember that you carry two hundred thousand francs with you 
 the hoarse voice replied 
 be easy 
 i have it in my bosom 
 a minute had not elapsed when the sound of the cracking of a whip was heard which rapidly retreated and died away 
 good growled thenardier 
 going at a fine pace at such a gallop the bourgeoise will be back inside of an hour 
 he drew a chair close to the fireplace folding his arms and presenting his muddy boots to the brazier 
 my feet are cold said he 
 only five ruffians now remained in the den with thenardier and the prisoner 
 these men through the black masks or paste which covered their faces and made of them at pleasure negroes or demons had a stupid and gloomy air and it could be felt that they perpetrated a crime like a bit of work tranquilly without either wrath or mercy with a sort of ennui 
 they were crowded together in one corner like brutes and remained silent 
 thenardier warmed his feet 
 the prisoner had relapsed into his taciturnity 
 a sombre calm had succeeded to the wild uproar which had filled the garret but a few moments before 
 the candle on which a large stranger had formed cast but a dim light in the immense hovel the brazier had grown dull and all those monstrous heads cast misshapen shadows on the walls and ceiling 
 no sound was audible except the quiet breathing of the old drunken man who was fast asleep 
 marius waited in a state of anxiety that was augmented by every trifle the enigma was more impenetrable than ever 
 who was this little one whom thenardier had called the lark was she his ursule the prisoner had not seemed to be affected by that word the lark and had replied in the most natural manner in the world 
 i do not know what you mean 
 on the other hand the two letters u f were explained they meant urbain fabre and ursule was no longer named ursule 
 this was what marius perceived most clearly of all 
 a sort of horrible fascination held him nailed to his post from which he was observing and commanding this whole scene there he stood almost incapable of movement or reflection as though annihilated by the abominable things viewed at such close quarters he waited in the hope of some incident no matter of what nature since he could not collect his thoughts and did not know upon what course to decide 
 in any case he said if she is the lark i shall see her for the thenardier woman is to bring her hither 
 that will be the end and then i will give my life and my blood if necessary but i will deliver her 
 nothing shall stop me 
 nearly half an hour passed in this manner 
 thenardier seemed to be absorbed in gloomy reflections the prisoner did not stir still marius fancied that at intervals and for the last few moments he had heard a faint dull noise in the direction of the prisoner 
 all at once thenardier addressed the prisoner 
 by the way monsieur fabre i might as well say it to you at once 
 these few words appeared to be the beginning of an explanation marius strained his ears 
 my wife will be back shortly get impatient 
 i think that the lark really is your daughter and it seems to me quite natural that you should keep her 
 only listen to me a bit 
 my wife will go and hunt her up with your letter 
 i told my wife to dress herself in the way she did so that your young lady might make no difficulty about following her 
 they will both enter the carriage with my comrade behind 
 somewhere outside the barrier there is a trap harnessed to two very good horses 
 your young lady will be taken to it she will alight from the fiacre 
 my comrade will enter the other vehicle with her and my wife will come back here to tell us done 
 as for the young lady no harm will be done to her the trap will conduct her to a place where she will be quiet and just as soon as you have handed over to me those little two hundred thousand francs she will be returned to you 
 if you have me arrested my comrade will give a turn of his thumb to the lark all 
 the prisoner uttered not a syllable 
 after a pause thenardier continued 
 very simple as you see 
 be no harm done unless you wish that there should be harm done 
 telling you how things stand i warn you so that you may be prepared 
 he paused 
 the prisoner did not break the silence and thenardier resumed 
 as soon as my wife returns and says to me 
 the lark is on the way we will release you and you will be free to go and sleep at home you see that our intentions are not evil 
 terrible images passed through marius mind 
 what 
 that young girl whom they were abducting was not to be brought back one of those monsters was to bear her off into the darkness whither 
 and what if it were she 
 it was clear that it was she 
 marius felt his heart stop beating 
 what was he to do 
 discharge the pistol 
 place all those scoundrels in the hands of justice 
 but the horrible man with the would none the less be out of reach with the young girl and marius reflected on words of which he perceived the bloody significance 
 if you have me arrested my comrade will give a turn of his thumb to the lark 
 now it was not alone by the testament it was by his own love it was by the peril of the one he loved that he felt himself restrained 
 this frightful situation which had already lasted above half an hour was changing its aspect every moment 
 marius had sufficient strength of mind to review in succession all the most conjectures seeking hope and finding none 
 the tumult of his thoughts contrasted with the funereal silence of the den 
 in the midst of this silence the door at the bottom of the staircase was heard to open and shut again 
 the prisoner made a movement in his bonds 
 the bourgeoise said thenardier 
 he had hardly uttered the words when the thenardier woman did in fact rush hastily into the room red panting breathless with flaming eyes and cried as she smote her huge hands on her thighs simultaneously 
 false address 
 the ruffian who had gone with her made his appearance behind her and picked up his axe again 
 she resumed 
 nobody there 
 rue no no monsieur urbain fabre they know not what it means 
 she paused choking then went on 
 monsieur thenardier 
 that old fellow has duped you 
 you are too good you see 
 if it had been me have chopped the beast in four quarters to begin with 
 and if he had acted ugly have boiled him alive 
 he would have been obliged to speak and say where the girl is and where he keeps his shiners 
 the way i should have managed matters 
 people are perfectly right when they say that men are a deal stupider than women 
 nobody at no nothing but a big carriage gate 
 no monsieur fabre in the rue and after all that racing and fee to the coachman and all 
 i spoke to both the porter and the portress a fine stout woman and they know nothing about him 
 marius breathed freely once more

 to gain time cried the prisoner in a thundering voice and at the same instant he shook off his bonds they were cut the prisoner was only attached to the bed now by one leg 
 before the seven men had time to collect their senses and dash forward he had bent down into the fireplace had stretched out his hand to the brazier and had then straightened himself up again and now thenardier the female thenardier and the ruffians huddled in amazement at the extremity of the hovel stared at him in stupefaction as almost free and in a formidable attitude he brandished above his head the chisel which emitted a threatening glow

 this sou piece was one of those marvels of industry which are engendered by the patience of the galleys in the shadows and for the shadows marvels which are nothing else than instruments of escape these hideous and delicate products of wonderful art are to jewellers work what the metaphors of slang are to poetry 
 there are benvenuto cellinis in the galleys just as there are villons in language the unhappy wretch who aspires to deliverance finds means sometimes without tools sometimes with a common knife to saw a sou into two thin plates to hollow out these plates without affecting the coinage stamp and to make a furrow on the edge of the sou in such a manner that the plates will adhere again this can be screwed together and unscrewed at will it is a box in this box he hides a and this properly handled cuts chains and bars of iron the unfortunate convict is supposed to possess merely a sou not at all he possesses liberty 
 it was a large sou of this sort which during the subsequent search of the police was found under the bed near the window

 be easy said bigrenaille to thenardier 
 he still holds by one leg and he get away 
 answer for that 
 i tied that paw for him 
 in the meanwhile the prisoner had begun to speak 
 you are wretches but my life is not worth the trouble of defending it 
 when you think that you can make me speak that you can make me write what i do not choose to write that you can make me say what i do not choose to say 
 he stripped up his left sleeve and added 
 see here 
 at the same moment he extended his arm and laid the glowing chisel which he held in his left hand by its wooden handle on his bare flesh 
 the crackling of the burning flesh became audible and the odor peculiar to chambers of torture filled the hovel 
 marius reeled in utter horror the very ruffians shuddered hardly a muscle of the old face contracted and while the iron sank into the smoking wound impassive and almost august he fixed on thenardier his beautiful glance in which there was no hatred and where suffering vanished in serene majesty

 and tearing the chisel from the wound he hurled it through the window which had been left open the horrible glowing tool disappeared into the night whirling as it flew and fell far away on the snow 
 the prisoner resumed 
 do what you please with me 
 he was disarmed 
 seize him said thenardier 
 two of the ruffians laid their hands on his shoulder and the masked man with the voice took up his station in front of him ready to smash his skull at the slightest movement 
 at the same time marius heard below him at the base of the partition but so near that he could not see who was speaking this colloquy conducted in a low tone 
 there is only one thing left to do 
 cut his throat 
 it 
 it was the husband and wife taking counsel together 
 thenardier walked slowly towards the table opened the drawer and took out the knife 
 marius fretted with the handle of his pistol unprecedented perplexity 
 for the last hour he had had two voices in his conscience the one enjoining him to respect his testament the other crying to him to rescue the prisoner these two voices continued uninterruptedly that struggle which tormented him to agony 
 up to that moment he had cherished a vague hope that he should find some means of reconciling these two duties but nothing within the limits of possibility had presented itself 
 however the peril was urgent the last bounds of delay had been reached thenardier was standing thoughtfully a few paces distant from the prisoner 
 marius cast a wild glance about him the last mechanical resource of despair 
 all at once a shudder ran through him 
 at his feet on the table a bright ray of light from the full moon illuminated and seemed to point out to him a sheet of paper on this paper he read the following line written that very morning in large letters by the eldest of the thenardier girls 
 the bobbies are here 
 an idea a flash crossed marius mind this was the expedient of which he was in search the solution of that frightful problem which was torturing him of sparing the assassin and saving the victim 
 he knelt down on his commode stretched out his arm seized the sheet of paper softly detached a bit of plaster from the wall wrapped the paper round it and tossed the whole through the crevice into the middle of the den 
 it was high time 
 thenardier had conquered his last fears or his last scruples and was advancing on the prisoner 
 something is falling cried the thenardier woman 
 what is it asked her husband 
 the woman darted forward and picked up the bit of plaster she handed it to her husband 
 where did this come from demanded thenardier 
 pardie ejaculated his wife where do you suppose it came from through the window of course 
 i saw it pass said bigrenaille 
 thenardier rapidly unfolded the paper and held it close to the candle 
 in handwriting 
 the devil 
 he made a sign to his wife who hastily drew near and showed her the line written on the sheet of paper then he added in a subdued voice 
 quick 
 the ladder 
 leave the bacon in the mousetrap and decamp 
 without cutting that throat asked the thenardier woman 
 we the time 
 through what resumed bigrenaille 
 through the window replied thenardier 
 since ponine has thrown the stone through the window it indicates that the house is not watched on that side 
 the mask with the voice deposited his huge key on the floor raised both arms in the air and opened and clenched his fists three times rapidly without uttering a word 
 this was the signal like the signal for clearing the decks for action on board ship

 come the bourgeoise first 
 and he rushed headlong to the window 
 but just as he was about to throw his leg over bigrenaille seized him roughly by the collar 
 not much come now you old dog after us 
 after us yelled the ruffians 
 you are children said thenardier we are losing time the police are on our heels 
 well said the ruffians draw lots to see who shall go down first 
 thenardier exclaimed 
 are you mad 
 are you crazy 
 what a pack of boobies 
 you want to waste time do you 
 draw lots do you 
 by a wet finger by a short straw 
 with written names 
 thrown into a hat

 the chief action of the battle of borodino was fought within the seven thousand feet between borodino and fleches beyond that space there was on the one side a demonstration made by the russians with cavalry at midday and on the other side beyond utitsa collision with tuchkov but these two were detached and feeble actions in comparison with what took place in the center of the battlefield on the field between borodino and the fleches beside the wood the chief action of the day took place on an open space visible from both sides and was fought in the simplest and most artless way 
 the battle began on both sides with a cannonade from several hundred guns 
 then when the whole field was covered with smoke two divisions and advanced from the french right while troops advanced on borodino from their left 
 from the shevardino redoubt where napoleon was standing the fleches were two thirds of a mile away and it was more than a mile as the crow flies to borodino so that napoleon could not see what was happening there especially as the smoke mingling with the mist hid the whole locality the soldiers of division advancing against the fleches could only be seen till they had entered the hollow that lay between them and the fleches as soon as they had descended into that hollow the smoke of the guns and musketry on the fleches grew so dense that it covered the whole approach on that side of it through the smoke glimpses could be caught of something black probably men and at times the glint of bayonets but whether they were moving or stationary whether they were french or russian could not be discovered from the shevardino redoubt 
 the sun had risen brightly and its slanting rays struck straight into face as shading his eyes with his hand he looked at the fleches the smoke spread out before them and at times it looked as if the smoke were moving at times as if the troops moved sometimes shouts were heard through the firing but it was impossible to tell what was being done there 
 napoleon standing on the knoll looked through a field glass and in its small circlet saw smoke and men sometimes his own and sometimes russians but when he looked again with the naked eye he could not tell where what he had seen was 
 he descended the knoll and began walking up and down before it 
 occasionally he stopped listened to the firing and gazed intently at the battlefield 
 but not only was it impossible to make out what was happening from where he was standing down below or from the knoll above on which some of his generals had taken their stand but even from the fleches themselves in which by this time there were now russian and now french soldiers alternately or together dead wounded alive frightened or maddened even at those fleches themselves it was impossible to make out what was taking place there for several hours amid incessant cannon and musketry fire now russians were seen alone now frenchmen alone now infantry and now cavalry they appeared fired fell collided not knowing what to do with one another screamed and ran back again 
 from the battlefield adjutants he had sent out and orderlies from his marshals kept galloping up to napoleon with reports of the progress of the action but all these reports were false both because it was impossible in the heat of battle to say what was happening at any given moment and because many of the adjutants did not go to the actual place of conflict but reported what they had heard from others and also because while an adjutant was riding more than a mile to napoleon circumstances changed and the news he brought was already becoming false thus an adjutant galloped up from murat with tidings that borodino had been occupied and the bridge over the kolocha was in the hands of the french the adjutant asked whether napoleon wished the troops to cross it napoleon gave orders that the troops should form up on the farther side and wait but before that order was given almost as soon in fact as the adjutant had left borodino the bridge had been retaken by the russians and burned in the very skirmish at which pierre had been present at the beginning of the battle 
 an adjutant galloped up from the fleches with a pale and frightened face and reported to napoleon that their attack had been repulsed campan wounded and davout killed yet at the very time the adjutant had been told that the french had been repulsed the fleches had in fact been recaptured by other french troops and davout was alive and only slightly bruised on the basis of these necessarily untrustworthy reports napoleon gave his orders which had either been executed before he gave them or could not be and were not executed 
 the marshals and generals who were nearer to the field of battle but like napoleon did not take part in the actual fighting and only occasionally went within musket range made their own arrangements without asking napoleon and issued orders where and in what direction to fire and where cavalry should gallop and infantry should run but even their orders like were seldom carried out and then but partially for the most part things happened contrary to their orders soldiers ordered to advance ran back on meeting grapeshot soldiers ordered to remain where they were suddenly seeing russians unexpectedly before them sometimes rushed back and sometimes forward and the cavalry dashed without orders in pursuit of the flying russians in this way two cavalry regiments galloped through the semenovsk hollow and as soon as they reached the top of the incline turned round and galloped full speed back again the infantry moved in the same way sometimes running to quite other places than those they were ordered to go to all orders as to where and when to move the guns when to send infantry to shoot or horsemen to ride down the russian infantry all such orders were given by the officers on the spot nearest to the units concerned without asking either ney davout or murat much less napoleon they did not fear getting into trouble for not fulfilling orders or for acting on their own initiative for in battle what is at stake is what is dearest to man his own life and it sometimes seems that safety lies in running back sometimes in running forward and these men who were right in the heat of the battle acted according to the mood of the moment in reality however all these movements forward and backward did not improve or alter the position of the troops all their rushing and galloping at one another did little harm the harm of disablement and death was caused by the balls and bullets that flew over the fields on which these men were floundering about as soon as they left the place where the balls and bullets were flying about their superiors located in the background them and brought them under discipline and under the influence of that discipline led them back to the zone of fire where under the influence of fear of death they lost their discipline and rushed about according to the chance promptings of the throng

 javert 
 i dare fire at that man 
 do you dare

 well then fire 
 thenardier took the pistol and aimed at javert

 book ten 
 chapter xxxiv 
 
 generals davout ney and murat who were near that region of fire and sometimes even entered it repeatedly led into it huge masses of troops but contrary to what had always happened in their former battles instead of the news they expected of the flight these orderly masses returned thence as disorganized and terrified mobs the generals them but their numbers constantly decreased in the middle of the day murat sent his adjutant to napoleon to demand reinforcements 
 napoleon sat at the foot of the knoll drinking punch when adjutant galloped up with an assurance that the russians would be routed if his majesty would let him have another division 
 reinforcements said napoleon in a tone of stern surprise looking at the adjutant a handsome lad with long black curls arranged like own as though he did not understand his words 
 reinforcements thought napoleon to himself how can they need reinforcements when they already have half the army directed against a weak unentrenched russian wing 
 tell the king of naples said he sternly that it is not noon yet and i yet see my chessboard clearly go 
 the handsome boy adjutant with the long hair sighed deeply without removing his hand from his hat and galloped back to where men were being slaughtered 
 napoleon rose and having summoned caulaincourt and berthier began talking to them about matters unconnected with the battle 
 in the midst of this conversation which was beginning to interest napoleon eyes turned to look at a general with a suite who was galloping toward the knoll on a lathering horse it was belliard having dismounted he went up to the emperor with rapid strides and in a loud voice began boldly demonstrating the necessity of sending reinforcements he swore on his honor that the russians were lost if the emperor would give another division 
 napoleon shrugged his shoulders and continued to pace up and down without replying belliard began talking loudly and eagerly to the generals of the suite around him 
 you are very fiery belliard said napoleon when he again came up to the general in the heat of a battle it is easy to make a mistake go and have another look and then come back to me 
 before belliard was out of sight a messenger from another part of the battlefield galloped up 
 now then what do you want asked napoleon in the tone of a man irritated at being continually disturbed 
 sire the prince began the adjutant 
 asks for reinforcements said napoleon with an angry gesture 
 the adjutant bent his head affirmatively and began to report but the emperor turned from him took a couple of steps stopped came back and called berthier 
 we must give reserves he said moving his arms slightly apart who do you think should be sent there he asked of berthier whom he subsequently termed that gosling i have made an eagle 
 send division sire replied berthier who knew all the divisions regiments and battalions by heart 
 napoleon nodded assent 
 the adjutant galloped to division and a few minutes later the young guards stationed behind the knoll moved forward napoleon gazed silently in that direction 
 no he suddenly said to berthier i send claparede send division 
 though there was no advantage in sending division instead of and even in obvious inconvenience and delay in stopping claparede and sending friant now the order was carried out exactly napoleon did not notice that in regard to his army he was playing the part of a doctor who hinders by his medicines a role he so justly understood and condemned 
 division disappeared as the others had done into the smoke of the battlefield from all sides adjutants continued to arrive at a gallop and as if by agreement all said the same thing they all asked for reinforcements and all said that the russians were holding their positions and maintaining a hellish fire under which the french army was melting away 
 napoleon sat on a campstool wrapped in thought 
 m de beausset the man so fond of travel having fasted since morning came up to the emperor and ventured respectfully to suggest lunch to his majesty 
 i hope i may now congratulate your majesty on a victory said he 
 napoleon silently shook his head in negation assuming the negation to refer only to the victory and not to the lunch m de beausset ventured with respectful jocularity to remark that there is no reason for not having lunch when one can get it 
 go away exclaimed napoleon suddenly and morosely and turned aside 
 a beatific smile of regret repentance and ecstasy beamed on m de face and he glided away to the other generals 
 napoleon was experiencing a feeling of depression like that of an gambler who after recklessly flinging money about and always winning suddenly just when he has calculated all the chances of the game finds that the more he considers his play the more surely he loses 
 his troops were the same his generals the same the same preparations had been made the same dispositions and the same proclamation courte et energique he himself was still the same he knew that and knew that he was now even more experienced and skillful than before even the enemy was the same as at austerlitz and friedland yet the terrible stroke of his arm had supernaturally become impotent 
 all the old methods that had been unfailingly crowned with success the concentration of batteries on one point an attack by reserves to break the line and a cavalry attack by the men of iron all these methods had already been employed yet not only was there no victory but from all sides came the same news of generals killed and wounded of reinforcements needed of the impossibility of driving back the russians and of disorganization among his own troops 
 formerly after he had given two or three orders and uttered a few phrases marshals and adjutants had come galloping up with congratulations and happy faces announcing the trophies taken the corps of prisoners bundles of enemy eagles and standards cannon and stores and murat had only begged leave to loose the cavalry to gather in the baggage wagons so it had been at lodi marengo arcola jena austerlitz wagram and so on but now something strange was happening to his troops 
 despite news of the capture of the fleches napoleon saw that this was not the same not at all the same as what had happened in his former battles he saw that what he was feeling was felt by all the men about him experienced in the art of war all their faces looked dejected and they all shunned one eyes only a de beausset could fail to grasp the meaning of what was happening 
 but napoleon with his long experience of war well knew the meaning of a battle not gained by the attacking side in eight hours after all efforts had been expended he knew that it was a lost battle and that the least accident might now with the fight balanced on such a strained center destroy him and his army 
 when he ran his mind over the whole of this strange russian campaign in which not one battle had been won and in which not a flag or cannon or army corps had been captured in two months when he looked at the concealed depression on the faces around him and heard reports of the russians still holding their ground a terrible feeling like a nightmare took possession of him and all the unlucky accidents that might destroy him occurred to his mind the russians might fall on his left wing might break through his center he himself might be killed by a stray cannon ball all this was possible in former battles he had only considered the possibilities of success but now innumerable unlucky chances presented themselves and he expected them all yes it was like a dream in which a man fancies that a ruffian is coming to attack him and raises his arm to strike that ruffian a terrible blow which he knows should annihilate him but then feels that his arm drops powerless and limp like a rag and the horror of unavoidable destruction seizes him in his helplessness 
 the news that the russians were attacking the left flank of the french army aroused that horror in napoleon he sat silently on a campstool below the knoll with head bowed and elbows on his knees berthier approached and suggested that they should ride along the line to ascertain the position of affairs 
 what what do you say asked napoleon yes tell them to bring me my horse 
 he mounted and rode toward semenovsk 
 amid the powder smoke slowly dispersing over the whole space through which napoleon rode horses and men were lying in pools of blood singly or in heaps neither napoleon nor any of his generals had ever before seen such horrors or so many slain in such a small area the roar of guns that had not ceased for ten hours wearied the ear and gave a peculiar significance to the spectacle as music does to tableaux vivants napoleon rode up the high ground at semenovsk and through the smoke saw ranks of men in uniforms of a color unfamiliar to him they were russians 
 the russians stood in serried ranks behind semenovsk village and its knoll and their guns boomed incessantly along their line and sent forth clouds of smoke it was no longer a battle it was a continuous slaughter which could be of no avail either to the french or the russians napoleon stopped his horse and again fell into the reverie from which berthier had aroused him he could not stop what was going on before him and around him and was supposed to be directed by him and to depend on him and from its lack of success this affair for the first time seemed to him unnecessary and horrible 
 one of the generals rode up to napoleon and ventured to offer to lead the old guard into action ney and berthier standing near napoleon exchanged looks and smiled contemptuously at this senseless offer 
 napoleon bowed his head and remained silent a long time 
 at eight hundred leagues from france i will not have my guard destroyed he said and turning his horse rode back to shevardino

 generals davout ney and murat who were near that region of fire and sometimes even entered it repeatedly led into it huge masses of troops but contrary to what had always happened in their former battles instead of the news they expected of the flight these orderly masses returned thence as disorganized and terrified mobs the generals them but their numbers constantly decreased in the middle of the day murat sent his adjutant to napoleon to demand reinforcements 
 napoleon sat at the foot of the knoll drinking punch when adjutant galloped up with an assurance that the russians would be routed if his majesty would let him have another division 
 reinforcements said napoleon in a tone of stern surprise looking at the adjutant a handsome lad with long black curls arranged like own as though he did not understand his words 
 reinforcements thought napoleon to himself how can they need reinforcements when they already have half the army directed against a weak unentrenched russian wing 
 tell the king of naples said he sternly that it is not noon yet and i yet see my chessboard clearly go 
 the handsome boy adjutant with the long hair sighed deeply without removing his hand from his hat and galloped back to where men were being slaughtered 
 napoleon rose and having summoned caulaincourt and berthier began talking to them about matters unconnected with the battle 
 in the midst of this conversation which was beginning to interest napoleon eyes turned to look at a general with a suite who was galloping toward the knoll on a lathering horse it was belliard having dismounted he went up to the emperor with rapid strides and in a loud voice began boldly demonstrating the necessity of sending reinforcements he swore on his honor that the russians were lost if the emperor would give another division 
 napoleon shrugged his shoulders and continued to pace up and down without replying belliard began talking loudly and eagerly to the generals of the suite around him 
 you are very fiery belliard said napoleon when he again came up to the general in the heat of a battle it is easy to make a mistake go and have another look and then come back to me 
 before belliard was out of sight a messenger from another part of the battlefield galloped up 
 now then what do you want asked napoleon in the tone of a man irritated at being continually disturbed 
 sire the prince began the adjutant 
 asks for reinforcements said napoleon with an angry gesture 
 the adjutant bent his head affirmatively and began to report but the emperor turned from him took a couple of steps stopped came back and called berthier 
 we must give reserves he said moving his arms slightly apart who do you think should be sent there he asked of berthier whom he subsequently termed that gosling i have made an eagle 
 send division sire replied berthier who knew all the divisions regiments and battalions by heart 
 napoleon nodded assent 
 the adjutant galloped to division and a few minutes later the young guards stationed behind the knoll moved forward napoleon gazed silently in that direction 
 no he suddenly said to berthier i send claparede send division 
 though there was no advantage in sending division instead of and even in obvious inconvenience and delay in stopping claparede and sending friant now the order was carried out exactly napoleon did not notice that in regard to his army he was playing the part of a doctor who hinders by his medicines a role he so justly understood and condemned 
 division disappeared as the others had done into the smoke of the battlefield from all sides adjutants continued to arrive at a gallop and as if by agreement all said the same thing they all asked for reinforcements and all said that the russians were holding their positions and maintaining a hellish fire under which the french army was melting away 
 napoleon sat on a campstool wrapped in thought 
 m de beausset the man so fond of travel having fasted since morning came up to the emperor and ventured respectfully to suggest lunch to his majesty 
 i hope i may now congratulate your majesty on a victory said he 
 napoleon silently shook his head in negation assuming the negation to refer only to the victory and not to the lunch m de beausset ventured with respectful jocularity to remark that there is no reason for not having lunch when one can get it 
 go away exclaimed napoleon suddenly and morosely and turned aside 
 a beatific smile of regret repentance and ecstasy beamed on m de face and he glided away to the other generals 
 napoleon was experiencing a feeling of depression like that of an gambler who after recklessly flinging money about and always winning suddenly just when he has calculated all the chances of the game finds that the more he considers his play the more surely he loses 
 his troops were the same his generals the same the same preparations had been made the same dispositions and the same proclamation courte et energique he himself was still the same he knew that and knew that he was now even more experienced and skillful than before even the enemy was the same as at austerlitz and friedland yet the terrible stroke of his arm had supernaturally become impotent 
 all the old methods that had been unfailingly crowned with success the concentration of batteries on one point an attack by reserves to break the line and a cavalry attack by the men of iron all these methods had already been employed yet not only was there no victory but from all sides came the same news of generals killed and wounded of reinforcements needed of the impossibility of driving back the russians and of disorganization among his own troops 
 formerly after he had given two or three orders and uttered a few phrases marshals and adjutants had come galloping up with congratulations and happy faces announcing the trophies taken the corps of prisoners bundles of enemy eagles and standards cannon and stores and murat had only begged leave to loose the cavalry to gather in the baggage wagons so it had been at lodi marengo arcola jena austerlitz wagram and so on but now something strange was happening to his troops 
 despite news of the capture of the fleches napoleon saw that this was not the same not at all the same as what had happened in his former battles he saw that what he was feeling was felt by all the men about him experienced in the art of war all their faces looked dejected and they all shunned one eyes only a de beausset could fail to grasp the meaning of what was happening 
 but napoleon with his long experience of war well knew the meaning of a battle not gained by the attacking side in eight hours after all efforts had been expended he knew that it was a lost battle and that the least accident might now with the fight balanced on such a strained center destroy him and his army 
 when he ran his mind over the whole of this strange russian campaign in which not one battle had been won and in which not a flag or cannon or army corps had been captured in two months when he looked at the concealed depression on the faces around him and heard reports of the russians still holding their ground a terrible feeling like a nightmare took possession of him and all the unlucky accidents that might destroy him occurred to his mind the russians might fall on his left wing might break through his center he himself might be killed by a stray cannon ball all this was possible in former battles he had only considered the possibilities of success but now innumerable unlucky chances presented themselves and he expected them all yes it was like a dream in which a man fancies that a ruffian is coming to attack him and raises his arm to strike that ruffian a terrible blow which he knows should annihilate him but then feels that his arm drops powerless and limp like a rag and the horror of unavoidable destruction seizes him in his helplessness 
 the news that the russians were attacking the left flank of the french army aroused that horror in napoleon he sat silently on a campstool below the knoll with head bowed and elbows on his knees berthier approached and suggested that they should ride along the line to ascertain the position of affairs 
 what what do you say asked napoleon yes tell them to bring me my horse 
 he mounted and rode toward semenovsk 
 amid the powder smoke slowly dispersing over the whole space through which napoleon rode horses and men were lying in pools of blood singly or in heaps neither napoleon nor any of his generals had ever before seen such horrors or so many slain in such a small area the roar of guns that had not ceased for ten hours wearied the ear and gave a peculiar significance to the spectacle as music does to tableaux vivants napoleon rode up the high ground at semenovsk and through the smoke saw ranks of men in uniforms of a color unfamiliar to him they were russians

 night had fully come 
 this lad was pale thin clad in rags with linen trousers in the month of february and was singing at the top of his voice 
 at the corner of the rue du a bent old woman was rummaging in a heap of refuse by the light of a street lantern the child jostled her as he passed then recoiled exclaiming 
 hello 
 and i took it for an enormous enormous dog 
 he pronounced the word enormous the second time with a jeering swell of the voice which might be tolerably well represented by capitals an enormous enormous dog 
 the old woman straightened herself up in a fury 
 nasty brat she grumbled 
 if i been bending over i know well where i would have planted my foot on you 
 the boy was already far away 
 kisss kisss he cried 
 after that i think i was mistaken 
 the old woman choking with indignation now rose completely upright and the red gleam of the lantern fully lighted up her livid face all hollowed into angles and wrinkles with meeting the corners of her mouth 
 her body was lost in the darkness and only her head was visible one would have pronounced her a mask of decrepitude carved out by a light from the night 
 the boy surveyed her 
 madame said he does not possess that style of beauty which pleases me 
 he then pursued his road and resumed his song

 at the end of these three lines he paused 
 he had arrived in front of no and finding the door fastened he began to assault it with resounding and heroic kicks which betrayed rather the shoes that he was wearing than the feet which he owned

 on the bench where pierre had seen him in the morning sat kutuzov his gray head hanging his heavy body relaxed he gave no orders but only assented to or dissented from what others suggested 
 yes yes do that he replied to various proposals yes yes go dear boy and have a look he would say to one or another of those about him or no better wait he listened to the reports that were brought him and gave directions when his subordinates demanded that of him but when listening to the reports it seemed as if he were not interested in the import of the words spoken but rather in something else in the expression of face and tone of voice of those who were reporting by long years of military experience he knew and with the wisdom of age understood that it is impossible for one man to direct hundreds of thousands of others struggling with death and he knew that the result of a battle is decided not by the orders of a commander in chief nor the place where the troops are stationed nor by the number of cannon or of slaughtered men but by that intangible force called the spirit of the army and he watched this force and guided it in as far as that was in his power 
 general expression was one of concentrated quiet attention and his face wore a strained look as if he found it difficult to master the fatigue of his old and feeble body 
 at eleven they brought him news that the fleches captured by the french had been retaken but that prince bagration was wounded kutuzov groaned and swayed his head 
 ride over to prince peter ivanovich and find out about it exactly he said to one of his adjutants and then turned to the duke of wurttemberg who was standing behind him 
 will your highness please take command of the first army 
 soon after the departure before he could possibly have reached semenovsk his adjutant came back from him and told kutuzov that the duke asked for more troops 
 kutuzov made a grimace and sent an order to dokhturov to take over the command of the first army and a request to the duke whom he said he could not spare at such an important moment to return to him when they brought him news that murat had been taken prisoner and the staff officers congratulated him kutuzov smiled 
 wait a little gentlemen said he the battle is won and there is nothing extraordinary in the capture of murat still it is better to wait before we rejoice 
 but he sent an adjutant to take the news round the army 
 when scherbinin came galloping from the left flank with news that the french had captured the fleches and the village of semenovsk kutuzov guessing by the sounds of the battle and by looks that the news was bad rose as if to stretch his legs and taking arm led him aside 
 go my dear fellow he said to ermolov and see whether something be done 
 kutuzov was in gorki near the center of the russian position the attack directed by napoleon against our left flank had been several times repulsed in the center the french had not got beyond borodino and on their left flank cavalry had put the french to flight 
 toward three the french attacks ceased on the faces of all who came from the field of battle and of those who stood around him kutuzov noticed an expression of extreme tension he was satisfied with the success a success exceeding his expectations but the old strength was failing him several times his head dropped low as if it were falling and he dozed off dinner was brought him 
 adjutant general wolzogen the man who when riding past prince andrew had said the war should be extended widely and whom bagration so detested rode up while kutuzov was at dinner wolzogen had come from barclay de tolly to report on the progress of affairs on the left flank the sagacious barclay de tolly seeing crowds of wounded men running back and the disordered rear of the army weighed all the circumstances concluded that the battle was lost and sent his favorite officer to the commander in chief with that news 
 kutuzov was chewing a piece of roast chicken with difficulty and glanced at wolzogen with eyes that brightened under their puckering lids 
 wolzogen nonchalantly stretching his legs approached kutuzov with a smile on his lips scarcely touching the peak of his cap 
 he treated his serene highness with a somewhat affected nonchalance intended to show that as a highly trained military man he left it to russians to make an idol of this useless old man but that he knew whom he was dealing with der alte herr as in their own set the germans called kutuzov is making himself very comfortable thought wolzogen and looking severely at the dishes in front of kutuzov he began to report to the old gentleman the position of affairs on the left flank as barclay had ordered him to and as he himself had seen and understood it 
 all the points of our position are in the hands and we cannot dislodge them for lack of troops the men are running away and it is impossible to stop them he reported 
 kutuzov ceased chewing and fixed an astonished gaze on wolzogen as if not understand what was said to him wolzogen noticing the old agitation said with a smile 
 i have not considered it right to conceal from your serene highness what i have seen the troops are in complete disorder 
 you have seen you have seen kutuzov shouted frowning and rising quickly he went up to wolzogen 
 how how dare you he shouted choking and making a threatening gesture with his trembling arms how dare you sir say that to me you know nothing about it tell general barclay from me that his information is incorrect and that the real course of the battle is better known to me the commander in chief than to him 
 wolzogen was about to make a rejoinder but kutuzov interrupted him 
 the enemy has been repulsed on the left and defeated on the right flank if you have seen amiss sir do not allow yourself to say what you know be so good as to ride to general barclay and inform him of my firm intention to attack the enemy tomorrow said kutuzov sternly 
 all were silent and the only sound audible was the heavy breathing of the panting old general 
 they are repulsed everywhere for which i thank god and our brave army the enemy is beaten and tomorrow we shall drive him from the sacred soil of russia said kutuzov crossing himself and he suddenly sobbed as his eyes filled with tears 
 wolzogen shrugging his shoulders and curling his lips stepped silently aside marveling at the old conceited stupidity 
 ah here he is my hero said kutuzov to a portly handsome general who was just ascending the knoll 
 this was raevski who had spent the whole day at the most important part of the field of borodino 
 raevski reported that the troops were firmly holding their ground and that the french no longer ventured to attack 
 after hearing him kutuzov said in french 
 then you do not think like some others that we must retreat 
 on the contrary your highness in indecisive actions it is always the most stubborn who remain victors replied raevski and in my opinion 
 kaysarov kutuzov called to his adjutant sit down and write out the order of the day for tomorrow and you he continued addressing another ride along the line and that tomorrow we attack 
 while kutuzov was talking to raevski and dictating the order of the day wolzogen returned from barclay and said that general barclay wished to have written confirmation of the order the field marshal had given 
 kutuzov without looking at wolzogen gave directions for the order to be written out which the former commander in chief to avoid personal responsibility very judiciously wished to receive 
 and by means of that mysterious indefinable bond which maintains throughout an army one and the same temper known as the spirit of the army and which constitutes the sinew of war words his order for a battle next day immediately became known from one end of the army to the other 
 it was far from being the same words or the same order that reached the farthest links of that chain the tales passing from mouth to mouth at different ends of the army did not even resemble what kutuzov had said but the sense of his words spread everywhere because what he said was not the outcome of cunning calculations but of a feeling that lay in the commander in soul as in that of every russian 
 and on learning that tomorrow they were to attack the enemy and hearing from the highest quarters a confirmation of what they wanted to believe the exhausted wavering men felt comforted and inspirited

 chapter i 
 
 well cut 
 and the two years which are immediately connected with the revolution of july form one of the most peculiar and striking moments of history 
 these two years rise like two mountains midway between those which precede and those which follow them 
 they have a revolutionary grandeur 
 precipices are to be distinguished there the social masses the very assizes of civilization the solid group of superposed and adhering interests the profiles of the ancient french formation appear and disappear in them every instant athwart the storm clouds of systems of passions and of theories these appearances and disappearances have been designated as movement and resistance 
 at intervals truth that daylight of the human soul can be descried shining there 
 this remarkable epoch is decidedly circumscribed and is beginning to be sufficiently distant from us to allow of our grasping the principal lines even at the present day 
 we shall make the attempt 
 the restoration had been one of those intermediate phases hard to define in which there is fatigue buzzing murmurs sleep tumult and which are nothing else than the arrival of a great nation at a 
 these epochs are peculiar and mislead the politicians who desire to convert them to profit 
 in the beginning the nation asks nothing but repose it thirsts for but one thing peace it has but one ambition to be small 
 which is the translation of remaining tranquil of great events great hazards great adventures great men thank god we have seen enough we have them heaped higher than our heads 
 we would exchange caesar for prusias and napoleon for the king of yvetot what a good little king was he

 guarantees are the same to facts that repose is to men

 it did not perceive that it also lay in that hand which had removed napoleon 
 it thought that it had roots because it was the past 
 it was mistaken it formed a part of the past but the whole past was france the roots of french society were not fixed in the bourbons but in the nations

 and the two years which are immediately connected with the revolution of july form one of the most peculiar and striking moments of history 
 these two years rise like two mountains midway between those which precede and those which follow them 
 they have a revolutionary grandeur 
 precipices are to be distinguished there the social masses the very assizes of civilization the solid group of superposed and adhering interests the profiles of the ancient french formation appear and disappear in them every instant athwart the storm clouds of systems of passions and of theories these appearances and disappearances have been designated as movement and resistance 
 at intervals truth that daylight of the human soul can be descried shining there 
 this remarkable epoch is decidedly circumscribed and is beginning to be sufficiently distant from us to allow of our grasping the principal lines even at the present day 
 we shall make the attempt 
 the restoration had been one of those intermediate phases hard to define in which there is fatigue buzzing murmurs sleep tumult and which are nothing else than the arrival of a great nation at a 
 these epochs are peculiar and mislead the politicians who desire to convert them to profit 
 in the beginning the nation asks nothing but repose it thirsts for but one thing peace it has but one ambition to be small 
 which is the translation of remaining tranquil of great events great hazards great adventures great men thank god we have seen enough we have them heaped higher than our heads 
 we would exchange caesar for prusias and napoleon for the king of yvetot what a good little king was he 
 we have marched since daybreak we have reached the evening of a long and toilsome day we have made our first change with mirabeau the second with robespierre the third with bonaparte we are worn out

 chapter xxxvi 
 
 prince regiment was among the reserves which till after one were stationed inactive behind semenovsk under heavy artillery fire toward two the regiment having already lost more than two hundred men was moved forward into a trampled oatfield in the gap between semenovsk and the knoll battery where thousands of men perished that day and on which an intense concentrated fire from several hundred enemy guns was directed between one and two 
 without moving from that spot or firing a single shot the regiment here lost another third of its men from in front and especially from the right in the unlifting smoke the guns boomed and out of the mysterious domain of smoke that overlay the whole space in front quick hissing cannon balls and slow whistling shells flew unceasingly at times as if to allow them a respite a quarter of an hour passed during which the cannon balls and shells all flew overhead but sometimes several men were torn from the regiment in a minute and the slain were continually being dragged away and the wounded carried off 
 with each fresh blow less and less chance of life remained for those not yet killed the regiment stood in columns of battalion three hundred paces apart but nevertheless the men were always in one and the same mood all alike were taciturn and morose talk was rarely heard in the ranks and it ceased altogether every time the thud of a successful shot and the cry of stretchers was heard most of the time by their officers order the men sat on the ground one having taken off his shako carefully loosened the gathers of its lining and drew them tight again another rubbing some dry clay between his palms polished his bayonet another fingered the strap and pulled the buckle of his bandolier while another smoothed and refolded his leg bands and put his boots on again some built little houses of the tufts in the plowed ground or plaited baskets from the straw in the cornfield all seemed fully absorbed in these pursuits when men were killed or wounded when rows of stretchers went past when some troops retreated and when great masses of the enemy came into view through the smoke no one paid any attention to these things but when our artillery or cavalry advanced or some of our infantry were seen to move forward words of approval were heard on all sides but the liveliest attention was attracted by occurrences quite apart from and unconnected with the battle it was as if the minds of these morally exhausted men found relief in everyday commonplace occurrences a battery of artillery was passing in front of the regiment the horse of an ammunition cart put its leg over a trace hey look at the trace horse get her leg out fall ah they see it came identical shouts from the ranks all along the regiment another time general attention was attracted by a small brown dog coming heaven knows whence which trotted in a preoccupied manner in front of the ranks with tail stiffly erect till suddenly a shell fell close by when it yelped tucked its tail between its legs and darted aside yells and shrieks of laughter rose from the whole regiment but such distractions lasted only a moment and for eight hours the men had been inactive without food in constant fear of death and their pale and gloomy faces grew ever paler and gloomier 
 prince andrew pale and gloomy like everyone in the regiment paced up and down from the border of one patch to another at the edge of the meadow beside an oatfield with head bowed and arms behind his back there was nothing for him to do and no orders to be given everything went on of itself the killed were dragged from the front the wounded carried away and the ranks closed up if any soldiers ran to the rear they returned immediately and hastily at first prince andrew considering it his duty to rouse the courage of the men and to set them an example walked about among the ranks but he soon became convinced that this was unnecessary and that there was nothing he could teach them all the powers of his soul as of every soldier there were unconsciously bent on avoiding the contemplation of the horrors of their situation he walked along the meadow dragging his feet rustling the grass and gazing at the dust that covered his boots now he took big strides trying to keep to the footprints left on the meadow by the mowers then he counted his steps calculating how often he must walk from one strip to another to walk a mile then he stripped the flowers from the wormwood that grew along a boundary rut rubbed them in his palms and smelled their pungent sweetly bitter scent nothing remained of the previous thoughts he thought of nothing he listened with weary ears to the sounds distinguishing the whistle of flying projectiles from the booming of the reports glanced at the tiresomely familiar faces of the men of the first battalion and waited here it comes this one is coming our way again he thought listening to an approaching whistle in the hidden region of smoke one another again it has hit he stopped and looked at the ranks no it has gone over but this one has hit and again he started trying to reach the boundary strip in sixteen paces a whizz and a thud five paces from him a cannon ball tore up the dry earth and disappeared a chill ran down his back again he glanced at the ranks probably many had been hit a large crowd had gathered near the second battalion 
 adjutant he shouted order them not to crowd together 
 the adjutant having obeyed this instruction approached prince andrew from the other side a battalion commander rode up 
 look out came a frightened cry from a soldier and like a bird whirring in rapid flight and alighting on the ground a shell dropped with little noise within two steps of prince andrew and close to the battalion horse the horse first regardless of whether it was right or wrong to show fear snorted reared almost throwing the major and galloped aside the terror infected the men 
 lie down cried the adjutant throwing himself flat on the ground 
 prince andrew hesitated the smoking shell spun like a top between him and the prostrate adjutant near a wormwood plant between the field and the meadow 
 can this be death thought prince andrew looking with a quite new envious glance at the grass the wormwood and the streamlet of smoke that curled up from the rotating black ball i cannot i do not wish to die i love life i love this grass this earth this air he thought this and at the same time remembered that people were looking at him 
 shameful sir he said to the adjutant what 
 he did not finish speaking at one and the same moment came the sound of an explosion a whistle of splinters as from a breaking window frame a suffocating smell of powder and prince andrew started to one side raising his arm and fell on his chest several officers ran up to him from the right side of his abdomen blood was welling out making a large stain on the grass 
 the militiamen with stretchers who were called up stood behind the officers prince andrew lay on his chest with his face in the grass breathing heavily and noisily 
 what are you waiting for come along 
 the peasants went up and took him by his shoulders and legs but he moaned piteously and exchanging looks they set him down again 
 pick him up lift him all the same cried someone 
 they again took him by the shoulders and laid him on the stretcher 
 ah god my god what is it the stomach that means death my god voices among the officers were heard saying 
 it flew a breadth past my ear said the adjutant 
 the peasants adjusting the stretcher to their shoulders started hurriedly along the path they had trodden down to the dressing station 
 keep in step ah those peasants shouted an officer seizing by their shoulders and checking the peasants who were walking unevenly and jolting the stretcher 
 get into step fedor i say fedor said the foremost peasant 
 now right said the one behind joyfully when he had got into step 
 your excellency eh prince said the trembling voice of timokhin who had run up and was looking down on the stretcher 
 prince andrew opened his eyes and looked up at the speaker from the stretcher into which his head had sunk deep and again his eyelids drooped 
 the militiamen carried prince andrew to dressing station by the wood where wagons were stationed the dressing station consisted of three tents with flaps turned back pitched at the edge of a birch wood in the wood wagons and horses were standing the horses were eating oats from their movable troughs and sparrows flew down and pecked the grains that fell some crows scenting blood flew among the birch trees cawing impatiently around the tents over more than five acres bloodstained men in various garbs stood sat or lay around the wounded stood crowds of soldier with dismal and attentive faces whom the officers keeping order tried in vain to drive from the spot disregarding the officers orders the soldiers stood leaning against their stretchers and gazing intently as if trying to comprehend the difficult problem of what was taking place before them from the tents came now loud angry cries and now plaintive groans occasionally dressers ran out to fetch water or to point out those who were to be brought in next the wounded men awaiting their turn outside the tents groaned sighed wept screamed swore or asked for vodka some were delirious prince bearers stepping over the wounded who had not yet been bandaged took him as a regimental commander close up to one of the tents and there stopped awaiting instructions prince andrew opened his eyes and for a long time could not make out what was going on around him he remembered the meadow the wormwood the field the whirling black ball and his sudden rush of passionate love of life two steps from him leaning against a branch and talking loudly and attracting general attention stood a tall handsome noncommissioned officer with a bandaged head he had been wounded in the head and leg by bullets around him eagerly listening to his talk a crowd of wounded and was gathered 
 we kicked him out from there so that he chucked everything we grabbed the king himself cried he looking around him with eyes that glittered with fever if only reserves had come up just then lads there have been nothing left of him i tell you surely 
 like all the others near the speaker prince andrew looked at him with shining eyes and experienced a sense of comfort but it all the same now thought he and what will be there and what has there been here why was i so reluctant to part with life there was something in this life i did not and do not understand

 the peasants went up and took him by his shoulders and legs but he moaned piteously and exchanging looks they set him down again 
 pick him up lift him all the same cried someone 
 they again took him by the shoulders and laid him on the stretcher 
 ah god my god what is it the stomach that means death my god voices among the officers were heard saying 
 it flew a breadth past my ear said the adjutant 
 the peasants adjusting the stretcher to their shoulders started hurriedly along the path they had trodden down to the dressing station 
 keep in step ah those peasants shouted an officer seizing by their shoulders and checking the peasants who were walking unevenly and jolting the stretcher 
 get into step fedor i say fedor said the foremost peasant 
 now right said the one behind joyfully when he had got into step 
 your excellency eh prince said the trembling voice of timokhin who had run up and was looking down on the stretcher 
 prince andrew opened his eyes and looked up at the speaker from the stretcher into which his head had sunk deep and again his eyelids drooped 
 the militiamen carried prince andrew to dressing station by the wood where wagons were stationed the dressing station consisted of three tents with flaps turned back pitched at the edge of a birch wood in the wood wagons and horses were standing the horses were eating oats from their movable troughs and sparrows flew down and pecked the grains that fell some crows scenting blood flew among the birch trees cawing impatiently around the tents over more than five acres bloodstained men in various garbs stood sat or lay around the wounded stood crowds of soldier with dismal and attentive faces whom the officers keeping order tried in vain to drive from the spot disregarding the officers orders the soldiers stood leaning against their stretchers and gazing intently as if trying to comprehend the difficult problem of what was taking place before them from the tents came now loud angry cries and now plaintive groans occasionally dressers ran out to fetch water or to point out those who were to be brought in next the wounded men awaiting their turn outside the tents groaned sighed wept screamed swore or asked for vodka some were delirious prince bearers stepping over the wounded who had not yet been bandaged took him as a regimental commander close up to one of the tents and there stopped awaiting instructions prince andrew opened his eyes and for a long time could not make out what was going on around him he remembered the meadow the wormwood the field the whirling black ball and his sudden rush of passionate love of life two steps from him leaning against a branch and talking loudly and attracting general attention stood a tall handsome noncommissioned officer with a bandaged head he had been wounded in the head and leg by bullets around him eagerly listening to his talk a crowd of wounded and was gathered 
 we kicked him out from there so that he chucked everything we grabbed the king himself cried he looking around him with eyes that glittered with fever if only reserves had come up just then lads there have been nothing left of him i tell you surely 
 like all the others near the speaker prince andrew looked at him with shining eyes and experienced a sense of comfort but it all the same now thought he and what will be there and what has there been here why was i so reluctant to part with life there was something in this life i did not and do not understand

 one of the doctors came out of the tent in a bloodstained apron holding a cigar between the thumb and little finger of one of his small bloodstained hands so as not to smear it he raised his head and looked about him but above the level of the wounded men he evidently wanted a little respite after turning his head from right to left for some time he sighed and looked down 
 all right immediately he replied to a dresser who pointed prince andrew out to him and he told them to carry him into the tent 
 murmurs arose among the wounded who were waiting 
 it seems that even in the next world only the gentry are to have a chance remarked one 
 prince andrew was carried in and laid on a table that had only just been cleared and which a dresser was washing down prince andrew could not make out distinctly what was in that tent the pitiful groans from all sides and the torturing pain in his thigh stomach and back distracted him all he saw about him merged into a general impression of naked bleeding human bodies that seemed to fill the whole of the low tent as a few weeks previously on that hot august day such bodies had filled the dirty pond beside the smolensk road yes it was the same flesh the same chair a canon the sight of which had even then filled him with horror as by a presentiment 
 there were three operating tables in the tent two were occupied and on the third they placed prince andrew for a little while he was left alone and involuntarily witnessed what was taking place on the other two tables on the nearest one sat a tartar probably a cossack judging by the uniform thrown down beside him four soldiers were holding him and a spectacled doctor was cutting into his muscular brown back 
 ooh ooh ooh grunted the tartar and suddenly lifting up his swarthy face with its high cheekbones and baring his white teeth he began to wriggle and twitch his body and utter piercing ringing and prolonged yells on the other table round which many people were crowding a tall man lay on his back with his head thrown back his curly hair its color and the shape of his head seemed strangely familiar to prince andrew several dressers were pressing on his chest to hold him down one large white plump leg twitched rapidly all the time with a feverish tremor the man was sobbing and choking convulsively two doctors one of whom was pale and trembling were silently doing something to this other gory leg when he had finished with the tartar whom they covered with an overcoat the spectacled doctor came up to prince andrew wiping his hands 
 he glanced at prince face and quickly turned away 
 undress him what are you waiting for he cried angrily to the dressers 
 his very first remotest recollections of childhood came back to prince mind when the dresser with sleeves rolled up began hastily to undo the buttons of his clothes and undressed him the doctor bent down over the wound felt it and sighed deeply then he made a sign to someone and the torturing pain in his abdomen caused prince andrew to lose consciousness when he came to himself the splintered portions of his thighbone had been extracted the torn flesh cut away and the wound bandaged water was being sprinkled on his face as soon as prince andrew opened his eyes the doctor bent over kissed him silently on the lips and hurried away 
 after the sufferings he had been enduring prince andrew enjoyed a blissful feeling such as he had not experienced for a long time all the best and happiest moments of his life especially his earliest childhood when he used to be undressed and put to bed and when leaning over him his nurse sang him to sleep and he burying his head in the pillow felt happy in the mere consciousness of life returned to his memory not merely as something past but as something present 
 the doctors were busily engaged with the wounded man the shape of whose head seemed familiar to prince andrew they were lifting him up and trying to quiet him 
 show it to me oh ooh oh oh ooh his frightened moans could be heard subdued by suffering and broken by sobs 
 hearing those moans prince andrew wanted andrew wanted to weep whether because he was dying without glory or because he was sorry to part with life or because of those memories of a childhood that could not return or because he was suffering and others were suffering and that man near him was groaning so piteously he felt like weeping childlike kindly and almost happy tears 
 the wounded man was shown his amputated leg stained with clotted blood and with the boot still on 
 oh oh ooh he sobbed like a woman 
 the doctor who had been standing beside him preventing prince andrew from seeing his face moved away 
 my god what is this why is he here said prince andrew to himself 
 in the miserable sobbing enfeebled man whose leg had just been amputated he recognized anatole kuragin men were supporting him in their arms and offering him a glass of water but his trembling swollen lips could not grasp its rim anatole was sobbing painfully yes it is he yes that man is somehow closely and painfully connected with me thought prince andrew not yet clearly grasping what he saw before him what is the connection of that man with my childhood and life he asked himself without finding an answer and suddenly a new unexpected memory from that realm of pure and loving childhood presented itself to him he remembered natasha as he had seen her for the first time at the ball in with her slender neck and arms and with a frightened happy face ready for rapture and love and tenderness for her stronger and more vivid than ever awoke in his soul he now remembered the connection that existed between himself and this man who was dimly gazing at him through tears that filled his swollen eyes he remembered everything and ecstatic pity and love for that man overflowed his happy heart 
 prince andrew could no longer restrain himself and wept tender loving tears for his fellow men for himself and for his own and their errors 
 compassion love of our brothers for those who love us and for those who hate us love of our enemies yes that love which god preached on earth and which princess mary taught me and i did not understand that is what made me sorry to part with life that is what remained for me had i lived but now it is too late i know it

 louis philippe 
 revolutions have a terrible arm and a happy hand they strike firmly and choose well 
 even incomplete even debased and abused and reduced to the state of a junior revolution like the revolution of they nearly always retain sufficient providential lucidity to prevent them from falling amiss 
 their eclipse is never an abdication 
 nevertheless let us not boast too loudly revolutions also may be deceived and grave errors have been seen 
 let us return to 
 in its deviation had good luck in the establishment which entitled itself order after the revolution had been cut short the king amounted to more than royalty louis philippe was a rare man 
 the son of a father to whom history will accord certain attenuating circumstances but also as worthy of esteem as that father had been of blame possessing all private virtues and many public virtues careful of his health of his fortune of his person of his affairs knowing the value of a minute and not always the value of a year sober serene peaceable patient a good man and a good prince sleeping with his wife and having in his palace lackeys charged with the duty of showing the conjugal bed to the bourgeois an ostentation of the regular which had become useful after the former illegitimate displays of the elder branch knowing all the languages of europe and what is more rare all the languages of all interests and speaking them an admirable representative of the middle class but outstripping it and in every way greater than it possessing excellent sense while appreciating the blood from which he had sprung counting most of all on his intrinsic worth and on the question of his race very particular declaring himself orleans and not bourbon thoroughly the first prince of the blood royal while he was still only a serene highness but a frank bourgeois from the day he became king diffuse in public concise in private reputed but not proved to be a miser at bottom one of those economists who are readily prodigal at their own fancy or duty lettered but not very sensitive to letters a gentleman but not a chevalier simple calm and strong adored by his family and his household a fascinating talker an undeceived statesman inwardly cold dominated by immediate interest always governing at the shortest range incapable of rancor and of gratitude making use without mercy of superiority on mediocrity clever in getting parliamentary majorities to put in the wrong those mysterious unanimities which mutter dully under thrones unreserved sometimes imprudent in his lack of reserve but with marvellous address in that imprudence fertile in expedients in countenances in masks making france fear europe and europe france incontestably fond of his country but preferring his family assuming more domination than authority and more authority than dignity a disposition which has this unfortunate property that as it turns everything to success it admits of ruse and does not absolutely repudiate baseness but which has this valuable side that it preserves politics from violent shocks the state from fractures and society from catastrophes minute correct vigilant attentive sagacious indefatigable contradicting himself at times and giving himself the lie bold against austria at ancona obstinate against england in spain bombarding antwerp and paying off pritchard singing the marseillaise with conviction inaccessible to despondency to lassitude to the taste for the beautiful and the ideal to daring generosity to utopia to chimeras to wrath to vanity to fear possessing all the forms of personal intrepidity a general at valmy a soldier at jemappes attacked eight times by regicides and always smiling 
 brave as a grenadier courageous as a thinker uneasy only in the face of the chances of a european shaking up and unfitted for great political adventures always ready to risk his life never his work disguising his will in influence in order that he might be obeyed as an intelligence rather than as a king endowed with observation and not with divination not very attentive to minds but knowing men that is to say requiring to see in order to judge prompt and penetrating good sense practical wisdom easy speech prodigious memory drawing incessantly on this memory his only point of resemblance with caesar alexander and napoleon knowing deeds facts details dates proper names ignorant of tendencies passions the diverse geniuses of the crowd the interior aspirations the hidden and obscure uprisings of souls in a word all that can be designated as the invisible currents of consciences accepted by the surface but little in accord with france lower down extricating himself by dint of tact governing too much and not enough his own first minister excellent at creating out of the pettiness of realities an obstacle to the immensity of ideas mingling a genuine creative faculty of civilization of order and organization an indescribable spirit of proceedings and chicanery the founder and lawyer of a dynasty having something of charlemagne and something of an attorney in short a lofty and original figure a prince who understood how to create authority in spite of the uneasiness of france and power in spite of the jealousy of europe 
 louis philippe will be classed among the eminent men of his century and would be ranked among the most illustrious governors of history had he loved glory but a little and if he had had the sentiment of what is great to the same degree as the feeling for what is useful 
 louis philippe had been handsome and in his old age he remained graceful not always approved by the nation he always was so by the masses he pleased 
 he had that gift of charming 
 he lacked majesty he wore no crown although a king and no white hair although an old man his manners belonged to the old regime and his habits to the new a mixture of the noble and the bourgeois which suited louis philippe was transition reigning he had preserved the ancient pronunciation and the ancient orthography which he placed at the service of opinions modern he loved poland and hungary but he wrote les polonois and he pronounced les hongrais 
 he wore the uniform of the national guard like charles x and the ribbon of the legion of honor like napoleon 
 he went a little to chapel not at all to the chase never to the opera incorruptible by sacristans by by this made a part of his bourgeois popularity 
 he had no heart he went out with his umbrella under his arm and this umbrella long formed a part of his aureole 
 he was a bit of a mason a bit of a gardener something of a doctor he bled a postilion who had tumbled from his horse louis philippe no more went about without his lancet than did henri iv 
 without his poniard 
 the royalists jeered at this ridiculous king the first who had ever shed blood with the object of healing 
 for the grievances against louis philippe there is one deduction to be made there is that which accuses royalty that which accuses the reign that which accuses the king three columns which all give different totals 
 democratic right confiscated progress becomes a matter of secondary interest the protests of the street violently repressed military execution of insurrections the rising passed over by arms the rue transnonain the counsels of war the absorption of the real country by the legal country on half shares with three hundred thousand privileged persons these are the deeds of royalty belgium refused algeria too harshly conquered and as in the case of india by the english with more barbarism than civilization the breach of faith to blaye deutz bought pritchard are the doings of the reign the policy which was more domestic than national was the doing of the king 
 as will be seen the proper deduction having been made the charge is decreased 
 this is his great fault he was modest in the name of france 
 whence arises this fault 
 we will state it 
 louis philippe was rather too much of a paternal king that incubation of a family with the object of founding a dynasty is afraid of everything and does not like to be disturbed hence excessive timidity which is displeasing to the people who have the th of july in their civil and austerlitz in their military tradition 
 moreover if we deduct the public duties which require to be fulfilled first of all that deep tenderness of louis philippe towards his family was deserved by the family 
 that domestic group was worthy of admiration 
 virtues there dwelt side by side with talents one of louis daughters marie placed the name of her race among artists as charles had placed it among poets 
 she made of her soul a marble which she named jeanne two of louis daughters elicited from metternich this eulogium 
 they are young people such as are rarely seen and princes such as are never seen 
 this without any dissimulation and also without any exaggeration is the truth about louis philippe 
 to be prince equality to bear in his own person the contradiction of the restoration and the revolution to have that disquieting side of the revolutionary which becomes reassuring in governing power therein lay the fortune of louis philippe in never was there a more complete adaptation of a man to an event the one entered into the other and the incarnation took place louis philippe is made man 
 moreover he had in his favor that great recommendation to the throne exile 
 he had been proscribed a wanderer poor 
 he had lived by his own labor

 louis philippe 
 revolutions have a terrible arm and a happy hand they strike firmly and choose well 
 even incomplete even debased and abused and reduced to the state of a junior revolution like the revolution of they nearly always retain sufficient providential lucidity to prevent them from falling amiss 
 their eclipse is never an abdication 
 nevertheless let us not boast too loudly revolutions also may be deceived and grave errors have been seen 
 let us return to 
 in its deviation had good luck in the establishment which entitled itself order after the revolution had been cut short the king amounted to more than royalty louis philippe was a rare man 
 the son of a father to whom history will accord certain attenuating circumstances but also as worthy of esteem as that father had been of blame possessing all private virtues and many public virtues careful of his health of his fortune of his person of his affairs knowing the value of a minute and not always the value of a year sober serene peaceable patient a good man and a good prince sleeping with his wife and having in his palace lackeys charged with the duty of showing the conjugal bed to the bourgeois an ostentation of the regular which had become useful after the former illegitimate displays of the elder branch knowing all the languages of europe and what is more rare all the languages of all interests and speaking them an admirable representative of the middle class but outstripping it and in every way greater than it possessing excellent sense while appreciating the blood from which he had sprung counting most of all on his intrinsic worth and on the question of his race very particular declaring himself orleans and not bourbon thoroughly the first prince of the blood royal while he was still only a serene highness but a frank bourgeois from the day he became king diffuse in public concise in private reputed but not proved to be a miser at bottom one of those economists who are readily prodigal at their own fancy or duty lettered but not very sensitive to letters a gentleman but not a chevalier simple calm and strong adored by his family and his household a fascinating talker an undeceived statesman inwardly cold dominated by immediate interest always governing at the shortest range incapable of rancor and of gratitude making use without mercy of superiority on mediocrity clever in getting parliamentary majorities to put in the wrong those mysterious unanimities which mutter dully under thrones unreserved sometimes imprudent in his lack of reserve but with marvellous address in that imprudence fertile in expedients in countenances in masks making france fear europe and europe france incontestably fond of his country but preferring his family assuming more domination than authority and more authority than dignity a disposition which has this unfortunate property that as it turns everything to success it admits of ruse and does not absolutely repudiate baseness but which has this valuable side that it preserves politics from violent shocks the state from fractures and society from catastrophes minute correct vigilant attentive sagacious indefatigable contradicting himself at times and giving himself the lie bold against austria at ancona obstinate against england in spain bombarding antwerp and paying off pritchard singing the marseillaise with conviction inaccessible to despondency to lassitude to the taste for the beautiful and the ideal to daring generosity to utopia to chimeras to wrath to vanity to fear possessing all the forms of personal intrepidity a general at valmy a soldier at jemappes attacked eight times by regicides and always smiling 
 brave as a grenadier courageous as a thinker uneasy only in the face of the chances of a european shaking up and unfitted for great political adventures always ready to risk his life never his work disguising his will in influence in order that he might be obeyed as an intelligence rather than as a king endowed with observation and not with divination not very attentive to minds but knowing men that is to say requiring to see in order to judge prompt and penetrating good sense practical wisdom easy speech prodigious memory drawing incessantly on this memory his only point of resemblance with caesar alexander and napoleon knowing deeds facts details dates proper names ignorant of tendencies passions the diverse geniuses of the crowd the interior aspirations the hidden and obscure uprisings of souls in a word all that can be designated as the invisible currents of consciences accepted by the surface but little in accord with france lower down extricating himself by dint of tact governing too much and not enough his own first minister excellent at creating out of the pettiness of realities an obstacle to the immensity of ideas mingling a genuine creative faculty of civilization of order and organization an indescribable spirit of proceedings and chicanery the founder and lawyer of a dynasty having something of charlemagne and something of an attorney in short a lofty and original figure a prince who understood how to create authority in spite of the uneasiness of france and power in spite of the jealousy of europe 
 louis philippe will be classed among the eminent men of his century and would be ranked among the most illustrious governors of history had he loved glory but a little and if he had had the sentiment of what is great to the same degree as the feeling for what is useful 
 louis philippe had been handsome and in his old age he remained graceful not always approved by the nation he always was so by the masses he pleased 
 he had that gift of charming 
 he lacked majesty he wore no crown although a king and no white hair although an old man his manners belonged to the old regime and his habits to the new a mixture of the noble and the bourgeois which suited louis philippe was transition reigning he had preserved the ancient pronunciation and the ancient orthography which he placed at the service of opinions modern he loved poland and hungary but he wrote les polonois and he pronounced les hongrais 
 he wore the uniform of the national guard like charles x and the ribbon of the legion of honor like napoleon 
 he went a little to chapel not at all to the chase never to the opera incorruptible by sacristans by by this made a part of his bourgeois popularity 
 he had no heart he went out with his umbrella under his arm and this umbrella long formed a part of his aureole 
 he was a bit of a mason a bit of a gardener something of a doctor he bled a postilion who had tumbled from his horse louis philippe no more went about without his lancet than did henri iv 
 without his poniard 
 the royalists jeered at this ridiculous king the first who had ever shed blood with the object of healing 
 for the grievances against louis philippe there is one deduction to be made there is that which accuses royalty that which accuses the reign that which accuses the king three columns which all give different totals 
 democratic right confiscated progress becomes a matter of secondary interest the protests of the street violently repressed military execution of insurrections the rising passed over by arms the rue transnonain the counsels of war the absorption of the real country by the legal country on half shares with three hundred thousand privileged persons these are the deeds of royalty belgium refused algeria too harshly conquered and as in the case of india by the english with more barbarism than civilization the breach of faith to blaye deutz bought pritchard are the doings of the reign the policy which was more domestic than national was the doing of the king 
 as will be seen the proper deduction having been made the charge is decreased 
 this is his great fault he was modest in the name of france 
 whence arises this fault 
 we will state it 
 louis philippe was rather too much of a paternal king that incubation of a family with the object of founding a dynasty is afraid of everything and does not like to be disturbed hence excessive timidity which is displeasing to the people who have the th of july in their civil and austerlitz in their military tradition 
 moreover if we deduct the public duties which require to be fulfilled first of all that deep tenderness of louis philippe towards his family was deserved by the family 
 that domestic group was worthy of admiration 
 virtues there dwelt side by side with talents one of louis daughters marie placed the name of her race among artists as charles had placed it among poets 
 she made of her soul a marble which she named jeanne two of louis daughters elicited from metternich this eulogium 
 they are young people such as are rarely seen and princes such as are never seen 
 this without any dissimulation and also without any exaggeration is the truth about louis philippe 
 to be prince equality to bear in his own person the contradiction of the restoration and the revolution to have that disquieting side of the revolutionary which becomes reassuring in governing power therein lay the fortune of louis philippe in never was there a more complete adaptation of a man to an event the one entered into the other and the incarnation took place louis philippe is made man 
 moreover he had in his favor that great recommendation to the throne exile 
 he had been proscribed a wanderer poor 
 he had lived by his own labor 
 in switzerland this heir to the richest princely domains in france had sold an old horse in order to obtain bread 
 at reichenau he gave lessons in mathematics while his sister adelaide did wool work and sewed these souvenirs connected with a king rendered the bourgeoisie enthusiastic 
 he had with his own hands demolished the iron cage of built by louis xi and used by louis xv he was the companion of dumouriez he was the friend of lafayette he had belonged to the jacobins club mirabeau had slapped him on the shoulder danton had said to him 
 young man at the age of four and twenty in being then m de chartres he had witnessed from the depth of a box the trial of louis xvi so well named that poor tyrant 
 the blind clairvoyance of the revolution breaking royalty in the king and the king with royalty did so almost without noticing the man in the fierce crushing of the idea the vast storm of the the public wrath interrogating capet not knowing what to reply the alarming stupefied vacillation by that royal head beneath that sombre breath the relative innocence of all in that catastrophe of those who condemned as well as of the man had looked on those things he had contemplated that giddiness he had seen the centuries appear before the bar of the he had beheld behind louis xvi that unfortunate who was made responsible the terrible culprit the monarchy rise through the shadows and there had lingered in his soul the respectful fear of these immense justices of the populace which are almost as impersonal as the justice of god

 cracks beneath the foundation 
 at the moment when the drama which we are narrating is on the point of penetrating into the depths of one of the tragic clouds which envelop the beginning of louis reign it was necessary that there should be no equivoque and it became requisite that this book should offer some explanation with regard to this king 
 louis philippe had entered into possession of his royal authority without violence without any direct action on his part by virtue of a revolutionary change evidently quite distinct from the real aim of the revolution but in which he the duc exercised no personal initiative 
 he had been born a prince and he believed himself to have been elected king 
 he had not served this mandate on himself he had not taken it it had been offered to him and he had accepted it convinced wrongly to be sure but convinced nevertheless that the offer was in accordance with right and that the acceptance of it was in accordance with duty hence his possession was in good faith 
 now we say it in good conscience louis philippe being in possession in perfect good faith and the democracy being in good faith in its attack the amount of terror discharged by the social conflicts weighs neither on the king nor on the democracy 
 a clash of principles resembles a clash of elements 
 the ocean defends the water the hurricane defends the air the king defends royalty the democracy defends the people the relative which is the monarchy resists the absolute which is the republic society bleeds in this conflict but that which constitutes its suffering will constitute its safety later on and in any case those who combat are not to be blamed one of the two parties is evidently mistaken the right is not like the colossus of rhodes on two shores at once with one foot on the republic and one in royalty it is indivisible and all on one side but those who are in error are so sincerely a blind man is no more a criminal than a vendean is a ruffian let us then impute to the fatality of things alone these formidable collisions 
 whatever the nature of these tempests may be human irresponsibility is mingled with them 
 let us complete this exposition 
 the government of led a hard life immediately 
 born yesterday it was obliged to fight 
 hardly installed it was already everywhere conscious of vague movements of traction on the apparatus of july so recently laid and so lacking in solidity 
 resistance was born on the morrow perhaps even it was born on the preceding evening 
 from month to month the hostility increased and from being concealed it became patent 
 the revolution of july which gained but little acceptance outside of france by kings had been diversely interpreted in france as we have said 
 god delivers over to men his visible will in events an obscure text written in a mysterious tongue 
 men immediately make translations of it translations hasty incorrect full of errors of gaps and of nonsense 
 very few minds comprehend the divine language the most sagacious the calmest the most profound decipher slowly and when they arrive with their text the task has long been completed there are already twenty translations on the public place from each remaining springs a party and from each misinterpretation a faction and each party thinks that it alone has the true text and each faction thinks that it possesses the light 
 power itself is often a faction 
 there are in revolutions swimmers who go against the current they are the old parties 
 for the old parties who clung to heredity by the grace of god think that revolutions having sprung from the right to revolt one has the right to revolt against them 
 error 
 for in these revolutions the one who revolts is not the people it is the king revolution is precisely the contrary of revolt 
 every revolution being a normal outcome contains within itself its legitimacy which false revolutionists sometimes dishonor but which remains even when soiled which survives even when stained with blood 
 revolutions spring not from an accident but from necessity a revolution is a return from the fictitious to the real 
 it is because it must be that it is 
 none the less did the old legitimist parties assail the revolution of with all the vehemence which arises from false reasoning errors make excellent projectiles

 to the rights of man as proclaimed by the french revolution they added the rights of woman and the rights of the child 
 the reader will not be surprised if for various reasons we do not here treat in a thorough manner from the theoretical point of view the questions raised by socialism 
 we confine ourselves to indicating them 
 all the problems that the socialists proposed to themselves cosmogonic visions revery and mysticism being cast aside can be reduced to two principal problems 
 first problem 
 to produce wealth 
 second problem 
 to share it 
 the first problem contains the question of work 
 the second contains the question of salary 
 in the first problem the employment of forces is in question 
 in the second the distribution of enjoyment 
 from the proper employment of forces results public power 
 from a good distribution of enjoyments results individual happiness 
 by a good distribution not an equal but an equitable distribution must be understood 
 from these two things combined the public power without individual happiness within results social prosperity 
 social prosperity means the man happy the citizen free the nation great 
 england solves the first of these two problems 
 she creates wealth admirably she divides it badly 
 this solution which is complete on one side only leads her fatally to two extremes monstrous opulence monstrous wretchedness 
 all enjoyments for some all privations for the rest that is to say for the people privilege exception monopoly feudalism born from toil itself a false and dangerous situation which sates public power or private misery which sets the roots of the state in the sufferings of the individual 
 a badly constituted grandeur in which are combined all the material elements and into which no moral element enters 
 communism and agrarian law think that they solve the second problem they are mistaken 
 their division kills production 
 equal partition abolishes emulation and consequently labor 
 it is a partition made by the butcher which kills that which it divides 
 it is therefore impossible to pause over these pretended solutions slaying wealth is not the same thing as dividing it 
 the two problems require to be solved together to be well solved the two problems must be combined and made but one 
 solve only the first of the two problems you will be venice you will be england 
 you will have like venice an artificial power or like england a material power you will be the wicked rich man 
 you will die by an act of violence as venice died or by bankruptcy as england will fall 
 and the world will allow to die and fall all that is merely selfishness all that does not represent for the human race either a virtue or an idea 
 it is well understood here that by the words venice england we designate not the peoples but social structures the oligarchies superposed on nations and not the nations themselves 
 the nations always have our respect and our sympathy 
 venice as a people will live again england the aristocracy will fall but england the nation is immortal 
 that said we continue 
 solve the two problems encourage the wealthy and protect the poor suppress misery put an end to the unjust farming out of the feeble by the strong put a bridle on the iniquitous jealousy of the man who is making his way against the man who has reached the goal adjust mathematically and fraternally salary to labor mingle gratuitous and compulsory education with the growth of childhood and make of science the base of manliness develop minds while keeping arms busy be at one and the same time a powerful people and a family of happy men render property democratic not by abolishing it but by making it universal so that every citizen without exception may be a proprietor an easier matter than is generally supposed in two words learn how to produce wealth and how to distribute it and you will have at once moral and material greatness and you will be worthy to call yourself france

 book few pages of history 
 chapter iv 
 
 cracks beneath the foundation 
 at the moment when the drama which we are narrating is on the point of penetrating into the depths of one of the tragic clouds which envelop the beginning of louis reign it was necessary that there should be no equivoque and it became requisite that this book should offer some explanation with regard to this king 
 louis philippe had entered into possession of his royal authority without violence without any direct action on his part by virtue of a revolutionary change evidently quite distinct from the real aim of the revolution but in which he the duc exercised no personal initiative 
 he had been born a prince and he believed himself to have been elected king 
 he had not served this mandate on himself he had not taken it it had been offered to him and he had accepted it convinced wrongly to be sure but convinced nevertheless that the offer was in accordance with right and that the acceptance of it was in accordance with duty hence his possession was in good faith 
 now we say it in good conscience louis philippe being in possession in perfect good faith and the democracy being in good faith in its attack the amount of terror discharged by the social conflicts weighs neither on the king nor on the democracy 
 a clash of principles resembles a clash of elements 
 the ocean defends the water the hurricane defends the air the king defends royalty the democracy defends the people the relative which is the monarchy resists the absolute which is the republic society bleeds in this conflict but that which constitutes its suffering will constitute its safety later on and in any case those who combat are not to be blamed one of the two parties is evidently mistaken the right is not like the colossus of rhodes on two shores at once with one foot on the republic and one in royalty it is indivisible and all on one side but those who are in error are so sincerely a blind man is no more a criminal than a vendean is a ruffian let us then impute to the fatality of things alone these formidable collisions 
 whatever the nature of these tempests may be human irresponsibility is mingled with them 
 let us complete this exposition 
 the government of led a hard life immediately 
 born yesterday it was obliged to fight 
 hardly installed it was already everywhere conscious of vague movements of traction on the apparatus of july so recently laid and so lacking in solidity 
 resistance was born on the morrow perhaps even it was born on the preceding evening 
 from month to month the hostility increased and from being concealed it became patent 
 the revolution of july which gained but little acceptance outside of france by kings had been diversely interpreted in france as we have said 
 god delivers over to men his visible will in events an obscure text written in a mysterious tongue 
 men immediately make translations of it translations hasty incorrect full of errors of gaps and of nonsense 
 very few minds comprehend the divine language the most sagacious the calmest the most profound decipher slowly and when they arrive with their text the task has long been completed there are already twenty translations on the public place from each remaining springs a party and from each misinterpretation a faction and each party thinks that it alone has the true text and each faction thinks that it possesses the light 
 power itself is often a faction 
 there are in revolutions swimmers who go against the current they are the old parties 
 for the old parties who clung to heredity by the grace of god think that revolutions having sprung from the right to revolt one has the right to revolt against them 
 error 
 for in these revolutions the one who revolts is not the people it is the king revolution is precisely the contrary of revolt 
 every revolution being a normal outcome contains within itself its legitimacy which false revolutionists sometimes dishonor but which remains even when soiled which survives even when stained with blood 
 revolutions spring not from an accident but from necessity a revolution is a return from the fictitious to the real 
 it is because it must be that it is 
 none the less did the old legitimist parties assail the revolution of with all the vehemence which arises from false reasoning errors make excellent projectiles 
 they strike it cleverly in its vulnerable spot in default of a cuirass in its lack of logic they attacked this revolution in its royalty 
 they shouted to it revolution why this king 
 factions are blind men who aim correctly 
 this cry was uttered equally by the republicans 
 but coming from them this cry was logical 
 what was blindness in the legitimists was clearness of vision in the democrats 
 had bankrupted the people the enraged democracy reproached it with this 
 between the attack of the past and the attack of the future the establishment of july struggled 
 it represented the minute at loggerheads on the one hand with the monarchical centuries on the other hand with eternal right 
 in addition and beside all this as it was no longer revolution and had become a monarchy was obliged to take precedence of all europe to keep the peace was an increase of complication 
 a harmony established contrary to sense is often more onerous than a war from this secret conflict always muzzled but always growling was born armed peace that ruinous expedient of civilization which in the harness of the european cabinets is suspicious in itself the royalty of july reared up in spite of the fact that it caught it in the harness of european cabinets 
 metternich would gladly have put it in pushed on in france by progress it pushed on the monarchies those loiterers in europe

 of cunning 
 we take cunning for a sinister or crooked wisdom and certainly there is great difference between a cunning man and a wise man not only in point of honesty but in point of ability there be that can pack the cards and yet cannot play well so there are some that are good in canvasses and factions that are otherwise weak men 
 again it is one thing to understand persons and another thing to understand matters for many are perfect in humours that are not greatly capable of the real part of business which is the constitution of one that hath studied men more than books such men are fitter for practice than for counsel and they are good 
 but in their own alley turn them to new men and they have lost their aim so as the old rule to know a fool from a wise man nutte ambos nudos ad ignotos et videbis doth scarce hold for them and because these cunning men are like haberdashers of small wares it is 
 not amiss to set forth their shop 
 
 it is a point of cunning to wait upon him with whom you speak with your eye as the jesuits give it in precept for there be many wise men that have secret hearts and transparent countenances yet this would be done with a demure abasing of your eye sometimes as the jesuits also do use 
 
 another is that when you have anything to obtain of present dispatch you entertain and amuse the party with whom you deal with some other discourse that he be not too much awake to make objections i knew a counsellor and secretary that never came to queen elizabeth of england with bills to sign but he would always first put her into some discourse of estate that she mought the less mind the bills 
 
 the like surprise may be made by moving things when the party is in haste and cannot stay to consider advisedly of that is moved 
 
 if a man would cross a business that he doubts some other would handsomely and effectually move let him pretend to wish it well and move it himself in such sort as may foil it 
 
 the breaking off in the midst of that one was about to say as if he took himself up breeds a greater appetite in him with whom you confer to know more

 of cunning 
 we take cunning for a sinister or crooked wisdom and certainly there is great difference between a cunning man and a wise man not only in point of honesty but in point of ability there be that can pack the cards and yet cannot play well so there are some that are good in canvasses and factions that are otherwise weak men 
 again it is one thing to understand persons and another thing to understand matters for many are perfect in humours that are not greatly capable of the real part of business which is the constitution of one that hath studied men more than books such men are fitter for practice than for counsel and they are good 
 but in their own alley turn them to new men and they have lost their aim so as the old rule to know a fool from a wise man nutte ambos nudos ad ignotos et videbis doth scarce hold for them and because these cunning men are like haberdashers of small wares it is 
 not amiss to set forth their shop 
 
 it is a point of cunning to wait upon him with whom you speak with your eye as the jesuits give it in precept for there be many wise men that have secret hearts and transparent countenances yet this would be done with a demure abasing of your eye sometimes as the jesuits also do use 
 
 another is that when you have anything to obtain of present dispatch you entertain and amuse the party with whom you deal with some other discourse that he be not too much awake to make objections i knew a counsellor and secretary that never came to queen elizabeth of england with bills to sign but he would always first put her into some discourse of estate that she mought the less mind the bills 
 
 the like surprise may be made by moving things when the party is in haste and cannot stay to consider advisedly of that is moved 
 
 if a man would cross a business that he doubts some other would handsomely and effectually move let him pretend to wish it well and move it himself in such sort as may foil it 
 
 the breaking off in the midst of that one was about to say as if he took himself up breeds a greater appetite in him with whom you confer to know more 
 
 and because it works better when anything seemeth to be gotten from you by question than if you offer it of yourself you may lay a bait for a question by showing another visage and countenance than you are wont to the end to give occasion for the party 
 to ask what the matter is of the change as nehemias did and i had not before that time been sad before the king 
 
 in things that arc tender and unpleasing it is good to break the ice by some whose words are of less weight and to reserve the more weighty voice to come in as by chance so that he may be asked the question upon the speech 
 as narcissus did in relating to claudius the marriage of messalina and silius in things that a man would not be seen in himself it is a point of cunning to borrow the name of the world as to say the world says or there is a speech abroad 
 
 i knew one that when he wrote a letter he would put that which was most material in the as if it had been a 
 i knew another that when he came to have speech he would pass over that that he intended most and go forth and come back again and speak of it as of a thing that he had almost forgot

 chapter vii 
 the interior of despair 
 let us try to say it 
 it is necessary that society should look at these things because it is itself which creates them 
 he was as we have said an ignorant man but he was not a fool the light of nature was ignited in him 
 unhappiness which also possesses a clearness of vision of its own augmented the small amount of daylight which existed in this mind 
 beneath the cudgel beneath the chain in the cell in hardship beneath the burning sun of the galleys upon the plank bed of the convict he withdrew into his own consciousness and meditated 
 he constituted himself the tribunal 
 he began by putting himself on trial 
 he recognized the fact that he was not an innocent man unjustly punished he admitted that he had committed an extreme and blameworthy act that that loaf of bread would probably not have been refused to him had he asked for it that in any case it would have been better to wait until he could get it through compassion or through work that it is not an unanswerable argument to say can one wait when one is hungry 
 that in the first place it is very rare for any one to die of hunger literally and next that fortunately or unfortunately man is so constituted that he can suffer long and much both morally and physically without dying that it is therefore necessary to have patience that that would even have been better for those poor little children that it had been an act of madness for him a miserable unfortunate wretch to take society at large violently by the collar and to imagine that one can escape from misery through theft that that is in any case a poor door through which to escape from misery through which infamy enters in short that he was in the wrong 
 then he asked himself 
 whether he had been the only one in fault in his fatal history whether it was not a serious thing that he a laborer out of work that he an industrious man should have lacked bread 
 and whether the fault once committed and confessed the chastisement had not been ferocious and disproportioned 
 whether there had not been more abuse on the part of the law in respect to the penalty than there had been on the part of the culprit in respect to his fault 
 whether there had not been an excess of weights in one balance of the scale in the one which contains expiation 
 whether the of the penalty was not equivalent to the annihilation of the crime and did not result in reversing the situation of replacing the fault of the delinquent by the fault of the repression of converting the guilty man into the victim and the debtor into the creditor and of ranging the law definitely on the side of the man who had violated it 
 whether this penalty complicated by successive aggravations for attempts at escape had not ended in becoming a sort of outrage perpetrated by the stronger upon the feebler a crime of society against the individual a crime which was being committed afresh every day a crime which had lasted nineteen years 
 he asked himself whether human society could have the right to force its members to suffer equally in one case for its own unreasonable lack of foresight and in the other case for its pitiless foresight and to seize a poor man forever between a defect and an excess a default of work and an excess of punishment 
 whether it was not outrageous for society to treat thus precisely those of its members who were the least well endowed in the division of goods made by chance and consequently the most deserving of consideration 
 these questions put and answered he judged society and condemned it 
 he condemned it to his hatred 
 he made it responsible for the fate which he was suffering and he said to himself that it might be that one day he should not hesitate to call it to account 
 he declared to himself that there was no equilibrium between the harm which he had caused and the harm which was being done to him he finally arrived at the conclusion that his punishment was not in truth unjust but that it most assuredly was iniquitous 
 anger may be both foolish and absurd one can be irritated wrongfully one is exasperated only when there is some show of right on side at bottom 
 jean valjean felt himself exasperated 
 and besides human society had done him nothing but harm he had never seen anything of it save that angry face which it calls justice and which it shows to those whom it strikes 
 men had only touched him to bruise him 
 every contact with them had been a blow never since his infancy since the days of his mother of his sister had he ever encountered a friendly word and a kindly glance from suffering to suffering he had gradually arrived at the conviction that life is a war and that in this war he was the conquered he had no other weapon than his hate 
 he resolved to whet it in the galleys and to bear it away with him when he departed 
 there was at toulon a school for the convicts kept by the ignorantin friars where the most necessary branches were taught to those of the unfortunate men who had a mind for them 
 he was of the number who had a mind 
 he went to school at the age of forty and learned to read to write to cipher 
 he felt that to fortify his intelligence was to fortify his hate 
 in certain cases education and enlightenment can serve to eke out evil 
 this is a sad thing to say after having judged society which had caused his unhappiness he judged providence which had made society and he condemned it also 
 thus during nineteen years of torture and slavery this soul mounted and at the same time fell 
 light entered it on one side and darkness on the other 
 jean valjean had not as we have seen an evil nature 
 he was still good when he arrived at the galleys 
 he there condemned society and felt that he was becoming wicked he there condemned providence and was conscious that he was becoming impious 
 it is difficult not to indulge in meditation at this point 
 does human nature thus change utterly and from top to bottom can the man created good by god be rendered wicked by man can the soul be completely made over by fate and become evil fate being evil 
 can the heart become misshapen and contract incurable deformities and infirmities under the oppression of a disproportionate unhappiness as the vertebral column beneath too low a vault 
 is there not in every human soul was there not in the soul of jean valjean in particular a first spark a divine element incorruptible in this world immortal in the other which good can develop fan ignite and make to glow with splendor and which evil can never wholly extinguish 
 grave and obscure questions to the last of which every physiologist would probably have responded no and that without hesitation had he beheld at toulon during the hours of repose which were for jean valjean hours of revery this gloomy seated with folded arms upon the bar of some capstan with the end of his chain thrust into his pocket to prevent its dragging serious silent and thoughtful a pariah of the laws which regarded the man with wrath condemned by civilization and regarding heaven with severity 
 we make no attempt to dissimulate the fact the observing physiologist would have beheld an irremediable misery he would perchance have pitied this sick man of the making but he would not have even essayed any treatment he would have turned aside his gaze from the caverns of which he would have caught a glimpse within this soul and like dante at the portals of hell he would have effaced from this existence the word which the finger of god has nevertheless inscribed upon the brow of every 
 was this state of his soul which we have attempted to analyze as perfectly clear to jean valjean as we have tried to render it for those who read us 
 did jean valjean distinctly perceive after their formation and had he seen distinctly during the process of their formation all the elements of which his moral misery was composed 
 had this rough and unlettered man gathered a perfectly clear perception of the succession of ideas through which he had by degrees mounted and descended to the lugubrious aspects which had for so many years formed the inner horizon of his spirit was he conscious of all that passed within him and of all that was working there 
 that is something which we do not presume to state it is something which we do not even believe 
 there was too much ignorance in jean valjean even after his misfortune to prevent much vagueness from still lingering there 
 at times he did not rightly know himself what he felt 
 jean valjean was in the shadows he suffered in the shadows he hated in the shadows one might have said that he hated in advance of himself 
 he dwelt habitually in this shadow feeling his way like a blind man and a dreamer 
 only at intervals there suddenly came to him from without and from within an access of wrath a surcharge of suffering a livid and rapid flash which illuminated his whole soul and caused to appear abruptly all around him in front behind amid the gleams of a frightful light the hideous precipices and the sombre perspective of his destiny 
 the flash passed the night closed in again and where was he he no longer knew 
 the peculiarity of pains of this nature in which that which is is to say that which is is to transform a man little by little by a sort of stupid transfiguration into a wild beast sometimes into a ferocious beast 
 jean successive and obstinate attempts at escape would alone suffice to prove this strange working of the law upon the human soul 
 jean valjean would have renewed these attempts utterly useless and foolish as they were as often as the opportunity had presented itself without reflecting for an instant on the result nor on the experiences which he had already gone through he escaped impetuously like the wolf who finds his cage open instinct said to him flee 
 reason would have said remain but in the presence of so violent a temptation reason vanished nothing remained but instinct 
 the beast alone acted 
 when he was recaptured the fresh severities inflicted on him only served to render him still more wild 
 one detail which we must not omit is that he possessed a physical strength which was not approached by a single one of the denizens of the galleys 
 at work at paying out a cable or winding up a capstan jean valjean was worth four men 
 he sometimes lifted and sustained enormous weights on his back and when the occasion demanded it he replaced that implement which is called a and was formerly called orgueil pride whence we may remark in passing is derived the name of the rue montorgueil near the halles fishmarket in paris 
 his comrades had nicknamed him jean the once when they were repairing the balcony of the at toulon one of those admirable caryatids of puget which support the balcony became loosened and was on the point of falling 
 jean valjean who was present supported the caryatid with his shoulder and gave the workmen time to arrive 
 his suppleness even exceeded his strength 
 certain convicts who were forever dreaming of escape ended by making a veritable science of force and skill combined 
 it is the science of muscles an entire system of mysterious statics is daily practised by prisoners men who are forever envious of the flies and birds to climb a vertical surface and to find points of support where hardly a projection was visible was play to jean valjean an angle of the wall being given with the tension of his back and legs with his elbows and his heels fitted into the unevenness of the stone he raised himself as if by magic to the third story he sometimes mounted thus even to the roof of the galley prison 
 he spoke but little 
 he laughed not at all 
 an excessive emotion was required to wring from him once or twice a year that lugubrious laugh of the convict which is like the echo of the laugh of a demon to all appearance he seemed to be occupied in the constant contemplation of something terrible 
 he was absorbed in fact 
 athwart the unhealthy perceptions of an incomplete nature and a crushed intelligence he was confusedly conscious that some monstrous thing was resting on him 
 in that obscure and wan shadow within which he crawled each time that he turned his neck and essayed to raise his glance he perceived with terror mingled with rage a sort of frightful accumulation of things 
 collecting and mounting above him beyond the range of his vision laws prejudices men and outlines escaped him whose mass terrified him and which was nothing else than that prodigious pyramid which we call civilization 
 he distinguished here and there in that swarming and formless mass now near him now afar off and on inaccessible some group some detail vividly illuminated here the and his cudgel there the gendarme and his sword yonder the mitred archbishop away at the top like a sort of sun the emperor crowned and dazzling it seemed to him that these distant splendors far from dissipating his night rendered it more funereal and more black 
 all this laws prejudices deeds men and came above him over his head in accordance with the complicated and mysterious movement which god imparts to civilization walking over him and crushing him with i know not what peacefulness in its cruelty and inexorability in its indifference 
 souls which have fallen to the bottom of all possible misfortune unhappy men lost in the lowest of those limbos at which no one any longer looks the reproved of the law feel the whole weight of this human society so formidable for him who is without so frightful for him who is beneath resting upon their heads 
 in this situation jean valjean meditated and what could be the nature of his meditation 
 if the grain of millet beneath the millstone had thoughts it would doubtless think that same thing which jean valjean thought 
 all these things realities full of spectres phantasmagories full of realities had eventually created for him a sort of interior state which is almost indescribable 
 at times amid his convict toil he paused 
 he fell to thinking his reason at one and the same time riper and more troubled than of yore rose in revolt 
 everything which had happened to him seemed to him absurd everything that surrounded him seemed to him impossible 
 he said to himself it is a dream he gazed at the standing a few paces from him the seemed a phantom to him 
 all of a sudden the phantom dealt him a blow with his cudgel 
 visible nature hardly existed for him 
 it would almost be true to say that there existed for jean valjean neither sun nor fine summer days nor radiant sky nor fresh april dawns i know not what daylight habitually illumined his soul 
 to sum up in conclusion that which can be summed up and translated into positive results in all that we have just pointed out we will confine ourselves to the statement that in the course of nineteen years jean valjean the inoffensive of faverolles the formidable convict of toulon had become capable thanks to the manner in which the galleys had moulded him of two sorts of evil action 
 firstly of evil action which was rapid unpremeditated dashing entirely instinctive in the nature of reprisals for the evil which he had undergone secondly of evil action which was serious grave consciously argued out and premeditated with the false ideas which such a misfortune can furnish 
 his deliberate deeds passed through three successive phases which natures of a certain stamp can alone will perseverance he had for moving causes his habitual wrath bitterness of soul a profound sense of indignities suffered the reaction even against the good the innocent and the just if there are any such the point of departure like the point of arrival for all his thoughts was hatred of human law that hatred which if it be not arrested in its development by some providential incident becomes within a given time the hatred of society then the hatred of the human race then the hatred of creation and which manifests itself by a vague incessant and brutal desire to do harm to some living being no matter whom 
 it will be perceived that it was not without reason that jean passport described him as a very dangerous man 
 from year to year this soul had dried away slowly but with fatal sureness 
 when the heart is dry the eye is dry 
 on his departure from the galleys it had been nineteen years since he had shed a tear

 certain convicts who were forever dreaming of escape ended by making a veritable science of force and skill combined 
 it is the science of muscles an entire system of mysterious statics is daily practised by prisoners men who are forever envious of the flies and birds to climb a vertical surface and to find points of support where hardly a projection was visible was play to jean valjean an angle of the wall being given with the tension of his back and legs with his elbows and his heels fitted into the unevenness of the stone he raised himself as if by magic to the third story he sometimes mounted thus even to the roof of the galley prison 
 he spoke but little 
 he laughed not at all 
 an excessive emotion was required to wring from him once or twice a year that lugubrious laugh of the convict which is like the echo of the laugh of a demon to all appearance he seemed to be occupied in the constant contemplation of something terrible 
 he was absorbed in fact 
 athwart the unhealthy perceptions of an incomplete nature and a crushed intelligence he was confusedly conscious that some monstrous thing was resting on him 
 in that obscure and wan shadow within which he crawled each time that he turned his neck and essayed to raise his glance he perceived with terror mingled with rage a sort of frightful accumulation of things 
 collecting and mounting above him beyond the range of his vision laws prejudices men and outlines escaped him whose mass terrified him and which was nothing else than that prodigious pyramid which we call civilization 
 he distinguished here and there in that swarming and formless mass now near him now afar off and on inaccessible some group some detail vividly illuminated here the and his cudgel there the gendarme and his sword yonder the mitred archbishop away at the top like a sort of sun the emperor crowned and dazzling it seemed to him that these distant splendors far from dissipating his night rendered it more funereal and more black 
 all this laws prejudices deeds men and came above him over his head in accordance with the complicated and mysterious movement which god imparts to civilization walking over him and crushing him with i know not what peacefulness in its cruelty and inexorability in its indifference 
 souls which have fallen to the bottom of all possible misfortune unhappy men lost in the lowest of those limbos at which no one any longer looks the reproved of the law feel the whole weight of this human society so formidable for him who is without so frightful for him who is beneath resting upon their heads 
 in this situation jean valjean meditated and what could be the nature of his meditation 
 if the grain of millet beneath the millstone had thoughts it would doubtless think that same thing which jean valjean thought 
 all these things realities full of spectres phantasmagories full of realities had eventually created for him a sort of interior state which is almost indescribable 
 at times amid his convict toil he paused 
 he fell to thinking his reason at one and the same time riper and more troubled than of yore rose in revolt 
 everything which had happened to him seemed to him absurd everything that surrounded him seemed to him impossible 
 he said to himself it is a dream he gazed at the standing a few paces from him the seemed a phantom to him 
 all of a sudden the phantom dealt him a blow with his cudgel 
 visible nature hardly existed for him 
 it would almost be true to say that there existed for jean valjean neither sun nor fine summer days nor radiant sky nor fresh april dawns i know not what daylight habitually illumined his soul 
 to sum up in conclusion that which can be summed up and translated into positive results in all that we have just pointed out we will confine ourselves to the statement that in the course of nineteen years jean valjean the inoffensive of faverolles the formidable convict of toulon had become capable thanks to the manner in which the galleys had moulded him of two sorts of evil action 
 firstly of evil action which was rapid unpremeditated dashing entirely instinctive in the nature of reprisals for the evil which he had undergone secondly of evil action which was serious grave consciously argued out and premeditated with the false ideas which such a misfortune can furnish 
 his deliberate deeds passed through three successive phases which natures of a certain stamp can alone will perseverance he had for moving causes his habitual wrath bitterness of soul a profound sense of indignities suffered the reaction even against the good the innocent and the just if there are any such the point of departure like the point of arrival for all his thoughts was hatred of human law that hatred which if it be not arrested in its development by some providential incident becomes within a given time the hatred of society then the hatred of the human race then the hatred of creation and which manifests itself by a vague incessant and brutal desire to do harm to some living being no matter whom 
 it will be perceived that it was not without reason that jean passport described him as a very dangerous man 
 from year to year this soul had dried away slowly but with fatal sureness 
 when the heart is dry the eye is dry 
 on his departure from the galleys it had been nineteen years since he had shed a tear

 the empire strikes back 
 viii 
 
 darth vader looked like a great silent god as he stood on the main control deck of hismammoth star destroyer 
 he was staring through the large rectangular window above the deck at theraging field of asteroids that was pelting his ship as it glided through of rocks streaked past the windows some collided with one another andexploded in brilliant displays of vivid light 
 as vader watched one of his smaller ships disintegrated under the impact of anenormous asteroid seemingly unmoved he turned to look at a series of twentyholographic images these twenty holograms in three dimensions thefeatures of twenty imperial battleship commanders the image of commanderwhose ship had just been obliterated was fading rapidly almost as quickly as theglowing particles of his exploded ship were being flung to oblivion 
 admiral piett and an aide quietly moved to stand behind their as he turned to an image in the center of the twenty holograms which wascontinually interrupted by static and faded in and out as captain needa of the stardestroyer avenger made his report his first words had already been drowned bystatic 
 which was the last time they appeared in any of our scopes captain needacontinued considering the amount of damage sustained they also must havebeen destroyed 
 vader disagreed he knew of the millennium power and was quitefamiliar with the skills of her cocky pilot no captain he snarled alive i want every ship available to sweep the asteroid field until 
 as soon as vader had given his command captain image and those ofthe other nineteen captains faded completely when the last hologram vanished thedark lord having sensed the two men standing behind him turned now what isso important it wait admiral he asked imperiously speak up 
 the face turned pale with fear his trembling voice shaking almost asmuch as his body it wasthe emperor 
 the emperor the voice behind the black breath mask repeated 
 yes the admiral replied he commands you make contact with him 
 move this ship out of the asteroid field vader ordered into a position wherewe can send a clear transmission 
 yes my lord 
 and cod the signal to my private chamber 
 the millennium falcon had come to rest hidden in the small cave which waspitch black and dripping with moisture the crew turned down its enginesuntil no sound at all was emitted from the small craft 
 inside the cockpit han solo and his shaggy copilot were just completingshutting down the electronic systems as they did so all the service lightsdimmed and the interior of the ship became nearly as dark as its sheltering cave 
 han glanced over at leia and flashed her a quick grin getting kind ofromantic in here 
 chewbacca growled there was work to be done in here and the wookieeneeded undivided attention if they were going to repair the malfunctioninghyperdrive 
 irritated han returned to his work what are you so grouchy about the wookiee could respond the protocol droid timidly approached han andposed a question of burning importance sir afraid to ask but does shuttingdown all except emergency power systems include me 
 chewbacca expressed his opinion with a resounding bark of affirmation but handisagreed no he said going to need you to talk to the old falcon hereand find out what happened to our hyperdrive he looked over at the princess andadded how are you with a macrofuser your holiness 
 before leia could get off a suitable retort the millennium falcon lurchedforward as a sudden impact struck its hull everything that was not bolted downflew through the cockpit even the giant wookiee howling boisterously had tostruggle to stay in his chair 
 hang on han yelled watch out 
 clattered against a wall then collected himself sir verypossible this asteroid is not stable 
 han glared at him glad here to tell us these things 
 the ship rocked once more even more violently than before 
 the wookiee howled again threepio stumbled backward and leia was hurledacross the cabin directly into the waiting arms of captain solo 
 the rocking stopped as suddenly as it had started but leia still stood embrace for once she did not draw away and he could almost swear she waswillingly embracing him why princess he said pleasantly surprised this is sosudden 
 at that she began to pull back let go she insisted trying to move out of hisarms getting angry 
 he saw the old familiar expression of arrogance beginning to return to her look angry he lied 
 how do i look 
 beautiful he answered truthfully with an emotion that surprised him 
 leia felt suddenly unexpectedly shy her cheeks flushed pink and when sherealized she was blushing she averted her eyes but she still did not really try to getfree 
 han somehow let the tender moment last and excited he had toadd 
 leia became infuriated once again the angry princess and haughty quickly moved away from him and drew herself up to her most regal captain she said her cheeks now reddened in anger being held by you to get me excited 
 well i hope you expect more he grunted angrier at himself than at herstinging words 
 i expect anything leia said indignantly except to be left alone 
 if just get out of my way leave you alone 
 embarrassed to realize that she was indeed still standing rather close leiastepped aside and made an effort to change the subject you think timewe got to work on your ship 
 han frowned fine with me he said coldly not looking at her 
 leia quickly turned on her heel and left the cockpit 
 for a moment han stood there quietly just gathering his he looked at the now quiet wookiee and droid both of whom hadwitnessed the entire incident 
 come on chewie tear into this flying short circuit he said quickly to endthe awkward moment 
 the copilot barked in agreement then joined his captain as they began to leavethe cockpit as they walked out han looked back at threepio who was stillstanding in the dim chamber looking dumbfounded you too goldenrod 
 i must admit the robot muttered to himself as he began to shuffle out of thecockpit there are times i understand human behavior 
 the lights of luke fighter pierced the darkness of the bogplanet the ship had sunk deeper into the scummy waters but there was still enoughof it above the surface to let luke carry needed supplies from the storagecompartments he knew it could not be much longer before his ship all the the water he thought that his chance ofsurvival might be increased if he gathered as many supplies as he could 
 it was now so dark that luke could scarcely see in front of him out in thedense jungle he heard a sharp snapping noise and felt a chill run through his pistol he prepared to blast any thing that leaped from the jungle toattack him but nothing did and he clipped his weapon back onto its holster andcontinued to unpack his gear 
 you ready for some power luke asked artoo who was patiently waiting forhis own form of nourishment luke took a small fusion furnace from an equipmentbox and ignited it welcoming even the tiny glow thrown off by the small heatingdevice then took a power cable and attached it to artoo through a protuberance thatroughly resembled a nose as power radiated through electronic innards thestout robot whistled his appreciation 
 luke sat down and opened a container of processed food as he began to talked to the robot now all i have to do is find this yoda if he even exists 
 he looked around nervously at the shadows in the jungle and felt and increasingly in doubt about his quest this certainly seems like astrange place to find a jedi master he said to the little robot gives me thecreeps 
 from the sound of his beep it was clear artoo shared opinion of theswamp world 
 although luke continued as he reluctantly tasted more of the food familiar about this place i feel like 
 you feel like what 
 that voice luke leaped up grabbed his pistol then spun into the gloom to try to find the source of those words 
 as he turned he saw a tiny creature standing directly in front of him lukeimmediately stepped back in surprise this little being seemed to have materialized outof nowhere it stood no more than half a meter in height fearlessly holding itsground in front of the towering youth who wielded an awesome laser pistol 
 the little wizened thing could have been any age its face was deeply lined butwas framed with elfin pointed ears that gave it a look of eternal youth long whitehair was parted down the middle and hung down on either side of the the being was bipedal and stood on short legs that terminated in reptilian feet it wore rags as gray as the mists of the swamp and in suchtatters that they must have approximated the very age 
 for the moment luke could not decide whether to be frightened or to when he gazed into those bulbous eyes and sensed the kindly nature herelaxed at last the creature motioned toward the pistol in hand 
 away put your weapon i mean you no harm it said 
 after some hesitation luke quietly put his pistol back into his belt as he didso he wondered why he felt impelled to obey this little creature 
 i am wondering the creature spoke again why are you here 
 looking for someone luke answered 
 looking looking the creature repeated curiously with a wide smilebeginning to crease his face found someone say 
 luke had to force himself not to smile yeah 
 help you i canyesyes 
 inexplicably luke found himself trusting the odd creature but at all surethat such a tiny individual could be of help on his important quest i thinkso he replied gently you see looking for a great warrior 
 a great warrior the creature shook his head the whitish hair floppingabout his pointed ears wars make one great 
 a strange phrase luke thought but before he could answer luke saw the tinyhominid hobble over to the top of the salvaged supply cases shocked he watchedas the creature began to rummage through the articles luke had brought with himfrom hoth 
 get away from there he said surprised at this sudden strange behavior 
 moving across the ground artoo waddled toward the pile of cases standing justabout at optical sensor level with the creature the droid squealed his disapproval ashe scanned the creature that was carelessly digging through the supplies 
 the strange being grabbed the container holding the remains of food andtook a bite 
 hey my dinner luke exclaimed 
 but no sooner had the creature taken his first bite than he spat out what he hadtasted his deeply lined face wrinkling like a prune peewh he said you no how get you so big eating food of this kind he looked luke upand down 
 before the astounded youth could reply the creature flipped the food container direction then dipped one of his small and delicate hands into another supplycase 
 listen friend luke said watching this bizarre scavenger we mean toland here and if i could get my fighter out of this puddle i would but i 
 get your ship out have you tried have you tried the creaturegoaded 
 luke had to admit to himself that he had not but then the whole idea waspatently ludicrous he have the proper equipment to 
 something in case had attracted the interest luke finallyreached the end of his patience when he saw the crazy little being snatch somethingout of the supply case knowing that survival depended on those supplies hegrabbed for the case but the creature held on to his miniature power lampthat he gripped tightly in his hand the little light came alive in hand throwing its radiance up into his delighted face and he immediatelybegan to examine his treasure 
 give me that luke cried 
 the creature retreated from the approaching youth like a petulant child or help you not 
 still clutching the lamp to his breast the creature stepped bumping into not remembering that the robot was at allanimate the being stood next to it as luke approached 
 i want your help luke said indignantly i want my lamp back it in this slimy mudhole 
 luke instantly realized he had issued an insult 
 mudhole slimy my home this is 
 as they argued artoo slowly reached out a mechanical arm suddenly hisappendage grabbed the pilfered lamp and immediately the two little figures wereengaged in a over the stolen prize as they spun about in battle artoobeeped a few electronic give me 
 mine mine give it back the creature cried abruptly though he seemedto give up the bizarre struggle and lightly poked the droid with one bluish finger 
 artoo emitted a loud startled squeal and immediately released the power lamp 
 the victor grinned at the glowing object in his tiny hands gleefully mine 
 luke was about fed up with these antics and advised the robot that the battle wasover okay artoo he said with a sigh let him have it now get out of fellow got things to do 
 no no the creature pleaded excitedly stay and help you find yourfriend 
 not looking for a friend luke said looking for a jedi master 
 oh the eyes widened as he spoke a jedi master differentaltogether yoda you seek yoda 
 mention of that name surprised luke but he felt skeptical how could an elflike this know anything about a great teacher of the jedi knights you know him 
 of course yes the creature said proudly take you to him but first wemust eat good food come come 
 with that the creature scurried out of camp and into the shadows of theswamp the tiny power lamp he carried was gradually dimming in the distance asluke stood feeling baffled at first he had no intention of pursuing the creature butall at once he found himself diving into the fog after him 
 as luke started off into the jungle he heard artoo whistling and beeping as if hewould blow his circuits luke turned around to see the little droid standing forlornlynext to the miniature fission furnace 
 better stay here and watch over the camp luke instructed the robot 
 but artoo only intensified his noisy output running through the entire gamut ofhis electronic articulations 
 artoo now settle down luke called as he ran into the jungle i can takecare of myself be safe okay 
 electronic grumbling grew fainter as luke hurried to catch up with thelittle guide i must really be out of my mind luke thought following this weirdbeing into but the creature had mentioned name andluke felt compelled to accept any help he could get to find the jedi master hestumbled in the dark over thick weeds and twisting roots as he pursued the flickeringlight ahead 
 the creature was chattering gaily as he led the way through the safeyes of course then in his odd little way thismysterious being started to laugh 
 two imperial cruisers slowly moved across the surface of the giant millennium falcon had to be hidden somewhere where 
 as the ships skimmed the surface of the asteroid they dropped bombs on itspockmarked terrain trying to scare out the freighter the shock waves from theexplosives violently shook the spheroid but there was no sign of the falcon as itdrifted above the asteroid one of the imperial star destroyers cast an eclipsingshadow across the tunnel entrance yet the scanners failed to not the curioushole in the bowllike wall within that hole in a winding tunnel not detected by theminions of the powerful empire sat the freighter it rattled and vibrated with everyexplosion that pounded the surface above 
 inside chewbacca worked feverishly to repair the complex powertrain he hadscrambled into an overhead compartment to get at the wires that operated thehyperdrive system but when he felt the first of the explosions he popped his headout through the mass of wires and gave out a worried yelp 
 princess leia who was welding a damaged valve stopped her work and lookedup the bombs sounded very close 
 glanced up at leia and nervously tilted his head oh my hesaid found us 
 everyone became quiet as if fearing that the sound of their voices mightsomehow carry and betray their exact position again the ship was shaken by a intense than the last 
 moving away leia said 
 han saw through their tactic just trying to see if they can stir upsomething he told her safe if we stay put 
 where have i heard that line before leia said with an innocent air 
 ignoring her sarcasm han moved past her as he went back to work thepassageway in the hold was so narrow that he avoid brushing against her ashe passed could he 
 with mixed emotions the princess watched him for a moment as he continued towork on his ship and then she turned back to her welding 
 ignored all this odd human behavior he was too busy trying tocommunicate with the falcon trying to find out what was wrong with its at the central control panel threepio was making uncharacteristic whistleand beep sounds a moment later the control panel whistled back 
 where is artoo when i need him sighed the golden robot the response had been difficult for him to interpret i know where yourship learned to communicate threepio announced to han but its dialect leavessomething to be desired i believe sir it says the power coupling on the negativeaxis has been polarized afraid have to replace it 
 of course have to replace it han snapped then called up to was peering from the ceiling compartment replace it he whispered 
 he noticed that leia had finished her welding but was having trouble reengagingthe valve struggling with a lever that simply would not budge he moved towardher and began offering to help but she coldly turned her back to him and continuedher battle with the valve 
 easy your worship he said only trying to help 
 still struggling with the lever leia asked quietly would you please stop callingme that 
 han was surprised at the simple tone he had expected a stingingretort or at best a cold silence but her words were missing the mocking tone thathe was accustomed to hearing was she finally bringing their relentless battle ofwills to an end sure he said gently 
 you make things difficult sometimes leia said as she shyly glanced at him 
 he had to agree i do i really do but he added you could be a little come on admit it sometimes you think all right 
 she let go of the lever and rubbed her sore hand sometimes she said with alittle smile maybeoccasionally when you acting the scoundrel 
 scoundrel he laughed finding her choice of words endearing i like thesound of that 
 without another word he reached for hand and began to massage it 
 stop it leia protested 
 han continued to hold her hand stop what he asked softly 
 leia felt flustered confused hundred things in that her sense of dignity prevailed stop that she said regally my hands aredirty 
 han smiled at her feeble excuse but held on to her hand and looked right intoher eyes my hands are dirty too what are you afraid of 
 afraid she returned his direct gaze of getting my hand dirty 
 why trembling he asked he could see that she was affectedby his closeness and by his touch and her expression softened whereupon hereached out and took her other hand 
 i think you like me because a scoundrel he said i think you enough scoundrels in your life as he spoke he slowly drew her near 
 leia resist his gentle pull now as she looked at him she thought he hadnever seemed more handsome but she was still the princess i happen to like nicemen she chided in a whisper 
 and not nice han asked teasing 
 chewbacca stuck his head out from the overhead compartment and watched theproceedings unnoticed 
 yes she whispered but you 
 before she could finish han solo drew her to him and felt her body tremble ashe pressed his lips to hers it seemed forever it seemed an eternity to share betweenthem as he gently bent her body back this time she resist at all 
 when they parted luke needed a moment to catch her breath she tried toregain her composure and work up a measure of indignation but she found it difficultto talk 
 okay hot shot she began i 
 but then she stopped and suddenly found herself kissing him pulling him evencloser than before 
 when their lips finally parted han held leia in his arms as they looked at eachother for a long moment there was a peaceful kind of emotion between leia began to draw away her thoughts and feelings a turmoil she averted hereyes and began to disengage herself from embrace in the next second sheturned and rushed from the cabin 
 han silently looked after her as she left the room he then became acutelyaware of the very curious wookiee whose head was poking from the ceiling 
 okay chewie he bellowed give me a hand with this valve 
 the fog dispersed by a torrent of rain snaked around the swamp in diaphanousswirls scooting along amid the pounding rain was a single r droid looking for hismaster 
 sensing devices were busily sending impulses to his electronicnerve ends at the slightest sound his auditory systems sent information to the nervous computer brain 
 it was too wet for artoo in this murky jungle he aimed his optical sensors inthe direction of a strange little mud house on the edge of a dark lake the by an perception of loneliness moved closer to the windowof the tiny abode artoo extended his utility feet toward the window and peekedinside he hoped no one inside noticed the slight shiver of his form orheard his nervous little electronic whimper 
 somehow luke skywalker managed to squeeze inside the miniature everything within was perfectly scaled to its tiny resident luke on the dried mud floor in the living room careful not to bang his skullagainst the low ceiling there was a table in front of him and he could see a fewcontainers holding what appeared to be scrolls 
 the creature was in his kitchen next to the living room busilyconcocting an incredible meal from where luke sat he could see the little cookstirring steaming pots chopping this shredding that scattering herbs over all andscurrying back and forth to put platters on the table in front of the youth 
 fascinated as he was by this bustling activity luke was growing very the creature made one of his frantic runs into the living room area luke remindedhis host i told you not hungry 
 patience the creature said as he scuttled back into the steamy time to eat 
 luke tried to be polite look he said it smells good sure but i know why we see yoda now 
 the time to eat too the creature answered 
 but luke was eager to be on his way will it take long to get there how faris he 
 not far not far be patient soon you will see him why wish you becomea jedi 
 because of my father i guess luke answered as he reflected that he neverreally knew his father that well in truth his deepest kinship with his father wasthrough the lightsaber ben had entrusted to him 
 luke noticed the curious look in the eyes as he mentioned his your father the being said sitting down to begin his vast meal a powerfuljedi was he powerful jedi 
 the youth wondered if the creature were mocking him how could you knowmy father he asked a little angrily you even know who i am heglanced around at the bizarre room and shook his head i know what here 
 then he noticed that the creature had turned away from him and was talking to acorner of the room this really is the final straw luke thought now thisimpossible creature is talking to thin air 
 no good is this the creature was saying irritably this will not do icannot teach him the boy has no patience 
 head spun in the direction the creature was facing cannot teach nopatience bewildered he still saw no one there then the truth of the situationgradually became as plain to him as the deep lines on the little he was being by none other than yoda himself 
 from the empty corner of the room luke heard the gentle wise voice of benkenobi responding to yoda he will learn patience ben said 
 much anger in him the dwarfish jedi teacher persisted like in his father 
 discussed this before kenobi said 
 luke could no longer wait i can be a jedi he interrupted it meant morethan anything else to him to become a part of the noble band that had championed thecauses of justice and peace ready benben the youth called to hisinvisible mentor looking about the room in hopes of finding him but all he sawwas yoda sitting across from him at the table 
 ready are you the skeptical yoda asked what know you of ready ihave trained jedi for eight hundred years my own counsel keep on who is to betrained 
 why not me luke asked insulted by insinuation 
 to become a jedi yoda said gravely takes the deepest commitment the mostserious mind 
 he can do it voice said in defense of the youth 
 looking toward the invisible kenobi yoda pointed at luke this one i havewatched a long time all his life has he looked awayto the horizon to the sky tothe future never his mind on where he was on what he was doing yoda shot a glaring look at luke a jedi craves not these things 
 luke tried to defend his past i have followed my feelings 
 you are reckless the jedi master shouted 
 he will learn came the soothing voice of kenobi 
 too old yoda argued yes too old too set in his ways to start thetraining 
 luke thought he heard a subtle softening in voice perhaps there wasstill a chance to sway him learned much luke said he give upnow he had come too far endured too much lost too much for that 
 yoda seemed to look right through luke as he spoke those words as if trying todetermine how much he had learned he turned to the invisible kenobi he finish what he begins yoda asked 
 come this far was the answer he is our only hope 
 i will not fail you luke said to both yoda and ben not afraid at that moment the young skywalker felt he could face anything without fear 
 but yoda was not so optimistic you will be my young one he jedi master turned slowly to face luke as a strange little smile appeared on hisblue face heh you will be

 he looked around nervously at the shadows in the jungle and felt and increasingly in doubt about his quest this certainly seems like astrange place to find a jedi master he said to the little robot gives me thecreeps 
 from the sound of his beep it was clear artoo shared opinion of theswamp world 
 although luke continued as he reluctantly tasted more of the food familiar about this place i feel like 
 you feel like what 
 that voice luke leaped up grabbed his pistol then spun into the gloom to try to find the source of those words 
 as he turned he saw a tiny creature standing directly in front of him lukeimmediately stepped back in surprise this little being seemed to have materialized outof nowhere it stood no more than half a meter in height fearlessly holding itsground in front of the towering youth who wielded an awesome laser pistol 
 the little wizened thing could have been any age its face was deeply lined butwas framed with elfin pointed ears that gave it a look of eternal youth long whitehair was parted down the middle and hung down on either side of the the being was bipedal and stood on short legs that terminated in reptilian feet it wore rags as gray as the mists of the swamp and in suchtatters that they must have approximated the very age 
 for the moment luke could not decide whether to be frightened or to when he gazed into those bulbous eyes and sensed the kindly nature herelaxed at last the creature motioned toward the pistol in hand 
 away put your weapon i mean you no harm it said 
 after some hesitation luke quietly put his pistol back into his belt as he didso he wondered why he felt impelled to obey this little creature 
 i am wondering the creature spoke again why are you here 
 looking for someone luke answered 
 looking looking the creature repeated curiously with a wide smilebeginning to crease his face found someone say 
 luke had to force himself not to smile yeah 
 help you i canyesyes 
 inexplicably luke found himself trusting the odd creature but at all surethat such a tiny individual could be of help on his important quest i thinkso he replied gently you see looking for a great warrior 
 a great warrior the creature shook his head the whitish hair floppingabout his pointed ears wars make one great 
 a strange phrase luke thought but before he could answer luke saw the tinyhominid hobble over to the top of the salvaged supply cases shocked he watchedas the creature began to rummage through the articles luke had brought with himfrom hoth 
 get away from there he said surprised at this sudden strange behavior 
 moving across the ground artoo waddled toward the pile of cases standing justabout at optical sensor level with the creature the droid squealed his disapproval ashe scanned the creature that was carelessly digging through the supplies 
 the strange being grabbed the container holding the remains of food andtook a bite 
 hey my dinner luke exclaimed 
 but no sooner had the creature taken his first bite than he spat out what he hadtasted his deeply lined face wrinkling like a prune peewh he said you no how get you so big eating food of this kind he looked luke upand down 
 before the astounded youth could reply the creature flipped the food container direction then dipped one of his small and delicate hands into another supplycase 
 listen friend luke said watching this bizarre scavenger we mean toland here and if i could get my fighter out of this puddle i would but i 
 get your ship out have you tried have you tried the creaturegoaded 
 luke had to admit to himself that he had not but then the whole idea waspatently ludicrous he have the proper equipment to 
 something in case had attracted the interest luke finallyreached the end of his patience when he saw the crazy little being snatch somethingout of the supply case knowing that survival depended on those supplies hegrabbed for the case but the creature held on to his miniature power lampthat he gripped tightly in his hand the little light came alive in hand throwing its radiance up into his delighted face and he immediatelybegan to examine his treasure 
 give me that luke cried 
 the creature retreated from the approaching youth like a petulant child or help you not 
 still clutching the lamp to his breast the creature stepped bumping into not remembering that the robot was at allanimate the being stood next to it as luke approached 
 i want your help luke said indignantly i want my lamp back it in this slimy mudhole 
 luke instantly realized he had issued an insult 
 mudhole slimy my home this is 
 as they argued artoo slowly reached out a mechanical arm suddenly hisappendage grabbed the pilfered lamp and immediately the two little figures wereengaged in a over the stolen prize as they spun about in battle artoobeeped a few electronic give me 
 mine mine give it back the creature cried abruptly though he seemedto give up the bizarre struggle and lightly poked the droid with one bluish finger 
 artoo emitted a loud startled squeal and immediately released the power lamp 
 the victor grinned at the glowing object in his tiny hands gleefully mine 
 luke was about fed up with these antics and advised the robot that the battle wasover okay artoo he said with a sigh let him have it now get out of fellow got things to do 
 no no the creature pleaded excitedly stay and help you find yourfriend 
 not looking for a friend luke said looking for a jedi master 
 oh the eyes widened as he spoke a jedi master differentaltogether yoda you seek yoda 
 mention of that name surprised luke but he felt skeptical how could an elflike this know anything about a great teacher of the jedi knights you know him 
 of course yes the creature said proudly take you to him but first wemust eat good food come come 
 with that the creature scurried out of camp and into the shadows of theswamp the tiny power lamp he carried was gradually dimming in the distance asluke stood feeling baffled at first he had no intention of pursuing the creature butall at once he found himself diving into the fog after him 
 as luke started off into the jungle he heard artoo whistling and beeping as if hewould blow his circuits luke turned around to see the little droid standing forlornlynext to the miniature fission furnace 
 better stay here and watch over the camp luke instructed the robot 
 but artoo only intensified his noisy output running through the entire gamut ofhis electronic articulations 
 artoo now settle down luke called as he ran into the jungle i can takecare of myself be safe okay 
 electronic grumbling grew fainter as luke hurried to catch up with thelittle guide i must really be out of my mind luke thought following this weirdbeing into but the creature had mentioned name andluke felt compelled to accept any help he could get to find the jedi master hestumbled in the dark over thick weeds and twisting roots as he pursued the flickeringlight ahead 
 the creature was chattering gaily as he led the way through the safeyes of course then in his odd little way thismysterious being started to laugh 
 two imperial cruisers slowly moved across the surface of the giant millennium falcon had to be hidden somewhere where 
 as the ships skimmed the surface of the asteroid they dropped bombs on itspockmarked terrain trying to scare out the freighter the shock waves from theexplosives violently shook the spheroid but there was no sign of the falcon as itdrifted above the asteroid one of the imperial star destroyers cast an eclipsingshadow across the tunnel entrance yet the scanners failed to not the curioushole in the bowllike wall within that hole in a winding tunnel not detected by theminions of the powerful empire sat the freighter it rattled and vibrated with everyexplosion that pounded the surface above 
 inside chewbacca worked feverishly to repair the complex powertrain he hadscrambled into an overhead compartment to get at the wires that operated thehyperdrive system but when he felt the first of the explosions he popped his headout through the mass of wires and gave out a worried yelp 
 princess leia who was welding a damaged valve stopped her work and lookedup the bombs sounded very close 
 glanced up at leia and nervously tilted his head oh my hesaid found us 
 everyone became quiet as if fearing that the sound of their voices mightsomehow carry and betray their exact position again the ship was shaken by a intense than the last 
 moving away leia said 
 han saw through their tactic just trying to see if they can stir upsomething he told her safe if we stay put 
 where have i heard that line before leia said with an innocent air 
 ignoring her sarcasm han moved past her as he went back to work thepassageway in the hold was so narrow that he avoid brushing against her ashe passed could he 
 with mixed emotions the princess watched him for a moment as he continued towork on his ship and then she turned back to her welding 
 ignored all this odd human behavior he was too busy trying tocommunicate with the falcon trying to find out what was wrong with its at the central control panel threepio was making uncharacteristic whistleand beep sounds a moment later the control panel whistled back 
 where is artoo when i need him sighed the golden robot the response had been difficult for him to interpret i know where yourship learned to communicate threepio announced to han but its dialect leavessomething to be desired i believe sir it says the power coupling on the negativeaxis has been polarized afraid have to replace it 
 of course have to replace it han snapped then called up to was peering from the ceiling compartment replace it he whispered 
 he noticed that leia had finished her welding but was having trouble reengagingthe valve struggling with a lever that simply would not budge he moved towardher and began offering to help but she coldly turned her back to him and continuedher battle with the valve 
 easy your worship he said only trying to help 
 still struggling with the lever leia asked quietly would you please stop callingme that 
 han was surprised at the simple tone he had expected a stingingretort or at best a cold silence but her words were missing the mocking tone thathe was accustomed to hearing was she finally bringing their relentless battle ofwills to an end sure he said gently 
 you make things difficult sometimes leia said as she shyly glanced at him 
 he had to agree i do i really do but he added you could be a little come on admit it sometimes you think all right 
 she let go of the lever and rubbed her sore hand sometimes she said with alittle smile maybeoccasionally when you acting the scoundrel 
 scoundrel he laughed finding her choice of words endearing i like thesound of that 
 without another word he reached for hand and began to massage it 
 stop it leia protested 
 han continued to hold her hand stop what he asked softly 
 leia felt flustered confused hundred things in that her sense of dignity prevailed stop that she said regally my hands aredirty 
 han smiled at her feeble excuse but held on to her hand and looked right intoher eyes my hands are dirty too what are you afraid of 
 afraid she returned his direct gaze of getting my hand dirty 
 why trembling he asked he could see that she was affectedby his closeness and by his touch and her expression softened whereupon hereached out and took her other hand 
 i think you like me because a scoundrel he said i think you enough scoundrels in your life as he spoke he slowly drew her near 
 leia resist his gentle pull now as she looked at him she thought he hadnever seemed more handsome but she was still the princess i happen to like nicemen she chided in a whisper 
 and not nice han asked teasing 
 chewbacca stuck his head out from the overhead compartment and watched theproceedings unnoticed 
 yes she whispered but you 
 before she could finish han solo drew her to him and felt her body tremble ashe pressed his lips to hers it seemed forever it seemed an eternity to share betweenthem as he gently bent her body back this time she resist at all 
 when they parted luke needed a moment to catch her breath she tried toregain her composure and work up a measure of indignation but she found it difficultto talk 
 okay hot shot she began i 
 but then she stopped and suddenly found herself kissing him pulling him evencloser than before 
 when their lips finally parted han held leia in his arms as they looked at eachother for a long moment there was a peaceful kind of emotion between leia began to draw away her thoughts and feelings a turmoil she averted hereyes and began to disengage herself from embrace in the next second sheturned and rushed from the cabin 
 han silently looked after her as she left the room he then became acutelyaware of the very curious wookiee whose head was poking from the ceiling 
 okay chewie he bellowed give me a hand with this valve 
 the fog dispersed by a torrent of rain snaked around the swamp in diaphanousswirls scooting along amid the pounding rain was a single r droid looking for hismaster 
 sensing devices were busily sending impulses to his electronicnerve ends at the slightest sound his auditory systems sent information to the nervous computer brain 
 it was too wet for artoo in this murky jungle he aimed his optical sensors inthe direction of a strange little mud house on the edge of a dark lake the by an perception of loneliness moved closer to the windowof the tiny abode artoo extended his utility feet toward the window and peekedinside he hoped no one inside noticed the slight shiver of his form orheard his nervous little electronic whimper 
 somehow luke skywalker managed to squeeze inside the miniature everything within was perfectly scaled to its tiny resident luke on the dried mud floor in the living room careful not to bang his skullagainst the low ceiling there was a table in front of him and he could see a fewcontainers holding what appeared to be scrolls 
 the creature was in his kitchen next to the living room busilyconcocting an incredible meal from where luke sat he could see the little cookstirring steaming pots chopping this shredding that scattering herbs over all andscurrying back and forth to put platters on the table in front of the youth 
 fascinated as he was by this bustling activity luke was growing very the creature made one of his frantic runs into the living room area luke remindedhis host i told you not hungry 
 patience the creature said as he scuttled back into the steamy time to eat 
 luke tried to be polite look he said it smells good sure but i know why we see yoda now 
 the time to eat too the creature answered 
 but luke was eager to be on his way will it take long to get there how faris he 
 not far not far be patient soon you will see him why wish you becomea jedi 
 because of my father i guess luke answered as he reflected that he neverreally knew his father that well in truth his deepest kinship with his father wasthrough the lightsaber ben had entrusted to him 
 luke noticed the curious look in the eyes as he mentioned his your father the being said sitting down to begin his vast meal a powerfuljedi was he powerful jedi 
 the youth wondered if the creature were mocking him how could you knowmy father he asked a little angrily you even know who i am heglanced around at the bizarre room and shook his head i know what here 
 then he noticed that the creature had turned away from him and was talking to acorner of the room this really is the final straw luke thought now thisimpossible creature is talking to thin air 
 no good is this the creature was saying irritably this will not do icannot teach him the boy has no patience 
 head spun in the direction the creature was facing cannot teach nopatience bewildered he still saw no one there then the truth of the situationgradually became as plain to him as the deep lines on the little he was being by none other than yoda himself 
 from the empty corner of the room luke heard the gentle wise voice of benkenobi responding to yoda he will learn patience ben said 
 much anger in him the dwarfish jedi teacher persisted like in his father 
 discussed this before kenobi said 
 luke could no longer wait i can be a jedi he interrupted it meant morethan anything else to him to become a part of the noble band that had championed thecauses of justice and peace ready benben the youth called to hisinvisible mentor looking about the room in hopes of finding him but all he sawwas yoda sitting across from him at the table 
 ready are you the skeptical yoda asked what know you of ready ihave trained jedi for eight hundred years my own counsel keep on who is to betrained 
 why not me luke asked insulted by insinuation 
 to become a jedi yoda said gravely takes the deepest commitment the mostserious mind 
 he can do it voice said in defense of the youth 
 looking toward the invisible kenobi yoda pointed at luke this one i havewatched a long time all his life has he looked awayto the horizon to the sky tothe future never his mind on where he was on what he was doing yoda shot a glaring look at luke a jedi craves not these things 
 luke tried to defend his past i have followed my feelings 
 you are reckless the jedi master shouted 
 he will learn came the soothing voice of kenobi 
 too old yoda argued yes too old too set in his ways to start thetraining 
 luke thought he heard a subtle softening in voice perhaps there wasstill a chance to sway him learned much luke said he give upnow he had come too far endured too much lost too much for that 
 yoda seemed to look right through luke as he spoke those words as if trying todetermine how much he had learned he turned to the invisible kenobi he finish what he begins yoda asked 
 come this far was the answer he is our only hope 
 i will not fail you luke said to both yoda and ben not afraid at that moment the young skywalker felt he could face anything without fear 
 but yoda was not so optimistic you will be my young one he jedi master turned slowly to face luke as a strange little smile appeared on hisblue face heh you will be

 while these conversations were going on in the reception room and the princess room a carriage containing pierre who had been sent for and anna mikhaylovna who found it necessary to accompany him was driving into the court of count house as the wheels rolled softly over the straw beneath the windows anna mikhaylovna having turned with words of comfort to her companion realized that he was asleep in his corner and woke him up rousing himself pierre followed anna mikhaylovna out of the carriage and only then began to think of the interview with his dying father which awaited him he noticed that they had not come to the front entrance but to the back door while he was getting down from the carriage steps two men who looked like tradespeople ran hurriedly from the entrance and hid in the shadow of the wall pausing for a moment pierre noticed several other men of the same kind hiding in the shadow of the house on both sides but neither anna mikhaylovna nor the footman nor the coachman who could not help seeing these people took any notice of them it seems to be all right pierre concluded and followed anna mikhaylovna she hurriedly ascended the narrow dimly lit stone staircase calling to pierre who was lagging behind to follow though he did not see why it was necessary for him to go to the count at all still less why he had to go by the back stairs yet judging by anna air of assurance and haste pierre concluded that it was all absolutely necessary halfway up the stairs they were almost knocked over by some men who carrying pails came running downstairs their boots clattering these men pressed close to the wall to let pierre and anna mikhaylovna pass and did not evince the least surprise at seeing them there 
 is this the way to the princesses apartments asked anna mikhaylovna of one of them 
 yes replied a footman in a bold loud voice as if anything were now permissible the door to the left 
 perhaps the count did not ask for me said pierre when he reached the landing better go to my own room 
 anna mikhaylovna paused and waited for him to come up 
 ah my friend she said touching his arm as she had done her when speaking to him that afternoon believe me i suffer no less than you do but be a man 
 but really i better go away he asked looking kindly at her over his spectacles 
 ah my dear friend forget the wrongs that may have been done you think that he is your father perhaps in the agony of death she sighed i have loved you like a son from the first trust yourself to me pierre i shall not forget your interests 
 pierre did not understand a word but the conviction that all this had to be grew stronger and he meekly followed anna mikhaylovna who was already opening a door 
 this door led into a back anteroom an old man a servant of the princesses sat in a corner knitting a stocking pierre had never been in this part of the house and did not even know of the existence of these rooms anna mikhaylovna addressing a maid who was hurrying past with a decanter on a tray as my dear and my sweet asked about the princess health and then led pierre along a stone passage the first door on the left led into the princesses apartments the maid with the decanter in her haste had not closed the door everything in the house was done in haste at that time and pierre and anna mikhaylovna in passing instinctively glanced into the room where prince vasili and the eldest princess were sitting close together talking seeing them pass prince vasili drew back with obvious impatience while the princess jumped up and with a gesture of desperation slammed the door with all her might 
 this action was so unlike her usual composure and the fear depicted on prince face so out of keeping with his dignity that pierre stopped and glanced inquiringly over his spectacles at his guide anna mikhaylovna evinced no surprise she only smiled faintly and sighed as if to say that this was no more than she had expected 
 be a man my friend i will look after your interests said she in reply to his look and went still faster along the passage 
 pierre could not make out what it was all about and still less what watching over his interests meant but he decided that all these things had to be from the passage they went into a large dimly lit room adjoining the reception room it was one of those sumptuous but cold apartments known to pierre only from the front approach but even in this room there now stood an empty bath and water had been spilled on the carpet they were met by a deacon with a censer and by a servant who passed out on tiptoe without heeding them they went into the reception room familiar to pierre with two italian windows opening into the conservatory with its large bust and full length portrait of catherine the great the same people were still sitting here in almost the same positions as before whispering to one another all became silent and turned to look at the pale anna mikhaylovna as she entered and at the big stout figure of pierre who hanging his head meekly followed her 
 anna face expressed a consciousness that the decisive moment had arrived with the air of a practical petersburg lady she now keeping pierre close beside her entered the room even more boldly than that afternoon she felt that as she brought with her the person the dying man wished to see her own admission was assured casting a rapid glance at all those in the room and noticing the confessor there she glided up to him with a sort of amble not exactly bowing yet seeming to grow suddenly smaller and respectfully received the blessing first of one and then of another priest 
 god be thanked that you are in time said she to one of the priests all we relatives have been in such anxiety this young man is the son she added more softly what a terrible moment 
 having said this she went up to the doctor 
 dear doctor said she this young man is the son is there any hope 
 the doctor cast a rapid glance upwards and silently shrugged his shoulders anna mikhaylovna with just the same movement raised her shoulders and eyes almost closing the latter sighed and moved away from the doctor to pierre to him in a particularly respectful and tenderly sad voice she said 
 trust in his mercy and pointing out a small sofa for him to sit and wait for her she went silently toward the door that everyone was watching and it creaked very slightly as she disappeared behind it 
 pierre having made up his mind to obey his monitress implicitly moved toward the sofa she had indicated as soon as anna mikhaylovna had disappeared he noticed that the eyes of all in the room turned to him with something more than curiosity and sympathy he noticed that they whispered to one another casting significant looks at him with a kind of awe and even servility a deference such as he had never before received was shown him a strange lady the one who had been talking to the priests rose and offered him her seat an picked up and returned a glove pierre had dropped the doctors became respectfully silent as he passed by and moved to make way for him at first pierre wished to take another seat so as not to trouble the lady and also to pick up the glove himself and to pass round the doctors who were not even in his way but all at once he felt that this would not do and that tonight he was a person obliged to perform some sort of awful rite which everyone expected of him and that he was therefore bound to accept their services he took the glove in silence from the and sat down in the chair placing his huge hands symmetrically on his knees in the naive attitude of an egyptian statue and decided in his own mind that all was as it should be and that in order not to lose his head and do foolish things he must not act on his own ideas tonight but must yield himself up entirely to the will of those who were guiding him 
 not two minutes had passed before prince vasili with head erect majestically entered the room he was wearing his long coat with three stars on his breast he seemed to have grown thinner since the morning his eyes seemed larger than usual when he glanced round and noticed pierre he went up to him took his hand a thing he never used to do and drew it downwards as if wishing to ascertain whether it was firmly fixed on 
 courage courage my friend he has asked to see you that is well and he turned to go 
 but pierre thought it necessary to ask how is and hesitated not knowing whether it would be proper to call the dying man the count yet ashamed to call him father 
 he had another stroke about half an hour ago courage my friend 
 mind was in such a confused state that the word stroke suggested to him a blow from something he looked at prince vasili in perplexity and only later grasped that a stroke was an attack of illness prince vasili said something to lorrain in passing and went through the door on tiptoe he could not walk well on tiptoe and his whole body jerked at each step the eldest princess followed him and the priests and deacons and some servants also went in at the door through that door was heard a noise of things being moved about and at last anna mikhaylovna still with the same expression pale but resolute in the discharge of duty ran out and touching pierre lightly on the arm said 
 the divine mercy is inexhaustible unction is about to be administered come

 chapter 
 
 summer drew to an end and early autumn it was past michaelmas but the harvest was late that year and a few of our fields were still uncleared mr linton and his daughter would frequently walk out among the reapers at the carrying of the last sheaves they stayed till dusk and the evening happening to be chill and damp my master caught a bad cold that settling obstinately on his lungs confined him indoors throughout the whole of the winter nearly without intermission 
 poor cathy frightened from her little romance had been considerably sadder and duller since its abandonment and her father insisted on her reading less and taking more exercise she had his companionship no longer i esteemed it a duty to supply its lack as much as possible with mine an inefficient substitute for i could only spare two or three hours from my numerous diurnal occupations to follow her footsteps and then my society was obviously less desirable than his 
 on an afternoon in october or the beginning of fresh watery afternoon when the turf and paths were rustling with moist withered leaves and the cold blue sky was half hidden by grey streamers rapidly mounting from the west and boding abundant requested my young lady to forego her ramble because i was certain of showers she refused and i unwillingly donned a cloak and took my umbrella to accompany her on a stroll to the bottom of the park a formal walk which she generally affected if that she invariably was when mr edgar had been worse than ordinary a thing never known from his confession but guessed both by her and me from his increased silence and the melancholy of his countenance she went sadly on there was no running or bounding now though the chill wind might well have tempted her to a race and often from the side of my eye i could detect her raising a hand and brushing something off her cheek i gazed round for a means of diverting her thoughts on one side of the road rose a high rough bank where hazels and stunted oaks with their roots half exposed held uncertain tenure the soil was too loose for the latter and strong winds had blown some nearly horizontal in summer miss catherine delighted to climb along these trunks and sit in the branches swinging twenty feet above the ground and i pleased with her agility and her light childish heart still considered it proper to scold every time i caught her at such an elevation but so that she knew there was no necessity for descending from dinner to tea she would lie in her cradle doing nothing except singing old nursery herself or watching the birds joint tenants feed and entice their young ones to fly or nestling with closed lids half thinking half dreaming happier than words can express 
 look miss i exclaimed pointing to a nook under the roots of one twisted tree winter is not here yet a little flower up yonder the last bud from the multitude of bluebells that clouded those turf steps in july with a lilac mist will you clamber up and pluck it to show to papa 
 cathy stared a long time at the lonely blossom trembling in its earthy shelter and replied at length 
 no not touch it but it looks melancholy does it not ellen 
 yes i observed about as starved and sackless as you your cheeks are bloodless let us take hold of hands and run so low i dare say i shall keep up with you 
 no she repeated and continued sauntering on pausing at intervals to muse over a bit of moss or a tuft of blanched grass or a fungus spreading its bright orange among the heaps of brown foliage and ever and anon her hand was lifted to her averted face 
 catherine why are you crying love i asked approaching and putting my arm over her shoulder you cry because papa has a cold be thankful it is nothing worse 
 she now put no further restraint on her tears her breath was stifled by sobs 
 oh it will be something worse she said and what shall i do when papa and you leave me and i am by myself i forget your words ellen they are always in my ear how life will be changed how dreary the world will be when papa and you are dead 
 none can tell whether you die before us i replied wrong to anticipate evil hope there are years and years to come before any of us go master is young and i am strong and hardly my mother lived till eighty a canty dame to the last and suppose mr linton were spared till he saw sixty that would be more years than you have counted miss and would it not be foolish to mourn a calamity above twenty years beforehand 
 but aunt isabella was younger than papa she remarked gazing up with timid hope to seek further consolation 
 aunt isabella had not you and me to nurse her i replied she as happy as master she as much to live for all you need do is to wait well on your father and cheer him by letting him see you cheerful and avoid giving him anxiety on any subject mind that cathy not disguise but you might kill him if you were wild and reckless and cherished a foolish fanciful affection for the son of a person who would be glad to have him in his grave and allowed him to discover that you fretted over the separation he had judged it expedient to make 
 i fret about nothing on earth except illness answered my companion i care for nothing in comparison with papa and never while i have my senses do an act or say a word to vex him i love him better than myself ellen and i know it by this i pray every night that i may live after him because i would rather be miserable than that he should be that proves i love him better than myself 
 good words i replied but deeds must prove it also and after he is well remember you forget resolutions formed in the hour of fear 
 as we talked we neared a door that opened on the road and my young lady lightening into sunshine again climbed up and seated herself on the top of the wall reaching over to gather some hips that bloomed scarlet on the summit branches of the wild rose trees shadowing the highway side the lower fruit had disappeared but only birds could touch the upper except from present station in stretching to pull them her hat fell off and as the door was locked she proposed scrambling down to recover it i bid her be cautious lest she got a fall and she nimbly disappeared but the return was no such easy matter the stones were smooth and neatly cemented and the and blackberry stragglers could yield no assistance in i like a fool recollect that till i heard her laughing and exclaiming 
 ellen have to fetch the key or else i must run round to the lodge i scale the ramparts on this side 
 stay where you are i answered i have my bundle of keys in my pocket perhaps i may manage to open it if not go 
 catherine amused herself with dancing to and fro before the door while i tried all the large keys in succession i had applied the last and found that none would do so repeating my desire that she would remain there i was about to hurry home as fast as i could when an approaching sound arrested me it was the trot of a horse dance stopped and in a minute the horse stopped also 
 who is that i whispered 
 ellen i wish you could open the door whispered back my companion anxiously 
 ho miss linton cried a deep voice the glad to meet you be in haste to enter for i have an explanation to ask and obtain 
 i speak to you mr heathcliff answered catherine papa says you are a wicked man and you hate both him and me and ellen says the same 
 that is nothing to the purpose said heathcliff he it was i hate my son i suppose and it is concerning him that i demand your attention yes you have cause to blush two or three months since were you not in the habit of writing to linton making love in play eh you deserved both of you flogging for that you especially the elder and less sensitive as it turns out got your letters and if you give me any pertness send them to your father i presume you grew weary of the amusement and dropped it you well you dropped linton with it into a slough of despond he was in earnest in love really as true as i live dying for you breaking his heart at your fickleness not figuratively but actually though hareton has made him a standing jest for six weeks and i have used more serious measures and attempted to frighten him out of his idiotcy he gets worse daily and be under the sod before summer unless you restore him 
 how can you lie so glaringly to the poor child i called from the inside pray ride on how can you deliberately get up such paltry falsehoods miss cathy knock the lock off with a stone you believe that vile nonsense you can feel in yourself it is impossible that a person should die for love of a stranger 
 i was not aware there were eavesdroppers muttered the detected villain worthy mrs dean i like you but i like your he added aloud how could you lie so glaringly as to affirm i hated the poor child and invent bugbear stories to terrify her from my doorstones catherine linton the very name warms me my bonnie lass i shall be from home all this week go and see if i have not spoken truth do a darling just imagine your father in my place and linton in yours then think how you would value your careless lover if he refused to stir a step to comfort you when your father himself entreated him and from pure stupidity fall into the same error i swear on my salvation going to his grave and none but you can save him 
 the lock gave way and i issued out 
 i swear linton is dying repeated heathcliff looking hard at me and grief and disappointment are hastening his death nelly if you let her go you can walk over yourself but i shall not return till this time next week and i think your master himself would scarcely object to her visiting her cousin 
 come in said i taking cathy by the arm and her to for she lingered viewing with troubled eyes the features of the speaker too stern to express his inward deceit 
 he pushed his horse close and bending down observed 
 miss catherine owe to you that i have little patience with linton and hareton and joseph have less own that with a harsh set he pines for kindness as well as love and a kind word from you would be his best medicine mind mrs cruel cautions but be generous and contrive to see him he dreams of you day and night and cannot be persuaded that you hate him since you neither write nor call 
 i closed the door and rolled a stone to assist the loosened lock in holding it and spreading my umbrella i drew my charge underneath for the rain began to drive through the moaning branches of the trees and warned us to avoid delay our hurry prevented any comment on the encounter with heathcliff as we stretched towards home but i divined instinctively that heart was clouded now in double darkness her features were so sad they did not seem hers she evidently regarded what she had heard as every syllable true 
 the master had retired to rest before we came in cathy stole to his room to inquire how he was he had fallen asleep she returned and asked me to sit with her in the library we took our tea together and afterwards she lay down on the rug and told me not to talk for she was weary i got a book and pretended to read as soon as she supposed me absorbed in my occupation she recommenced her silent weeping it appeared at present her favourite diversion i suffered her to enjoy it a while then i expostulated deriding and ridiculing all mr assertions about his son as if i were certain she would coincide alas i skill to counteract the effect his account had produced it was just what he intended 
 you may be right ellen she answered but i shall never feel at ease till i know and i must tell linton it is not my fault that i write and convince him that i shall not change 
 what use were anger and protestations against her silly credulity we parted that but next day beheld me on the road to wuthering heights by the side of my wilful young pony i bear to witness her sorrow to see her pale dejected countenance and heavy eyes and i yielded in the faint hope that linton himself might prove by his reception of us how little of the tale was founded on fact

 chapter 
 
 like sunshine after a storm were the peaceful weeks which followed the invalids improved rapidly and mr march began to talk or returning early in the new year beth was soon able to lie on the study sofa all day amusing herself with the cats at first and in time with sewing which had fallen sadly behindhand her once active limbs were so stiff and feeble that jo took her for a daily airing about the house in her strong arms meg cheerfully blackened and burned her white hands cooking delicate messes for the dear while amy a loyal slave of the ring celebrated her return by giving away as many of her treasures as she could prevail on her sisters to accept 
 as christmas approached the usual mysteries began to haunt the house and jo frequently convulsed the family by proposing utterly impossible or magnificently absurd ceremonies in honor of this unusually merry christmas laurie was equally impracticable and would have had bonfires skyrockets and triumphal arches if he had had his own way after many skirmishes and snubbings the ambitious pair were considered effectually quenched and went about with forlorn faces which were rather belied by explosions of laughter when the two got together 
 several days of unusually mild weather fitly ushered in a splendid christmas day hannah felt in her bones that it was going to be an unusually fine day and she proved herself a true prophetess for everybody and everything seemed bound to produce a grand success to begin with mr march wrote that he should soon be with them then beth felt uncommonly well that morning and being dressed in her gift a soft crimson merino wrapper was borne in high triumph to the window to behold the offering of jo and laurie the unquenchables had done their best to be worthy of the name for like elves they had worked by night and conjured up a comical surprise out in the garden stood a stately snow maiden crowned with holly bearing a basket of fruit and flowers in one hand a great roll of music in the other a perfect rainbow of an afghan round her chilly shoulders and a christmas carol issuing from her lips on a pink paper streamer 
 
 the jungfrau to beth 
 god bless you dear queen bess 
 may nothing you dismay 
 but health and peace and happiness 
 be yours this christmas day 
 fruit to feed our busy bee 
 and flowers for her nose 
 music for her pianee 
 an afghan for her toes 
 a portrait of joanna see 
 by raphael no 
 ho laboured with great industry 
 to make it fair and true 
 accept a ribbon red i beg 
 for madam tail 
 and ice cream made by lovely peg 
 a mont blanc in a pail 
 their dearest love my makers laid 
 within my breast of snow 
 accept it and the alpine maid 
 from laurie and from jo 
 
 how beth laughed when she saw it how laurie ran up and down to bring in the gifts and what ridiculous speeches jo made as she presented them 
 so full of happiness that if father was only here i hold one drop more said beth quite sighing with contentment as jo carried her off to the study to rest after the excitement and to refresh herself with some of the delicious grapes the jungfrau had sent her 
 so am i added jo slapping the pocket wherein reposed the undine and sintram 
 sure i am echoed amy poring over the engraved copy of the madonna and child which her mother had given her in a pretty frame 
 of course i am cried meg smoothing the silvery folds of her first sild dress for mr laurence had insisted on giving it how can i be otherwise said mrs march gratefully as her eyes went from her letter to smiling face and her hand carressed the brooch made of gray and golden chestnut and dark brown hair which the girls had just fastened on her breast 
 now and then in this workaday world things do happen in the delightful storybook fashion and what a comfort it is half an hour after everyone had said they were so happy they could only hold one drop more the drop came laurie opened the parlor door and popped his head in very quietly he might just as well have turned a somersault and uttered an indian war whoop for his face was so full of suppressed excitement and his voice so treacherously joyful that everyone jumped up though he only said in a queer breathless voice another christmas present for the march family 
 before the words were well out of his mouth he was whisked away somehow and in his place appeared a tall man muffled up to the eyes leaning on the arm of another tall man who tried to say something and of course there was a general stampede and for several minutes everybody seemed to lose their wits for the strangest things were done and no one said a word 
 mr march became invisible in the embrace of four pairs of loving arms jo disgraced herself by nearly fainting away and had to be doctored by laurie in the china closet mr brooke kissed meg entirely by mistake as he somewhat incoherently explained and amy the dignified tumbled over a stool and never stopping to get up hugged and cried over her boots in the most touching manner mrs march was the first to recover herself and held up her hand with a warning hush remember beth 
 but it was too late the study door flew open the little red wrapper appeared on the threshold joy put strength into the feeble limbs and beth ran straight into her arms never mind what happened just after that for the full hearts overflowed washing away the bitterness of the past and leaving only the sweetness of the present 
 it was not at all romantic but a hearty laugh set everybody straight again for hannah was discovered behind the door sobbing over the fat turkey which she had forgotten to put down when she rushed up from the kitchen as the laugh subsided mrs march began to thank mr brooke for his faithful care of her husband at which mr brooke suddenly remembered that mr march needed rest and seizing laurie he precipitately retired then the two invalids were ordered to repose which they did by both sitting in one big chair and talking hard 
 mr march told how he had longed to surprise them and how when the fine weather came he had been allowed by his doctor to take advantage of it how devoted brooke had been and how he was altogether a most estimable and upright young man why mr march paused a minute just there and after a glance at meg who was violently poking the fire looked at his wife with an inquiring lift of the eyebrows i leave you to imagine also why mrs march gently nodded her head and asked rather abruptly if he like to have something to eat jo saw and understood the look and she stalked grimly away to get wine and beef tea muttering to herself as she slammed the door i hate estimable young men with brown eyes 
 there never was such a christmas dinner as they had that day the fat turkey was a sight to behold when hannah sent him up stuffed browned and decorated so was the plum pudding which melted in mouth likewise the jellies in which amy reveled like a fly in a honeypot everything turned out well which was a mercy hannah said for my mind was that flustered mum that a merrycle i roast the pudding and stuff the turkey with raisins let alone bilin of it in a cloth 
 mr laurence and his grandson dined with them also mr brooke at whom jo glowered darkly to infinite amusement two easy chairs stood side by side at the head of the table in which sat beth and her father feasting modestly on chicken and a little fruit they drank healths told stories sang songs reminisced as the old folks say and had a thoroughly good time a sleigh ride had been planned but the girls would not leave their father so the guests departed early and as twilight gathered the happy family sat together round the fire 
 just a year ago we were groaning over the dismal christmas we expected to have do you remember asked jo breaking a short pause which had followed a long conversation about many things 
 rather a pleasant year on the whole said meg smiling at the fire and congratulating herself on having treated mr brooke with dignity 
 i think been a pretty hard one observed amy watching the light shine on her ring with thoughtful eyes 
 glad over because got you back whispered beth who sat on her knee 
 rather a rough road for you to travel my little pilgrims especially the latter part of it but you have got on bravely and i think the burdens are in a fair way to tumble off very soon said mr march looking with fatherly satisfaction at the four young faces gathered round him 
 how do you know did mother tell you asked jo 
 not much straws show which way the wind blows and made several discoveries today 
 oh tell us what they are cried meg who sat beside him 
 here is one and taking up the hand which lay on the arm of his chair he pointed to the roughened forefinger a burn on the back and two or three little hard spots on the palm i remember a time when this hand was white and smooth and your first care was to keep it so it was very pretty then but to me it is much prettier now for in this seeming blemishes i read a little history a burnt offering has been made to vanity this hardened palm has earned something better than blisters and sure the sewing done by these pricked fingers will last a long time so much good will went into the stitches meg my dear i value the womanly skill which keeps home happy more than white hands or fashionable accomplishments proud to shake this good industrious little hand and hope i shall not soon be asked to give it away 
 if meg had wanted a reward for hours of patient labor she received it in the hearty pressure of her hand and the approving smile he gave her 
 what about jo please say something nice for she has tried so hard and been so very very good to me said beth in her ear 
 he laughed and looked across at the tall girl who sat opposite with and unusually mild expression in her face 
 in spite of the curly crop i see the son jo whom i left a year ago said mr march i see a young lady who pins her collar straight laces her boots neatly and neither whistles talks slang nor lies on the rug as she used to do her face is rather thin and pale just now with watching and anxiety but i like to look at it for it has grown gentler and her voice is lower she bounce but moves quietly and takes care of a certain little person in a motherly way which delights me i rather miss my wild girl but if i get a strong helpful tenderhearted woman in her place i shall feel quite satisfied i know whether the shearing sobered our black sheep but i do know that in all washington i find anything beautiful enough to be bought with the dollars my good girl sent me 
 keen eyes were rather dim for a minute and her thin face grew rosy in the firelight as she received her praise feeling that she did deserve a portion of it 
 now beth said amy longing for her turn but ready to wait 
 so little of her afraid to say much for fear she will slip away altogether though she is not so shy as she used to be began their father cheerfully but recollecting how nearly he had lost her he held her close saying tenderly with her cheek against his own got you safe my beth and keep you so please god 
 after a silence he looked down at amy who sat on the cricket at his feet and said with a caress of the shining hair 
 i observed that amy took drumsticks at dinner ran errands for her mother all the afternoon gave meg her place tonight and has waited on every on with patience and good humor i also observe that she does not fret much nor look in the glass and has not even mentioned a very pretty ring which she wears so i conclude that she has learned to think of other people more and of herself less and has decided to try and mold her character as carefully as she molds her little clay figures i am glad of this for though i should be very proud of a graceful statue made by her i shall be infinitely prouder of a lovable daughter with a talent for making life beautiful to herself and others 
 what are you thinking of beth asked jo when amy had thanked her father and told about her ring 
 i read in progress today how after many troubles christian and hopeful came to a pleasant green meadow where lilies bloomed all year round and there they rested happily as we do now before they went on to their end answered beth adding as she slipped out of her arms and went to the instrument singing time now and i want to be in my old place try to sing the song of the shepherd boy which the pilgrims heard i made the music for father because he likes the verses 
 so sitting at the dear little piano beth softly touched the keys and in the sweet voice they had never thought to hear again sang to her own accompaniment the quaint hymn which was a singularly fitting song for her 
 he that is down need fear no fall 
 he that is low no pride 
 he that is humble ever shall 
 have god to be his guide 
 i am content with what i have 
 little be it or much 
 and lord contentment still i crave 
 because thou savest such 
 fulness to them a burden is 
 that go on pilgrimage 
 here little and hereafter bliss 
 is best from age to age

 several days of unusually mild weather fitly ushered in a splendid christmas day hannah felt in her bones that it was going to be an unusually fine day and she proved herself a true prophetess for everybody and everything seemed bound to produce a grand success to begin with mr march wrote that he should soon be with them then beth felt uncommonly well that morning and being dressed in her gift a soft crimson merino wrapper was borne in high triumph to the window to behold the offering of jo and laurie the unquenchables had done their best to be worthy of the name for like elves they had worked by night and conjured up a comical surprise out in the garden stood a stately snow maiden crowned with holly bearing a basket of fruit and flowers in one hand a great roll of music in the other a perfect rainbow of an afghan round her chilly shoulders and a christmas carol issuing from her lips on a pink paper streamer 
 
 the jungfrau to beth 
 god bless you dear queen bess 
 may nothing you dismay 
 but health and peace and happiness 
 be yours this christmas day 
 fruit to feed our busy bee 
 and flowers for her nose 
 music for her pianee 
 an afghan for her toes 
 a portrait of joanna see 
 by raphael no 
 ho laboured with great industry 
 to make it fair and true 
 accept a ribbon red i beg 
 for madam tail 
 and ice cream made by lovely peg 
 a mont blanc in a pail 
 their dearest love my makers laid 
 within my breast of snow 
 accept it and the alpine maid 
 from laurie and from jo 
 
 how beth laughed when she saw it how laurie ran up and down to bring in the gifts and what ridiculous speeches jo made as she presented them 
 so full of happiness that if father was only here i hold one drop more said beth quite sighing with contentment as jo carried her off to the study to rest after the excitement and to refresh herself with some of the delicious grapes the jungfrau had sent her 
 so am i added jo slapping the pocket wherein reposed the undine and sintram 
 sure i am echoed amy poring over the engraved copy of the madonna and child which her mother had given her in a pretty frame 
 of course i am cried meg smoothing the silvery folds of her first sild dress for mr laurence had insisted on giving it how can i be otherwise said mrs march gratefully as her eyes went from her letter to smiling face and her hand carressed the brooch made of gray and golden chestnut and dark brown hair which the girls had just fastened on her breast 
 now and then in this workaday world things do happen in the delightful storybook fashion and what a comfort it is half an hour after everyone had said they were so happy they could only hold one drop more the drop came laurie opened the parlor door and popped his head in very quietly he might just as well have turned a somersault and uttered an indian war whoop for his face was so full of suppressed excitement and his voice so treacherously joyful that everyone jumped up though he only said in a queer breathless voice another christmas present for the march family 
 before the words were well out of his mouth he was whisked away somehow and in his place appeared a tall man muffled up to the eyes leaning on the arm of another tall man who tried to say something and of course there was a general stampede and for several minutes everybody seemed to lose their wits for the strangest things were done and no one said a word 
 mr march became invisible in the embrace of four pairs of loving arms jo disgraced herself by nearly fainting away and had to be doctored by laurie in the china closet mr brooke kissed meg entirely by mistake as he somewhat incoherently explained and amy the dignified tumbled over a stool and never stopping to get up hugged and cried over her boots in the most touching manner mrs march was the first to recover herself and held up her hand with a warning hush remember beth 
 but it was too late the study door flew open the little red wrapper appeared on the threshold joy put strength into the feeble limbs and beth ran straight into her arms never mind what happened just after that for the full hearts overflowed washing away the bitterness of the past and leaving only the sweetness of the present 
 it was not at all romantic but a hearty laugh set everybody straight again for hannah was discovered behind the door sobbing over the fat turkey which she had forgotten to put down when she rushed up from the kitchen as the laugh subsided mrs march began to thank mr brooke for his faithful care of her husband at which mr brooke suddenly remembered that mr march needed rest and seizing laurie he precipitately retired then the two invalids were ordered to repose which they did by both sitting in one big chair and talking hard 
 mr march told how he had longed to surprise them and how when the fine weather came he had been allowed by his doctor to take advantage of it how devoted brooke had been and how he was altogether a most estimable and upright young man why mr march paused a minute just there and after a glance at meg who was violently poking the fire looked at his wife with an inquiring lift of the eyebrows i leave you to imagine also why mrs march gently nodded her head and asked rather abruptly if he like to have something to eat jo saw and understood the look and she stalked grimly away to get wine and beef tea muttering to herself as she slammed the door i hate estimable young men with brown eyes 
 there never was such a christmas dinner as they had that day the fat turkey was a sight to behold when hannah sent him up stuffed browned and decorated so was the plum pudding which melted in mouth likewise the jellies in which amy reveled like a fly in a honeypot everything turned out well which was a mercy hannah said for my mind was that flustered mum that a merrycle i roast the pudding and stuff the turkey with raisins let alone bilin of it in a cloth 
 mr laurence and his grandson dined with them also mr brooke at whom jo glowered darkly to infinite amusement two easy chairs stood side by side at the head of the table in which sat beth and her father feasting modestly on chicken and a little fruit they drank healths told stories sang songs reminisced as the old folks say and had a thoroughly good time a sleigh ride had been planned but the girls would not leave their father so the guests departed early and as twilight gathered the happy family sat together round the fire 
 just a year ago we were groaning over the dismal christmas we expected to have do you remember asked jo breaking a short pause which had followed a long conversation about many things 
 rather a pleasant year on the whole said meg smiling at the fire and congratulating herself on having treated mr brooke with dignity 
 i think been a pretty hard one observed amy watching the light shine on her ring with thoughtful eyes 
 glad over because got you back whispered beth who sat on her knee 
 rather a rough road for you to travel my little pilgrims especially the latter part of it but you have got on bravely and i think the burdens are in a fair way to tumble off very soon said mr march looking with fatherly satisfaction at the four young faces gathered round him 
 how do you know did mother tell you asked jo 
 not much straws show which way the wind blows and made several discoveries today 
 oh tell us what they are cried meg who sat beside him 
 here is one and taking up the hand which lay on the arm of his chair he pointed to the roughened forefinger a burn on the back and two or three little hard spots on the palm i remember a time when this hand was white and smooth and your first care was to keep it so it was very pretty then but to me it is much prettier now for in this seeming blemishes i read a little history a burnt offering has been made to vanity this hardened palm has earned something better than blisters and sure the sewing done by these pricked fingers will last a long time so much good will went into the stitches meg my dear i value the womanly skill which keeps home happy more than white hands or fashionable accomplishments proud to shake this good industrious little hand and hope i shall not soon be asked to give it away 
 if meg had wanted a reward for hours of patient labor she received it in the hearty pressure of her hand and the approving smile he gave her 
 what about jo please say something nice for she has tried so hard and been so very very good to me said beth in her ear 
 he laughed and looked across at the tall girl who sat opposite with and unusually mild expression in her face 
 in spite of the curly crop i see the son jo whom i left a year ago said mr march i see a young lady who pins her collar straight laces her boots neatly and neither whistles talks slang nor lies on the rug as she used to do her face is rather thin and pale just now with watching and anxiety but i like to look at it for it has grown gentler and her voice is lower she bounce but moves quietly and takes care of a certain little person in a motherly way which delights me i rather miss my wild girl but if i get a strong helpful tenderhearted woman in her place i shall feel quite satisfied i know whether the shearing sobered our black sheep but i do know that in all washington i find anything beautiful enough to be bought with the dollars my good girl sent me 
 keen eyes were rather dim for a minute and her thin face grew rosy in the firelight as she received her praise feeling that she did deserve a portion of it 
 now beth said amy longing for her turn but ready to wait 
 so little of her afraid to say much for fear she will slip away altogether though she is not so shy as she used to be began their father cheerfully but recollecting how nearly he had lost her he held her close saying tenderly with her cheek against his own got you safe my beth and keep you so please god 
 after a silence he looked down at amy who sat on the cricket at his feet and said with a caress of the shining hair 
 i observed that amy took drumsticks at dinner ran errands for her mother all the afternoon gave meg her place tonight and has waited on every on with patience and good humor i also observe that she does not fret much nor look in the glass and has not even mentioned a very pretty ring which she wears so i conclude that she has learned to think of other people more and of herself less and has decided to try and mold her character as carefully as she molds her little clay figures i am glad of this for though i should be very proud of a graceful statue made by her i shall be infinitely prouder of a lovable daughter with a talent for making life beautiful to herself and others 
 what are you thinking of beth asked jo when amy had thanked her father and told about her ring 
 i read in progress today how after many troubles christian and hopeful came to a pleasant green meadow where lilies bloomed all year round and there they rested happily as we do now before they went on to their end answered beth adding as she slipped out of her arms and went to the instrument singing time now and i want to be in my old place try to sing the song of the shepherd boy which the pilgrims heard i made the music for father because he likes the verses 
 so sitting at the dear little piano beth softly touched the keys and in the sweet voice they had never thought to hear again sang to her own accompaniment the quaint hymn which was a singularly fitting song for her 
 he that is down need fear no fall 
 he that is low no pride 
 he that is humble ever shall 
 have god to be his guide 
 i am content with what i have 
 little be it or much 
 and lord contentment still i crave 
 because thou savest such 
 fulness to them a burden is 
 that go on pilgrimage 
 here little and hereafter bliss 
 is best from age to age

 harry 
 
 hermione was tugging at his sleeve staring at her watch got exactly ten minutes to get back down to the hospital wing without anybody seeing us before dumbledore locks the door 
 
 okay said harry wrenching his gaze from the sky go 
 
 they slipped through the doorway behind them and down a tightly spiraling stone staircase as they reached the bottom of it they heard voices they flattened themselves against the wall and listened it sounded like fudge and snape they were walking quickly along the corridor at the foot of the staircase 
 
 only hope not going to make difficulties snape was saying the kiss will be performed immediately 
 
 as soon as macnair returns with the dementors this whole black affair has been highly embarrassing i tell you how much looking forward to informing the daily prophet that got him at last i daresay want to interview you snape and once young back in his right mind i expect want to tell the prophet exactly how you saved him 
 
 harry clenched his teeth he caught a glimpse of smirk as he and fudge passed harry and hiding place their footsteps died away harry and hermione waited a few moments to make sure really gone then started to run in the opposite direction down one staircase then another along a new corridor then they heard a cackling ahead 
 
 peeves harry muttered grabbing wrist in here 
 
 they tore into a deserted classroom to their left just in time peeves seemed to be bouncing along the corridor in boisterous good spirits laughing his head off 
 
 oh horrible whispered hermione her ear to the door i bet all excited because the dementors are going to finish off sirius she checked her watch three minutes harry 
 
 they waited until gloating voice had faded into the distance then slid back out of the room and broke into a run again 
 
 hermione happen if we get back inside before dumbledore locks the door harry panted 
 
 i want to think about it hermione moaned checking her watch again one minute 
 
 they had reached the end of the corridor with the hospital wing entrance okay i can hear dumbledore said hermione tensely come on harry 
 
 they crept along the corridor the door opened back appeared 
 
 i am going to lock you in they heard him saying it is five minutes to midnight miss granger three turns should do it good luck 
 
 dumbledore backed out of the room closed the door and took out his wand to magically lock it panicking harry and hermione ran forward dumbledore looked up and a wide smile appeared under the long silver mustache well he said quietly 
 
 we did it said harry breathlessly sirius has gone on buckbeak 
 
 dumbledore beamed at them 
 
 well done i think he listened intently for any sound within the hospital wing yes i think gone too get inside lock you in 
 
 harry and hermione slipped back inside the dormitory it was empty except for ron who was still lying motionless in the end bed as the lock clicked behind them harry and hermione crept back to their own beds hermione tucking the back under her robes a moment later madam pomfrey came striding back out of her office 
 
 did i hear the headmaster leaving am i allowed to look after my patients now 
 
 she was in a very bad mood harry and hermione thought it best to accept their chocolate quietly madam pomfrey stood over them making sure they ate it but harry could hardly swallow he and hermione were waiting listening their nerves jangling and then as they both took a fourth piece of chocolate from madam pomfrey they heard a distant roar of fury echoing from somewhere above them 
 
 what was that said madam pomfrey in alarm 
 
 now they could hear angry voices growing louder and louder madam pomfrey was staring at the door 
 
 really wake everybody up what do they think doing 
 
 harry was trying to hear what the voices were saying they were drawing nearer 
 
 he must have disapparated severus we should have left somebody in the room with him when this gets out 
 
 he disapparate snape roared now very close at hand you apparate or disapparate inside this castle this has something to do with potter 
 
 severus be reasonable harry has been locked up 
 
 bam 
 
 the door of the hospital wing burst open 
 
 fudge snape and dumbledore came striding into the ward dumbledore alone looked calm indeed he looked as though he was quite enjoying himself fudge appeared angry but snape was beside himself 
 
 out with it potter he bellowed what did you do 
 
 professor snape shrieked madam pomfrey control yourself 
 
 see here snape be reasonable said fudge this been locked we just saw 
 
 they helped him escape i know it snape howled pointing at harry and hermione his face was twisted spit was flying from his mouth 
 
 calm down man fudge barked talking nonsense 
 
 you know potter shrieked snape he did it i know he did it 
 
 that will do severus said dumbledore quietly think about what you are saying this door has been locked since i left the ward ten minutes ago madam pomfrey have these students left their beds 
 
 of course not said madam pomfrey bristling i would have heard them 
 
 well there you have it severus said dumbledore calmly unless you are suggesting that harry and hermione are able to be in two places at once afraid i see any point in troubling them further 
 
 snape stood there seething staring from fudge who looked thoroughly shocked at his behavior to dumbledore whose eyes were twinkling behind his glasses snape whirled about robes swishing behind him and stormed out of the ward 
 
 fellow seems quite unbalanced said fudge staring after him watch out for him if i were you dumbledore 
 
 oh not unbalanced said dumbledore quietly just suffered a severe disappointment 
 
 not the only one puffed fudge the daily going to have a field day we had black cornered and he slipped through our fingers yet again all it needs now is for the story of that escape to get out and be a laughingstock well better go and notify the ministry 
 
 and the dementors said dumbledore be removed from the school i trust 
 
 oh yes have to go said fudge running his fingers distractedly through his hair never dreamed attempt to administer the kiss on an innocent boy completely out of control no have them packed off back to azkaban tonight perhaps we should think about dragons at the school entrance 
 
 hagrid would like that said dumbledore smiling at harry and hermione as he and fudge left the dormitory madam pomfrey hurried to the door and locked it again muttering angrily to herself she headed back to her office 
 
 there was a low moan from the other end of the ward ron had woken up they could see him sitting up rubbing his head looking around 
 
 what what happened he groaned harry why are we in here sirius lupin going on 
 
 harry and hermione looked at each other 
 
 you explain said harry helping himself to some more chocolate 
 
 
 
 when harry ron and hermione left the hospital wing at noon the next day it was to find an almost deserted castle the sweltering heat and the end of the exams meant that everyone was taking full advantage of another hogsmeade visit neither ron nor hermione felt like going however so they and harry wandered onto the grounds still talking about the extraordinary events of the previous night and wondering where sirius and buckbeak were now sitting near the lake watching the giant squid waving its tentacles lazily above the water harry lost the thread of the conversation as he looked across to the opposite bank the stag had galloped toward him from there just last night 
 
 a shadow fell across them and they looked up to see a very hagrid mopping his sweaty face with one of his handkerchiefs and beaming down at them 
 
 know i shouldn feel happy after wha happened las night he said i mean black escapin again an everythin but guess what 
 
 what they said pretending to look curious 
 
 beaky he escaped free bin celebratin all night 
 
 wonderful said hermione giving ron a reproving look because he looked as though he was close to laughing 
 
 yeah tied him up properly said hagrid gazing happily out over the grounds i was worried this mornin mind thought he mighta met professor lupin on the grounds but lupin says he never ate anythin las night 
 
 what said harry quickly 
 
 blimey haven yeh heard said hagrid his smile fading a little he lowered his voice even though there was nobody in sight er snape told all the slytherins this mornin thought know by now professor a werewolf see an he was loose on the grounds las night packin now o course 
 
 packing said harry alarmed why 
 
 leavin isn he said hagrid looking surprised that harry had to ask resigned firs thing this mornin says he risk it happenin again 
 
 harry scrambled to his feet 
 
 going to see him he said to ron and hermione 
 
 but if resigned 
 
 c sound like anything we can do 
 
 i care i still want to see him meet you back here 
 
 office door was open he had already packed most of his things the empty tank stood next to his battered old suitcase which was open and nearly full lupin was bending over something on his desk and looked up only when harry knocked on the door 
 
 i saw you coming said lupin smiling he pointed to the parchment he had been poring over it was the map 
 
 i just saw hagrid said harry and he said resigned not true is it 
 
 afraid it is said lupin he started opening his desk drawers and taking out the contents 
 
 why said harry the ministry of magic think you were helping sirius do they 
 
 lupin crossed to the door and closed it behind harry 
 
 no professor dumbledore managed to convince fudge that i was trying to save your lives he sighed that was the final straw for severus i think the loss of the order of merlin hit him hard so he er accidentally let slip that i am a werewolf this morning at breakfast 
 
 not leaving just because of that said harry 
 
 lupin smiled wryly 
 
 this time tomorrow the owls will start arriving from parents they will not want a werewolf teaching their children harry and after last night i see their point i could have bitten any of you that must never happen again 
 
 the best defense against the dark arts teacher ever had said harry go 
 
 lupin shook his head and speak he carried on emptying his drawers then while harry was trying to think of a good argument to make him stay lupin said from what the headmaster told me this morning you saved a lot of lives last night harry if proud of anything done this year how much learned tell me about your patronus 
 
 how know about that said harry distracted 
 
 what else could have driven the dementors back 
 
 harry told lupin what had happened when finished lupin was smiling again 
 
 yes your father was always a stag when he transformed he said you guessed right why we called him prongs 
 
 lupin threw his last few books into his case closed the desk drawers and turned to look at harry 
 
 here i brought this from the shrieking shack last night he said handing harry back the invisibility cloak and he hesitated then held out the map too i am no longer your teacher so i feel guilty about giving you back this as well no use to me and i daresay you ron and hermione will find uses for it 
 
 harry took the map and grinned 
 
 you told me moony wormtail padfoot and prongs wanted to lure me out of school you said have thought it was funny 
 
 and so we would have said lupin now reaching down to close his case i have no hesitation in saying that james would have been highly disappointed if his son had never found any of the secret passages out of the castle 
 
 there was a knock on the door harry hastily stuffed the map and the invisibility cloak into his pocket 
 
 it was professor dumbledore he look surprised to see harry there 
 
 your carriage is at the gates remus he said 
 
 thank you headmaster 
 
 lupin picked up his old suitcase and the empty grindylow tank 
 
 well harry he said smiling it has been a real pleasure teaching you i feel sure meet again sometime headmaster there is no need to see me to the gates i can manage 
 
 harry had the impression that lupin wanted to leave as quickly as possible 
 
 then remus said dumbledore soberly lupin shifted the grindylow tank slightly so that he and dumbledore could shake hands then with a final nod to harry and a swift smile lupin left the office 
 
 harry sat down in his vacated chair staring glumly at the floor he heard the door close and looked up dumbledore was still there 
 
 why so miserable harry he said quietly you should be very proud of yourself after last night 
 
 it make any difference said harry bitterly pettigrew got away 
 
 make any difference said dumbledore quietly it made all the difference in the world harry you helped uncover the truth you saved an innocent man from a terrible fate 
 
 terrible something stirred in memory greater and more terrible than ever before professor prediction 
 
 professor dumbledore yesterday when i was having my divination exam professor trelawney went very very strange 
 
 indeed said dumbledore er stranger than usual you mean 
 
 yes her voice went all deep and her eyes rolled and she said she said servant was going to set out to return to him before midnight she said the servant would help him come back to power harry stared up at dumbledore and then she sort of became normal again and she remember anything said was it was she making a real prediction 
 
 dumbledore looked mildly impressed 
 
 do you know harry i think she might have been he said thoughtfully have thought it that brings her total of real predictions up to two i should offer her a pay raise 
 
 but harry looked at him aghast how could dumbledore take this so calmly 
 
 but i stopped sirius and professor lupin from killing pettigrew that makes it my fault if voldemort comes back 
 
 it does not said dumbledore quietly your experience with the taught you anything harry the consequences of our actions are always so complicated so diverse that predicting the future is a very difficult business indeed professor trelawney bless her is living proof of that you did a very noble thing in saving life 
 
 but if he helps voldemort back to power 
 
 pettigrew owes his life to you you have sent voldemort a deputy who is in your debt when one wizard saves another life it creates a certain bond between them and much mistaken if voldemort wants his servant in the debt of harry potter 
 
 i want a connection with pettigrew said harry he betrayed my parents 
 
 this is magic at its deepest its most impenetrable harry but trust me the time may come when you will be very glad you saved life 
 
 harry imagine when that would be dumbledore looked as though he knew what harry was thinking 
 
 i knew your father very well both at hogwarts and later harry he said gently he would have saved pettigrew too i am sure of it 
 
 harry looked up at him dumbledore laugh he could tell dumbledore 
 
 i thought it was my dad conjured my patronus i mean when i saw myself across the lake i thought i was seeing him 
 
 an easy mistake to make said dumbledore softly i expect tire of hearing it but you do look extraordinarily like james except for the eyes you have your eyes 
 
 harry shook his head 
 
 it was stupid thinking it was him he muttered i mean i knew he was dead 
 
 you think the dead we loved ever truly leave us you think that we recall them more clearly than ever in times of great trouble your father is alive in you harry and shows himself most plainly when you have need of him how else could you produce that particular patronus prongs rode again last night 
 
 it took a moment for harry to realize what dumblefore had said 
 
 last night sirius told me all about how they became animagi said dumbledore smiling an extraordinary achievement not least keeping it quiet from me and then i remembered the most unusual form your patronus took when it charged mr malfoy down at your quidditch match against ravenclaw you know harry in a way you did see your father last night you found him inside yourself 
 
 and dumbledore left the office leaving harry to his very confused thoughts 
 
 
 
 nobody at hogwarts now knew the truth of what had happened the night that sirius buckbeak and pettigrew had vanished except harry ron hermione and professor dumbledore as the end of term approached harry heard many different theories about what had really happened but none of them came close to the truth 
 
 malfoy was furious about buckbeak he was convinced that hagrid had found a way of smuggling the hippogriff to safety and seemed outraged that he and his father had been outwitted by a gamekeeper percy weasley meanwhile had much to say on the subject of escape 
 
 if i manage to get into the ministry have a lot of proposals to make about magical law enforcement he told the only person who would listen his girlfriend penelope 
 
 though the weather was perfect though the atmosphere was so cheerful though he knew they had achieved the near impossible in helping sirius to freedom harry had never approached the end of a school year in worse spirits 
 
 he certainly the only one who was sorry to see professor lupin go the whole of defense against the dark arts class was miserable about his resignation 
 
 wonder what give us next year said seamus finnigan gloomily 
 
 maybe a vampire suggested dean thomas hopefully 
 
 it only professor departure that was weighing on mind he help thinking a lot about professor prediction he kept wondering where pettigrew was now whether he had sought sanctuary with voldemort yet but the thing that was lowering spirits most of all was the prospect of returning to the dursleys for maybe half an hour a glorious half hour he had believed he would be living with sirius from now onhis parents best friendit would have been the next best thing to having his own father back and while no news of sirius was definitely good news because it meant he had successfully gone into hiding harry help feeling miserable when he thought of the home he might have had and the fact that it was now impossible 
 
 the exam results came out on the last day of term harry ron and hermione had passed every subject harry was amazed that he had got through potions he had a shrewd suspicion that dumbledore might have stepped in to stop snape failing him on purpose behavior toward harry over the past week had been quite alarming harry have thought it possible that dislike for him could increase but it certainly had a muscle twitched unpleasantly at the corner of thin mouth every time he looked at harry and he was constantly flexing his fingers as though itching to place them around throat 
 
 percy had got his fred and george had scraped a handful of each gryffindor house meanwhile largely thanks to their spectacular performance in the quidditch cup had won the house championship for the third year running this meant that the end of term feast took place amid decorations of scarlet and gold and that the gryffindor table was the noisiest of the lot as everybody celebrated even harry managed to forget about the journey back to the dursleys the next day as he ate drank talked and laughed with the rest 
 
 
 
 as the hogwarts express pulled out of the station the next morning hermione gave harry and ron some surprising news 
 
 i went to see professor mcgonagall this morning just before breakfast decided to drop muggle studies 
 
 but you passed your exam with three hundred and twenty percent said ron 
 
 i know sighed hermione but i stand another year like this one that it was driving me mad handed it in without muggle studies and divination be able to have a normal schedule again 
 
 i still believe you tell us about it said ron grumpily supposed to be your friends 
 
 i promised i tell anyone said hermione severely she looked around at harry who was watching hogwarts disappear from view behind a mountain two whole months before see it again 
 
 oh cheer up harry said hermione sadly 
 
 okay said harry quickly just thinking about the holidays 
 
 yeah been thinking about them too said ron harry got to come and stay with us fix it up with mum and dad then call you i know how to use a fellytone now 
 
 a telephone ron said hermione honestly you should take muggle studies next year 
 
 ron ignored her 
 
 the quidditch world cup this summer how about it harry come and stay and go and see it dad can usually get tickets from work 
 
 this proposal had the effect of cheering harry up a great deal 
 
 yeah i bet the be pleased to let me come especially after what i did to aunt marge 
 
 feeling considerably more cheerful harry joined ron and hermione in several games of exploding snap and when the witch with the tea cart arrived he bought himself a very large lunch though nothing with chocolate in it 
 
 but it was late in the afternoon before the thing that made him truly happy turned up 
 
 harry said hermione suddenly peering over his shoulder that thing outside your window 
 
 harry turned to look outside something very small and gray was bobbing in and out of sight beyond the glass he stood up for a better look and saw that it was a tiny owl carrying a letter that was much too big for it the owl was so small in fact that it kept tumbling over in the air buffeted this way and that in the slipstream harry quickly pulled down the window stretched out his arm and caught it it felt like a very fluffy snitch he brought it carefully inside 
 
 the owl dropped its letter onto seat and began zooming around their compartment apparently very pleased with itself for accomplishing its task hedwig clicked her beak with a sort of dignified disapproval crookshanks sat up in his seat following the owl with his great yellow eyes ron noticing this snatched the owl safely out of way 
 
 harry picked up the letter it was addressed to him he ripped open the letter and shouted from sirius 
 
 what said ron and hermione excitedly read it aloud 
 
 dear harry 
 i hope this finds you before you reach your aunt and uncle i know whether used to owl post 
 buckbeak and i are in hiding i tell you where in case this owl falls into the wrong hands i have some doubt about his reliability but he is the best i could find and he did seem eager for the job 
 i believe the dementors are still searching for me but they a hope of finding me here i am planning to allow some muggles to glimpse me soon a long way from hogwarts so that the security on the castle will be lifted 
 there is something i never got around to telling you during our brief meeting it was i who sent you the firebolt 
 ha said hermione triumphantly see i told you it was from him 
 
 yes but he jinxed it had he said ron ouch the tiny owl now hooting happily in his hand had nibbled one of his fingers in what it seemed to think was an affectionate way 
 
 c crookshanks took the order to the owl office for me i used your name but told them to take the gold from my own gringotts vault please consider it as thirteen birthdays worth of presents from your godfather 
 i would also like to apologize for the fright i think i gave you that night last year when you left your house i had only hoped to get a glimpse of you before starting my journey north but i think the sight of me alarmed you 
 i am enclosing something else for you which i think will make your next year at hogwarts more enjoyable 
 if ever you need me send word your owl will find me 
 write again soon 
 sirius 
 harry looked eagerly inside the envelope there was another piece of parchment in there he read it through quickly and felt suddenly as warm and contented as though swallowed a bottle of hot butterbeer in one gulp 
 
 i sirius black harry godfather hereby give him permission to visit hogsmeade on weekends be good enough for dumbledore said harry happily he looked back at letter hang on a ps 
 i thought your friend ron might like to keep this owl as my fault he no longer has a rat 
 eyes widened the minute owl was still hooting excitedly keep him he said uncertainly he looked closely at the owl for a moment then to and great surprise he held him out for crookshanks to sniff 
 
 what do you reckon ron asked the cat definitely an owl 
 
 crookshanks purred 
 
 good enough for me said ron happily mine 
 
 harry read and reread the letter from sirius all the way back into cross station it was still clutched tightly in his hand as he ron and hermione stepped back through the barrier of platform nine and harry spotted uncle vernon at once he was standing a good distance from mr and mrs weasley eyeing them suspiciously and when mrs weasley hugged harry in greeting his worst suspicions about them seemed confirmed 
 
 call about the world cup ron yelled after harry as harry bid him and hermione then wheeled the trolley bearing his trunk and cage toward uncle vernon who greeted him in his usual fashion 
 
 that he snarled staring at the envelope harry was still clutching in his hand if another form for me to sign got another 
 
 not said harry cheerfully a letter from my godfather 
 
 godfather sputtered uncle vernon you got a godfather 
 
 yes i have said harry brightly he was my mum and best friend a convicted murderer but broken out of wizard prison and on the run he likes to keep in touch with me though keep up with my news check if happy 
 
 and grinning broadly at the look of horror on uncle face harry set off toward the station exit hedwig rattling along in front of him for what looked like a much better summer than the last 
 
 rowling

 the prisoner of azkaban 
 

lionfish nov chapter owl post againcontents prev chapter 
 harry 
 
 hermione was tugging at his sleeve staring at her watch got exactly ten minutes to get back down to the hospital wing without anybody seeing us before dumbledore locks the door 
 
 okay said harry wrenching his gaze from the sky go 
 
 they slipped through the doorway behind them and down a tightly spiraling stone staircase as they reached the bottom of it they heard voices they flattened themselves against the wall and listened it sounded like fudge and snape they were walking quickly along the corridor at the foot of the staircase 
 
 only hope not going to make difficulties snape was saying the kiss will be performed immediately 
 
 as soon as macnair returns with the dementors this whole black affair has been highly embarrassing i tell you how much looking forward to informing the daily prophet that got him at last i daresay want to interview you snape and once young back in his right mind i expect want to tell the prophet exactly how you saved him 
 
 harry clenched his teeth he caught a glimpse of smirk as he and fudge passed harry and hiding place their footsteps died away harry and hermione waited a few moments to make sure really gone then started to run in the opposite direction down one staircase then another along a new corridor then they heard a cackling ahead 
 
 peeves harry muttered grabbing wrist in here 
 
 they tore into a deserted classroom to their left just in time peeves seemed to be bouncing along the corridor in boisterous good spirits laughing his head off 
 
 oh horrible whispered hermione her ear to the door i bet all excited because the dementors are going to finish off sirius she checked her watch three minutes harry 
 
 they waited until gloating voice had faded into the distance then slid back out of the room and broke into a run again 
 
 hermione happen if we get back inside before dumbledore locks the door harry panted 
 
 i want to think about it hermione moaned checking her watch again one minute 
 
 they had reached the end of the corridor with the hospital wing entrance okay i can hear dumbledore said hermione tensely come on harry 
 
 they crept along the corridor the door opened back appeared 
 
 i am going to lock you in they heard him saying it is five minutes to midnight miss granger three turns should do it good luck 
 
 dumbledore backed out of the room closed the door and took out his wand to magically lock it panicking harry and hermione ran forward dumbledore looked up and a wide smile appeared under the long silver mustache well he said quietly 
 
 we did it said harry breathlessly sirius has gone on buckbeak 
 
 dumbledore beamed at them 
 
 well done i think he listened intently for any sound within the hospital wing yes i think gone too get inside lock you in 
 
 harry and hermione slipped back inside the dormitory it was empty except for ron who was still lying motionless in the end bed as the lock clicked behind them harry and hermione crept back to their own beds hermione tucking the back under her robes a moment later madam pomfrey came striding back out of her office 
 
 did i hear the headmaster leaving am i allowed to look after my patients now 
 
 she was in a very bad mood harry and hermione thought it best to accept their chocolate quietly madam pomfrey stood over them making sure they ate it but harry could hardly swallow he and hermione were waiting listening their nerves jangling and then as they both took a fourth piece of chocolate from madam pomfrey they heard a distant roar of fury echoing from somewhere above them 
 
 what was that said madam pomfrey in alarm 
 
 now they could hear angry voices growing louder and louder madam pomfrey was staring at the door 
 
 really wake everybody up what do they think doing 
 
 harry was trying to hear what the voices were saying they were drawing nearer 
 
 he must have disapparated severus we should have left somebody in the room with him when this gets out 
 
 he disapparate snape roared now very close at hand you apparate or disapparate inside this castle this has something to do with potter 
 
 severus be reasonable harry has been locked up 
 
 bam 
 
 the door of the hospital wing burst open 
 
 fudge snape and dumbledore came striding into the ward dumbledore alone looked calm indeed he looked as though he was quite enjoying himself fudge appeared angry but snape was beside himself 
 
 out with it potter he bellowed what did you do 
 
 professor snape shrieked madam pomfrey control yourself 
 
 see here snape be reasonable said fudge this been locked we just saw 
 
 they helped him escape i know it snape howled pointing at harry and hermione his face was twisted spit was flying from his mouth 
 
 calm down man fudge barked talking nonsense 
 
 you know potter shrieked snape he did it i know he did it 
 
 that will do severus said dumbledore quietly think about what you are saying this door has been locked since i left the ward ten minutes ago madam pomfrey have these students left their beds 
 
 of course not said madam pomfrey bristling i would have heard them 
 
 well there you have it severus said dumbledore calmly unless you are suggesting that harry and hermione are able to be in two places at once afraid i see any point in troubling them further 
 
 snape stood there seething staring from fudge who looked thoroughly shocked at his behavior to dumbledore whose eyes were twinkling behind his glasses snape whirled about robes swishing behind him and stormed out of the ward 
 
 fellow seems quite unbalanced said fudge staring after him watch out for him if i were you dumbledore 
 
 oh not unbalanced said dumbledore quietly just suffered a severe disappointment 
 
 not the only one puffed fudge the daily going to have a field day we had black cornered and he slipped through our fingers yet again all it needs now is for the story of that escape to get out and be a laughingstock well better go and notify the ministry 
 
 and the dementors said dumbledore be removed from the school i trust 
 
 oh yes have to go said fudge running his fingers distractedly through his hair never dreamed attempt to administer the kiss on an innocent boy completely out of control no have them packed off back to azkaban tonight perhaps we should think about dragons at the school entrance 
 
 hagrid would like that said dumbledore smiling at harry and hermione as he and fudge left the dormitory madam pomfrey hurried to the door and locked it again muttering angrily to herself she headed back to her office 
 
 there was a low moan from the other end of the ward ron had woken up they could see him sitting up rubbing his head looking around 
 
 what what happened he groaned harry why are we in here sirius lupin going on 
 
 harry and hermione looked at each other 
 
 you explain said harry helping himself to some more chocolate 
 
 
 
 when harry ron and hermione left the hospital wing at noon the next day it was to find an almost deserted castle the sweltering heat and the end of the exams meant that everyone was taking full advantage of another hogsmeade visit neither ron nor hermione felt like going however so they and harry wandered onto the grounds still talking about the extraordinary events of the previous night and wondering where sirius and buckbeak were now sitting near the lake watching the giant squid waving its tentacles lazily above the water harry lost the thread of the conversation as he looked across to the opposite bank the stag had galloped toward him from there just last night 
 
 a shadow fell across them and they looked up to see a very hagrid mopping his sweaty face with one of his handkerchiefs and beaming down at them 
 
 know i shouldn feel happy after wha happened las night he said i mean black escapin again an everythin but guess what 
 
 what they said pretending to look curious 
 
 beaky he escaped free bin celebratin all night 
 
 wonderful said hermione giving ron a reproving look because he looked as though he was close to laughing 
 
 yeah tied him up properly said hagrid gazing happily out over the grounds i was worried this mornin mind thought he mighta met professor lupin on the grounds but lupin says he never ate anythin las night 
 
 what said harry quickly 
 
 blimey haven yeh heard said hagrid his smile fading a little he lowered his voice even though there was nobody in sight er snape told all the slytherins this mornin thought know by now professor a werewolf see an he was loose on the grounds las night packin now o course 
 
 packing said harry alarmed why 
 
 leavin isn he said hagrid looking surprised that harry had to ask resigned firs thing this mornin says he risk it happenin again 
 
 harry scrambled to his feet 
 
 going to see him he said to ron and hermione 
 
 but if resigned 
 
 c sound like anything we can do 
 
 i care i still want to see him meet you back here 
 
 office door was open he had already packed most of his things the empty tank stood next to his battered old suitcase which was open and nearly full lupin was bending over something on his desk and looked up only when harry knocked on the door 
 
 i saw you coming said lupin smiling he pointed to the parchment he had been poring over it was the map 
 
 i just saw hagrid said harry and he said resigned not true is it 
 
 afraid it is said lupin he started opening his desk drawers and taking out the contents 
 
 why said harry the ministry of magic think you were helping sirius do they 
 
 lupin crossed to the door and closed it behind harry 
 
 no professor dumbledore managed to convince fudge that i was trying to save your lives he sighed that was the final straw for severus i think the loss of the order of merlin hit him hard so he er accidentally let slip that i am a werewolf this morning at breakfast 
 
 not leaving just because of that said harry 
 
 lupin smiled wryly 
 
 this time tomorrow the owls will start arriving from parents they will not want a werewolf teaching their children harry and after last night i see their point i could have bitten any of you that must never happen again 
 
 the best defense against the dark arts teacher ever had said harry go 
 
 lupin shook his head and speak he carried on emptying his drawers then while harry was trying to think of a good argument to make him stay lupin said from what the headmaster told me this morning you saved a lot of lives last night harry if proud of anything done this year how much learned tell me about your patronus 
 
 how know about that said harry distracted 
 
 what else could have driven the dementors back 
 
 harry told lupin what had happened when finished lupin was smiling again 
 
 yes your father was always a stag when he transformed he said you guessed right why we called him prongs 
 
 lupin threw his last few books into his case closed the desk drawers and turned to look at harry

 harry took the map and grinned

 and so we would have said lupin now reaching down to close his case i have no hesitation in saying that james would have been highly disappointed if his son had never found any of the secret passages out of the castle 
 
 there was a knock on the door harry hastily stuffed the map and the invisibility cloak into his pocket 
 
 it was professor dumbledore he look surprised to see harry there 
 
 your carriage is at the gates remus he said 
 
 thank you headmaster 
 
 lupin picked up his old suitcase and the empty grindylow tank 
 
 well harry he said smiling it has been a real pleasure teaching you i feel sure meet again sometime headmaster there is no need to see me to the gates i can manage 
 
 harry had the impression that lupin wanted to leave as quickly as possible 
 
 then remus said dumbledore soberly lupin shifted the grindylow tank slightly so that he and dumbledore could shake hands then with a final nod to harry and a swift smile lupin left the office 
 
 harry sat down in his vacated chair staring glumly at the floor he heard the door close and looked up dumbledore was still there 
 
 why so miserable harry he said quietly you should be very proud of yourself after last night

 as the hogwarts express pulled out of the station the next morning hermione gave harry and ron some surprising news 
 
 i went to see professor mcgonagall this morning just before breakfast decided to drop muggle studies 
 
 but you passed your exam with three hundred and twenty percent said ron 
 
 i know sighed hermione but i stand another year like this one that it was driving me mad handed it in without muggle studies and divination be able to have a normal schedule again 
 
 i still believe you tell us about it said ron grumpily supposed to be your friends 
 
 i promised i tell anyone said hermione severely she looked around at harry who was watching hogwarts disappear from view behind a mountain two whole months before see it again 
 
 oh cheer up harry said hermione sadly 
 
 okay said harry quickly just thinking about the holidays 
 
 yeah been thinking about them too said ron harry got to come and stay with us fix it up with mum and dad then call you i know how to use a fellytone now 
 
 a telephone ron said hermione honestly you should take muggle studies next year 
 
 ron ignored her 
 
 the quidditch world cup this summer how about it harry come and stay and go and see it dad can usually get tickets from work 
 
 this proposal had the effect of cheering harry up a great deal 
 
 yeah i bet the be pleased to let me come especially after what i did to aunt marge 
 
 feeling considerably more cheerful harry joined ron and hermione in several games of exploding snap and when the witch with the tea cart arrived he bought himself a very large lunch though nothing with chocolate in it 
 
 but it was late in the afternoon before the thing that made him truly happy turned up 
 
 harry said hermione suddenly peering over his shoulder that thing outside your window 
 
 harry turned to look outside something very small and gray was bobbing in and out of sight beyond the glass he stood up for a better look and saw that it was a tiny owl carrying a letter that was much too big for it the owl was so small in fact that it kept tumbling over in the air buffeted this way and that in the slipstream harry quickly pulled down the window stretched out his arm and caught it it felt like a very fluffy snitch he brought it carefully inside 
 
 the owl dropped its letter onto seat and began zooming around their compartment apparently very pleased with itself for accomplishing its task hedwig clicked her beak with a sort of dignified disapproval crookshanks sat up in his seat following the owl with his great yellow eyes ron noticing this snatched the owl safely out of way 
 
 harry picked up the letter it was addressed to him he ripped open the letter and shouted from sirius 
 
 what said ron and hermione excitedly read it aloud 
 
 dear harry 
 i hope this finds you before you reach your aunt and uncle i know whether used to owl post 
 buckbeak and i are in hiding i tell you where in case this owl falls into the wrong hands i have some doubt about his reliability but he is the best i could find and he did seem eager for the job 
 i believe the dementors are still searching for me but they a hope of finding me here i am planning to allow some muggles to glimpse me soon a long way from hogwarts so that the security on the castle will be lifted 
 there is something i never got around to telling you during our brief meeting it was i who sent you the firebolt 
 ha said hermione triumphantly see i told you it was from him 
 
 yes but he jinxed it had he said ron ouch the tiny owl now hooting happily in his hand had nibbled one of his fingers in what it seemed to think was an affectionate way 
 
 c crookshanks took the order to the owl office for me i used your name but told them to take the gold from my own gringotts vault please consider it as thirteen birthdays worth of presents from your godfather 
 i would also like to apologize for the fright i think i gave you that night last year when you left your house i had only hoped to get a glimpse of you before starting my journey north but i think the sight of me alarmed you 
 i am enclosing something else for you which i think will make your next year at hogwarts more enjoyable 
 if ever you need me send word your owl will find me 
 write again soon 
 sirius 
 harry looked eagerly inside the envelope there was another piece of parchment in there he read it through quickly and felt suddenly as warm and contented as though swallowed a bottle of hot butterbeer in one gulp 
 
 i sirius black harry godfather hereby give him permission to visit hogsmeade on weekends be good enough for dumbledore said harry happily he looked back at letter hang on a ps 
 i thought your friend ron might like to keep this owl as my fault he no longer has a rat 
 eyes widened the minute owl was still hooting excitedly keep him he said uncertainly he looked closely at the owl for a moment then to and great surprise he held him out for crookshanks to sniff 
 
 what do you reckon ron asked the cat definitely an owl 
 
 crookshanks purred 
 
 good enough for me said ron happily mine 
 
 harry read and reread the letter from sirius all the way back into cross station it was still clutched tightly in his hand as he ron and hermione stepped back through the barrier of platform nine and harry spotted uncle vernon at once he was standing a good distance from mr and mrs weasley eyeing them suspiciously and when mrs weasley hugged harry in greeting his worst suspicions about them seemed confirmed 
 
 call about the world cup ron yelled after harry as harry bid him and hermione then wheeled the trolley bearing his trunk and cage toward uncle vernon who greeted him in his usual fashion 
 
 that he snarled staring at the envelope harry was still clutching in his hand if another form for me to sign got another 
 
 not said harry cheerfully a letter from my godfather 
 
 godfather sputtered uncle vernon you got a godfather 
 
 yes i have said harry brightly he was my mum and best friend a convicted murderer but broken out of wizard prison and on the run he likes to keep in touch with me though keep up with my news check if happy 
 
 and grinning broadly at the look of horror on uncle face harry set off toward the station exit hedwig rattling along in front of him for what looked like a much better summer than the last

 potter weasley will you pay attention 
 
 professor irritated voice cracked like a whip through the transfiguration class on thursday and harry and ron both jumped and looked up 
 
 it was the end of the lesson they had finished their work the guinea fowl they had been changing into guinea pigs had been shut away in a large cage on professor desk still had feathers they had copied down their homework from the blackboard describe with examples the ways in which transforming spells must be adapted when performing switches the bell was due to ring at any moment and harry and ron who had been having a sword fight with a couple of fred and fake wands at the back of the class looked up ron holding a tin parrot and harry a rubber haddock 
 
 now that potter and weasley have been kind enough to act their age said professor mcgonagall with an angry look at the pair of them as the head of haddock drooped and fell silently to the floor beak had severed it moments before i have something to say to you all 
 
 the yule ball is approaching a traditional part of the triwizard tournament and an opportunity for us to socialize with our foreign guests now the ball will be open only to fourth years and above although you may invite a younger student if you wish 
 
 lavender brown let out a shrill giggle parvati patil nudged her hard in the ribs her face working furiously as she too fought not to giggle they both looked around at harry professor mcgonagall ignored them which harry thought was distinctly unfair as she had just told off him and ron 
 
 dress robes will be worn professor mcgonagall continued and the ball will start at eight on christmas day finishing at midnight in the great hall now then 
 
 professor mcgonagall stared deliberately around the class 
 
 the yule ball is of course a chance for us all to er let our hair down she said in a disapproving voice 
 
 lavender giggled harder than ever with her hand pressed hard against her mouth to stifle the sound harry could see what was funny this time professor mcgonagall with her hair in a tight bun looked as though she had never let her hair down in any sense 
 
 but that does not mean professor mcgonagall went on that we will be relaxing the standards of behavior we expect from hogwarts students i will be most seriously displeased if a gryffindor student embarrasses the school in any way 
 
 the bell rang and there was the usual scuffle of activity as everyone packed their bags and swung them onto their shoulders 
 
 professor mcgonagall called above the noise potter a word if you please 
 
 assuming this had something to do with his headless rubber haddock harry proceeded gloomily to the desk professor mcgonagall waited until the rest of the class had gone and then said potter the champions and their partners 
 
 what partners said harry 
 
 profesor mcgonagall looked suspiciously at him as though she thought he was trying to be funny 
 
 your partners for the yule ball potter she said coldly your dance partners 
 
 insides seemed to curl up and shrivel 
 
 dance partners he felt himself going red i dance he said quickly 
 
 oh yes you do said professor mcgonagall irritably what telling you traditionally the champions and their partners open the ball 
 
 harry had a sudden mental image of himself in a top hat and tails accompanied by a girl in the sort of frilly dress aunt petunia always wore to uncle work parties 
 
 not dancing he said 
 
 it is traditional said professor mcgonagall firmly you are a hogwarts champion and you will do what is expected of you as a representative of the school so make sure you get yourself a partner potter 
 
 but i 
 
 you heard me potter said professor mcgonagall in a very final sort of way 
 
 
 
 a week ago harry would have said finding a partner for a dance would be a cinch compared to taking on a hungarian horntail but now that he had done the latter and was facing the prospect of asking a girl to the ball he thought rather have another round with the dragon 
 
 harry had never known so many people to put their names down to stay at hogwarts for christmas he always did of course because the alternative was usually going back to privet drive but he had always been very much in the minority before now this year however everyone in the fourth year and above seemed to be staying and they all seemed to harry to be obsessed with the coming ball or at least all the girls were and it was amazing how many girls hogwarts suddenly seemed to hold he had never quite noticed that before girls giggling and whispering in the corridors girls shrieking with laughter as boys passed them girls excitedly comparing notes on what they were going to wear on christmas night 
 
 why do they have to move in packs harry asked ron as a dozen or so girls walked past them sniggering and staring at harry you supposed to get one on their own to ask them 
 
 lasso one ron suggested got any idea who going to try 
 
 harry answer he knew perfectly well whom like to ask but working up the nerve was something was a year older than he was she was very pretty she was a very good quidditch player and she was also very popular 
 
 ron seemed to know what was going on inside head 
 
 listen not going to have any trouble a champion just beaten a hungarian horntail i bet be queuing up to go with you 
 
 in tribute to their recently repaired friendship ron had kept the bitterness in his voice to a bare minimum moreover to amazement he turned out to be quite right 
 
 a hufflepuff girl to whom harry had never spoken in his life asked him to go to the ball with her the very next day harry was so taken aback he said no before even stopped to consider the matter the girl walked off looking rather hurt and harry had to endure and taunts about her all through history of magic the following day two more girls asked him a second year and to his horror a fifth year who looked as though she might knock him out if he refused 
 
 she was quite said ron fairly after stopped laughing 
 
 she was a foot taller than me said harry still unnerved imagine what look like trying to dance with her 
 
 words about krum kept coming back to him they only like him because famous harry doubted very much if any of the girls who had asked to be his partner so far would have wanted to go to the ball with him if he been a school champion then he wondered if this would bother him if cho asked him 
 
 on the whole harry had to admit that even with the embarrassing prospect of opening the ball before him life had definitely improved since he had got through the first task he attracting nearly as much unpleasantness in the corridors anymore which he suspected had a lot to do with cedric he had an idea cedric might have told the hufflepuffs to leave harry alone in gratitude for about the dragons there seemed to be fewer support cedric diggory badges around too draco malfoy of course was still quoting rita article to him at every possible opportunity but he was getting fewer and fewer laughs out of it and just to heighten feeling of no story about hagrid had appeared in the daily prophet 
 
 she didn seem very in magical creatures ter tell yeh the truth hagrid said when harry ron and hermione asked him how his interview with rita skeeter had gone during the last care of magical creatures lesson of the term to their very great relief hagrid had given up on direct contact with the skrewts now and they were merely sheltering behind his cabin today sitting at a trestle table and preparing a fresh selection of food with which to tempt the skrewts 
 
 she jus wanted me ter talk about you harry hagrid continued in a low voice well i told her been friends since i went ter fetch yeh from the dursleys never had to tell him off in four years she said never played you up in lessons has he i told her no an she didn seem happy at all think she wanted me to say yeh were horrible harry 
 
 course she did said harry throwing lumps of dragon liver into a large metal bowl and picking up his knife to cut some more she keep writing about what a tragic little hero i am get boring 
 
 she wants a new angle hagrid said ron wisely as he shelled salamander eggs you were supposed to say a mad delinquent 
 
 but not said hagrid looking genuinely shocked 
 
 she interviewed snape said harry grimly give her the goods on me any day potter has been crossing lines ever since he first arrived at this school 
 
 said that did he said hagrid while ron and hermione laughed well yeh bent a few rules harry bu all righ really aren you 
 
 cheers hagrid said harry grinning 
 
 you coming to this ball thing on christmas day hagrid said ron 
 
 though i might look in on it yeah said hagrid gruffly should be a good do i reckon be openin the dancin won yeh harry you takin 
 
 no one yet said harry feeling himself going red again hagrid pursue the subject 
 
 the last week of term became increasingly boisterous as it progressed rumors about the yule ball were flying everywhere though harry believe half of them for instance that dumbledore had bought eight hundred barrels of mulled mead from madam rosmerta it seemed to be fact however that he had booked the weird sisters exactly who or what the weird sisters were harry know never having had access to a wireless but he deduced from the wild excitement of those who had grown up listening to the wwn wizarding wireless network that they were a very famous musical group 
 
 some of the teachers like little professor flitwick gave up trying to teach them much when their minds were so clearly elsewhere he allowed them to play games in his lesson on wednesday and spent most of it talking to harry about the perfect summoning charm harry had used during the first task of the triwizard tournament other teachers were not so generous nothing would ever deflect professor binns for example from plowing on through his notes on goblin rebellions as binns let his own death stand in the way of continuing to teach they supposed a small thing like christmas going to put him off it was amazing how he could make even bloody and vicious goblin riots sound as boring as report professors mcgonagall and moody kept them working until the very last second of their classes too and snape of course would no sooner let them play games in class than adopt harry staring nastily around at them all he informed them that he would be testing them on poison antidotes during the last lesson of the term 
 
 evil he is ron said bitterly that night in the gryffindor common room springing a test on us on the last day ruining the last bit of term with a whole load of studying 
 
 not exactly straining yourself though are you said hermione looking at him over the top of her potions notes ron was busy building a card castle out of his exploding snap pack a much more interesting pastime than with muggle cards because of the chance that the whole thing would blow up at any second 
 
 christmas hermione said harry lazily he was rereading flying with the cannons for the tenth time in an armchair near the fire 
 
 hermione looked severely over at him too have thought be doing something constructive harry even if you want to learn your antidotes 
 
 like what harry said as he watched joey jenkins of the cannons belt a bludger toward a ballycastle bats chaser 
 
 that egg hermione hissed 
 
 come on hermione got till february the harry said 
 
 he had put the golden egg upstairs in his trunk and opened it since the celebration party after the first task there were still two and a half months to go until he needed to know what all the screechy wailing meant after all 
 
 but it might take weeks to work it out said hermione going to look a real idiot if everyone else knows what the next task is and you 
 
 leave him alone hermione earned a bit of a break said ron and he placed the last two cards on top of the castle and the whole lot blew up singeing his eyebrows 
 
 nice look rongo well with your dress robes that will 
 
 it was fred and george they sat down at the table with harry ron and hermione as ron felt how much damage had been done 
 
 ron can we borrow pigwidgeon george asked 
 
 no off delivering a letter said ron why 
 
 because george wants to invite him to the ball said fred sarcastically 
 
 because we want to send a letter you stupid great prat said george 
 
 who two keep writing to eh said ron 
 
 nose out ron or burn that for you too said fred waving his wand threateningly soyou lot got dates for the ball yet 
 
 nope said ron 
 
 well better hurry up mate or all the good ones will be gone said fred 
 
 you going with then said ron 
 
 angelina said fred promptly without a trace of embarrassment 
 
 what said ron taken aback already asked her 
 
 good point said fred he turned his head and called across the common room oi angelina 
 
 angelina who had been chatting with alicia spinnet near the fire looked over at him 
 
 what she called back 
 
 want to come to the ball with me 
 
 angelina gave fred an appraising sort of look 
 
 all right then she said and she turned back to alicia and carried on chatting with a bit of a grin on her face 
 
 there you go said fred to harry and ron piece of cake 
 
 he got to his feet yawning and said better use a school owl then george come on 
 
 they left ron stopped feeling his eyebrows and looked across the smoldering wreck of his card castle at harry 
 
 we should get a move on you knowask someone right we want to end up with a pair of trolls 
 
 hermione let out a sputter of indignation 
 
 a pair ofwhat excuse me 
 
 well you know said ron shrugging rather go alone than with with eloise midgen say 
 
 her loads better lately and really nice 
 
 her nose is said ron 
 
 oh i see hermione said bristling so basically going to take the girl have you even if completely horrible 
 
 er yeah that sounds about right said ron 
 
 going to bed hermione snapped and she swept off toward the girls staircase without another word 
 
 
 
 the hogwarts staff demonstrating a continued desire to impress the visitors from beauxbatons and durmstrang seemed determined to show the castle at its best this christmas when the decorations went up harry noticed that they were the most stunning he had yet seen inside the school everlasting icicles had been attached to the banisters of the marble staircase the usual twelve christmas trees in the great hall were bedecked with everything from luminous holly berries to real hooting golden owls and the suits of armor had all been bewitched to sing carols whenever anyone passed them it was quite something to hear o come all ye faithful sung by an empty helmet that only knew half the words several times filch the caretaker had to extract peeves from inside the armor where he had taken to hiding filling in the gaps in the songs with lyrics of his own invention all of which were very rude 
 
 and still harry asked cho to the ball he and ron were getting very nervous now though as harry pointed out ron would look much less stupid than he would without a partner harry was supposed to be starting the dancing with the other champions 
 
 i suppose always moaning myrtle he said gloomily referring to the ghost who haunted the girls toilets on the second floor 
 
 harry just got to grit our teeth and do it said ron on friday morning in a tone that suggested they were planning the storming of an impregnable fortress when we get back to the common room tonight both have partners agreed 
 
 erokay said harry 
 
 but every time he glimpsed cho that day during break and then lunchtime and once on the way to history of magic she was surrounded by friends she ever go anywhere alone could he perhaps ambush her as she was going into a bathroom but no she even seemed to go there with an escort of four or five girls yet if he do it soon she was bound to have been asked by somebody else 
 
 he found it hard to concentrate on potions test and consequently forgot to add the key ingredient a bezoar meaning that he received bottom marks he care though he was too busy screwing up his courage for what he was about to do when the bell rang he grabbed his bag and hurried to the dungeon door 
 
 meet you at dinner he said to ron and hermione and he dashed off upstairs 
 
 just have to ask cho for a private word that was hurried off through the packed corridors looking for her and rather sooner than he had expected he found her emerging from a defense against the dark arts lesson 
 
 er cho could i have a word with you 
 
 giggling should be made illegal harry thought furiously as all the girls around cho started doing it she though she said okay and followed him out of earshot other classmates 
 
 harry turned to look at her and his stomach gave a weird lurch as though he had missed a step going downstairs 
 
 er he said 
 
 he ask her he but he had to cho stood there looking puzzled watching him the words came out before harry had quite got his tongue around them 
 
 wangoballwime 
 
 sorry said cho 
 
 want to go to the ball with me said harry why did he have to go red now why 
 
 oh said cho and she went red too oh harry really sorry and she truly looked it already said go with someone else 
 
 oh said harry 
 
 it was odd a moment before his insides had been writhing like snakes but suddenly he seem to have any insides at all 
 
 oh okay he said no problem 
 
 really sorry she said again 
 
 okay said harry 
 
 they stood there looking at each other and then cho said well 
 
 yeah said harry 
 
 well bye said cho still very red she walked away 
 
 harry called after her before he could stop himself 
 
 you going with 
 
 oh cedric she said cedric diggory 
 
 oh right said harry 
 
 his insides had come back again it felt as though they had been filled with lead in their absence 
 
 completely forgetting about dinner he walked slowly back up to gryffindor tower voice echoing in his ears with every step he took cedric cedric diggory he had been starting to quite like cedric prepared to overlook the fact that he had once beaten him at quidditch and was handsome and popular and nearly favorite champion now he suddenly realized that cedric was in fact a useless pretty boy who have enough brains to fill an eggcup 
 
 fairy lights he said dully to the fat lady the password had been changed the previous day 
 
 yes indeed dear she trilled straightening her new tinsel hair band as she swung forward to admit him 
 
 
 
 entering the common room harry looked around and to his surprise he saw ron sitting in a distant corner ginny was sitting with him talking to him in what seemed to be a low soothing voice 
 
 up ron said harry joining them 
 
 ron looked up at harry a sort of blind horror in his face 
 
 why did i do it he said wildly i know what made me do it 
 
 what said harry 
 
 he er just asked fleur delacour to go to the ball with him said ginny she looked as though she was fighting back a smile but she kept patting arm sympathetically 
 
 you what said harry 
 
 i know what made me do it ron gasped again what was i playing at there were people all around gone mad everyone watching i was just walking past her in the entrance hall she was standing there talking to diggory and it sort of came over me and i asked her 
 
 ron moaned and put his face in his hands he kept talking though the words were barely distinguishable 
 
 she looked at me like i was a sea slug or something even answer and then i dunno i just sort of came to my senses and ran for it 
 
 part veela said harry you were right her grandmother was one it your fault i bet you just walked past when she was turning on the old charm for diggory and got a blast of it but she was wasting her time going with cho chang 
 
 ron looked up 
 
 i asked her to go with me just now harry said dully and she told me 
 
 ginny had suddenly stopped smiling 
 
 this is mad said ron the only ones left who got anyone well except neville hey guess who he asked hermione 
 
 what said harry completely distracted by this startling news 
 
 yeah i know said ron some of the color coming back into his face as he started to laugh he told me after potions said always been really nice helping him out with work and stuff but she told him she was already going with someone ha as if she just want to go with nevillei mean who would 
 
 said ginny annoyed laugh 
 
 just then hermione climbed in through the portrait hole 
 
 why you two at dinner she said coming over to join them 
 
 because oh shut up laughing you two because both just been turned down by girls they asked to the ball said ginny 
 
 that shut harry and ron up 
 
 thanks a bunch ginny said ron sourly 
 
 all the ones taken ron said hermione loftily eloise midgen starting to look quite pretty now is she well sure find someone somewhere have you 
 
 but ron was staring at hermione as though suddenly seeing her in a whole new light 
 
 hermione right you are a girl 
 
 oh well spotted she said acidly 
 
 well you can come with one of us 
 
 no i snapped hermione 
 
 oh come on he said impatiently we need partners going to look really stupid if we got any everyone else has 
 
 i come with you said hermione now blushing because already going with someone 
 
 no not said ron you just said that to get rid of neville 
 
 oh did i said hermione and her eyes flashed dangerously just because taken you three years to notice ron mean no one else has spotted a girl 
 
 ron stared at her then he grinned again 
 
 okay okay we know a girl he said that do will you come now 
 
 already told you hermione said very angrily going with someone else 
 
 and she stormed off toward the girls dormitories again 
 
 lying said ron flatly watching her go 
 
 not said ginny quietly 
 
 who is it then said ron sharply 
 
 not telling you her business said ginny 
 
 right said ron who looked extremely put out this is getting stupid ginny you can go with harry and just 
 
 i said ginny and she went scarlet too going with with neville he asked me when hermione said no and i not going to be able to go otherwise not in fourth year she looked extremely miserable i think go and have dinner she said and she got up and walked off to the portrait hole her head bowed 
 
 ron goggled at harry 
 
 got into them he demanded 
 
 but harry had just seen parvati and lavender come in through the portrait hole the time had come for drastic action 
 
 wait here he said to ron and he stood up walked straight up to parvati and said parvati will you go to the ball with me 
 
 parvati went into a fit of giggles harry waited for them to subside his fingers crossed in the pocket of his robes 
 
 yes all right then she said finally blushing furiously 
 
 thanks said harry in relief lavender will you go with ron 
 
 going with seamus said parvati and the pair of them giggled harder than ever 
 
 harry sighed 
 
 you think of anyone go with ron he said lowering his voice so that ron hear 
 
 what about hermione granger said parvati 
 
 going with someone else 
 
 parvati looked astonished 
 
 ooooh who she said keenly 
 
 harry shrugged no idea he said so what about ron 
 
 well said parvati slowly i suppose my sister mightpadma you knowin ravenclaw ask her if you like 
 
 yeah that would be great said harry let me know will you 
 
 and he went back over to ron feeling that this ball was a lot more trouble than it was worth and hoping very much that padma nose was dead center

 oh yes you do said professor mcgonagall irritably what telling you traditionally the champions and their partners open the ball

 harry answer he knew perfectly well whom like to ask but working up the nerve was something was a year older than he was she was very pretty she was a very good quidditch player and she was also very popular 
 
 ron seemed to know what was going on inside head 
 
 listen not going to have any trouble a champion just beaten a hungarian horntail i bet be queuing up to go with you 
 
 in tribute to their recently repaired friendship ron had kept the bitterness in his voice to a bare minimum moreover to amazement he turned out to be quite right 
 
 a hufflepuff girl to whom harry had never spoken in his life asked him to go to the ball with her the very next day harry was so taken aback he said no before even stopped to consider the matter the girl walked off looking rather hurt and harry had to endure and taunts about her all through history of magic the following day two more girls asked him a second year and to his horror a fifth year who looked as though she might knock him out if he refused 
 
 she was quite said ron fairly after stopped laughing 
 
 she was a foot taller than me said harry still unnerved imagine what look like trying to dance with her 
 
 words about krum kept coming back to him they only like him because famous harry doubted very much if any of the girls who had asked to be his partner so far would have wanted to go to the ball with him if he been a school champion then he wondered if this would bother him if cho asked him 
 
 on the whole harry had to admit that even with the embarrassing prospect of opening the ball before him life had definitely improved since he had got through the first task he attracting nearly as much unpleasantness in the corridors anymore which he suspected had a lot to do with cedric he had an idea cedric might have told the hufflepuffs to leave harry alone in gratitude for about the dragons there seemed to be fewer support cedric diggory badges around too draco malfoy of course was still quoting rita article to him at every possible opportunity but he was getting fewer and fewer laughs out of it and just to heighten feeling of no story about hagrid had appeared in the daily prophet 
 
 she didn seem very in magical creatures ter tell yeh the truth hagrid said when harry ron and hermione asked him how his interview with rita skeeter had gone during the last care of magical creatures lesson of the term to their very great relief hagrid had given up on direct contact with the skrewts now and they were merely sheltering behind his cabin today sitting at a trestle table and preparing a fresh selection of food with which to tempt the skrewts 
 
 she jus wanted me ter talk about you harry hagrid continued in a low voice well i told her been friends since i went ter fetch yeh from the dursleys never had to tell him off in four years she said never played you up in lessons has he i told her no an she didn seem happy at all think she wanted me to say yeh were horrible harry 
 
 course she did said harry throwing lumps of dragon liver into a large metal bowl and picking up his knife to cut some more she keep writing about what a tragic little hero i am get boring 
 
 she wants a new angle hagrid said ron wisely as he shelled salamander eggs you were supposed to say a mad delinquent 
 
 but not said hagrid looking genuinely shocked 
 
 she interviewed snape said harry grimly give her the goods on me any day potter has been crossing lines ever since he first arrived at this school 
 
 said that did he said hagrid while ron and hermione laughed well yeh bent a few rules harry bu all righ really aren you 
 
 cheers hagrid said harry grinning 
 
 you coming to this ball thing on christmas day hagrid said ron 
 
 though i might look in on it yeah said hagrid gruffly should be a good do i reckon be openin the dancin won yeh harry you takin 
 
 no one yet said harry feeling himself going red again hagrid pursue the subject 
 
 the last week of term became increasingly boisterous as it progressed rumors about the yule ball were flying everywhere though harry believe half of them for instance that dumbledore had bought eight hundred barrels of mulled mead from madam rosmerta it seemed to be fact however that he had booked the weird sisters exactly who or what the weird sisters were harry know never having had access to a wireless but he deduced from the wild excitement of those who had grown up listening to the wwn wizarding wireless network that they were a very famous musical group 
 
 some of the teachers like little professor flitwick gave up trying to teach them much when their minds were so clearly elsewhere he allowed them to play games in his lesson on wednesday and spent most of it talking to harry about the perfect summoning charm harry had used during the first task of the triwizard tournament other teachers were not so generous nothing would ever deflect professor binns for example from plowing on through his notes on goblin rebellions as binns let his own death stand in the way of continuing to teach they supposed a small thing like christmas going to put him off it was amazing how he could make even bloody and vicious goblin riots sound as boring as report professors mcgonagall and moody kept them working until the very last second of their classes too and snape of course would no sooner let them play games in class than adopt harry staring nastily around at them all he informed them that he would be testing them on poison antidotes during the last lesson of the term 
 
 evil he is ron said bitterly that night in the gryffindor common room springing a test on us on the last day ruining the last bit of term with a whole load of studying 
 
 not exactly straining yourself though are you said hermione looking at him over the top of her potions notes ron was busy building a card castle out of his exploding snap pack a much more interesting pastime than with muggle cards because of the chance that the whole thing would blow up at any second 
 
 christmas hermione said harry lazily he was rereading flying with the cannons for the tenth time in an armchair near the fire 
 
 hermione looked severely over at him too have thought be doing something constructive harry even if you want to learn your antidotes 
 
 like what harry said as he watched joey jenkins of the cannons belt a bludger toward a ballycastle bats chaser 
 
 that egg hermione hissed 
 
 come on hermione got till february the harry said 
 
 he had put the golden egg upstairs in his trunk and opened it since the celebration party after the first task there were still two and a half months to go until he needed to know what all the screechy wailing meant after all 
 
 but it might take weeks to work it out said hermione going to look a real idiot if everyone else knows what the next task is and you 
 
 leave him alone hermione earned a bit of a break said ron and he placed the last two cards on top of the castle and the whole lot blew up singeing his eyebrows 
 
 nice look rongo well with your dress robes that will 
 
 it was fred and george they sat down at the table with harry ron and hermione as ron felt how much damage had been done 
 
 ron can we borrow pigwidgeon george asked 
 
 no off delivering a letter said ron why 
 
 because george wants to invite him to the ball said fred sarcastically 
 
 because we want to send a letter you stupid great prat said george 
 
 who two keep writing to eh said ron 
 
 nose out ron or burn that for you too said fred waving his wand threateningly soyou lot got dates for the ball yet 
 
 nope said ron 
 
 well better hurry up mate or all the good ones will be gone said fred 
 
 you going with then said ron 
 
 angelina said fred promptly without a trace of embarrassment 
 
 what said ron taken aback already asked her 
 
 good point said fred he turned his head and called across the common room oi angelina 
 
 angelina who had been chatting with alicia spinnet near the fire looked over at him 
 
 what she called back 
 
 want to come to the ball with me 
 
 angelina gave fred an appraising sort of look 
 
 all right then she said and she turned back to alicia and carried on chatting with a bit of a grin on her face 
 
 there you go said fred to harry and ron piece of cake 
 
 he got to his feet yawning and said better use a school owl then george come on 
 
 they left ron stopped feeling his eyebrows and looked across the smoldering wreck of his card castle at harry 
 
 we should get a move on you knowask someone right we want to end up with a pair of trolls 
 
 hermione let out a sputter of indignation 
 
 a pair ofwhat excuse me 
 
 well you know said ron shrugging rather go alone than with with eloise midgen say 
 
 her loads better lately and really nice 
 
 her nose is said ron 
 
 oh i see hermione said bristling so basically going to take the girl have you even if completely horrible 
 
 er yeah that sounds about right said ron 
 
 going to bed hermione snapped and she swept off toward the girls staircase without another word 
 
 
 
 the hogwarts staff demonstrating a continued desire to impress the visitors from beauxbatons and durmstrang seemed determined to show the castle at its best this christmas when the decorations went up harry noticed that they were the most stunning he had yet seen inside the school everlasting icicles had been attached to the banisters of the marble staircase the usual twelve christmas trees in the great hall were bedecked with everything from luminous holly berries to real hooting golden owls and the suits of armor had all been bewitched to sing carols whenever anyone passed them it was quite something to hear o come all ye faithful sung by an empty helmet that only knew half the words several times filch the caretaker had to extract peeves from inside the armor where he had taken to hiding filling in the gaps in the songs with lyrics of his own invention all of which were very rude 
 
 and still harry asked cho to the ball he and ron were getting very nervous now though as harry pointed out ron would look much less stupid than he would without a partner harry was supposed to be starting the dancing with the other champions 
 
 i suppose always moaning myrtle he said gloomily referring to the ghost who haunted the girls toilets on the second floor 
 
 harry just got to grit our teeth and do it said ron on friday morning in a tone that suggested they were planning the storming of an impregnable fortress when we get back to the common room tonight both have partners agreed 
 
 erokay said harry 
 
 but every time he glimpsed cho that day during break and then lunchtime and once on the way to history of magic she was surrounded by friends she ever go anywhere alone could he perhaps ambush her as she was going into a bathroom but no she even seemed to go there with an escort of four or five girls yet if he do it soon she was bound to have been asked by somebody else 
 
 he found it hard to concentrate on potions test and consequently forgot to add the key ingredient a bezoar meaning that he received bottom marks he care though he was too busy screwing up his courage for what he was about to do when the bell rang he grabbed his bag and hurried to the dungeon door 
 
 meet you at dinner he said to ron and hermione and he dashed off upstairs 
 
 just have to ask cho for a private word that was hurried off through the packed corridors looking for her and rather sooner than he had expected he found her emerging from a defense against the dark arts lesson 
 
 er cho could i have a word with you 
 
 giggling should be made illegal harry thought furiously as all the girls around cho started doing it she though she said okay and followed him out of earshot other classmates 
 
 harry turned to look at her and his stomach gave a weird lurch as though he had missed a step going downstairs 
 
 er he said 
 
 he ask her he but he had to cho stood there looking puzzled watching him the words came out before harry had quite got his tongue around them 
 
 wangoballwime 
 
 sorry said cho 
 
 want to go to the ball with me said harry why did he have to go red now why 
 
 oh said cho and she went red too oh harry really sorry and she truly looked it already said go with someone else 
 
 oh said harry 
 
 it was odd a moment before his insides had been writhing like snakes but suddenly he seem to have any insides at all 
 
 oh okay he said no problem 
 
 really sorry she said again 
 
 okay said harry 
 
 they stood there looking at each other and then cho said well 
 
 yeah said harry 
 
 well bye said cho still very red she walked away 
 
 harry called after her before he could stop himself 
 
 you going with 
 
 oh cedric she said cedric diggory 
 
 oh right said harry 
 
 his insides had come back again it felt as though they had been filled with lead in their absence 
 
 completely forgetting about dinner he walked slowly back up to gryffindor tower voice echoing in his ears with every step he took cedric cedric diggory he had been starting to quite like cedric prepared to overlook the fact that he had once beaten him at quidditch and was handsome and popular and nearly favorite champion now he suddenly realized that cedric was in fact a useless pretty boy who have enough brains to fill an eggcup 
 
 fairy lights he said dully to the fat lady the password had been changed the previous day 
 
 yes indeed dear she trilled straightening her new tinsel hair band as she swung forward to admit him 
 
 
 
 entering the common room harry looked around and to his surprise he saw ron sitting in a distant corner ginny was sitting with him talking to him in what seemed to be a low soothing voice 
 
 up ron said harry joining them 
 
 ron looked up at harry a sort of blind horror in his face 
 
 why did i do it he said wildly i know what made me do it 
 
 what said harry 
 
 he er just asked fleur delacour to go to the ball with him said ginny she looked as though she was fighting back a smile but she kept patting arm sympathetically 
 
 you what said harry 
 
 i know what made me do it ron gasped again what was i playing at there were people all around gone mad everyone watching i was just walking past her in the entrance hall she was standing there talking to diggory and it sort of came over me and i asked her 
 
 ron moaned and put his face in his hands he kept talking though the words were barely distinguishable 
 
 she looked at me like i was a sea slug or something even answer and then i dunno i just sort of came to my senses and ran for it 
 
 part veela said harry you were right her grandmother was one it your fault i bet you just walked past when she was turning on the old charm for diggory and got a blast of it but she was wasting her time going with cho chang 
 
 ron looked up 
 
 i asked her to go with me just now harry said dully and she told me 
 
 ginny had suddenly stopped smiling 
 
 this is mad said ron the only ones left who got anyone well except neville hey guess who he asked hermione 
 
 what said harry completely distracted by this startling news 
 
 yeah i know said ron some of the color coming back into his face as he started to laugh he told me after potions said always been really nice helping him out with work and stuff but she told him she was already going with someone ha as if she just want to go with nevillei mean who would 
 
 said ginny annoyed laugh 
 
 just then hermione climbed in through the portrait hole 
 
 why you two at dinner she said coming over to join them 
 
 because oh shut up laughing you two because both just been turned down by girls they asked to the ball said ginny 
 
 that shut harry and ron up 
 
 thanks a bunch ginny said ron sourly 
 
 all the ones taken ron said hermione loftily eloise midgen starting to look quite pretty now is she well sure find someone somewhere have you 
 
 but ron was staring at hermione as though suddenly seeing her in a whole new light 
 
 hermione right you are a girl 
 
 oh well spotted she said acidly 
 
 well you can come with one of us 
 
 no i snapped hermione 
 
 oh come on he said impatiently we need partners going to look really stupid if we got any everyone else has 
 
 i come with you said hermione now blushing because already going with someone 
 
 no not said ron you just said that to get rid of neville 
 
 oh did i said hermione and her eyes flashed dangerously just because taken you three years to notice ron mean no one else has spotted a girl 
 
 ron stared at her then he grinned again 
 
 okay okay we know a girl he said that do will you come now 
 
 already told you hermione said very angrily going with someone else 
 
 and she stormed off toward the girls dormitories again 
 
 lying said ron flatly watching her go 
 
 not said ginny quietly 
 
 who is it then said ron sharply 
 
 not telling you her business said ginny 
 
 right said ron who looked extremely put out this is getting stupid ginny you can go with harry and just 
 
 i said ginny and she went scarlet too going with with neville he asked me when hermione said no and i not going to be able to go otherwise not in fourth year she looked extremely miserable i think go and have dinner she said and she got up and walked off to the portrait hole her head bowed 
 
 ron goggled at harry 
 
 got into them he demanded 
 
 but harry had just seen parvati and lavender come in through the portrait hole the time had come for drastic action 
 
 wait here he said to ron and he stood up walked straight up to parvati and said parvati will you go to the ball with me 
 
 parvati went into a fit of giggles harry waited for them to subside his fingers crossed in the pocket of his robes 
 
 yes all right then she said finally blushing furiously 
 
 thanks said harry in relief lavender will you go with ron 
 
 going with seamus said parvati and the pair of them giggled harder than ever 
 
 harry sighed 
 
 you think of anyone go with ron he said lowering his voice so that ron hear 
 
 what about hermione granger said parvati 
 
 going with someone else 
 
 parvati looked astonished 
 
 ooooh who she said keenly 
 
 harry shrugged no idea he said so what about ron 
 
 well said parvati slowly i suppose my sister mightpadma you knowin ravenclaw ask her if you like 
 
 yeah that would be great said harry let me know will you 
 
 and he went back over to ron feeling that this ball was a lot more trouble than it was worth and hoping very much that padma nose was dead center 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the goblet of fire 
 

lionfish nov chapter st hosptial for magical maladies and injuriescontents prev chapter next chapter 
 harry was so relieved she was taking him seriously that he did not hesitate but jumped out of bed at once pulled on his dressing gown and pushed his glasses back on to his nose 
 
 weasley you ought to come too said professor mcgonagall 
 
 they followed professor mcgonagall past the silent figures of neville dean and seamus out of the dormitory down the spiral stairs into the common room through the portrait hole and off along the fat moonlit corridor harry felt as though the panic inside him might spill over at any moment he wanted to run to yell for dumbledore mr weasley was bleeding as they walked along so sedately and what if those fangs harry tried hard not to think my fangs had been poisonous they passed mrs norris who turned her lamplike eyes upon them and hissed faintly but professor mcgonagall said shoo mrs norris slunk away into the shadows and in a few minutes they had reached the stone gargoyle guarding the entrance to dumbledore s office 
 
 fizzing whizzbee said professor mcgonagall 
 
 the gargoyle sprang to life and leapt aside the wall behind it split in two to reveal a stone staircase that was moving continually upwards like a spiral escalator the three of them stepped on to the moving stairs the wall closed behind them with a thud and they were moving upwards in tight circles until they reached the highly polished oak door with the brass knocker shaped like a griffin 
 
 though it was now well past midnight there were voices coming from inside the room a positive babble of them it sounded as though dumbledore was entertaining at least a dozen people 
 
 professor mcgonagall rapped three times with the griffin knocker and the voices ceased abruptly as though someone had switched them all off the door opened of its own accord and professor mcgonagall led harry and ron inside 
 
 the room was in the strange silver instruments standing on tables were silent and still rather than whirring and emitting puffs of smoke as they usually did the portraits of old headmasters and headmistresses covering the walls were all snoozing in their frames behind the door a magnificent red and gold bird the size of a swan dozed on its perch with its head under its wing 
 
 oh you professor mcgonagall and ah 
 
 dumbledore was sitting in a chair behind his desk he leaned forward into the pool of candlelight illuminating the papers laid out before him he was wearing a magnificently embroidered purple and gold dressing gown over a snowy white nightshirt but seemed his penetrating light blue eyes fixed intently upon professor mcgonagall 
 
 professor dumbledore potter has had a well a nightmare said professor mcgonagall he says 
 
 it a nightmare said harry quickly 
 
 professor mcgonagall looked round at harry frowning slightly 
 
 very well then potter you tell the headmaster about it 
 
 i well i was asleep said harry and even in his terror and his desperation to make dumbledore understand he felt slightly irritated that the headmaster was not looking at him but examining his own interlocked fingers but it an ordinary dream it was real i saw it happen he took a deep breath dadmr weasleyhas been attacked by a giant snake 
 
 the words seemed to reverberate in the air after he had said them sounding slightly ridiculous even comic there was a pause in which dumbledore leaned back and stared meditatively at the ceiling ron looked from harry to dumbledore and shocked 
 
 how did you see this dumbledore asked quietly still not looking at harry 
 
 well i know said harry rather angrilywhat did it matter inside my head i suppose 
 
 you misunderstand me said dumbledore still in the same calm tone i mean can you remembererwhere you were positioned as you watched this attack happen were you perhaps standing beside the victim or else looking down on the scene from above 
 
 this was such a curious question that harry gaped at dumbledore it was almost as though he knew 
 
 i was the snake he said i saw it all from the point of view 
 
 nobody else spoke for a moment then dumbledore now looking at ron who was still asked in a new and sharper voice is arthur seriously injured 
 
 yes said harry emphaticallywhy were they all so slow on the uptake did they not realise how much a person bled when fangs that long pierced their side and why could dumbledore not do him the courtesy of looking at him 
 
 but dumbledore stood up so quickly it made harry jump and addressed one of the old portraits hanging very near the ceiling everard he said sharply and you too dilys 
 
 a wizard with a short black fringe and an elderly witch with long silver ringlets in the frame beside him both of whom seemed to have been in the deepest of sleeps opened their eyes immediately 
 
 you were listening said dumbledore 
 
 the wizard nodded the witch said naturally 
 
 the man has red hair and glasses said dumbledore everard you will need to raise the alarm make sure he is found by the right people 
 
 both nodded and moved sideways out of their frames but instead of emerging in neighbouring pictures as usually happened at hogwarts neither reappeared one frames now contained nothing but a backdrop of dark curtain the other a handsome leather armchair harry noticed that many of the other headmasters and mistresses on the walls though snoring and drooling most convincingly kept sneaking peeks at him from under their eyelids and he suddenly understood who had been talking when they had knocked 
 
 everard and dilys were two of hogwartss most celebrated heads dumbledore said now sweeping around harry ron and professor mcgonagall to approach the magnificent sleeping bird on his perch beside the door their renown is such that both have portraits hanging in other important wizarding institutions as they are free to move between their own portraits they can tell us what may be happening elsewhere 
 
 but mr weasley could be anywhere said harry 
 
 please sit down all three of you said dumbledore as though harry had not spoken everard and dilys may not be back for several minutes professor mcgonagall if you could draw up extra chairs 
 
 professor mcgonagall pulled her wand from the pocket of her dressing gown and waved it three chairs appeared out of thin air and wooden quite unlike the comfortable chintz armchairs that dumbledore had conjured up at hearing harry sat down watching dumbledore over his shoulder dumbledore was now stroking plumed golden head with one finger the phoenix awoke immediately he stretched his beautiful head high and observed dumbledore through bright dark eyes 
 
 we will need dumbledore said very quietly to the bird a warning 
 
 there was a flash of fire and the phoenix had gone 
 
 dumbledore now swooped down upon one of the fragile silver instruments whose function harry had never known carried it over to his desk sat down facing them again and tapped it gently with the tip of his wand 
 
 the instrument tinkled into life at once with rhythmic clinking noises tiny puffs of pale green smoke issued from the minuscule silver tube at the top dumbledore watched the smoke closely his brow furrowed after a few seconds the tiny puffs became a steady stream of smoke that thickened and coiled in the air a head grew out of the end of it opening its mouth wide harry wondered whether the instrument was confirming his story he looked eagerly at dumbledore for a sign that he was right but dumbledore did not look up 
 
 naturally naturally murmured dumbledore apparently to himself still observing the stream of smoke without the slightest sign of surprise but in essence divided 
 
 harry could make neither head nor tail of this question the smoke serpent however split itself instantly into two snakes both coiling and undulating in the dark air with a look of grim satisfaction dumbledore gave the instrument another gentle tap with his wand the clinking noise slowed and died and the smoke serpents grew faint became a formless haze and vanished 
 
 dumbledore replaced the instrument on its spindly little table harry saw many of the old headmasters in the portraits follow him with their eyes then realising that harry was watching them hastily pretend to be sleeping again harry wanted to ask what the strange silver instrument was for but before he could do so there was a shout from the top of the wall to their right the wizard called everard had reappeared in his portrait panting slightly 
 
 dumbledore 
 
 what news said dumbledore at once 
 
 i yelled until someone came running said the wizard who was mopping his brow on the curtain behind him said heard something moving downstairsthey sure whether to believe me but went down to checkyou know there are no portraits down there to watch from anyway they carried him up a few minutes later he look good covered in blood i ran along to elfrida portrait to get a good view as they left 
 
 good said dumbledore as ron made a convulsive movement i take it dilys will have seen him arrive then 
 
 and moments later the witch had reappeared in her picture too she sank coughing into her armchair and said yes taken him to st dumbledore they carried him past my portrait he looks bad 
 
 thank you said dumbledore he looked round at professor mcgonagall 
 
 minerva i need you to go and wake the other weasley children 
 
 of course 
 
 professor mcgonagall got up and moved swiftly to the door harry cast a sideways glance at ron who was looking terrified 
 
 and dumbledore what about molly said professor mcgonagall pausing at the door 
 
 that will be a job for fawkes when he has finished keeping a lookout for anybody approaching said dumbledore but she may already know that excellent clock of hers 
 
 harry knew dumbledore was referring to the clock that told not the time but the whereabouts and conditions of the various weasley family members and with a pang he thought that mr hand must even now be pointing at mortal it was very late mrs weasley was probably asleep not watching the clock harry felt cold as he remembered mrs boggart turning into mr lifeless body his glasses askew blood running down his face but mr weasley going to die he 
 
 dumbledore was now rummaging in a cupboard behind harry and ron he emerged from it carrying a blackened old kettle which he placed carefully on his desk he raised his wand and murmured portus for a moment the kettle trembled glowing with an odd blue light then it quivered to rest as solidly black as ever 
 
 dumbledore marched over to another portrait this time of a wizard with a pointed beard who had been painted wearing the slytherin colours of green and silver and was apparently sleeping so deeply that he could not hear voice when he attempted to rouse him 
 
 phineas phineas 
 
 the subjects of the portraits lining the room were no longer pretending to be asleep they were shifting around in their frames the better to watch what was happening when the wizard continued to feign sleep some of them shouted his name too 
 
 phineas phineas phineas 
 
 he could not pretend any longer he gave a theatrical jerk and opened his eyes wide 
 
 did someone call 
 
 i need you to visit your other portrait again phineas said dumbledore got another message 
 
 visit my other portrait said phineas in a reedy voice giving a long fake yawn his eyes travelling around the room and focusing on harry oh no dumbledore i am too tired tonight 
 
 something about voice was familiar to harry where had he heard it before but before he could think the portraits on the surrounding walls broke into a storm of protest 
 
 insubordination sir roared a corpulent wizard brandishing his fists dereliction of duty 
 
 we are to give service to the present headmaster of hogwarts cried a old wizard whom harry recognised as predecessor armando dippet sharne on you phineas 
 
 shall i persuade him dumbledore called a witch raising an unusually thick wand that looked not unlike a birch rod 
 
 oh very well said the wizard called phineas eyeing the wand with mild apprehension though he may well have destroyed my picture by now done away with most of the family 
 
 sirius knows not to destroy your portrait said dumbledore and harry realised immediately where he had heard voice before issuing from the apparently empty frame in his bedroom in grimmauld place you are to give him the message that arthur weasley has been gravely injured and that his wife children and harry potter will be arriving at his house shortly do you understand 
 
 arthur weasley injured wife and children and harry potter coming to stay repeated phineas in a bored voice yes yes very well 
 
 he sloped away into the frame of the portrait and disappeared from view at the very moment the study door opened again fred george and ginny were ushered inside by professor mcgonagall all three of them looking dishevelled and shocked still in their night things 
 
 going on asked ginny who looked frightened professor mcgonagall says you saw dad get hurt 
 
 your father has been injured in the course of his work for the order of the phoenix said dumbledore before harry could speak he has been taken to st hospital for magical maladies and injuries i am sending you back to house which is much more convenient for the hospital than the burrow you will meet your mother there 
 
 we going asked fred looking shaken floo powder 
 
 no said dumbledore floo powder is not safe at the moment the network is being watched you will be taking a portkey he indicated the old kettle lying innocently on his desk we are just waiting for phineas nigellus to report back i want to be sure that the coast is clear before sending you 
 
 there was a flash of flame in the very middle of the office leaving behind a single golden feather that floated gently to the floor 
 
 it is warning said dumbledore catching the feather as it fell professor umbridge must know out of your beds minerva go and head her offtell her any story 
 
 professor mcgonagall was gone in a swish of tartan 
 
 he says be delighted said a bored voice behind dumbledore the wizard called phineas had reappeared in front of his slytherin banner my has always had an odd taste in 
 
 come here then dumbledore said to harry and the weasleys and quickly before anyone else joins us 
 
 harry and the others gathered around desk 
 
 you have all used a portkey before asked dumbledore and they nodded each reaching out to touch some part of the blackened kettle good on the count of three then one two 
 
 it happened in a fraction of a second in the infinitesimal pause before dumbledore said three harry looked up at himthey were very close togetherand clear blue gaze moved from the portkey to face 
 
 at once scar burned as though the old wound had burst open againand unbidden unwanted but terrifyingly strong there rose within harry a hatred so powerful he felt for that instant he would like nothing better than to striketo biteto sink his fangs into the man before him 
 
 three 
 
 harry felt a powerful jerk behind his navel the ground vanished from beneath his feet his hand was glued to the kettle he was banging into the others as they all sped forwards in a swirl of colours and a rush of wind the kettle pulling them onwards until his feet hit the ground so hard his knees buckled the kettle clattered to the ground and somewhere close at hand a voice said 
 
 back again the brats is it true their dying 
 
 out roared a second voice 
 
 harry scrambled to his feet and looked around they had arrived in the gloomy basement kitchen of number twelve grimmauld place the only sources of light were the fire and one guttering candle which illuminated the remains of a solitary supper kreacher was disappearing through the door to the hall looking back at them malevolently as he hitched up his loincloth sirius was hurrying towards them all looking anxious he was unshaven and still in his day clothes there was also a slightly whiff of stale drink about him 
 
 going on he said stretching out a hand to help ginny up thineas nigellus said been badly injured 
 
 ask harry said fred 
 
 yeah i want to hear this for myself said george 
 
 the twins and ginny were staring at him footsteps had stopped on the stairs outside 
 
 it was harry began this was even worse than telling mcgonagall and dumbledore i had aa kind ofvision 
 
 and he told them all that he had seen though he altered the story so that it sounded as though he had watched from the sidelines as the snake attacked rather than from behind the own eyes ron who was still very white gave him a fleeting look but did not speak when harry had finished fred george and ginny continued to stare at him for a moment harry did not know whether he was imagining it or not but he fancied there was something accusatory in their looks well if they were going to blame him just for seeing the attack he was glad he had not told them that he had been inside the snake at the time 
 
 is mum here said fred turning to sirius 
 
 she probably even know happened yet said sirius the important thing was to get you away before umbridge could interfere i expect letting molly know now 
 
 got to go to st mungos said ginny urgently she looked around at her brothers they were of course still in their pyjamas sirius can you lend us cloaks or anything 
 
 hang on you go tearing off to st said sirius 
 
 course we can go to st if we want said fred with a mulish expression our dad 
 
 and how are you going to explain how you knew arthur was attacked before the hospital even let his wife know 
 
 what does that matter said george hotly 
 
 it matters because we want to draw attention to the fact that harry is having visions of things that are happening hundreds of miles away said sirius angrily have you any idea what the ministry would make off that information 
 
 fred and george looked as though they could not care less what the ministry made of anything ron was still and silent 
 
 ginny said somebody else could have told us we could have heard it somewhere other than harry 
 
 like who said sirius impatiently listen your been hurt while on duty for the order and the circumstances are fishy enough without his children knowing about it seconds after it happened you could seriously damage the 
 
 we care about the dumb order shouted fred 
 
 our dad dying talking about yelled george 
 
 your father knew what he was getting into and he thank you for messing things up for the order said sirius equally angry this is how it isthis is why not in the orderyou understandthere are things worth dying for 
 
 easy for you to say stuck here bellowed fred i see you risking your neck 
 
 the little colour remaining in face drained from it he looked for a moment as though he would quite like to hit fred but when he spoke it was in a voice of determined calm 
 
 i know hard but all got to act as though we know anything yet got to stay put at least until we hear from your mother all right 
 
 fred and george still looked mutinous ginny however took a few steps over to the nearest chair and sank into it harry looked at ron who made a funny movement somewhere between a nod and a shrug and they sat down too the twins glared at sirius for another minute then took seats either side of ginny 
 
 right said sirius encouragingly come on lets all all have a drink while waiting accio butterbeer 
 
 he raised his wand as he spoke and half a dozen bottles came flying towards them out of the pantry skidded along the table scattering the debris of meal and stopped neatly in front of the six of them they all drank and for a while the only sounds were those of the crackling of the kitchen fire and the soft thud of their bottles on the table 
 
 harry was only drinking to have something to do with his hands his stomach was full of horrible hot bubbling guilt they would not be here if it were not for him they would all still be asleep in bed and it was no good telling himself that by raising the alarm he had ensured that mr weasley was found because there was also the inescapable business of it being he who had attacked mr weasley in the first place 
 
 be stupid you got fangs he told himself trying to keep calm though the hand on his butterbeer bottle was shaking you were lying in bed you attacking anyone 
 
 but then what just happened in office he asked himself i felt like i wanted to attack dumbledore too 
 
 he put the bottle down a little harder than he meant to and it slopped over on to the table no one took any notice then a burst of fire in midair illuminated the dirty plates in front of them and as they gave cries of shock a scroll of parchment fell with a thud on to the table accompanied by a single golden phoenix tail feather 
 
 fawkes said sirius at once snatching up the parchment not writing it must be a message from your motherhere 
 
 he thrust the letter into hand who ripped it open and read aloud dad is still alive i am setting out for st now stay where you are i will send news as soon as i can mum 
 
 george looked around the table 
 
 still alive he said slowly but that makes it sound 
 
 he did not need to finish the sentence it sounded to harry too as though mr weasley was hovering somewhere between life and death still exceptionally pale ron stared at the back of his letter as though it might speak words of comfort to him fred pulled the parchment out of hands and read it for himself then looked up at harry who felt his hand shaking on his butterbeer bottle again and clenched it more tightly to stop the trembling 
 
 if harry had ever sat through a longer night than this one he could not remember it sirius suggested once without any real conviction that they all go to bed but the weasleys looks of disgust were answer enough they mostly sat in silence around the table watching the candle wick sinking lower and lower into liquid wax occasionally raising a bottle to their lips speaking only to check the time to wonder aloud what was happening and to reassure each other that if there was bad news they would know straightaway for mrs weasley must long since have arrived at st 
 
 fred fell into a doze his head lolling sideways on to his shoulder ginny was curled like a cat on her chair but her eyes were open harry could see them reflecting the firelight ron was sitting with his head in his hands whether awake or asleep it was impossible to tell harry and sirius looked at each other every so often intruders upon the family grief waiting waiting 
 
 at ten past five in the morning by watch the kitchen door swung open and mrs weasley entered the kitchen she was extremely pale but when they all turned to look at her fred ron and harry half rising from their chairs she gave a wan smile 
 
 going to be all right she said her voice weak with tiredness sleeping we can all go and see him later sitting with him now going to take the morning off work 
 
 fred fell back into his chair with his hands over his face george and ginny got up walked swiftly over to their mother and hugged her ron gave a very shaky laugh and downed the rest of his butterbeer in one 
 
 breakfast said sirius loudly and joyfully jumping to his feet that accursed kreacher kreacher 
 
 but kreacher did not answer the summons 
 
 oh forget it then muttered sirius counting the people in front of him so breakfast seeseven bacon and eggs i think and some tea and toast 
 
 harry hurried over to the stove to help he did not want to intrude on the weasleys happiness and he dreaded the moment when mrs weasley would ask him to recount his vision however he had barely taken plates from the dresser when mrs weasley lifted them out of his hands and pulled him into a hug 
 
 i know what would have happened if it been for you harry she said in a muffled voice they might not have found arthur for hours and then it would have been too late but thanks to you alive and been able to think up a good cover story for arthur being where he was no idea what trouble he would have been in otherwise look at poor sturgis 
 
 harry could hardly bear her gratitude but fortunately she soon released him to turn to sirius and thank him for looking after her children through the night sirius said he was very pleased to have been able to help and hoped they would all stay with him as long as mr weasley was in hospital 
 
 oh sirius so grateful they think be there a little while and it would be wonderful to be nearer of course that might mean here for christmas 
 
 the more the merrier said sirius with such obvious sincerity that mrs weasley beamed at him threw on an apron and began to help with breakfast 
 
 sirius harry muttered unable to stand it a moment longer can i have a quick word er now 
 
 he walked into the dark pantry and sirius followed without preamble harry told his godfather every detail of the vision he had had including the fact that he himself had been the snake who had attacked mr weasley 
 
 when he paused for breath sirius said did you tell dumbledore this 
 
 yes said harry impatiently but he tell me what it meant well he tell me anything any more 
 
 i m sure he would have told you if it was anything to worry about said sirius steadily 
 
 but not all said harry in a voice only a little above a whisper sirius i i think going mad back in office just before we took the portkey for a couple of seconds there i thought i was a snake i felt like onemy scar really hurt when i was looking at dumbledoresirius i wanted to attack him 
 
 he could only see a sliver of face the rest was in darkness 
 
 it must have been the aftermath of the vision all said sirius you were still thinking of the dream or whatever it was and 
 
 it that said harry shaking his head it was like something rose up inside me like a snake inside me 
 
 you need to sleep said sirius firmly going to have breakfast then go upstairs to bed and after lunch you can go and see arthur with the others in shock harry blaming yourself for something you only witnessed and lucky you did witness it or arthur might have died just stop worrying 
 
 he clapped harry on the shoulder and left the pantry leaving harry standing alone in the dark 
 
 everyone but harry spent the rest of the morning sleeping he went up to the bedroom he and ron had shared over the last few weeks of summer but while ron crawled into bed and was asleep within minutes harry sat fully clothed hunched against the cold metal bars of the bedstead keeping himself deliberately uncomfortable determined not to fall into a doze terrified that he might become the serpent again in his sleep and wake to find that he had attacked ron or else slithered through the house after one of the others 
 
 when ron woke up harry pretended to have enjoyed a refreshing nap too their trunks arrived from hogwarts while they were eating lunch so they could dress as muggles for the trip to st everybody except harry was riotously happy and talkative as they changed out of their robes into jeans and sweatshirts when tonks and turned up to escort them across london they greeted them gleefully laughing at the bowler hat was wearing at an angle to conceal his magical eye and assuring him truthfully that tonks whose hair was short and bright pink again would attract far less attention on the underground 
 
 tonks was very interested in vision of the attack on mr weasley something harry was not remotely interested in discussing 
 
 there any seer blood in your family is there she enquired curiously as they sat side by side on a train rattling towards the heart of the city 
 
 no said harry thinking of professor trelawney and feeling insulted 
 
 no said tonks musingly no i suppose not really prophecy doing is it i mean not seeing the future seeing the present odd it useful though 
 
 harry answer fortunately they got out at the next stop a station in the very heart of london and in the bustle of leaving the train he was able to allow fred and george to get between himself and tonks who was leading the way they all followed her up the escalator moody clunking along at the back of the group his bowler tilted low and one gnarled hand stuck in between the buttons of his coat clutching his wand harry thought he sensed the concealed eye staring hard at him trying to avoid any more questions about his dream he asked where st was hidden 
 
 not far from here grunted moody as they stepped out into the wintry air on a broad street packed with christmas shoppers he pushed harry a little ahead of him and stumped along just behind harry knew the eye was rolling in all directions under the tilted hat easy to find a good location for a hospital nowhere in diagon alley was big enough and we have it underground like the be healthy in the end they managed to get hold of a building up here theory was sick wizards could come and go and just blend in with the crowd 
 
 he seized shoulder to prevent them being separated by a gaggle of shoppers plainly intent on nothing but making it into a nearby shop full of electrical gadgets 
 
 here we go said moody a moment later 
 
 they had arrived outside a large department store called purge dowse ltd the place had a shabby miserable air the window displays consisted of a few chipped dummies with their wigs askew standing at random and modelling fashions at least ten years out of date large signs on all the dusty doors read closed for refurbishment harry distinctly heard a large woman laden with plastic shopping bags say to her friend as they passed never open that place 
 
 right said tonks beckoning them towards a window displaying nothing but a particularly ugly female dummy its false eyelashes were hanging off and it was modelling a green nylon pinafore dress everybody ready 
 
 they nodded clustering around her moody gave harry another shove between the shoulder blades to urge him forward and tonks leaned close to the glass looking up at the very ugly dummy her breath steaming up the glass wotcher she said here to see arthur weasley 
 
 harry thought how absurd it was for tonks to expect the dummy to hear her talking so quietly through a sheet of glass with buses rumbling along behind her and all the racket of a street full of shoppers then he reminded himself that dummies hear anyway next second his mouth opened in shock as the dummy gave a tiny nod and beckoned with its jointed finger and tonks had seized ginny and mrs weasley by the elbows stepped right through the glass and vanished 
 
 fred george and ron stepped after them harry glanced around at the jostling crowd not one of them seemed to have a glance to spare for window displays as ugly as those of purge dowse ltd nor did any of them seem to have noticed that six people had just melted into thin air in front of them 
 
 growled moody giving harry yet another poke in the back and together they stepped forward through what felt like a sheet of cool water emerging quite warm and dry on the other side 
 
 there was no sign of the ugly dummy or the space where she had stood they were in what seemed to be a crowded reception area where rows of witches and wizards sat upon rickety wooden chairs some looking perfectly normal and perusing copies of witch weekly others sporting gruesome disfigurements such as elephant trunks or extra hands sticking out of their chests the room was scarcely less quiet than the street outside for many of the patients were making very peculiar noises a witch in the centre of the front row who was fanning herself vigorously with a copy of the daily prophet kept letting off a whistle as steam came pouring out of her mouth a warlock in the corner clanged like a bell every time he moved and with each clang his head vibrated horribly so that he had to seize himself by the ears to hold it steady 
 
 witches and wizards in robes were walking up and down the rows asking questions and making notes on clipboards like harry noticed the emblem embroidered on their chests a wand and bone crossed 
 
 are they doctors he asked ron quietly 
 
 doctors said ron looking startled those muggle nutters that cut people up nah healers 
 
 over here called mrs weasley above the renewed clanging of the warlock in the corner and they followed her to the queue in front of a plump blonde witch seated at a desk marked wall behind her was covered in notices and posters saying things like a clean cauldron keeps potions from becoming poisons and antidotes are unless approved by a qualified healer there was also a large portrait of a witch with long silver ringlets which was labelled 
 
 dilys derwent 
 
 st healer 
 
 headmistress of hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry 
 
 
 
 dilys was eyeing the weasley party closely as though counting them when harry caught her eye she gave a tiny wink walked sideways out of her portrait and vanished 
 
 meanwhile at the front of the queue a young wizard was performing an odd jig and trying in between yelps of pain to explain his predicament to the witch behind the desk 
 
 these ouchshoes my brother gave meowthey re eating myouchfeetlook at them there must be some kind ofaarghjinx on them and i aaaaarghget them off he hopped from one foot to the other as though dancing on hot coals 
 
 the shoes prevent you reading do they said the blonde witch irritably pointing at a large sign to the left of her desk you want spell damage fourth floor just like it says on the floor guide next 
 
 as the wizard hobbled and pranced sideways out of the way the weasley party moved forward a few steps and harry read the floor guide

 if you are unsure where to go incapable of normal speech or unable to remember why you are here our welcomewitch will be pleased to help 
 
 a very old stooped wizard with a hearing trumpet had shuffled to the front of the queue now here to see broderick bode he wheezed 
 
 ward but afraid wasting your time said the witch dismissively completely addled you knowstill thinks a teapot next 
 
 a wizard was holding his small daughter tightly by the ankle while she flapped around his head using the immensely large feathery wings that had sprouted right out through the back of her romper suit 
 
 fourth floor said the witch in a bored voice without asking and the man disappeared through the double doors beside the desk holding his daughter like an oddly shaped balloon next 
 
 mrs weasley moved forward to the desk 
 
 hello she said my husband arthur weasley was supposed to be moved to a different ward this morning could you tell us 
 
 arthur weasley said the witch running her finger down a long list in front of her yes first floor second door on the right dai llewellyn ward 
 
 thank you said mrs weasley come on you lot 
 
 they followed her through the double doors and along the narrow corridor beyond which was lined with more portraits of famous healers and lit by crystal bubbles full of candles that floated up on the ceiling looking like giant soapsuds more witches and wizards in robes walked in and out of the doors they passed a yellow gas wafted into the passageway as they passed one door and every now and then they heard distant wailing they climbed a flight of stairs and entered the injuries corridor where the second door on the right bore the words dangerous dai llewellyn ward serious this was a card in a brass holder on which had been handwritten hippocrates smethwyck trainee healer augustus pye 
 
 wait outside molly tonks said arthur want too many visitors at once it ought to be just the family first 
 
 growled his approval of this idea and set himself with his back against the corridor wall his magical eye spinning in all directions harry drew back too but mrs weasley reached out a hand and pushed him through the door saying be silly harry arthur wants to thank you 
 
 the ward was small and rather dingy as the only window was narrow and set high in the wall facing the door most of the light came from more shining crystal bubbles clustered in the middle of the ceiling the walls were of panelled oak and there was a portrait of a rather wizard on the wall captioned urquhart rackharrow inventor of the curse 
 
 there were only three patients mr weasley was occupying the bed at the far end oi the ward beside the tiny window harry was pleased and relieved to see that he was propped up on several pillows and reading the daily prophet by the solitary ray of sunlight falling on to his bed he looked up as they walked towards him and seeing who it was beamed 
 
 hello he called throwing the prophet aside bill just left molly had to get back to work but he says drop in on you later 
 
 how are you arthur asked mrs weasley bending down to kiss his cheek and looking anxiously into his face still looking a bit peaky 
 
 i feel absolutely fine said mr weasley brightly holding out his good arm to give ginny a hug if they could only take the bandages off be fit to go home 
 
 why they take them off dad asked fred 
 
 well i start bleeding like mad every time they try said mr weasley cheerfully reaching across for his wand which lay on his bedside cabinet and waving it so that six extra chairs appeared at his bedside to seat them all it seems there was some rather unusual kind of poison in that fangs that keeps wounds open sure find an antidote though they say had much worse cases than mine and in the meantime i just have to keep taking a potion every hour but that fellow over there he said dropping his voice and nodding towards the bed opposite in which a man lay looking green and sickly and staring at the ceiling bitten by a werewolf poor chap no cure at all 
 
 a werewolf whispered mrs weasley looking alarmed is he safe in a public ward he be in a private room 
 
 two weeks till full moon mr weasley reminded her quietly been talking to him this morning the healers you know trying to persuade him be able to lead an almost normal life i said to mention names of course but i said i knew a werewolf personally very nice man who finds the condition quite easy to manage 
 
 what did he say asked george 
 
 said give me another bite if i shut up said mr weasley sadly and that woman over there he indicated the only other occupied bed which was right beside the door tell the healers what bit her which makes us all think it must have been something she was handling illegally whatever it was took a real chunk out of her leg very nasty smell when they take off the dressings 
 
 so you going to tell us what happened dad asked fred pulling his chair closer to the bed 
 
 well you already know you said mr weasley with a significant smile at harry very had a very long day dozed off got sneaked up on and bitten 
 
 is it in the prophet you being attacked asked fred indicating the newspaper mr weasley had cast aside 
 
 no of course not said mr weasley with a slightly bitter smile the ministry want everyone to know a dirty great serpent got 
 
 arthur mrs weasley warned him 
 
 goter me mr weasley said hastily though harry was quite sure that was not what he had meant to say 
 
 so where were you when it happened dad asked george 
 
 my business said mr weasley though with a small smile he snatched up the daily prophet shook it open again and said i was just reading about willy arrest when you arrived you know willy turned out to be behind those regurgitating toilets back in the summer one of his jinxes backfired the toilet exploded and they found him lying unconscious in the wreckage covered from head to foot in 
 
 when you say you were on duty fred interrupted in a low voice what were you doing 
 
 you heard your father whispered mrs weasley we are not discussing this here go on about willy widdershins arthur 
 
 well ask me how but he actually got off the toilet charge said mr weasley grimly i can only suppose gold changed hands 
 
 you were guarding it you said george quietly the weapon the thing after 
 
 george be quiet snapped mrs weasley 
 
 anyway said mr weasley in a raised voice this time been caught selling biting doorknobs to muggles and i think be able to worm his way out of it because according to this article two muggles have lost fingers and are now in st for emergency bone and memory modification just think of it muggles in st i wonder which ward in 
 
 and he looked eagerly around as though hoping to see a signpost 
 
 you say got a snake harry asked fred looking at his father for a reaction a massive one you saw it the night he returned you 
 
 enough said mrs weasley crossly and tonks are outside arthur they want to come and see you and you lot can wait outside she added to her children and harry you can come and say goodbye afterwards go on 
 
 they trooped back into the corridor and tonks went in and closed the door of the ward behind them fred raised his eyebrows 
 
 fine he said coolly rummaging in his pockets be like that tell us anything 
 
 looking for these said george holding out what looked like a tangle of string 
 
 you read my mind said fred grinning see if st puts imperturbable charms on its ward doors shall we 
 
 he and george disentangled the string and separated five extendable ears from each other fred and george handed them around harry hesitated to take one 
 
 go on harry take it you saved life if got the right to eavesdrop on him you 
 
 grinning in spite of himself harry took the end of the string and inserted it into his ear as the twins had done 
 
 ok go fred whispered 
 
 the strings wriggled like long skinny worms and snaked under the door at first harry could hear nothing then he jumped as he heard tonks whispering as clearly as though she were standing right beside him 
 
 they searched the whole area but find the snake anywhere it just seems to have vanished after it attacked you arthur but have expected a snake to get in can he 
 
 i reckon he sent it as a lookout growled moody cause not had any luck so far has he no i reckon trying to get a clearer picture of what facing and if arthur been there the beast had a lot more time to look around so potter says he saw it all happen 
 
 yes said mrs weasley she sounded rather uneasy you know dumbledore seems almost to have been waiting for harry to see something like this 
 
 yeah well said moody something funny about the potter kid we all know that 
 
 dumbledore seemed worried about harry when i spoke to him this morning whispered mrs weasley 
 
 course worried growled moody the seeing things from inside snake obviously potter realise what that means but if possessing him 
 
 harry pulled the extendable ear out of his own his heart hammering very fast and heat rushing up his face he looked around at the others they were all staring at him the strings still trailing from their ears looking suddenly fearful 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the order of the phoenix 
 

lionfish nov chapter st hosptial for magical maladies and injuriescontents prev chapter next chapter 
 harry was so relieved she was taking him seriously that he did not hesitate but jumped out of bed at once pulled on his dressing gown and pushed his glasses back on to his nose 
 
 weasley you ought to come too said professor mcgonagall 
 
 they followed professor mcgonagall past the silent figures of neville dean and seamus out of the dormitory down the spiral stairs into the common room through the portrait hole and off along the fat moonlit corridor harry felt as though the panic inside him might spill over at any moment he wanted to run to yell for dumbledore mr weasley was bleeding as they walked along so sedately and what if those fangs harry tried hard not to think my fangs had been poisonous they passed mrs norris who turned her lamplike eyes upon them and hissed faintly but professor mcgonagall said shoo mrs norris slunk away into the shadows and in a few minutes they had reached the stone gargoyle guarding the entrance to dumbledore s office 
 
 fizzing whizzbee said professor mcgonagall 
 
 the gargoyle sprang to life and leapt aside the wall behind it split in two to reveal a stone staircase that was moving continually upwards like a spiral escalator the three of them stepped on to the moving stairs the wall closed behind them with a thud and they were moving upwards in tight circles until they reached the highly polished oak door with the brass knocker shaped like a griffin 
 
 though it was now well past midnight there were voices coming from inside the room a positive babble of them it sounded as though dumbledore was entertaining at least a dozen people 
 
 professor mcgonagall rapped three times with the griffin knocker and the voices ceased abruptly as though someone had switched them all off the door opened of its own accord and professor mcgonagall led harry and ron inside 
 
 the room was in the strange silver instruments standing on tables were silent and still rather than whirring and emitting puffs of smoke as they usually did the portraits of old headmasters and headmistresses covering the walls were all snoozing in their frames behind the door a magnificent red and gold bird the size of a swan dozed on its perch with its head under its wing 
 
 oh you professor mcgonagall and ah 
 
 dumbledore was sitting in a chair behind his desk he leaned forward into the pool of candlelight illuminating the papers laid out before him he was wearing a magnificently embroidered purple and gold dressing gown over a snowy white nightshirt but seemed his penetrating light blue eyes fixed intently upon professor mcgonagall 
 
 professor dumbledore potter has had a well a nightmare said professor mcgonagall he says 
 
 it a nightmare said harry quickly 
 
 professor mcgonagall looked round at harry frowning slightly 
 
 very well then potter you tell the headmaster about it 
 
 i well i was asleep said harry and even in his terror and his desperation to make dumbledore understand he felt slightly irritated that the headmaster was not looking at him but examining his own interlocked fingers but it an ordinary dream it was real i saw it happen he took a deep breath dadmr weasleyhas been attacked by a giant snake 
 
 the words seemed to reverberate in the air after he had said them sounding slightly ridiculous even comic there was a pause in which dumbledore leaned back and stared meditatively at the ceiling ron looked from harry to dumbledore and shocked 
 
 how did you see this dumbledore asked quietly still not looking at harry 
 
 well i know said harry rather angrilywhat did it matter inside my head i suppose 
 
 you misunderstand me said dumbledore still in the same calm tone i mean can you remembererwhere you were positioned as you watched this attack happen were you perhaps standing beside the victim or else looking down on the scene from above 
 
 this was such a curious question that harry gaped at dumbledore it was almost as though he knew 
 
 i was the snake he said i saw it all from the point of view 
 
 nobody else spoke for a moment then dumbledore now looking at ron who was still asked in a new and sharper voice is arthur seriously injured 
 
 yes said harry emphaticallywhy were they all so slow on the uptake did they not realise how much a person bled when fangs that long pierced their side and why could dumbledore not do him the courtesy of looking at him 
 
 but dumbledore stood up so quickly it made harry jump and addressed one of the old portraits hanging very near the ceiling everard he said sharply and you too dilys 
 
 a wizard with a short black fringe and an elderly witch with long silver ringlets in the frame beside him both of whom seemed to have been in the deepest of sleeps opened their eyes immediately 
 
 you were listening said dumbledore 
 
 the wizard nodded the witch said naturally 
 
 the man has red hair and glasses said dumbledore everard you will need to raise the alarm make sure he is found by the right people 
 
 both nodded and moved sideways out of their frames but instead of emerging in neighbouring pictures as usually happened at hogwarts neither reappeared one frames now contained nothing but a backdrop of dark curtain the other a handsome leather armchair harry noticed that many of the other headmasters and mistresses on the walls though snoring and drooling most convincingly kept sneaking peeks at him from under their eyelids and he suddenly understood who had been talking when they had knocked 
 
 everard and dilys were two of hogwartss most celebrated heads dumbledore said now sweeping around harry ron and professor mcgonagall to approach the magnificent sleeping bird on his perch beside the door their renown is such that both have portraits hanging in other important wizarding institutions as they are free to move between their own portraits they can tell us what may be happening elsewhere 
 
 but mr weasley could be anywhere said harry 
 
 please sit down all three of you said dumbledore as though harry had not spoken everard and dilys may not be back for several minutes professor mcgonagall if you could draw up extra chairs 
 
 professor mcgonagall pulled her wand from the pocket of her dressing gown and waved it three chairs appeared out of thin air and wooden quite unlike the comfortable chintz armchairs that dumbledore had conjured up at hearing harry sat down watching dumbledore over his shoulder dumbledore was now stroking plumed golden head with one finger the phoenix awoke immediately he stretched his beautiful head high and observed dumbledore through bright dark eyes 
 
 we will need dumbledore said very quietly to the bird a warning 
 
 there was a flash of fire and the phoenix had gone 
 
 dumbledore now swooped down upon one of the fragile silver instruments whose function harry had never known carried it over to his desk sat down facing them again and tapped it gently with the tip of his wand 
 
 the instrument tinkled into life at once with rhythmic clinking noises tiny puffs of pale green smoke issued from the minuscule silver tube at the top dumbledore watched the smoke closely his brow furrowed after a few seconds the tiny puffs became a steady stream of smoke that thickened and coiled in the air a head grew out of the end of it opening its mouth wide harry wondered whether the instrument was confirming his story he looked eagerly at dumbledore for a sign that he was right but dumbledore did not look up 
 
 naturally naturally murmured dumbledore apparently to himself still observing the stream of smoke without the slightest sign of surprise but in essence divided 
 
 harry could make neither head nor tail of this question the smoke serpent however split itself instantly into two snakes both coiling and undulating in the dark air with a look of grim satisfaction dumbledore gave the instrument another gentle tap with his wand the clinking noise slowed and died and the smoke serpents grew faint became a formless haze and vanished 
 
 dumbledore replaced the instrument on its spindly little table harry saw many of the old headmasters in the portraits follow him with their eyes then realising that harry was watching them hastily pretend to be sleeping again harry wanted to ask what the strange silver instrument was for but before he could do so there was a shout from the top of the wall to their right the wizard called everard had reappeared in his portrait panting slightly 
 
 dumbledore 
 
 what news said dumbledore at once 
 
 i yelled until someone came running said the wizard who was mopping his brow on the curtain behind him said heard something moving downstairsthey sure whether to believe me but went down to checkyou know there are no portraits down there to watch from anyway they carried him up a few minutes later he look good covered in blood i ran along to elfrida portrait to get a good view as they left 
 
 good said dumbledore as ron made a convulsive movement i take it dilys will have seen him arrive then 
 
 and moments later the witch had reappeared in her picture too she sank coughing into her armchair and said yes taken him to st dumbledore they carried him past my portrait he looks bad 
 
 thank you said dumbledore he looked round at professor mcgonagall 
 
 minerva i need you to go and wake the other weasley children 
 
 of course 
 
 professor mcgonagall got up and moved swiftly to the door harry cast a sideways glance at ron who was looking terrified 
 
 and dumbledore what about molly said professor mcgonagall pausing at the door 
 
 that will be a job for fawkes when he has finished keeping a lookout for anybody approaching said dumbledore but she may already know that excellent clock of hers 
 
 harry knew dumbledore was referring to the clock that told not the time but the whereabouts and conditions of the various weasley family members and with a pang he thought that mr hand must even now be pointing at mortal it was very late mrs weasley was probably asleep not watching the clock harry felt cold as he remembered mrs boggart turning into mr lifeless body his glasses askew blood running down his face but mr weasley going to die he 
 
 dumbledore was now rummaging in a cupboard behind harry and ron he emerged from it carrying a blackened old kettle which he placed carefully on his desk he raised his wand and murmured portus for a moment the kettle trembled glowing with an odd blue light then it quivered to rest as solidly black as ever 
 
 dumbledore marched over to another portrait this time of a wizard with a pointed beard who had been painted wearing the slytherin colours of green and silver and was apparently sleeping so deeply that he could not hear voice when he attempted to rouse him 
 
 phineas phineas 
 
 the subjects of the portraits lining the room were no longer pretending to be asleep they were shifting around in their frames the better to watch what was happening when the wizard continued to feign sleep some of them shouted his name too 
 
 phineas phineas phineas 
 
 he could not pretend any longer he gave a theatrical jerk and opened his eyes wide 
 
 did someone call 
 
 i need you to visit your other portrait again phineas said dumbledore got another message 
 
 visit my other portrait said phineas in a reedy voice giving a long fake yawn his eyes travelling around the room and focusing on harry oh no dumbledore i am too tired tonight 
 
 something about voice was familiar to harry where had he heard it before but before he could think the portraits on the surrounding walls broke into a storm of protest 
 
 insubordination sir roared a corpulent wizard brandishing his fists dereliction of duty 
 
 we are to give service to the present headmaster of hogwarts cried a old wizard whom harry recognised as predecessor armando dippet sharne on you phineas 
 
 shall i persuade him dumbledore called a witch raising an unusually thick wand that looked not unlike a birch rod 
 
 oh very well said the wizard called phineas eyeing the wand with mild apprehension though he may well have destroyed my picture by now done away with most of the family 
 
 sirius knows not to destroy your portrait said dumbledore and harry realised immediately where he had heard voice before issuing from the apparently empty frame in his bedroom in grimmauld place you are to give him the message that arthur weasley has been gravely injured and that his wife children and harry potter will be arriving at his house shortly do you understand 
 
 arthur weasley injured wife and children and harry potter coming to stay repeated phineas in a bored voice yes yes very well 
 
 he sloped away into the frame of the portrait and disappeared from view at the very moment the study door opened again fred george and ginny were ushered inside by professor mcgonagall all three of them looking dishevelled and shocked still in their night things 
 
 going on asked ginny who looked frightened professor mcgonagall says you saw dad get hurt 
 
 your father has been injured in the course of his work for the order of the phoenix said dumbledore before harry could speak he has been taken to st hospital for magical maladies and injuries i am sending you back to house which is much more convenient for the hospital than the burrow you will meet your mother there 
 
 we going asked fred looking shaken floo powder 
 
 no said dumbledore floo powder is not safe at the moment the network is being watched you will be taking a portkey he indicated the old kettle lying innocently on his desk we are just waiting for phineas nigellus to report back i want to be sure that the coast is clear before sending you 
 
 there was a flash of flame in the very middle of the office leaving behind a single golden feather that floated gently to the floor 
 
 it is warning said dumbledore catching the feather as it fell professor umbridge must know out of your beds minerva go and head her offtell her any story 
 
 professor mcgonagall was gone in a swish of tartan 
 
 he says be delighted said a bored voice behind dumbledore the wizard called phineas had reappeared in front of his slytherin banner my has always had an odd taste in 
 
 come here then dumbledore said to harry and the weasleys and quickly before anyone else joins us 
 
 harry and the others gathered around desk 
 
 you have all used a portkey before asked dumbledore and they nodded each reaching out to touch some part of the blackened kettle good on the count of three then one two 
 
 it happened in a fraction of a second in the infinitesimal pause before dumbledore said three harry looked up at himthey were very close togetherand clear blue gaze moved from the portkey to face 
 
 at once scar burned as though the old wound had burst open againand unbidden unwanted but terrifyingly strong there rose within harry a hatred so powerful he felt for that instant he would like nothing better than to striketo biteto sink his fangs into the man before him 
 
 three 
 
 harry felt a powerful jerk behind his navel the ground vanished from beneath his feet his hand was glued to the kettle he was banging into the others as they all sped forwards in a swirl of colours and a rush of wind the kettle pulling them onwards until his feet hit the ground so hard his knees buckled the kettle clattered to the ground and somewhere close at hand a voice said 
 
 back again the brats is it true their dying 
 
 out roared a second voice 
 
 harry scrambled to his feet and looked around they had arrived in the gloomy basement kitchen of number twelve grimmauld place the only sources of light were the fire and one guttering candle which illuminated the remains of a solitary supper kreacher was disappearing through the door to the hall looking back at them malevolently as he hitched up his loincloth sirius was hurrying towards them all looking anxious he was unshaven and still in his day clothes there was also a slightly whiff of stale drink about him 
 
 going on he said stretching out a hand to help ginny up thineas nigellus said been badly injured 
 
 ask harry said fred 
 
 yeah i want to hear this for myself said george 
 
 the twins and ginny were staring at him footsteps had stopped on the stairs outside 
 
 it was harry began this was even worse than telling mcgonagall and dumbledore i had aa kind ofvision 
 
 and he told them all that he had seen though he altered the story so that it sounded as though he had watched from the sidelines as the snake attacked rather than from behind the own eyes ron who was still very white gave him a fleeting look but did not speak when harry had finished fred george and ginny continued to stare at him for a moment harry did not know whether he was imagining it or not but he fancied there was something accusatory in their looks well if they were going to blame him just for seeing the attack he was glad he had not told them that he had been inside the snake at the time 
 
 is mum here said fred turning to sirius 
 
 she probably even know happened yet said sirius the important thing was to get you away before umbridge could interfere i expect letting molly know now 
 
 got to go to st mungos said ginny urgently she looked around at her brothers they were of course still in their pyjamas sirius can you lend us cloaks or anything 
 
 hang on you go tearing off to st said sirius 
 
 course we can go to st if we want said fred with a mulish expression our dad 
 
 and how are you going to explain how you knew arthur was attacked before the hospital even let his wife know 
 
 what does that matter said george hotly 
 
 it matters because we want to draw attention to the fact that harry is having visions of things that are happening hundreds of miles away said sirius angrily have you any idea what the ministry would make off that information 
 
 fred and george looked as though they could not care less what the ministry made of anything ron was still and silent 
 
 ginny said somebody else could have told us we could have heard it somewhere other than harry 
 
 like who said sirius impatiently listen your been hurt while on duty for the order and the circumstances are fishy enough without his children knowing about it seconds after it happened you could seriously damage the 
 
 we care about the dumb order shouted fred 
 
 our dad dying talking about yelled george 
 
 your father knew what he was getting into and he thank you for messing things up for the order said sirius equally angry this is how it isthis is why not in the orderyou understandthere are things worth dying for 
 
 easy for you to say stuck here bellowed fred i see you risking your neck 
 
 the little colour remaining in face drained from it he looked for a moment as though he would quite like to hit fred but when he spoke it was in a voice of determined calm 
 
 i know hard but all got to act as though we know anything yet got to stay put at least until we hear from your mother all right 
 
 fred and george still looked mutinous ginny however took a few steps over to the nearest chair and sank into it harry looked at ron who made a funny movement somewhere between a nod and a shrug and they sat down too the twins glared at sirius for another minute then took seats either side of ginny 
 
 right said sirius encouragingly come on lets all all have a drink while waiting accio butterbeer 
 
 he raised his wand as he spoke and half a dozen bottles came flying towards them out of the pantry skidded along the table scattering the debris of meal and stopped neatly in front of the six of them they all drank and for a while the only sounds were those of the crackling of the kitchen fire and the soft thud of their bottles on the table 
 
 harry was only drinking to have something to do with his hands his stomach was full of horrible hot bubbling guilt they would not be here if it were not for him they would all still be asleep in bed and it was no good telling himself that by raising the alarm he had ensured that mr weasley was found because there was also the inescapable business of it being he who had attacked mr weasley in the first place 
 
 be stupid you got fangs he told himself trying to keep calm though the hand on his butterbeer bottle was shaking you were lying in bed you attacking anyone 
 
 but then what just happened in office he asked himself i felt like i wanted to attack dumbledore too 
 
 he put the bottle down a little harder than he meant to and it slopped over on to the table no one took any notice then a burst of fire in midair illuminated the dirty plates in front of them and as they gave cries of shock a scroll of parchment fell with a thud on to the table accompanied by a single golden phoenix tail feather 
 
 fawkes said sirius at once snatching up the parchment not writing it must be a message from your motherhere 
 
 he thrust the letter into hand who ripped it open and read aloud dad is still alive i am setting out for st now stay where you are i will send news as soon as i can mum 
 
 george looked around the table 
 
 still alive he said slowly but that makes it sound 
 
 he did not need to finish the sentence it sounded to harry too as though mr weasley was hovering somewhere between life and death still exceptionally pale ron stared at the back of his letter as though it might speak words of comfort to him fred pulled the parchment out of hands and read it for himself then looked up at harry who felt his hand shaking on his butterbeer bottle again and clenched it more tightly to stop the trembling 
 
 if harry had ever sat through a longer night than this one he could not remember it sirius suggested once without any real conviction that they all go to bed but the weasleys looks of disgust were answer enough they mostly sat in silence around the table watching the candle wick sinking lower and lower into liquid wax occasionally raising a bottle to their lips speaking only to check the time to wonder aloud what was happening and to reassure each other that if there was bad news they would know straightaway for mrs weasley must long since have arrived at st 
 
 fred fell into a doze his head lolling sideways on to his shoulder ginny was curled like a cat on her chair but her eyes were open harry could see them reflecting the firelight ron was sitting with his head in his hands whether awake or asleep it was impossible to tell harry and sirius looked at each other every so often intruders upon the family grief waiting waiting 
 
 at ten past five in the morning by watch the kitchen door swung open and mrs weasley entered the kitchen she was extremely pale but when they all turned to look at her fred ron and harry half rising from their chairs she gave a wan smile 
 
 going to be all right she said her voice weak with tiredness sleeping we can all go and see him later sitting with him now going to take the morning off work 
 
 fred fell back into his chair with his hands over his face george and ginny got up walked swiftly over to their mother and hugged her ron gave a very shaky laugh and downed the rest of his butterbeer in one 
 
 breakfast said sirius loudly and joyfully jumping to his feet that accursed kreacher kreacher 
 
 but kreacher did not answer the summons 
 
 oh forget it then muttered sirius counting the people in front of him so breakfast seeseven bacon and eggs i think and some tea and toast 
 
 harry hurried over to the stove to help he did not want to intrude on the weasleys happiness and he dreaded the moment when mrs weasley would ask him to recount his vision however he had barely taken plates from the dresser when mrs weasley lifted them out of his hands and pulled him into a hug 
 
 i know what would have happened if it been for you harry she said in a muffled voice they might not have found arthur for hours and then it would have been too late but thanks to you alive and been able to think up a good cover story for arthur being where he was no idea what trouble he would have been in otherwise look at poor sturgis 
 
 harry could hardly bear her gratitude but fortunately she soon released him to turn to sirius and thank him for looking after her children through the night sirius said he was very pleased to have been able to help and hoped they would all stay with him as long as mr weasley was in hospital 
 
 oh sirius so grateful they think be there a little while and it would be wonderful to be nearer of course that might mean here for christmas 
 
 the more the merrier said sirius with such obvious sincerity that mrs weasley beamed at him threw on an apron and began to help with breakfast 
 
 sirius harry muttered unable to stand it a moment longer can i have a quick word er now 
 
 he walked into the dark pantry and sirius followed without preamble harry told his godfather every detail of the vision he had had including the fact that he himself had been the snake who had attacked mr weasley 
 
 when he paused for breath sirius said did you tell dumbledore this 
 
 yes said harry impatiently but he tell me what it meant well he tell me anything any more 
 
 i m sure he would have told you if it was anything to worry about said sirius steadily 
 
 but not all said harry in a voice only a little above a whisper sirius i i think going mad back in office just before we took the portkey for a couple of seconds there i thought i was a snake i felt like onemy scar really hurt when i was looking at dumbledoresirius i wanted to attack him 
 
 he could only see a sliver of face the rest was in darkness 
 
 it must have been the aftermath of the vision all said sirius you were still thinking of the dream or whatever it was and 
 
 it that said harry shaking his head it was like something rose up inside me like a snake inside me 
 
 you need to sleep said sirius firmly going to have breakfast then go upstairs to bed and after lunch you can go and see arthur with the others in shock harry blaming yourself for something you only witnessed and lucky you did witness it or arthur might have died just stop worrying 
 
 he clapped harry on the shoulder and left the pantry leaving harry standing alone in the dark 
 
 everyone but harry spent the rest of the morning sleeping he went up to the bedroom he and ron had shared over the last few weeks of summer but while ron crawled into bed and was asleep within minutes harry sat fully clothed hunched against the cold metal bars of the bedstead keeping himself deliberately uncomfortable determined not to fall into a doze terrified that he might become the serpent again in his sleep and wake to find that he had attacked ron or else slithered through the house after one of the others 
 
 when ron woke up harry pretended to have enjoyed a refreshing nap too their trunks arrived from hogwarts while they were eating lunch so they could dress as muggles for the trip to st everybody except harry was riotously happy and talkative as they changed out of their robes into jeans and sweatshirts when tonks and turned up to escort them across london they greeted them gleefully laughing at the bowler hat was wearing at an angle to conceal his magical eye and assuring him truthfully that tonks whose hair was short and bright pink again would attract far less attention on the underground 
 
 tonks was very interested in vision of the attack on mr weasley something harry was not remotely interested in discussing 
 
 there any seer blood in your family is there she enquired curiously as they sat side by side on a train rattling towards the heart of the city 
 
 no said harry thinking of professor trelawney and feeling insulted 
 
 no said tonks musingly no i suppose not really prophecy doing is it i mean not seeing the future seeing the present odd it useful though 
 
 harry answer fortunately they got out at the next stop a station in the very heart of london and in the bustle of leaving the train he was able to allow fred and george to get between himself and tonks who was leading the way they all followed her up the escalator moody clunking along at the back of the group his bowler tilted low and one gnarled hand stuck in between the buttons of his coat clutching his wand harry thought he sensed the concealed eye staring hard at him trying to avoid any more questions about his dream he asked where st was hidden 
 
 not far from here grunted moody as they stepped out into the wintry air on a broad street packed with christmas shoppers he pushed harry a little ahead of him and stumped along just behind harry knew the eye was rolling in all directions under the tilted hat easy to find a good location for a hospital nowhere in diagon alley was big enough and we have it underground like the be healthy in the end they managed to get hold of a building up here theory was sick wizards could come and go and just blend in with the crowd 
 
 he seized shoulder to prevent them being separated by a gaggle of shoppers plainly intent on nothing but making it into a nearby shop full of electrical gadgets 
 
 here we go said moody a moment later 
 
 they had arrived outside a large department store called purge dowse ltd the place had a shabby miserable air the window displays consisted of a few chipped dummies with their wigs askew standing at random and modelling fashions at least ten years out of date large signs on all the dusty doors read closed for refurbishment harry distinctly heard a large woman laden with plastic shopping bags say to her friend as they passed never open that place 
 
 right said tonks beckoning them towards a window displaying nothing but a particularly ugly female dummy its false eyelashes were hanging off and it was modelling a green nylon pinafore dress everybody ready 
 
 they nodded clustering around her moody gave harry another shove between the shoulder blades to urge him forward and tonks leaned close to the glass looking up at the very ugly dummy her breath steaming up the glass wotcher she said here to see arthur weasley 
 
 harry thought how absurd it was for tonks to expect the dummy to hear her talking so quietly through a sheet of glass with buses rumbling along behind her and all the racket of a street full of shoppers then he reminded himself that dummies hear anyway next second his mouth opened in shock as the dummy gave a tiny nod and beckoned with its jointed finger and tonks had seized ginny and mrs weasley by the elbows stepped right through the glass and vanished 
 
 fred george and ron stepped after them harry glanced around at the jostling crowd not one of them seemed to have a glance to spare for window displays as ugly as those of purge dowse ltd nor did any of them seem to have noticed that six people had just melted into thin air in front of them 
 
 growled moody giving harry yet another poke in the back and together they stepped forward through what felt like a sheet of cool water emerging quite warm and dry on the other side 
 
 there was no sign of the ugly dummy or the space where she had stood they were in what seemed to be a crowded reception area where rows of witches and wizards sat upon rickety wooden chairs some looking perfectly normal and perusing copies of witch weekly others sporting gruesome disfigurements such as elephant trunks or extra hands sticking out of their chests the room was scarcely less quiet than the street outside for many of the patients were making very peculiar noises a witch in the centre of the front row who was fanning herself vigorously with a copy of the daily prophet kept letting off a whistle as steam came pouring out of her mouth a warlock in the corner clanged like a bell every time he moved and with each clang his head vibrated horribly so that he had to seize himself by the ears to hold it steady 
 
 witches and wizards in robes were walking up and down the rows asking questions and making notes on clipboards like harry noticed the emblem embroidered on their chests a wand and bone crossed 
 
 are they doctors he asked ron quietly 
 
 doctors said ron looking startled those muggle nutters that cut people up nah healers 
 
 over here called mrs weasley above the renewed clanging of the warlock in the corner and they followed her to the queue in front of a plump blonde witch seated at a desk marked wall behind her was covered in notices and posters saying things like a clean cauldron keeps potions from becoming poisons and antidotes are unless approved by a qualified healer there was also a large portrait of a witch with long silver ringlets which was labelled 
 
 dilys derwent 
 
 st healer 
 
 headmistress of hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry 
 
 
 
 dilys was eyeing the weasley party closely as though counting them when harry caught her eye she gave a tiny wink walked sideways out of her portrait and vanished 
 
 meanwhile at the front of the queue a young wizard was performing an odd jig and trying in between yelps of pain to explain his predicament to the witch behind the desk 
 
 these ouchshoes my brother gave meowthey re eating myouchfeetlook at them there must be some kind ofaarghjinx on them and i aaaaarghget them off he hopped from one foot to the other as though dancing on hot coals 
 
 the shoes prevent you reading do they said the blonde witch irritably pointing at a large sign to the left of her desk you want spell damage fourth floor just like it says on the floor guide next 
 
 as the wizard hobbled and pranced sideways out of the way the weasley party moved forward a few steps and harry read the floor guide

 if you are unsure where to go incapable of normal speech or unable to remember why you are here our welcomewitch will be pleased to help 
 
 a very old stooped wizard with a hearing trumpet had shuffled to the front of the queue now here to see broderick bode he wheezed 
 
 ward but afraid wasting your time said the witch dismissively completely addled you knowstill thinks a teapot next 
 
 a wizard was holding his small daughter tightly by the ankle while she flapped around his head using the immensely large feathery wings that had sprouted right out through the back of her romper suit 
 
 fourth floor said the witch in a bored voice without asking and the man disappeared through the double doors beside the desk holding his daughter like an oddly shaped balloon next 
 
 mrs weasley moved forward to the desk 
 
 hello she said my husband arthur weasley was supposed to be moved to a different ward this morning could you tell us 
 
 arthur weasley said the witch running her finger down a long list in front of her yes first floor second door on the right dai llewellyn ward 
 
 thank you said mrs weasley come on you lot 
 
 they followed her through the double doors and along the narrow corridor beyond which was lined with more portraits of famous healers and lit by crystal bubbles full of candles that floated up on the ceiling looking like giant soapsuds more witches and wizards in robes walked in and out of the doors they passed a yellow gas wafted into the passageway as they passed one door and every now and then they heard distant wailing they climbed a flight of stairs and entered the injuries corridor where the second door on the right bore the words dangerous dai llewellyn ward serious this was a card in a brass holder on which had been handwritten hippocrates smethwyck trainee healer augustus pye 
 
 wait outside molly tonks said arthur want too many visitors at once it ought to be just the family first 
 
 growled his approval of this idea and set himself with his back against the corridor wall his magical eye spinning in all directions harry drew back too but mrs weasley reached out a hand and pushed him through the door saying be silly harry arthur wants to thank you 
 
 the ward was small and rather dingy as the only window was narrow and set high in the wall facing the door most of the light came from more shining crystal bubbles clustered in the middle of the ceiling the walls were of panelled oak and there was a portrait of a rather wizard on the wall captioned urquhart rackharrow inventor of the curse 
 
 there were only three patients mr weasley was occupying the bed at the far end oi the ward beside the tiny window harry was pleased and relieved to see that he was propped up on several pillows and reading the daily prophet by the solitary ray of sunlight falling on to his bed he looked up as they walked towards him and seeing who it was beamed 
 
 hello he called throwing the prophet aside bill just left molly had to get back to work but he says drop in on you later 
 
 how are you arthur asked mrs weasley bending down to kiss his cheek and looking anxiously into his face still looking a bit peaky 
 
 i feel absolutely fine said mr weasley brightly holding out his good arm to give ginny a hug if they could only take the bandages off be fit to go home 
 
 why they take them off dad asked fred 
 
 well i start bleeding like mad every time they try said mr weasley cheerfully reaching across for his wand which lay on his bedside cabinet and waving it so that six extra chairs appeared at his bedside to seat them all it seems there was some rather unusual kind of poison in that fangs that keeps wounds open sure find an antidote though they say had much worse cases than mine and in the meantime i just have to keep taking a potion every hour but that fellow over there he said dropping his voice and nodding towards the bed opposite in which a man lay looking green and sickly and staring at the ceiling bitten by a werewolf poor chap no cure at all 
 
 a werewolf whispered mrs weasley looking alarmed is he safe in a public ward he be in a private room 
 
 two weeks till full moon mr weasley reminded her quietly been talking to him this morning the healers you know trying to persuade him be able to lead an almost normal life i said to mention names of course but i said i knew a werewolf personally very nice man who finds the condition quite easy to manage 
 
 what did he say asked george 
 
 said give me another bite if i shut up said mr weasley sadly and that woman over there he indicated the only other occupied bed which was right beside the door tell the healers what bit her which makes us all think it must have been something she was handling illegally whatever it was took a real chunk out of her leg very nasty smell when they take off the dressings 
 
 so you going to tell us what happened dad asked fred pulling his chair closer to the bed 
 
 well you already know you said mr weasley with a significant smile at harry very had a very long day dozed off got sneaked up on and bitten 
 
 is it in the prophet you being attacked asked fred indicating the newspaper mr weasley had cast aside 
 
 no of course not said mr weasley with a slightly bitter smile the ministry want everyone to know a dirty great serpent got 
 
 arthur mrs weasley warned him 
 
 goter me mr weasley said hastily though harry was quite sure that was not what he had meant to say 
 
 so where were you when it happened dad asked george 
 
 my business said mr weasley though with a small smile he snatched up the daily prophet shook it open again and said i was just reading about willy arrest when you arrived you know willy turned out to be behind those regurgitating toilets back in the summer one of his jinxes backfired the toilet exploded and they found him lying unconscious in the wreckage covered from head to foot in 
 
 when you say you were on duty fred interrupted in a low voice what were you doing 
 
 you heard your father whispered mrs weasley we are not discussing this here go on about willy widdershins arthur 
 
 well ask me how but he actually got off the toilet charge said mr weasley grimly i can only suppose gold changed hands 
 
 you were guarding it you said george quietly the weapon the thing after 
 
 george be quiet snapped mrs weasley 
 
 anyway said mr weasley in a raised voice this time been caught selling biting doorknobs to muggles and i think be able to worm his way out of it because according to this article two muggles have lost fingers and are now in st for emergency bone and memory modification just think of it muggles in st i wonder which ward in 
 
 and he looked eagerly around as though hoping to see a signpost 
 
 you say got a snake harry asked fred looking at his father for a reaction a massive one you saw it the night he returned you 
 
 enough said mrs weasley crossly and tonks are outside arthur they want to come and see you and you lot can wait outside she added to her children and harry you can come and say goodbye afterwards go on 
 
 they trooped back into the corridor and tonks went in and closed the door of the ward behind them fred raised his eyebrows 
 
 fine he said coolly rummaging in his pockets be like that tell us anything 
 
 looking for these said george holding out what looked like a tangle of string 
 
 you read my mind said fred grinning see if st puts imperturbable charms on its ward doors shall we 
 
 he and george disentangled the string and separated five extendable ears from each other fred and george handed them around harry hesitated to take one 
 
 go on harry take it you saved life if got the right to eavesdrop on him you 
 
 grinning in spite of himself harry took the end of the string and inserted it into his ear as the twins had done 
 
 ok go fred whispered 
 
 the strings wriggled like long skinny worms and snaked under the door at first harry could hear nothing then he jumped as he heard tonks whispering as clearly as though she were standing right beside him 
 
 they searched the whole area but find the snake anywhere it just seems to have vanished after it attacked you arthur but have expected a snake to get in can he 
 
 i reckon he sent it as a lookout growled moody cause not had any luck so far has he no i reckon trying to get a clearer picture of what facing and if arthur been there the beast had a lot more time to look around so potter says he saw it all happen 
 
 yes said mrs weasley she sounded rather uneasy you know dumbledore seems almost to have been waiting for harry to see something like this 
 
 yeah well said moody something funny about the potter kid we all know that 
 
 dumbledore seemed worried about harry when i spoke to him this morning whispered mrs weasley 
 
 course worried growled moody the seeing things from inside snake obviously potter realise what that means but if possessing him 
 
 harry pulled the extendable ear out of his own his heart hammering very fast and heat rushing up his face he looked around at the others they were all staring at him the strings still trailing from their ears looking suddenly fearful 
 
 rowling
