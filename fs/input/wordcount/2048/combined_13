 a story 
 by hans christian andersen 
 
 in the garden all the were in blossom they had 
 hastened to bring forth flowers before they got green leaves and in 
 the yard all the ducklings walked up and down and the cat too it 
 basked in the sun and licked the sunshine from its own paws and 
 when one looked at the fields how beautifully the corn stood and 
 how green it shone without comparison and there was a twittering and a fluttering of all the little birds as if the day were a great 
 festival and so it was for it was sunday all the bells were 
 ringing and all the people went to church looking cheerful and 
 dressed in their best clothes there was a look of cheerfulness on 
 everything the day was so warm and beautiful that one might well have said kindness to us men is beyond all limits but inside 
 the church the pastor stood in the pulpit and spoke very loudly and 
 angrily he said that all men were wicked and god would punish them for their sins and that the wicked when they died would be cast into hell to burn for ever and ever he spoke very excitedly 
 saying that their evil propensities would not be destroyed nor 
 would the fire be extinguished and they should never find rest 
 
 that was terrible to hear and he said it in such a tone of 
 conviction he described hell to them as a miserable hole where all 
 the refuse of the world gathers there was no air beside the hot 
 burning sulphur flame and there was no ground under their feet they 
 the wicked ones sank deeper and deeper while eternal silence 
 surrounded them it was dreadful to hear all that for the preacher 
 spoke from his heart and all the people in the church were terrified 
 meanwhile the birds sang merrily outside and the sun was shining 
 so beautifully warm it seemed as though every little flower said 
 god thy kindness towards us all is without limits indeed 
 outside it was not at all like the sermon 
 
 the same evening upon going to bed the pastor noticed his wife 
 sitting there quiet and pensive 
 
 what is the matter with you he asked her 
 well the matter with me is she said that i cannot collect my 
 thoughts and am unable to grasp the meaning of what you said in church that there are so many wicked people and that they 
 should burn eternally alas eternally how long i am only a woman 
 and a sinner before god but i should not have the heart to let even 
 the worst sinner burn for ever and how could our lord to do so who is so infinitely good and who knows how the wickedness comes from without and within no i am unable to imagine that although you say so 
 it was autumn the trees dropped their leaves the earnest and 
 severe pastor sat at the bedside of a dying person a pious 
 faithful soul closed her eyes for ever she was the wife 
 if any one shall find rest in the grave and mercy before our 
 lord you shall certainly do so said the pastor he folded her 
 hands and read a psalm over the dead woman 
 
 she was buried two large tears rolled over the cheeks of the 
 earnest man and in the parsonage it was empty and still for its 
 sun had set for ever she had gone home 
 
 it was night a cold wind swept over the head he 
 opened his eyes and it seemed to him as if the moon was shining 
 into his room it was not so however there was a being standing 
 before his bed and looking like the ghost of his deceased wife she 
 fixed her eyes upon him with such a kind and sad expression just as 
 if she wished to say something to him the pastor raised himself in 
 bed and stretched his arms towards her saying not even you can find eternal rest you suffer you best and most pious woman 
 
 the dead woman nodded her head as if to say yes and put her 
 hand on her breast 
 
 and can i not obtain rest in the grave for you 
 yes was the answer 
 and how 
 give me one hair only one single hair from the head of the 
 sinner for whom the fire shall never be extinguished of the sinner 
 whom god will condemn to eternal punishment in hell 
 yes one ought to be able to redeem you so easily you pure 
 pious woman he said 
 
 follow me said the dead woman it is thus granted to us by my 
 side you will be able to fly wherever your thoughts wish to go 
 invisible to men we shall penetrate into their most secret 
 chambers but with sure hand you must find out him who is destined 
 to eternal torture and before the cock crows he must be found as 
 quickly as if carried by the winged thoughts they were in the great 
 city and from the walls the names of the deadly sins shone in flaming 
 letters pride avarice drunkenness wantonness in short the 
 whole bow of sin 
 
 yes therein as i believed as i knew it said the pastor are 
 living those who are abandoned to the eternal fire and they were 
 standing before the magnificently illuminated gate the broad steps 
 were adorned with carpets and flowers and dance music was sounding through the festive halls a footman dressed in silk and velvet stood with a large rod near the entrance 
 
 our ball can compare favourably with the he said and 
 turned with contempt towards the gazing crowd in the street what he 
 thought was sufficiently expressed in his features and movements 
 miserable beggars who are looking in you are nothing in 
 comparison to me 
 
 pride said the dead woman do you see him 
 the footman asked the pastor he is but a poor fool and not 
 doomed to be tortured eternally by fire 
 only a fool it sounded through the whole house of pride they 
 were all fools there 
 
 then they flew within the four naked walls of the miser lean as a 
 skeleton trembling with cold and hunger the old man was clinging 
 with all his thoughts to his money they saw him jump up feverishly 
 from his miserable couch and take a loose stone out of the wall there 
 lay gold coins in an old stocking they saw him anxiously feeling over an old ragged coat in which pieces of gold were sewn and his clammy fingers trembled 
 
 he is ill that is madness a joyless madness besieged by fear 
 and dreadful dreams 
 
 they quickly went away and came before the beds of the 
 criminals these unfortunate people slept side by side in long 
 rows like a ferocious animal one of them rose out of his sleep and 
 uttered a horrible cry and gave his comrade a violent dig in the ribs 
 with his pointed elbow and this one turned round in his sleep 
 be quiet monster sleep this happens every night 
 
 every night repeated the other yes every night he comes 
 and tortures me in my violence i have done this and that i was 
 born with an evil mind which has brought me hither for the second 
 time but if i have done wrong i suffer punishment for it one 
 thing however i have not yet confessed when i came out a little 
 while ago and passed by the yard of my former master evil thoughts 
 rose within me when i remembered this and that i struck a match a 
 little bit on the wall probably it came a little too close to the 
 thatched roof all burnt down a great heat rose such as sometimes 
 overcomes me i myself helped to rescue cattle and things nothing 
 alive burnt except a flight of pigeons which flew into the fire and 
 the yard dog of which i had not thought one could hear him howl 
 out of the fire and this howling i still hear when i wish to sleep 
 and when i have fallen asleep the great rough dog comes and places 
 himself upon me and howls presses and tortures me now listen to 
 what i tell you you can snore you are snoring the whole night and i 
 hardly a quarter of an hour and the blood rose to the head of the 
 excited criminal he threw himself upon his comrade and beat him with his clenced fist in the face 
 
 wicked matz has become mad again they said amongst 
 themselves the other criminals seized him wrestled with him and 
 bent him double so that his head rested between his knees and they 
 tied him so that the blood almost came out of his eyes and out of all 
 his pores 
 
 you are killing the unfortunate man said the pastor and as 
 he stretched out his hand to protect him who already suffered too 
 much the scene changed they flew through rich halls and wretched 
 hovels wantonness and envy all the deadly sins passed before 
 them an angel of justice read their crimes and their defence the 
 latter was not a brilliant one but it was read before god who 
 reads the heart who knows everything the wickedness that comes 
 from within and from without who is mercy and love personified 
 the hand trembled he dared not stretch it out he did not 
 venture to pull a hair out of the head and tears gushed from 
 his eyes like a stream of mercy and love the cooling waters of 
 which extinguished the eternal fire of hell 
 
 just then the cock crowed 
 
 father of all mercy grant thou to her the peace that i was 
 unable to procure for her 
 
 i have it now said the dead woman it was your hard words 
 your despair of mankind your gloomy belief in god and his creation 
 which drove me to you learn to know mankind even in the wicked one lives a part of god and this extinguishes and conquers the flame of hell 
 the pastor felt a kiss on his lips a gleam of light surrounded 
 him bright sun shone into the room and his wife alive 
 sweet and full of love awoke him from a dream which god had sent him

 who guarded his house for him 
 the house in which he lived consisted as we have said of a ground floor and one story above three rooms on the ground floor three chambers on the first and an attic above 
 behind the house was a garden a quarter of an acre in extent 
 the two women occupied the first floor the bishop was lodged below 
 the first room opening on the street served him as the second was his bedroom and the third his oratory 
 there was no exit possible from this oratory except by passing through the bedroom nor from the bedroom without passing through the at the end of the suite in the oratory there was a detached alcove with a bed for use in cases of hospitality 
 the bishop offered this bed to country curates whom business or the requirements of their parishes brought to d 
 the pharmacy of the hospital a small building which had been added to the house and abutted on the garden had been transformed into a kitchen and cellar 
 in addition to this there was in the garden a stable which had formerly been the kitchen of the hospital and in which the bishop kept two cows 
 no matter what the quantity of milk they gave he invariably sent half of it every morning to the sick people in the hospital 
 i am paying my tithes he said 
 his bedroom was tolerably large and rather difficult to warm in bad weather 
 as wood is extremely dear at d he hit upon the idea of having a compartment of boards constructed in the here he passed his evenings during seasons of severe cold he called it his winter salon 
 in this winter salon as in the there was no other furniture than a square table in white wood and four chairs in addition to this the was ornamented with an antique sideboard painted pink in water colors 
 out of a similar sideboard properly draped with white napery and imitation lace the bishop had constructed the altar which decorated his oratory 
 his wealthy penitents and the sainted women of d had more than once assessed themselves to raise the money for a new altar for oratory on each occasion he had taken the money and had given it to the poor 
 the most beautiful of altars he said is the soul of an unhappy creature consoled and thanking god 
 in his oratory there were two straw and there was an also in straw in his bedroom 
 when by chance he received seven or eight persons at one time the prefect 
 or the general or the staff of the regiment in garrison or several pupils from the little seminary the chairs had to be fetched from the winter salon in the stable the from the oratory and the from the bedroom 
 in this way as many as eleven chairs could be collected for the visitors 
 a room was dismantled for each new guest 
 it sometimes happened that there were twelve in the party the bishop then relieved the embarrassment of the situation by standing in front of the chimney if it was winter or by strolling in the garden if it was summer 
 there was still another chair in the detached alcove but the straw was half gone from it and it had but three legs so that it was of service only when propped against the wall 
 mademoiselle baptistine had also in her own room a very large of wood which had formerly been gilded and which was covered with flowered pekin but they had been obliged to hoist this bergere up to the first story through the window as the staircase was too narrow it could not therefore be reckoned among the possibilities in the way of furniture 
 mademoiselle ambition had been to be able to purchase a set of furniture in yellow utrecht velvet stamped with a rose pattern and with mahogany in neck style with a sofa 
 but this would have cost five hundred francs at least and in view of the fact that she had only been able to lay by francs and ten sous for this purpose in the course of five years she had ended by renouncing the idea 
 however who is there who has attained his ideal 
 nothing is more easy to present to the imagination than the bedchamber 
 a glazed door opened on the garden opposite this was the hospital bed of iron with a canopy of green serge in the shadow of the bed behind a curtain were the utensils of the toilet which still betrayed the elegant habits of the man of the world there were two doors one near the chimney opening into the oratory the other near the bookcase opening into the the bookcase was a large cupboard with glass doors filled with books the chimney was of wood painted to represent marble and habitually without fire in the chimney stood a pair of firedogs of iron ornamented above with two garlanded vases and flutings which had formerly been silvered with silver leaf which was a sort of episcopal luxury above the hung a crucifix of copper with the silver worn off fixed on a background of threadbare velvet in a wooden frame from which the gilding had fallen near the glass door a large table with an inkstand loaded with a confusion of papers and with huge volumes before the table an of straw in front of the bed a borrowed from the oratory 
 two portraits in oval frames were fastened to the wall on each side of the bed 
 small gilt inscriptions on the plain surface of the cloth at the side of these figures indicated that the portraits represented one the abbe of chaliot bishop of saint claude the other the abbe tourteau of agde abbe of order of citeaux diocese of chartres 
 when the bishop succeeded to this apartment after the hospital patients he had found these portraits there and had left them 
 they were priests and probably reasons for respecting them 
 all that he knew about these two persons was that they had been appointed by the king the one to his bishopric the other to his benefice on the same day the th of april 
 madame magloire having taken the pictures down to dust the bishop had discovered these particulars written in whitish ink on a little square of paper yellowed by time and attached to the back of the portrait of the abbe of with four wafers 
 at his window he had an antique curtain of a coarse woollen stuff which finally became so old that in order to avoid the expense of a new one madame magloire was forced to take a large seam in the very middle of it 
 this seam took the form of a cross the bishop often called attention to it 
 how delightful that is he said 
 all the rooms in the house without exception those on the ground floor as well as those on the first floor were which is a fashion in barracks and hospitals 
 however in their latter years madame magloire discovered beneath the paper which had been washed over paintings ornamenting the apartment of mademoiselle baptistine as we shall see further on before becoming a hospital this house had been the ancient parliament house of the bourgeois 
 hence this decoration the chambers were paved in red bricks which were washed every week with straw mats in front of all the beds 
 altogether this dwelling which was attended to by the two women was exquisitely clean from top to bottom 
 this was the sole luxury which the bishop permitted he said that takes nothing from the poor 
 it must be confessed however that he still retained from his former possessions six silver knives and forks and a which madame magloire contemplated every day with delight as they glistened splendidly upon the coarse linen cloth and since we are now painting the bishop of d as he was in reality we must add that he had said more than once i find it difficult to renounce eating from silver dishes 
 to this silverware must be added two large candlesticks of massive silver which he had inherited from a these candlesticks held two wax candles and usually figured on the when he had any one to dinner madame magloire lighted the two candles and set the candlesticks on the table 
 in the own chamber at the head of his bed there was a small cupboard in which madame magloire locked up the six silver knives and forks and the big spoon every night but it is necessary to add that the key was never removed 
 the garden which had been rather spoiled by the ugly buildings which we have mentioned was composed of four alleys in radiating from a tank 
 another walk made the circuit of the garden and skirted the white wall which enclosed it 
 these alleys left behind them four square plots rimmed with box 
 in three of these madame magloire cultivated vegetables in the fourth the bishop had planted some flowers here and there stood a few madame magloire had once remarked with a sort of gentle malice monseigneur you who turn everything to account have nevertheless one useless plot 
 it would be better to grow salads there than bouquets madame magloire retorted the bishop you are mistaken the beautiful is as useful as the useful 
 he added after a pause more so perhaps 
 this plot consisting of three or four beds occupied the bishop almost as much as did his books 
 he liked to pass an hour or two there trimming hoeing and making holes here and there in the earth into which he dropped seeds 
 he was not as hostile to insects as a gardener could have wished to see him 
 moreover he made no pretensions to botany he ignored groups and consistency he made not the slightest effort to decide between tournefort and the natural method he took part neither with the buds against the cotyledons nor with jussieu against linnaeus 
 he did not study plants he loved flowers he respected learned men greatly he respected the ignorant still more and without ever failing in these two respects he watered his every summer evening with a tin painted green 
 the house had not a single door which could be locked 
 the door of the which as we have said opened directly on the cathedral square had formerly been ornamented with locks and bolts like the door of a prison 
 the bishop had had all this ironwork removed and this door was never fastened either by night or by day with anything except the latch 
 all that the first passerby had to do at any hour was to give it a push 
 at first the two women had been very much tried by this door which was never fastened but monsieur de d had said to them have bolts put on your rooms if that will please you 
 they had ended by sharing his confidence or by at least acting as though they shared it 
 madame magloire alone had frights from time to time 
 as for the bishop his thought can be found explained or at least indicated in the three lines which he wrote on the margin of a bible this is the shade of difference 
 the door of the physician should never be shut the door of the priest should always be open 
 on another book entitled philosophy of the medical science he had written this other note 
 am not i a physician like them i also have my patients and then too i have some whom i call my unfortunates 
 again he wrote 
 do not inquire the name of him who asks a shelter of you 
 the very man who is embarrassed by his name is the one who needs shelter 
 it chanced that a worthy cure i know not whether it was the cure of couloubroux or the cure of pompierry took it into his head to ask him one day probably at the instigation of madame magloire whether monsieur was sure that he was not committing an indiscretion to a certain extent in leaving his door unfastened day and night at the mercy of any one who should choose to enter and whether in short he did not fear lest some misfortune might occur in a house so little guarded 
 the bishop touched his shoulder with gentle gravity and said to him nisi dominus custodierit domum in vanum vigilant qui custodiunt eam unless the lord guard the house in vain do they watch who guard it 
 then he spoke of something else 
 he was fond of saying there is a bravery of the priest as well as the bravery of a colonel of he added ours must be tranquil

 at his window he had an antique curtain of a coarse woollen stuff which finally became so old that in order to avoid the expense of a new one madame magloire was forced to take a large seam in the very middle of it 
 this seam took the form of a cross the bishop often called attention to it 
 how delightful that is he said 
 all the rooms in the house without exception those on the ground floor as well as those on the first floor were which is a fashion in barracks and hospitals 
 however in their latter years madame magloire discovered beneath the paper which had been washed over paintings ornamenting the apartment of mademoiselle baptistine as we shall see further on before becoming a hospital this house had been the ancient parliament house of the bourgeois 
 hence this decoration the chambers were paved in red bricks which were washed every week with straw mats in front of all the beds 
 altogether this dwelling which was attended to by the two women was exquisitely clean from top to bottom 
 this was the sole luxury which the bishop permitted he said that takes nothing from the poor 
 it must be confessed however that he still retained from his former possessions six silver knives and forks and a which madame magloire contemplated every day with delight as they glistened splendidly upon the coarse linen cloth and since we are now painting the bishop of d as he was in reality we must add that he had said more than once i find it difficult to renounce eating from silver dishes 
 to this silverware must be added two large candlesticks of massive silver which he had inherited from a these candlesticks held two wax candles and usually figured on the when he had any one to dinner madame magloire lighted the two candles and set the candlesticks on the table 
 in the own chamber at the head of his bed there was a small cupboard in which madame magloire locked up the six silver knives and forks and the big spoon every night but it is necessary to add that the key was never removed 
 the garden which had been rather spoiled by the ugly buildings which we have mentioned was composed of four alleys in radiating from a tank 
 another walk made the circuit of the garden and skirted the white wall which enclosed it 
 these alleys left behind them four square plots rimmed with box 
 in three of these madame magloire cultivated vegetables in the fourth the bishop had planted some flowers here and there stood a few madame magloire had once remarked with a sort of gentle malice monseigneur you who turn everything to account have nevertheless one useless plot 
 it would be better to grow salads there than bouquets madame magloire retorted the bishop you are mistaken the beautiful is as useful as the useful 
 he added after a pause more so perhaps 
 this plot consisting of three or four beds occupied the bishop almost as much as did his books 
 he liked to pass an hour or two there trimming hoeing and making holes here and there in the earth into which he dropped seeds 
 he was not as hostile to insects as a gardener could have wished to see him 
 moreover he made no pretensions to botany he ignored groups and consistency he made not the slightest effort to decide between tournefort and the natural method he took part neither with the buds against the cotyledons nor with jussieu against linnaeus 
 he did not study plants he loved flowers he respected learned men greatly he respected the ignorant still more and without ever failing in these two respects he watered his every summer evening with a tin painted green 
 the house had not a single door which could be locked 
 the door of the which as we have said opened directly on the cathedral square had formerly been ornamented with locks and bolts like the door of a prison 
 the bishop had had all this ironwork removed and this door was never fastened either by night or by day with anything except the latch 
 all that the first passerby had to do at any hour was to give it a push 
 at first the two women had been very much tried by this door which was never fastened but monsieur de d had said to them have bolts put on your rooms if that will please you 
 they had ended by sharing his confidence or by at least acting as though they shared it 
 madame magloire alone had frights from time to time 
 as for the bishop his thought can be found explained or at least indicated in the three lines which he wrote on the margin of a bible this is the shade of difference 
 the door of the physician should never be shut the door of the priest should always be open 
 on another book entitled philosophy of the medical science he had written this other note 
 am not i a physician like them i also have my patients and then too i have some whom i call my unfortunates 
 again he wrote 
 do not inquire the name of him who asks a shelter of you 
 the very man who is embarrassed by his name is the one who needs shelter 
 it chanced that a worthy cure i know not whether it was the cure of couloubroux or the cure of pompierry took it into his head to ask him one day probably at the instigation of madame magloire whether monsieur was sure that he was not committing an indiscretion to a certain extent in leaving his door unfastened day and night at the mercy of any one who should choose to enter and whether in short he did not fear lest some misfortune might occur in a house so little guarded 
 the bishop touched his shoulder with gentle gravity and said to him nisi dominus custodierit domum in vanum vigilant qui custodiunt eam unless the lord guard the house in vain do they watch who guard it 
 then he spoke of something else 
 he was fond of saying there is a bravery of the priest as well as the bravery of a colonel of he added ours must be tranquil

 a new hope 
 vi 
 
 look over there luke kenobi ordered pointing to the southwest thelandspeeder continued to race over the gravelly desert floor beneath them should think 
 luke spared a glance at the indicated direction i see anything sir 
 angle over that way anyhow someone may be in trouble 
 luke turned the speeder before long the rising wisps of smoke that kenobihad somehow detected earlier became visible to him also 
 topping a slight rise the speeder dropped down a gentle slope into a canyon that was filled with twisted burned shapes some of them not dead in the center of this carnage and looking like a beached metal whalelay the shattered hulk of a jawa sandcrawler 
 luke brought the speeder to a halt kenobi followed him onto the sand andtogether they began to examine the detritus of destruction 
 several slight depressions in the sand caught attention walking a littlefaster he came up next to them and studied them for a moment before calling back tokenobi 
 looks like the sandpeople did it all right bantha tracks lukenoticed a gleam of metal in the sand and a piece of one ofthose big double axes of theirs he shook his head in confusion but i neverheard of the raiders hitting something this big he leaned back staring up at thetowering bulk of the sandcrawler 
 kenobi had passed him he was examining the broad huge footprints in thesand they he declared casually but they intended that anyoneelse who might happen onto think so luke moved up alongside him 
 i understand sir 
 look at these tracks carefully the older man directed him pointing down atthe nearest and then up at the others notice anything funny about them lukeshook his head whoever left here was riding banthas side by side sandpeoplealways ride one bantha behind another single file to hide their strength from anydistant observers 
 leaving luke to gape at the parallel sets of tracks kenobi turned his attention tothe sandcrawler he pointed out where single weapons bursts had blasted awayportals treads and support beams look at the precision with which this firepowerwas applied sandpeople this accurate in fact no one on tatooine fires anddestroys with this kind of efficiency turing he examined the horizon one ofthose nearby bluffs concealed a a threat only imperial troops wouldmount an attack on a sandcrawler with this kind of cold accuracy 
 luke had walked over to one of the small crumpled bodies and kicked it overonto its back his face screwed up in distaste as he saw what remained of the pitifulcreature 
 these are the same jawas who sold uncle owen and me artoo and recognize this cloak design why would imperial troops be slaughteringjawas and sandpeople they must have killed some raider to get those mind worked furiously and he found himself growing unnaturally tense as hestared back at the landspeeder past the rapidly deteriorating corpses of the jawas 
 butif they tracked the droids to the jawas then they had to learn first whothey sold them to they would lead them back to luke was sprinting insanelyfor the landspeeder 
 luke waitwait luke kenobi called too dangerous 
 luke heard nothing except the roaring in his ears felt nothing save the burningin his heart he jumped into the speeder and was throwing the accelerator full overalmost simultaneously in an explosion of sand and gravel he left kenobi and thetwo robots standing alone in the midst of smoldering bodies framed by the stillsmoking wreck of the sandcrawler 
 the smoke that luke saw as he drew near the homestead was of a differentconsistency from that which had boiled out of the jawa machine he barelyremembered to shut down the engine as he popped the cockpit canopyand threw himself out dark smoke was drifting steadily from holes in the ground 
 those holes had been his home the only one he had ever known they mightas well have been throats of small volcanoes now again and again he tried topenetrate the surface entrances to the belowground complex again and again heat drove him back coughing and choking 
 weakly he found himself stumbling clear his eyes watering not entirely from thesmoke half blinded he staggered over to the exterior entrance to the garage ittoo was burning but perhaps they managed to escape in the other landspeeder 
 aunt beruuncle owen it was difficult to make out much of anythingthrough the haze two smoking shapes showed down the tunnel barelyvisible through tears and haze they almost looked like he squinted angrily at his uncooperative eyes 
 no 
 then he was spinning away falling to his stomach and burying his face in thesand so he have to look anymore 
 the tridimensional solid screen filled one wall of the vast chamber from floor toceiling it showed a million star systems a tiny portion of the galaxy but animpressive display nonetheless when exhibited in such a fashion 
 below far below the huge shape of darth vader stood flanked on one side bygovernor tarkin and on the other by admiral motti and general tagge their privateantagonisms forgotten in the awesomeness of this moment 
 the final checkout is complete motti informed them all systems areoperational he turned to the others what shall be the first course we set 
 vader appeared not to have heard as he mumbled softly half to himself she hasa surprising amount of control her resistance to the interrogator is glanced down at tarkin it will be some time before we can extract any usefulinformation from her 
 always found the methods you recommend rather quaint vader 
 they are efficient the dark lord argued softly in the interest ofaccelerating the procedure however i am open to your suggestions 
 tarkin looked thoughtful such stubbornness can often be detoured byapplying threats to something other than the one involved 
 what do you mean 
 only that i think is time we demonstrated the full power of this station wemay do so in a fashion doubly useful he instructed the attentive motti tell yourprogrammers to set course for the alderaan system 
 pride did not prevent him from wrapping an old scarf over nose andmouth to filter out a portion of the drifting putrid odor though possessedof olfactory sensory apparatus artoo detoo and threepio had no need of such ascreen even threepio who was equipped to discriminate among aromaticaesthetics could be artificially selective when he so desired 
 working together the two droids helped kenobi throw the last of the bodiesonto the blazing pyre then stood back and watched the dead continue to burn notthat the desert scavengers have been equally efficient in picking the sandcrawler clean of flesh but kenobi retained values most modern men wouldhave deemed archaic he would consign no one to the and not even a filthy jawa 
 at a rising thrumming kenobi turned from the residue of the noisome business tosee the landspeeder approaching now traveling at a sensible pace far different fromwhen it had left it slowed and hovered nearby but showed no signs of life 
 gesturing for the two robots to follow ben started toward the waiting canopy flipped open and up to reveal luke sitting motionless in the look up at inquiring glance that in itself was enough to tell theold man what had happened 
 i share your sorrow luke he finally ventured softly there was nothing youcould have done had you been there be dead now too and the droidswould be in the hands of the imperials not even the force 
 damn your force luke snarled with sudden violence now he turned andglared at kenobi there was a set to his jaw that belonged on a much older face 
 take you to the spaceport at mos eisley ben i want to go with nothing left for me here now his eyes turned to look outacross the desert to focus on something beyond sand and rock and canyon walls iwant to learn to be like a jedi like my father i want he paused the wordsbacking up like a logjam in his throat 
 kenobi slid into the cockpit put a hand gently on the shoulder then wentforward to make room for the two robots do my best to see that you get whatyou want luke for now go to mos eisley 
 luke nodded and closed the canopy the landspeeder moved away to thesoutheast leaving behind the sandcrawler the jawa funeral pyre andthe only life luke had ever known 
 leaving the speeder parked near the edge of the sandstone bluff luke and benwalked over and peered down at the tiny regularized bumps erupting from the plain below the haphazard collage of concrete stone and plastoidstructures spread outward from a central plant like thespokes of a wheel 
 actually the town was considerably larger than it appeared since a good portionof it lay underground looking like bomb craters from this distance the smoothcircular depressions of launch stations pockmarked the cityscape 
 a brisk gale was scouring the tired ground it whipped the sand about and legs as he adjusted his protective goggles 
 there it is kenobi murmured indicating the unimpressive collection ofbuildings mos eisley ideal place for us to lose ourselves while weseek passage offplanet not a more wretched collection of villainy and disreputabletypes exists anywhere on tatooine the empire has been alerted to us so we mustbe very cautious luke the population of mos eisley should disguise us well 
 luke wore a determined look ready for anything 
 i wonder if you comprehend what that might entail luke kenobi thought buthe only nodded as he led the way back to the landspeeder 
 unlike anchorhead there were enough people in mos eisley to requiremovement in the heat of day built from the beginning with commerce in the oldest of the buildings had been designed to provide protection fromthe twin suns they looked primitive from the outside and many were butoftentimes walls and arches of old stone masked durasteel double walls withcirculating coolant flowing freely between 
 luke was maneuvering the landspeeder through the outskirts whenseveral tall gleaming forms appeared from nowhere and began to close a circlearound him for one panicked moment he considered gunning the engine and racingthrough the pedestrians and other vehicles a startlingly firm grip on his arm bothrestrained and relaxed him he glanced over to see kenobi smiling warning him 
 so they continued at a normal town cruising speed luke hoping that the imperialtroops were bent on business elsewhere no such luck one of the troopers raisedan armored hand luke had no choice but to respond as he pulled the speederover he grew aware of the attention they were receiving from curious yet it seemed that the attention was in fact reserved not for kenobi orhimself but for the two unmoving robots seated in the speeder behind them 
 how long have you had these droids the trooper who had raised his handbarked polite formalities were to be dispensed with it appeared 
 looking blank for a second luke finally came up with three or four seasons iguess 
 up for sale if you want the price is right kenobi put a wonderful impression of a dessert finagler out to cajole a few quick creditsfrom ignorant imperials 
 the trooper in charge did not deign to reply he was absorbed in a thoroughexamination of the underside 
 did you come in from the south he asked 
 nono luke answered quickly we live in the west near bestine township 
 bestine the trooper murmured walking around to study the forced himself to stare straight ahead finally the armored figure concludedhis examination he moved to stand ominously close to luke and snapped let mesee your identification 
 surely the man sensed his terror and nervousness by now luke thought resolution of not long before to be ready to take on anything had alreadydisintegrated under the unwinking stare of this professional soldier he knew whatwould happen if they got a look at his formal id with the location of his homesteadand the name of his nearest relatives on it something seemed to be buzzing insidehis head he felt faint 
 kenobi had leaned over and was talking easily to the trooper you needto see his identification the old man informed the imperial in an extremely peculiarvoice 
 staring blankly back at him the officer replied as if it were i to see your identification his reaction was the opposite of hisvoice was normal but his expression peculiar 
 these the droids looking for kenobi told him pleasantly 
 these the droids looking for 
 he can go about his business 
 you can go about your business the officer informed luke 
 the expression of relief that spread across face ought to have been asrevealing as his previous nervousness but the imperial ignored it 
 move along kenobi whispered 
 move along the officer instructed luke 
 unable to decide whether he should salute nod or give thanks to the man lukesettled for nudging the accelerator the landspeeder moved forward drawing awayfrom the circle of troops as they prepared to round a corner luke risked a glancebackward the officer who had inspected them appeared to be arguing with severalcomrades though at this distance luke be sure

 mind was too full of their narrow escape for him to comment sentiments i still understand how we got by these troops ithought we were as good as dead 
 the force is in the mind luke and can sometime be used to influence a powerful ally but as you come to know the force you will discover that it canalso be a danger

 kenobi was exiting from the speeder most of the good independent freighterpilots frequent this place though many can afford better they can talk freely should have learned by now luke not to equate ability with appearance lukesaw the old shabby clothing anew and felt ashamed watch yourself place can be rough

 moving inward luke was astonished at the variety of beings making use of thebar there were creatures and creature with with fur and some with skin that seemed to ripple and change consistencyaccording to their feelings of the moment 
 hovering near the bar itself was a towering insectoid that luke glimpsed only asa threatening shadow it contrasted with two of the tallest women luke had everseen they were among the most normal looking of the outrageous assemblage ofhumans that mixed freely among alien counterparts tentacles claws and handswere wrapped around drinking utensils of various sizes and shapes conversationwas a steady babble of human and alien tongues 
 leaning close kenobi gestured toward the far end of the bar a small knot humans lounged there drinking laughing and trading stories ofdubious origin 
 most likely 
 i thought we were looking for an independent freighter captain with his ownship for hire luke whispered back 
 so we are young luke so we are agreed kenobi and bound to beone or two adequate for our needs among that group just that in corellianterminology the distinction between who owns what cargo tends to get a littlemuddled from time to time wait here 
 luke nodded and watched as kenobi worked his way through the crowd thecorrellians suspicion at his approach vanished as soon as he engaged them inconversation 
 something grabbed shoulder and spun him around 
 hey looking around and struggling to regain his composure he foundhimself staring up at an enormous human luke saw by the that he must be the bartender if not the owner of this cantina 
 we serve their kind in here the glaring form growled 
 what luke replied dumbly he still recovered from his suddensubmergence into the cultures of several dozen races it was rather different fromthe poolroom behind the anchorhead power station your droids the bartenderexplained impatiently gesturing with a thick thumb luke peered in the indicateddirection to see artoo and threepio standing quietly nearby have to waitoutside we serve them in here i only carry stuff for organics not heconcluded with an expression of distaste mechanicals 
 luke like the idea of kicking threepio and artoo out but he knowhow else to deal with the problem the bartender appear to be the sort whowould readily respond to reason and when he looked around for old ben luke sawthat he was locked in deep conversation with one of the corellians 
 meanwhile the discussion had attracted the attention of several types who happened to be clustered within hearing range alwere regarding luke and the two droids in a decidedly unfriendly fashion 
 yes of course luke said realizing this the time or place to force theissue of droid rights sorry he looked over at threepio betterstay outside with the speeder we want any trouble in here 
 i heartily agree with you sir threepio said his gaze traveling past luke andthe bartender to take in the unfriendly stares at the bar i feel the need forlubrication at the moment anyway with artoo waddling in his wake the tall robothastily headed for the exit 
 that finished things as far as the bartender was concerned but luke now foundhimself the subject of some unwanted attention he abruptly became aware of hisisolation and felt as if at one time or another every eye in the place rested a momenton him that things human and otherwise were smirking and making comments abouthim behind his back 
 trying to maintain an air of quiet confidence he returned his gaze to old started when he saw what the oldster was talking to now the corellian wasgone in its place kenobi was chatting with a towering anthropoid that showed amouthful of teeth when it smiled 
 luke had heard about wookies but he had never expected to see one much lessmeet on despite an almost comical face the wookie was anythingbut gentle looking only the large glowing yellow eyes softened its otherwiseawesome appearance the massive torso was covered entirely with soft thick russetfur less appealing cover consisted of a pair of chromed bandoliers which heldlethal projectiles of a type unknown to luke other than these the wookies luke knew that anyone would laugh at the mode of dress he sawthat other denizens of the bar eddied and swirled around the huge form without evercoming too close all but old who was talking to the wookie in its ownlanguage quarreling and hooting softly like a native 
 in the course of the conversation the old man had occasion to gesture in once the huge anthropoid stared directly at luke and let out a horrifyinghowling laugh 
 disgruntled by the role he was evidently playing in the discussion luke turnedaway and pretended to ignore the whole conversation he might be acting unfairlytoward the creature but he doubted that laugh was meant in 
 for the life of him he understand what ben wanted with the monster orwhy he was spending his time in guttural conversation with it instead of with the corellians so he sat and sipped his drink in splendid silence his eyesroving over the crowd in hopes of meeting a responsive gaze that held no belligerence 
 suddenly something shoved him roughly from behind so hard he almost turned angrily but his fury spent itself in astonishment he found himselfconfronted by a large squarish monstrosity of multiple eyes and indeterminate origin 
 negola dewaghi wooldugger the apparition bubbled challengingly 
 luke had never seen its like before he knew neither its species nor its gabbling might have been an invitation to a fight a request to share a drink or amarriage proposal despite his ignorance however luke could tell by the way thecreature bobbed and wove unsteadily on its podal supports that it had imbibed toomuch of whatever it considered a pleasing intoxicant 
 not knowing what else to do luke tried turning back to his own drink whilestudiously ignoring the creature as he did so a cross between a capybaraand a small over to stand or squat next to the quivering short companionable arm around the snuffling mass 
 he like you the stubby human informed luke in a surprisingly deepvoice 
 sorry about that luke admitted wishing heartily he were somewhere else 
 i like you either the smiling little man went on with brotherly negativity 
 i said i was sorry about it 
 whether from the conversation it was having with the creature or theoverdose of booze the apartment house for wayward eyeballs was obviously growingagitated it leaned forward almost toppling into luke and spewed a stream ofunintelligible gibberish at him luke felt the eyes of a crowd on him as he grewincreasingly more nervous 
 sorry the human mimicked derisively clearly deep into his own cups areyou insulting us you just better watch yourself all wanted heindicated his drunken companions i have the death sentence on me in twelvedifferent systems 
 be careful then luke muttered 
 the little man was smiling broadly be dead 
 at this the rodent let out a loud grunt it was either a signal or a everything human or otherwise which had been leaning up at the barimmediately backed away leaving a clear space around luke and his antagonists 
 trying to salvage the situation luke essayed a wan smile that faded rapidlywhen he saw that the three were readying hand weapons not only he havecountered all three of them he had no idea what a couple of the devicesdid 
 this little one worth the trouble a calm voice said luke looked he heard kenobi come up alongside him come let me buy youall something 
 by way of reply the bulky monster chittered hideously and swung out a massivelimb it caught an unprepared luke across the temple and sent him spinning acrossthe room crashing through tables and shattering a large jug filled with a 
 the crowd edged back farther a few grunts and warning snorts coming fromsome of them as the drunken monstrosity pulled a pistol from itsservice pouch he started to wave it in direction 
 that spurred the bartender to life he came chargingclumsily around the end of the bar waving his hands frantically but still taking care tostay out of range 
 no blasters no blasters not in my place 
 the rodent thing chattered threateningly at him while the weapon spared him a warning grunt 
 in the split second when the gun and its attention was off him the hand had moved to the disk slung at his side the short human started to yellas a fiery light appeared in the dimness of the cantina 
 he never finished the yell it turned into a blink when the blink was man found himself lying prone against the bar moaning and whimpering as hestared at the stump of an arm 
 in between the start of his yell and the conclusion of the blink the been cleft cleanly in half down the middle its two halves falling in oppositedirections the giant multiocular creature still stood staring dazed at the old humanwho was poised motionless before it the shining lightsaber held over his head in apeculiar fashion the chrome pistol fired once blowing a hole in the the torso peeled away as neatly as had the body of the rodent its two cauterizedsection falling in opposite directions to lie motionless on the cool stone 
 only then did the suggestion of a sigh escape from kenobi only then did hisbody appear to relax bringing the lightsaber down he flipped it carefully upward ina reflex saluting motion which ended with the deactivated weapon restinginnocuously on his hip 
 that final movement broke the total quiet which had enshrouded the resumed as did the movement of bodies in chairs the scraping ofmugs and pitchers and other drinking devices on tabletops the bartender andseveral assistants appeared to drag the unsightly corpses out of the room while themutilated human vanished wordlessly into the crowd cradling the stump of his gunarm and counting himself fortunate 
 to all appearances the cantina had returned to its former state with one smallexception ben kenobi was given a respectful amount of space at the bar 
 luke barely heard the renewed conversation he was still shaken by the speedof the fight and by the old unimagined abilities as his mind cleared and hemoved to rejoin kenobi he could overhear bits and snatches of the talk around of it centered on admiration for the cleanness and finality of the fight 
 hurt luke kenobi observed solicitously 
 luke felt of the bruise where the big creature had stuck him i he started tosay but old ben cut him off as if nothing had happened he indicated the greathairy mass which was shouldering its way through the crowd toward them 
 this is chewbacca he explained when the anthropoid had joined them at thebar first mate on a ship that might suit our needs take us to now 
 this way the wookie least it sounded something like that to any case the huge gesture was unmistakable they startedto wend their way deeper into the bar the wookie parting the crowd like a gravelstorm cutting canyonettes 
 out in front of the cantina threepio paced nervously next to the unconcerned artoo detoo was engaged in animated electronicconversation with a bright red r unit be longing to another of the patrons 
 what could be taking them so long they went to hire one a fleet 
 abruptly threepio paused beckoning silently for artoo to be quiet twoimperial troopers had appeared on the scene they were met by an unkempt humanwho had emerged almost simultaneously from the depths of the cantina 
 i do not like the looks of this the tall droid murmured 
 luke had appropriated someone drink from a tray as they madetheir way to the rear of the cantina he gulped at it with the giddy air of one whofeels himself under diving protection that safe he was not but in the company ofkenobi and the giant wookie he began to feel confident that no one in the bar wouldassault him with so much as a dirty look 
 in a rear booth they encountered a young man perhaps five yearsolder than luke perhaps a was difficult to tell he displayed the opennessof the utterly the insanely reckless at their approach the man sent thehumanoid wench who had been wriggling on his lap on her way with a whisperedsomething which left a wide if inhuman grin on her face 
 the wookie chewbacca rumbled something at the man and he nodded inresponse glancing up at the newcomers pleasantly 
 pretty handy with that saber old man not often does one see that kindof swordplay in this part of the empire anymore he downed a prodigious portionof whatever filled his mug han solo captain of the millennium he became all business chewie tells me looking for passage tothe alderaan system 
 right son if on a fast ship kenobi told him solo bridleat the son 
 fast ship you mean never heard of the millennium falcon 
 kenobi appeared amused should i 
 the ship that made the kessel run in less than twelve standard told him indignantly outrun imperial starships and corellian cruisers ithink fast enough for you old man his outrage subsided rapidly cargo 
 only passengers myself the boy and two questions asked 
 no questions solo regarded his mug finally looked up is it local trouble 
 just say like to avoid any imperial entanglements kenobi repliedeasily 
 these days that can be a real trick cost you a little extra he did somemental figuring all in all about ten thousand in advance he added with asmile and no questions asked 
 luke gaped at the pilot ten thousand we could almost buy our own shipfor that 
 solo shrugged maybe you could and maybe you in any you fly it 
 you bet i could luke shot back rising not such a bad pilot myself 
 again the firm hand on his arm we that much with us kenobiexplained but we could pay you two thousand now plus another fifteen when wereach alderaan 
 solo leaned forward uncertainly fifteenyou can really get your hands onthat kind of money 
 i promise the government on alderaan itself at the worst earned an honest fee two thousand 
 but solo seemed not to hear the last seventeen thousandall right it got yourselves a ship as for avoiding imperial better twist out of here or even the millennium falcon be any help toyou he nodded toward the cantina entrance and added quickly docking first thing in the morning 
 four imperial troopers their eyes darting rapidly from table to booth to bar hadentered the cantina there was muttering from among the crowd but whenever theeyes of one of the heavily armed troopers went hunting for the mutterers the wordsdied with sullen speed 
 moving to the bar the officer in charge asked the bartender a couple of briefquestions the big man hesitated a moment then pointed toward a place near theback of the room as he did so his eyes widened slightly those of the officerwere unreadable 
 the booth he was pointing to was empty

 a new hope 
 vi 
 
 look over there luke kenobi ordered pointing to the southwest thelandspeeder continued to race over the gravelly desert floor beneath them should think 
 luke spared a glance at the indicated direction i see anything sir 
 angle over that way anyhow someone may be in trouble 
 luke turned the speeder before long the rising wisps of smoke that kenobihad somehow detected earlier became visible to him also 
 topping a slight rise the speeder dropped down a gentle slope into a canyon that was filled with twisted burned shapes some of them not dead in the center of this carnage and looking like a beached metal whalelay the shattered hulk of a jawa sandcrawler 
 luke brought the speeder to a halt kenobi followed him onto the sand andtogether they began to examine the detritus of destruction 
 several slight depressions in the sand caught attention walking a littlefaster he came up next to them and studied them for a moment before calling back tokenobi 
 looks like the sandpeople did it all right bantha tracks lukenoticed a gleam of metal in the sand and a piece of one ofthose big double axes of theirs he shook his head in confusion but i neverheard of the raiders hitting something this big he leaned back staring up at thetowering bulk of the sandcrawler 
 kenobi had passed him he was examining the broad huge footprints in thesand they he declared casually but they intended that anyoneelse who might happen onto think so luke moved up alongside him 
 i understand sir 
 look at these tracks carefully the older man directed him pointing down atthe nearest and then up at the others notice anything funny about them lukeshook his head whoever left here was riding banthas side by side sandpeoplealways ride one bantha behind another single file to hide their strength from anydistant observers 
 leaving luke to gape at the parallel sets of tracks kenobi turned his attention tothe sandcrawler he pointed out where single weapons bursts had blasted awayportals treads and support beams look at the precision with which this firepowerwas applied sandpeople this accurate in fact no one on tatooine fires anddestroys with this kind of efficiency turing he examined the horizon one ofthose nearby bluffs concealed a a threat only imperial troops wouldmount an attack on a sandcrawler with this kind of cold accuracy 
 luke had walked over to one of the small crumpled bodies and kicked it overonto its back his face screwed up in distaste as he saw what remained of the pitifulcreature 
 these are the same jawas who sold uncle owen and me artoo and recognize this cloak design why would imperial troops be slaughteringjawas and sandpeople they must have killed some raider to get those mind worked furiously and he found himself growing unnaturally tense as hestared back at the landspeeder past the rapidly deteriorating corpses of the jawas 
 butif they tracked the droids to the jawas then they had to learn first whothey sold them to they would lead them back to luke was sprinting insanelyfor the landspeeder 
 luke waitwait luke kenobi called too dangerous 
 luke heard nothing except the roaring in his ears felt nothing save the burningin his heart he jumped into the speeder and was throwing the accelerator full overalmost simultaneously in an explosion of sand and gravel he left kenobi and thetwo robots standing alone in the midst of smoldering bodies framed by the stillsmoking wreck of the sandcrawler 
 the smoke that luke saw as he drew near the homestead was of a differentconsistency from that which had boiled out of the jawa machine he barelyremembered to shut down the engine as he popped the cockpit canopyand threw himself out dark smoke was drifting steadily from holes in the ground 
 those holes had been his home the only one he had ever known they mightas well have been throats of small volcanoes now again and again he tried topenetrate the surface entrances to the belowground complex again and again heat drove him back coughing and choking 
 weakly he found himself stumbling clear his eyes watering not entirely from thesmoke half blinded he staggered over to the exterior entrance to the garage ittoo was burning but perhaps they managed to escape in the other landspeeder 
 aunt beruuncle owen it was difficult to make out much of anythingthrough the haze two smoking shapes showed down the tunnel barelyvisible through tears and haze they almost looked like he squinted angrily at his uncooperative eyes 
 no 
 then he was spinning away falling to his stomach and burying his face in thesand so he have to look anymore 
 the tridimensional solid screen filled one wall of the vast chamber from floor toceiling it showed a million star systems a tiny portion of the galaxy but animpressive display nonetheless when exhibited in such a fashion 
 below far below the huge shape of darth vader stood flanked on one side bygovernor tarkin and on the other by admiral motti and general tagge their privateantagonisms forgotten in the awesomeness of this moment 
 the final checkout is complete motti informed them all systems areoperational he turned to the others what shall be the first course we set 
 vader appeared not to have heard as he mumbled softly half to himself she hasa surprising amount of control her resistance to the interrogator is glanced down at tarkin it will be some time before we can extract any usefulinformation from her 
 always found the methods you recommend rather quaint vader 
 they are efficient the dark lord argued softly in the interest ofaccelerating the procedure however i am open to your suggestions 
 tarkin looked thoughtful such stubbornness can often be detoured byapplying threats to something other than the one involved 
 what do you mean 
 only that i think is time we demonstrated the full power of this station wemay do so in a fashion doubly useful he instructed the attentive motti tell yourprogrammers to set course for the alderaan system 
 pride did not prevent him from wrapping an old scarf over nose andmouth to filter out a portion of the drifting putrid odor though possessedof olfactory sensory apparatus artoo detoo and threepio had no need of such ascreen even threepio who was equipped to discriminate among aromaticaesthetics could be artificially selective when he so desired 
 working together the two droids helped kenobi throw the last of the bodiesonto the blazing pyre then stood back and watched the dead continue to burn notthat the desert scavengers have been equally efficient in picking the sandcrawler clean of flesh but kenobi retained values most modern men wouldhave deemed archaic he would consign no one to the and not even a filthy jawa 
 at a rising thrumming kenobi turned from the residue of the noisome business tosee the landspeeder approaching now traveling at a sensible pace far different fromwhen it had left it slowed and hovered nearby but showed no signs of life 
 gesturing for the two robots to follow ben started toward the waiting canopy flipped open and up to reveal luke sitting motionless in the look up at inquiring glance that in itself was enough to tell theold man what had happened 
 i share your sorrow luke he finally ventured softly there was nothing youcould have done had you been there be dead now too and the droidswould be in the hands of the imperials not even the force 
 damn your force luke snarled with sudden violence now he turned andglared at kenobi there was a set to his jaw that belonged on a much older face 
 take you to the spaceport at mos eisley ben i want to go with nothing left for me here now his eyes turned to look outacross the desert to focus on something beyond sand and rock and canyon walls iwant to learn to be like a jedi like my father i want he paused the wordsbacking up like a logjam in his throat 
 kenobi slid into the cockpit put a hand gently on the shoulder then wentforward to make room for the two robots do my best to see that you get whatyou want luke for now go to mos eisley 
 luke nodded and closed the canopy the landspeeder moved away to thesoutheast leaving behind the sandcrawler the jawa funeral pyre andthe only life luke had ever known 
 leaving the speeder parked near the edge of the sandstone bluff luke and benwalked over and peered down at the tiny regularized bumps erupting from the plain below the haphazard collage of concrete stone and plastoidstructures spread outward from a central plant like thespokes of a wheel 
 actually the town was considerably larger than it appeared since a good portionof it lay underground looking like bomb craters from this distance the smoothcircular depressions of launch stations pockmarked the cityscape 
 a brisk gale was scouring the tired ground it whipped the sand about and legs as he adjusted his protective goggles 
 there it is kenobi murmured indicating the unimpressive collection ofbuildings mos eisley ideal place for us to lose ourselves while weseek passage offplanet not a more wretched collection of villainy and disreputabletypes exists anywhere on tatooine the empire has been alerted to us so we mustbe very cautious luke the population of mos eisley should disguise us well 
 luke wore a determined look ready for anything 
 i wonder if you comprehend what that might entail luke kenobi thought buthe only nodded as he led the way back to the landspeeder 
 unlike anchorhead there were enough people in mos eisley to requiremovement in the heat of day built from the beginning with commerce in the oldest of the buildings had been designed to provide protection fromthe twin suns they looked primitive from the outside and many were butoftentimes walls and arches of old stone masked durasteel double walls withcirculating coolant flowing freely between 
 luke was maneuvering the landspeeder through the outskirts whenseveral tall gleaming forms appeared from nowhere and began to close a circlearound him for one panicked moment he considered gunning the engine and racingthrough the pedestrians and other vehicles a startlingly firm grip on his arm bothrestrained and relaxed him he glanced over to see kenobi smiling warning him 
 so they continued at a normal town cruising speed luke hoping that the imperialtroops were bent on business elsewhere no such luck one of the troopers raisedan armored hand luke had no choice but to respond as he pulled the speederover he grew aware of the attention they were receiving from curious yet it seemed that the attention was in fact reserved not for kenobi orhimself but for the two unmoving robots seated in the speeder behind them 
 how long have you had these droids the trooper who had raised his handbarked polite formalities were to be dispensed with it appeared 
 looking blank for a second luke finally came up with three or four seasons iguess 
 up for sale if you want the price is right kenobi put a wonderful impression of a dessert finagler out to cajole a few quick creditsfrom ignorant imperials 
 the trooper in charge did not deign to reply he was absorbed in a thoroughexamination of the underside 
 did you come in from the south he asked 
 nono luke answered quickly we live in the west near bestine township 
 bestine the trooper murmured walking around to study the forced himself to stare straight ahead finally the armored figure concludedhis examination he moved to stand ominously close to luke and snapped let mesee your identification 
 surely the man sensed his terror and nervousness by now luke thought resolution of not long before to be ready to take on anything had alreadydisintegrated under the unwinking stare of this professional soldier he knew whatwould happen if they got a look at his formal id with the location of his homesteadand the name of his nearest relatives on it something seemed to be buzzing insidehis head he felt faint 
 kenobi had leaned over and was talking easily to the trooper you needto see his identification the old man informed the imperial in an extremely peculiarvoice 
 staring blankly back at him the officer replied as if it were i to see your identification his reaction was the opposite of hisvoice was normal but his expression peculiar 
 these the droids looking for kenobi told him pleasantly 
 these the droids looking for 
 he can go about his business 
 you can go about your business the officer informed luke 
 the expression of relief that spread across face ought to have been asrevealing as his previous nervousness but the imperial ignored it 
 move along kenobi whispered 
 move along the officer instructed luke 
 unable to decide whether he should salute nod or give thanks to the man lukesettled for nudging the accelerator the landspeeder moved forward drawing awayfrom the circle of troops as they prepared to round a corner luke risked a glancebackward the officer who had inspected them appeared to be arguing with severalcomrades though at this distance luke be sure 
 he peered up at his tall companion and started to say something kenobiseemed to have some idea where they were headed luke studied the and equally individuals they were passing theyhad entered the oldest section of mos eisley and consequently the one where the oldvices flourished most strongly 
 kenobi pointed and luke pulled the landspeeder up in front of what appeared tobe one of the original first blockhouses it had been converted into acantina whose clientele was suggested by the diverse nature of transport parkedoutside some of them luke recognized others he had only heard rumors of thecantina itself he knew from the design of the building must lie partially underground 
 as the dusty but still sleek craft pulled into an open spot a jawa materializedfrom nowhere and began running covetous hands over the metal sides luke leanedout and barked something harsh at the which caused it to scurry away 
 i abide those jawas murmured threepio with lofty creatures 
 mind was too full of their narrow escape for him to comment sentiments i still understand how we got by these troops ithought we were as good as dead 
 the force is in the mind luke and can sometime be used to influence a powerful ally but as you come to know the force you will discover that it canalso be a danger 
 nodding without really understanding luke indicated the thoughobviously popular cantina do you really think we can find a pilot here capable oftaking us all the way to alderaan 
 kenobi was exiting from the speeder most of the good independent freighterpilots frequent this place though many can afford better they can talk freely should have learned by now luke not to equate ability with appearance lukesaw the old shabby clothing anew and felt ashamed watch yourself place can be rough

 this little one worth the trouble a calm voice said luke looked he heard kenobi come up alongside him come let me buy youall something 
 by way of reply the bulky monster chittered hideously and swung out a massivelimb it caught an unprepared luke across the temple and sent him spinning acrossthe room crashing through tables and shattering a large jug filled with a 
 the crowd edged back farther a few grunts and warning snorts coming fromsome of them as the drunken monstrosity pulled a pistol from itsservice pouch he started to wave it in direction 
 that spurred the bartender to life he came chargingclumsily around the end of the bar waving his hands frantically but still taking care tostay out of range 
 no blasters no blasters not in my place 
 the rodent thing chattered threateningly at him while the weapon spared him a warning grunt 
 in the split second when the gun and its attention was off him the hand had moved to the disk slung at his side the short human started to yellas a fiery light appeared in the dimness of the cantina 
 he never finished the yell it turned into a blink when the blink was man found himself lying prone against the bar moaning and whimpering as hestared at the stump of an arm 
 in between the start of his yell and the conclusion of the blink the been cleft cleanly in half down the middle its two halves falling in oppositedirections the giant multiocular creature still stood staring dazed at the old humanwho was poised motionless before it the shining lightsaber held over his head in apeculiar fashion the chrome pistol fired once blowing a hole in the the torso peeled away as neatly as had the body of the rodent its two cauterizedsection falling in opposite directions to lie motionless on the cool stone 
 only then did the suggestion of a sigh escape from kenobi only then did hisbody appear to relax bringing the lightsaber down he flipped it carefully upward ina reflex saluting motion which ended with the deactivated weapon restinginnocuously on his hip 
 that final movement broke the total quiet which had enshrouded the resumed as did the movement of bodies in chairs the scraping ofmugs and pitchers and other drinking devices on tabletops the bartender andseveral assistants appeared to drag the unsightly corpses out of the room while themutilated human vanished wordlessly into the crowd cradling the stump of his gunarm and counting himself fortunate 
 to all appearances the cantina had returned to its former state with one smallexception ben kenobi was given a respectful amount of space at the bar 
 luke barely heard the renewed conversation he was still shaken by the speedof the fight and by the old unimagined abilities as his mind cleared and hemoved to rejoin kenobi he could overhear bits and snatches of the talk around of it centered on admiration for the cleanness and finality of the fight 
 hurt luke kenobi observed solicitously 
 luke felt of the bruise where the big creature had stuck him i he started tosay but old ben cut him off as if nothing had happened he indicated the greathairy mass which was shouldering its way through the crowd toward them 
 this is chewbacca he explained when the anthropoid had joined them at thebar first mate on a ship that might suit our needs take us to now 
 this way the wookie least it sounded something like that to any case the huge gesture was unmistakable they startedto wend their way deeper into the bar the wookie parting the crowd like a gravelstorm cutting canyonettes 
 out in front of the cantina threepio paced nervously next to the unconcerned artoo detoo was engaged in animated electronicconversation with a bright red r unit be longing to another of the patrons 
 what could be taking them so long they went to hire one a fleet 
 abruptly threepio paused beckoning silently for artoo to be quiet twoimperial troopers had appeared on the scene they were met by an unkempt humanwho had emerged almost simultaneously from the depths of the cantina 
 i do not like the looks of this the tall droid murmured 
 luke had appropriated someone drink from a tray as they madetheir way to the rear of the cantina he gulped at it with the giddy air of one whofeels himself under diving protection that safe he was not but in the company ofkenobi and the giant wookie he began to feel confident that no one in the bar wouldassault him with so much as a dirty look 
 in a rear booth they encountered a young man perhaps five yearsolder than luke perhaps a was difficult to tell he displayed the opennessof the utterly the insanely reckless at their approach the man sent thehumanoid wench who had been wriggling on his lap on her way with a whisperedsomething which left a wide if inhuman grin on her face 
 the wookie chewbacca rumbled something at the man and he nodded inresponse glancing up at the newcomers pleasantly 
 pretty handy with that saber old man not often does one see that kindof swordplay in this part of the empire anymore he downed a prodigious portionof whatever filled his mug han solo captain of the millennium he became all business chewie tells me looking for passage tothe alderaan system 
 right son if on a fast ship kenobi told him solo bridleat the son 
 fast ship you mean never heard of the millennium falcon 
 kenobi appeared amused should i 
 the ship that made the kessel run in less than twelve standard told him indignantly outrun imperial starships and corellian cruisers ithink fast enough for you old man his outrage subsided rapidly cargo 
 only passengers myself the boy and two questions asked 
 no questions solo regarded his mug finally looked up is it local trouble 
 just say like to avoid any imperial entanglements kenobi repliedeasily 
 these days that can be a real trick cost you a little extra he did somemental figuring all in all about ten thousand in advance he added with asmile and no questions asked 
 luke gaped at the pilot ten thousand we could almost buy our own shipfor that 
 solo shrugged maybe you could and maybe you in any you fly it 
 you bet i could luke shot back rising not such a bad pilot myself 
 again the firm hand on his arm we that much with us kenobiexplained but we could pay you two thousand now plus another fifteen when wereach alderaan 
 solo leaned forward uncertainly fifteenyou can really get your hands onthat kind of money 
 i promise the government on alderaan itself at the worst earned an honest fee two thousand 
 but solo seemed not to hear the last seventeen thousandall right it got yourselves a ship as for avoiding imperial better twist out of here or even the millennium falcon be any help toyou he nodded toward the cantina entrance and added quickly docking first thing in the morning 
 four imperial troopers their eyes darting rapidly from table to booth to bar hadentered the cantina there was muttering from among the crowd but whenever theeyes of one of the heavily armed troopers went hunting for the mutterers the wordsdied with sullen speed 
 moving to the bar the officer in charge asked the bartender a couple of briefquestions the big man hesitated a moment then pointed toward a place near theback of the room as he did so his eyes widened slightly those of the officerwere unreadable 
 the booth he was pointing to was empty

 how is it she began as usual in french settling down briskly and fussily in the easy chair how is it annette never got married how stupid you men all are not to have married her excuse me for saying so but you have no sense about women what an argumentative fellow you are monsieur pierre 
 and i am still arguing with your husband i understand why he wants to go to the war replied pierre addressing the princess with none of the embarrassment so commonly shown by young men in their intercourse with young women 
 the princess started evidently words touched her to the quick 
 ah that is just what i tell him said she i understand it i in the least understand why men live without wars how is it that we women want anything of the kind need it now you shall judge between us i always tell him here he is a most brilliant position he is so well known so much appreciated by everyone the other day at the apraksins i heard a lady asking is that the famous prince andrew i did indeed she laughed he is so well received everywhere he might easily become to the emperor you know the emperor spoke to him most graciously annette and i were speaking of how to arrange it what do you think 
 pierre looked at his friend and noticing that he did not like the conversation gave no reply 
 when are you starting he asked 
 oh speak of his going i hear it spoken of said the princess in the same petulantly playful tone in which she had spoken to hippolyte in the drawing room and which was so plainly to the family circle of which pierre was almost a member today when i remembered that all these delightful associations must be broken off and then you know andre she looked significantly at her husband afraid afraid she whispered and a shudder ran down her back 
 her husband looked at her as if surprised to notice that someone besides pierre and himself was in the room and addressed her in a tone of frigid politeness

 alone all the same without my friends and he expects me not to be afraid 
 her tone was now querulous and her lip drawn up giving her not a joyful but an animal expression she paused as if she felt it indecorous to speak of her pregnancy before pierre though the gist of the matter lay in that 
 i still understand what you are afraid of said prince andrew slowly not taking his eyes off his wife 
 the princess blushed and raised her arms with a gesture of despair 
 no andrew i must say you have changed oh how you have 
 your doctor tells you to go to bed earlier said prince andrew you had better go

 you treat me like an invalid or a child i see it all did you behave like that six months ago 
 lise i beg you to desist said prince andrew still more emphatically 
 pierre who had been growing more and more agitated as he listened to all this rose and approached the princess he seemed unable to bear the sight of tears and was ready to cry himself

 prince andrew caught him by the hand 
 no wait pierre the princess is too kind to wish to deprive me of the pleasure of spending the evening with you 
 no he thinks only of himself muttered the princess without restraining her angry tears 
 lise said prince andrew dryly raising his voice to the pitch which indicates that patience is exhausted 
 suddenly the angry expression of the princess pretty face changed into a winning and piteous look of fear her beautiful eyes glanced askance at her face and her own assumed the timid deprecating expression of a dog when it rapidly but feebly wags its drooping tail 
 mon dieu mon dieu she muttered and lifting her dress with one hand she went up to her husband and kissed him on the forehead 
 good night lise said he rising and courteously kissing her hand as he would have done to a stranger

 chapter 
 
 cathy stayed at thrushcross grange five weeks till christmas by that time her ankle was thoroughly cured and her manners much improved the mistress visited her often in the interval and commenced her plan of reform by trying to raise her with fine clothes and flattery which she took readily so that instead of a wild hatless little savage jumping into the house and rushing to squeeze us all breathless there alighted from a handsome black pony a very dignified person with brown ringlets falling from the cover of a feathered beaver and a long cloth habit which she was obliged to hold up with both hands that she might sail in hindley lifted her from her horse exclaiming delightedly why cathy you are quite a beauty i should scarcely have known you you look like a lady now isabella linton is not to be compared with her is she frances 
 isabella has not her natural advantages replied his wife but she must mind and not grow wild again here ellen help miss catherine off with her dear you will disarrange your me untie your hat 
 i removed the habit and there shone forth beneath a grand plaid silk frock white trousers and burnished shoes and while her eyes sparkled joyfully when the dogs came bounding up to welcome her she dare hardly touch them lest they should fawn upon her splendid garments she kissed me gently i was all flour making the christmas cake and it would not have done to give me a hug and then she looked round for heathcliff mr and mrs earnshaw watched anxiously their meeting thinking it would enable them to judge in some measure what grounds they had for hoping to succeed in separating the two friends 
 heathcliff was hard to discover at first if he were careless and uncared for before absence he had been ten times more so since nobody but i even did him the kindness to call him a dirty boy and bid him wash himself once a week and children of his age seldom have a natural pleasure in soap and water therefore not to mention his clothes which had seen three months service in mire and dust and his thick uncombed hair the surface of his face and hands was dismally beclouded he might well skulk behind the settle on beholding such a bright graceful damsel enter the house instead of a counterpart of himself as he expected is heathcliff not here she demanded pulling off her gloves and displaying fingers wonderfully whitened with doing nothing and staying indoors 
 heathcliff you may come forward cried mr hindley enjoying his discomfiture and gratified to see what a forbidding young blackguard he would be compelled to present himself you may come and wish miss catherine welcome like the other servants 
 cathy catching a glimpse of her friend in his concealment flew to embrace him she bestowed seven or eight kisses on his cheek within the second and then stopped and drawing back burst into a laugh exclaiming why how very black and cross you look and funny and grim but because used to edgar and isabella linton well heathcliff have you forgotten me 
 she had some reason to put the question for shame and pride threw double gloom over his countenance and kept him immovable 
 shake hands heathcliff said mr earnshaw condescendingly once in a way that is permitted 
 i shall not replied the boy finding his tongue at last i shall not stand to be laughed at i shall not bear it 
 and he would have broken from the circle but miss cathy seized him again 
 i did not mean to laugh at you she said i could not hinder myself heathcliff shake hands at least what are you sulky for it was only that you looked odd if you wash your face and brush your hair it will be all right but you are so dirty 
 she gazed concernedly at the dusky fingers she held in her own and also at her dress which she feared had gained no embellishment from its contact with his 
 you have touched me he answered following her eye and snatching away his hand i shall be as dirty as i please and i like to be dirty and i will be dirty 
 with that he dashed head foremost out of the room amid the merriment of the master and mistress and to the serious disturbance of catherine who could not comprehend how her remarks should have produced such an exhibition of bad temper 
 after playing to the newcomer and putting my cakes in the oven and making the house and kitchen cheerful with great fires befitting christmas eve i prepared to sit down and amuse myself by singing carols all alone regardless of affirmations that he considered the merry tunes i chose as next door to songs he had retired to private prayer in his chamber and mr and mrs earnshaw were engaging attention by sundry gay trifles bought for her to present to the little lintons as an acknowledgment of their kindness they had invited them to spend the morrow at wuthering heights and the invitation had been accepted on one condition mrs linton begged that her darlings must be kept carefully apart from that naughty swearing boy 
 under these circumstances i remained solitary i smelt the rich scent of the heating spices and admired the shining kitchen utensils the polished clock decked in holly the silver mugs ranged on a tray ready to be filled with mulled ale for supper and above all the speckless purity of my particular scoured and floor i gave due inward applause to every object and then i remembered how old earnshaw used to come in when all was tidied and call me a cant lass and slip a shilling into my hand as a christmas box and from that i went on to think of his fondness for heathcliff and his dread lest he should suffer neglect after death had removed him and that naturally led me to consider the poor situation now and from singing i changed my mind to crying it struck me soon however there would be more sense in endeavouring to repair some of his wrongs than shedding tears over them i got up and walked into the court to seek him he was not far i found him smoothing the glossy coat of the new pony in the stable and feeding the other beasts according to custom 
 make haste heathcliff i said the kitchen is so comfortable and joseph is upstairs make haste and let me dress you smart before miss cathy comes out and then you can sit together with the whole hearth to yourselves and have a long chatter till bedtime 
 he proceeded with his task and never turned his head towards me 
 you coming i continued a little cake for each of you nearly enough and need half an donning 
 i waited five minutes but getting no answer left him catherine supped with her brother and joseph and i joined in an unsociable meal seasoned with reproofs on one side and sauciness on the other his cake and cheese remained on the table all night for the fairies he managed to continue work till nine and then marched dumb and dour to his chamber cathy sat up late having a world of things to order for the reception of her new friends she came into the kitchen once to speak to her old one but he was gone and she only stayed to ask what was the matter with him and then went back in the morning he rose early and as it was a holiday carried his ill humour on to the moors not reappearing till the family were departed for church fasting and reflection seemed to have brought him to a better spirit he hung about me for a while and having screwed up his courage exclaimed abruptly 
 nelly make me decent going to be good 
 high time heathcliff i said you have grieved catherine sorry she ever came home i dare say it looks as if you envied her because she is more thought of than you 
 the notion of envying catherine was incomprehensible to him but the notion of grieving her he understood clearly enough 
 did she say she was grieved he inquired looking very serious she cried when i told her you were off again this morning 
 well i cried last night he returned and i had more reason to cry than she 
 yes you had the reason of going to bed with a proud heart and an empty stomach said i proud people breed sad sorrows for themselves but if you be ashamed of your touchiness you must ask pardon mind when she comes in you must go up and offer to kiss her and know best what to say only do it heartily and not as if you thought her converted into a stranger by her grand dress and now though i have dinner to get ready steal time to arrange you so that edgar linton shall look quite a doll beside you and that he does you are younger and yet be bound you are taller and twice as broad across the shoulders you could knock him down in a twinkling you feel that you could 
 face brightened a moment then it was overcast afresh and he sighed 
 but nelly if i knocked him down twenty times that make him less handsome or me more so i wish i had light hair and a fair skin and was dressed and behaved as well and had a chance of being as rich as he will be 
 and cried for mamma at every turn i added and trembled if a country lad heaved his fist against you and sat at home all day for a shower of rain oh heathcliff you are showing a poor spirit come to the glass and let you see what you should wish do you mark those two lines between your eyes and those thick brows that instead of rising arched sink in the middle and that couple of black fiends so deeply buried who never open their windows boldly but lurk glinting under them like spies wish and learn to smooth away the surly wrinkles to raise your lids frankly and change the fiends to confident innocent angels suspecting and doubting nothing and always seeing friends where they are not sure of foes get the expression of a vicious cur that appears to know the kicks it gets are its desert and yet hates all the world as well as the kicker for what it suffers 
 in other words i must wish for edgar great blue eyes and even forehead he replied i that help me to them 
 a good heart will help you to a bonny face my lad i continued if you were a regular black and a bad one will turn the bonniest into something worse than ugly and now that done washing and combing and me whether you think yourself rather handsome tell you i do fit for a prince in disguise who knows but your father was emperor of china and your mother an indian queen each of them able to buy up with one income wuthering heights and thrushcross grange together and you were kidnapped by wicked sailors and brought to england were i in your place i would frame high notions of my birth and the thoughts of what i was should give me courage and dignity to support the oppressions of a little farmer 
 so i chattered on and heathcliff gradually lost his frown and began to look quite pleasant when all at once our conversation was interrupted by a rumbling sound moving up the road and entering the court he ran to the window and i to the door just in time to behold the two lintons descend from the family carriage smothered in cloaks and furs and the earnshaws dismount from their horses they often rode to church in winter catherine took a hand of each of the children and brought them into the house and set them before the fire which quickly put colour into their white faces 
 i urged my companion to hasten now and show his amiable humour and he willingly obeyed but ill luck would have it that as he opened the door leading from the kitchen on one side hindley opened it on the other they met and the master irritated at seeing him clean and cheerful or perhaps eager to keep his promise to mrs linton shoved him back with a sudden thrust and angrily bade joseph keep the fellow out of the him into the garret till dinner is over be cramming his fingers in the tarts and stealing the fruit if left alone with them a minute 
 nay sir i could not avoid answering touch nothing not he and i suppose he must have his share of the dainties as well as we 
 he shall have his share of my hand if i catch him downstairs again till dark cried hindley begone you vagabond what you are attempting the coxcomb are you wait till i get hold of those elegant if i pull them a bit longer 
 they are long enough already observed master linton peeping from the doorway i wonder they make his head ache like a mane over his eyes 
 he ventured his remark without any intention to insult but violent nature was not prepared to endure the appearance of impertinence from one whom he seemed to hate even then as a rival he seized a tureen of hot apple sauce the first thing that came under his gripe and dashed it full against the face and neck who instantly commenced a lament that brought isabella and catherine hurrying to the place mr earnshaw snatched up the culprit directly and conveyed him to his chamber where doubtless he administered a rough remedy to cool the fit of passion for he reappeared red and breathless i got the and rather spitefully scrubbed nose and mouth affirming it served him right for meddling his sister began weeping to go home and cathy stood by confounded blushing for all 
 you should not have spoken to him she expostulated with master linton he was in a bad temper and now spoilt your visit and be flogged i hate him to be flogged i eat my dinner why did you speak to him edgar 
 i sobbed the youth escaping from my hands and finishing the remainder of the purification with his cambric pocket handkerchief i promised mamma that i say one word to him and i 
 well cry replied catherine contemptuously not killed make more mischief my brother is coming be quiet give over isabella has anybody hurt you 
 there there your seats cried hindley bustling in that brute of a lad has warmed me nicely next time master edgar take the law into your own will give you an appetite 
 the little party recovered its equanimity at sight of the fragrant feast they were hungry after their ride and easily consoled since no real harm had befallen them mr earnshaw carved bountiful platefuls and the mistress made them merry with lively talk i waited behind her chair and was pained to behold catherine with dry eyes and an indifferent air commence cutting up the wing of a goose before her an unfeeling child i thought to myself how lightly she dismisses her old troubles i could not have imagined her to be so selfish she lifted a mouthful to her lips then she set it down again her cheeks flushed and the tears gushed over them she slipped her fork to the floor and hastily dived under the cloth to conceal her emotion i did not cal her unfeeling long for i perceived she was in purgatory through out the day and wearying to find an opportunity of getting by herself or paying a visit to heathcliff who had been locked up b the master as i discovered on endeavouring to introduce to him private mess of victuals 
 in the evening we had a dance cathy begged that he might b liberated then as isabella linton had no partner her entreaties were vain and i was appointed to supply the deficiency we got rid of all gloom in the excitement of the exercise and our pleasure was increased by the arrival of the gimmerton band mustering fifteen strong a trumpet a trombone clarionets bassoon french horns and a bass viol besides singers they go the rounds of all the respectable houses and receive contributions every christmas and we esteemed it a treat to hear them after the usual carols had been sung we set them to songs and glees mrs earnshaw loved the music and so they gave us plenty 
 catherine loved it too but she said it sounded sweetest at the top of the steps and she went up in the dark i followed they shut the house door below never noting our absence it was so full people she made no stay at the head but mounted farther to the garret where heathcliff was confined and called him i stubbornly declined answering for a while she persevered and finally persuaded him to hold communion with her through the boards i let the poor things converse unmolested till i supposed the songs were going to cease and the singers to get some refreshment then i clambered up the ladder to warn her instead of finding her outside i heard her voice within the little monkey had crept by the skylight of one garret along the roof into the skylight of the other and it was with the utmost difficulty i could coax her out again when she did come heathcliff came with her and she insisted that i should take him into the kitchen as my had gone to a to be removed from the sound of our psalmody as it pleased him to call it i told them i intended by no means to encourage their tricks but as the prisoner had never broken his fast since dinner i would wink at his cheating mr hindley that once he went down i set him a stool by the fire and offered him a quantity of good things but he was sick and could eat little and my attempts to entertain him were thrown away he leant his two elbows on his knees and his chin on his hands and remained wrapt in dumb meditation on my inquiring the subject of his thoughts he answered gravely 
 trying to settle how i shall pay hindley back i care how long i wait if i can only do it at last i hope he will not die before i do 
 for shame heathcliff said i it is for god to punish wicked people we should learn to forgive 
 no god have the satisfaction that i shall he returned i only wish i knew the best way let me alone and plan it out while thinking of that i feel pain 
 but mr lockwood i forget these tales cannot divert you annoyed how i should dream of chattering on at such a rate and your gruel cold and you nodding for bed i could have told heathcliffs history all that you need hear in half a dozen words 
 thus interrupting herself the housekeeper rose arid proceeded to lay aside her sewing but i felt incapable of moving from the hearth and i was very far from nodding sit still mrs dean i cried do sit still another done just right to tell the story leisurely that is the method i like and you must finish it in the same style i am interested in every character you have mentioned more or less 
 the clock is on the stroke of eleven sir 
 no not accustomed to go to bed in the long hours one or two is early enough for a person who lies till ten 
 you lie till ten the very prime of the morning gone long before that time a person who has not done one half his work by ten runs a chance of leaving the other half undone 
 nevertheless mrs dean resume your chair because to morrow i intend lengthening the night till afternoon i prognosticate for myself an obstinate cold at least 
 i hope not sir well you must allow me to leap over some three years during that space mrs earnshaw 
 no no allow nothing of the sort are you acquainted with the mood of mind in which if you were seated alone and the cat licking its kitten on the rug before you you would watch the operation so intently that neglect of one ear would put you seriously out of temper 
 a terribly lazy mood i should say 
 on the contrary a tiresomely active one it is mine at present and therefore continue minutely i perceive that people in these regions acquire over people in towns the value that the spider in a dungeon does over a spider in a cottage to their various occupants and yet the deepened attraction is not entirely owing to the situation of the they do live more in earnest more in themselves and less in surface change and frivolous external things i could fancy a love for life here almost possible and i was a fixed unbeliever in any love of a standing one state resembles setting a hungry man down to a single dish on which he may concentrate his entire appetite and do it justice the other introducing him to a table laid out by french cooks he can perhaps extract as much enjoyment from the whole but each part is a mere atom in his regard and remembrance 
 oh here we are the same as anywhere else when you get to know us observed mrs dean somewhat puzzled at my speech 
 excuse me i responded you my good friend are a striking evidence against that assertion excepting a few provincialisms of slight consequence you have no marks of the manners which i am habituated to consider as peculiar to your class i am sure you have thought a great deal more than the generality of servants think you have been compelled to cultivate your reflective faculties for want of occasions for frittering your life away in silly trifles 
 mrs dean laughed 
 i certainly esteem myself a steady reasonable kind of body she said not exactly from living among the hills and seeing one set of faces and one series of actions from end to end but i have undergone sharp discipline which has taught me wisdom and then i have read more than you would fancy mr lockwood you could not open a book in this library that i have not looked into and got something out of also unless it be that range of greek and latin and that of french and those i know one from another it is as much as you can expect of a poor daughter however if i am to follow my story in true fashion i had better go on and instead of leaping three years i will be content to pass to the next summer of that is nearly years ago

 chapter 
 
 cathy stayed at thrushcross grange five weeks till christmas by that time her ankle was thoroughly cured and her manners much improved the mistress visited her often in the interval and commenced her plan of reform by trying to raise her with fine clothes and flattery which she took readily so that instead of a wild hatless little savage jumping into the house and rushing to squeeze us all breathless there alighted from a handsome black pony a very dignified person with brown ringlets falling from the cover of a feathered beaver and a long cloth habit which she was obliged to hold up with both hands that she might sail in hindley lifted her from her horse exclaiming delightedly why cathy you are quite a beauty i should scarcely have known you you look like a lady now isabella linton is not to be compared with her is she frances 
 isabella has not her natural advantages replied his wife but she must mind and not grow wild again here ellen help miss catherine off with her dear you will disarrange your me untie your hat 
 i removed the habit and there shone forth beneath a grand plaid silk frock white trousers and burnished shoes and while her eyes sparkled joyfully when the dogs came bounding up to welcome her she dare hardly touch them lest they should fawn upon her splendid garments she kissed me gently i was all flour making the christmas cake and it would not have done to give me a hug and then she looked round for heathcliff mr and mrs earnshaw watched anxiously their meeting thinking it would enable them to judge in some measure what grounds they had for hoping to succeed in separating the two friends 
 heathcliff was hard to discover at first if he were careless and uncared for before absence he had been ten times more so since nobody but i even did him the kindness to call him a dirty boy and bid him wash himself once a week and children of his age seldom have a natural pleasure in soap and water therefore not to mention his clothes which had seen three months service in mire and dust and his thick uncombed hair the surface of his face and hands was dismally beclouded he might well skulk behind the settle on beholding such a bright graceful damsel enter the house instead of a counterpart of himself as he expected is heathcliff not here she demanded pulling off her gloves and displaying fingers wonderfully whitened with doing nothing and staying indoors 
 heathcliff you may come forward cried mr hindley enjoying his discomfiture and gratified to see what a forbidding young blackguard he would be compelled to present himself you may come and wish miss catherine welcome like the other servants 
 cathy catching a glimpse of her friend in his concealment flew to embrace him she bestowed seven or eight kisses on his cheek within the second and then stopped and drawing back burst into a laugh exclaiming why how very black and cross you look and funny and grim but because used to edgar and isabella linton well heathcliff have you forgotten me 
 she had some reason to put the question for shame and pride threw double gloom over his countenance and kept him immovable 
 shake hands heathcliff said mr earnshaw condescendingly once in a way that is permitted 
 i shall not replied the boy finding his tongue at last i shall not stand to be laughed at i shall not bear it 
 and he would have broken from the circle but miss cathy seized him again 
 i did not mean to laugh at you she said i could not hinder myself heathcliff shake hands at least what are you sulky for it was only that you looked odd if you wash your face and brush your hair it will be all right but you are so dirty 
 she gazed concernedly at the dusky fingers she held in her own and also at her dress which she feared had gained no embellishment from its contact with his 
 you have touched me he answered following her eye and snatching away his hand i shall be as dirty as i please and i like to be dirty and i will be dirty 
 with that he dashed head foremost out of the room amid the merriment of the master and mistress and to the serious disturbance of catherine who could not comprehend how her remarks should have produced such an exhibition of bad temper 
 after playing to the newcomer and putting my cakes in the oven and making the house and kitchen cheerful with great fires befitting christmas eve i prepared to sit down and amuse myself by singing carols all alone regardless of affirmations that he considered the merry tunes i chose as next door to songs he had retired to private prayer in his chamber and mr and mrs earnshaw were engaging attention by sundry gay trifles bought for her to present to the little lintons as an acknowledgment of their kindness they had invited them to spend the morrow at wuthering heights and the invitation had been accepted on one condition mrs linton begged that her darlings must be kept carefully apart from that naughty swearing boy 
 under these circumstances i remained solitary i smelt the rich scent of the heating spices and admired the shining kitchen utensils the polished clock decked in holly the silver mugs ranged on a tray ready to be filled with mulled ale for supper and above all the speckless purity of my particular scoured and floor i gave due inward applause to every object and then i remembered how old earnshaw used to come in when all was tidied and call me a cant lass and slip a shilling into my hand as a christmas box and from that i went on to think of his fondness for heathcliff and his dread lest he should suffer neglect after death had removed him and that naturally led me to consider the poor situation now and from singing i changed my mind to crying it struck me soon however there would be more sense in endeavouring to repair some of his wrongs than shedding tears over them i got up and walked into the court to seek him he was not far i found him smoothing the glossy coat of the new pony in the stable and feeding the other beasts according to custom 
 make haste heathcliff i said the kitchen is so comfortable and joseph is upstairs make haste and let me dress you smart before miss cathy comes out and then you can sit together with the whole hearth to yourselves and have a long chatter till bedtime 
 he proceeded with his task and never turned his head towards me 
 you coming i continued a little cake for each of you nearly enough and need half an donning 
 i waited five minutes but getting no answer left him catherine supped with her brother and joseph and i joined in an unsociable meal seasoned with reproofs on one side and sauciness on the other his cake and cheese remained on the table all night for the fairies he managed to continue work till nine and then marched dumb and dour to his chamber cathy sat up late having a world of things to order for the reception of her new friends she came into the kitchen once to speak to her old one but he was gone and she only stayed to ask what was the matter with him and then went back in the morning he rose early and as it was a holiday carried his ill humour on to the moors not reappearing till the family were departed for church fasting and reflection seemed to have brought him to a better spirit he hung about me for a while and having screwed up his courage exclaimed abruptly 
 nelly make me decent going to be good 
 high time heathcliff i said you have grieved catherine sorry she ever came home i dare say it looks as if you envied her because she is more thought of than you 
 the notion of envying catherine was incomprehensible to him but the notion of grieving her he understood clearly enough 
 did she say she was grieved he inquired looking very serious she cried when i told her you were off again this morning 
 well i cried last night he returned and i had more reason to cry than she 
 yes you had the reason of going to bed with a proud heart and an empty stomach said i proud people breed sad sorrows for themselves but if you be ashamed of your touchiness you must ask pardon mind when she comes in you must go up and offer to kiss her and know best what to say only do it heartily and not as if you thought her converted into a stranger by her grand dress and now though i have dinner to get ready steal time to arrange you so that edgar linton shall look quite a doll beside you and that he does you are younger and yet be bound you are taller and twice as broad across the shoulders you could knock him down in a twinkling you feel that you could 
 face brightened a moment then it was overcast afresh and he sighed 
 but nelly if i knocked him down twenty times that make him less handsome or me more so i wish i had light hair and a fair skin and was dressed and behaved as well and had a chance of being as rich as he will be 
 and cried for mamma at every turn i added and trembled if a country lad heaved his fist against you and sat at home all day for a shower of rain oh heathcliff you are showing a poor spirit come to the glass and let you see what you should wish do you mark those two lines between your eyes and those thick brows that instead of rising arched sink in the middle and that couple of black fiends so deeply buried who never open their windows boldly but lurk glinting under them like spies wish and learn to smooth away the surly wrinkles to raise your lids frankly and change the fiends to confident innocent angels suspecting and doubting nothing and always seeing friends where they are not sure of foes get the expression of a vicious cur that appears to know the kicks it gets are its desert and yet hates all the world as well as the kicker for what it suffers 
 in other words i must wish for edgar great blue eyes and even forehead he replied i that help me to them 
 a good heart will help you to a bonny face my lad i continued if you were a regular black and a bad one will turn the bonniest into something worse than ugly and now that done washing and combing and me whether you think yourself rather handsome tell you i do fit for a prince in disguise who knows but your father was emperor of china and your mother an indian queen each of them able to buy up with one income wuthering heights and thrushcross grange together and you were kidnapped by wicked sailors and brought to england were i in your place i would frame high notions of my birth and the thoughts of what i was should give me courage and dignity to support the oppressions of a little farmer 
 so i chattered on and heathcliff gradually lost his frown and began to look quite pleasant when all at once our conversation was interrupted by a rumbling sound moving up the road and entering the court he ran to the window and i to the door just in time to behold the two lintons descend from the family carriage smothered in cloaks and furs and the earnshaws dismount from their horses they often rode to church in winter catherine took a hand of each of the children and brought them into the house and set them before the fire which quickly put colour into their white faces 
 i urged my companion to hasten now and show his amiable humour and he willingly obeyed but ill luck would have it that as he opened the door leading from the kitchen on one side hindley opened it on the other they met and the master irritated at seeing him clean and cheerful or perhaps eager to keep his promise to mrs linton shoved him back with a sudden thrust and angrily bade joseph keep the fellow out of the him into the garret till dinner is over be cramming his fingers in the tarts and stealing the fruit if left alone with them a minute 
 nay sir i could not avoid answering touch nothing not he and i suppose he must have his share of the dainties as well as we 
 he shall have his share of my hand if i catch him downstairs again till dark cried hindley begone you vagabond what you are attempting the coxcomb are you wait till i get hold of those elegant if i pull them a bit longer 
 they are long enough already observed master linton peeping from the doorway i wonder they make his head ache like a mane over his eyes 
 he ventured his remark without any intention to insult but violent nature was not prepared to endure the appearance of impertinence from one whom he seemed to hate even then as a rival he seized a tureen of hot apple sauce the first thing that came under his gripe and dashed it full against the face and neck who instantly commenced a lament that brought isabella and catherine hurrying to the place mr earnshaw snatched up the culprit directly and conveyed him to his chamber where doubtless he administered a rough remedy to cool the fit of passion for he reappeared red and breathless i got the and rather spitefully scrubbed nose and mouth affirming it served him right for meddling his sister began weeping to go home and cathy stood by confounded blushing for all 
 you should not have spoken to him she expostulated with master linton he was in a bad temper and now spoilt your visit and be flogged i hate him to be flogged i eat my dinner why did you speak to him edgar 
 i sobbed the youth escaping from my hands and finishing the remainder of the purification with his cambric pocket handkerchief i promised mamma that i say one word to him and i 
 well cry replied catherine contemptuously not killed make more mischief my brother is coming be quiet give over isabella has anybody hurt you 
 there there your seats cried hindley bustling in that brute of a lad has warmed me nicely next time master edgar take the law into your own will give you an appetite 
 the little party recovered its equanimity at sight of the fragrant feast they were hungry after their ride and easily consoled since no real harm had befallen them mr earnshaw carved bountiful platefuls and the mistress made them merry with lively talk i waited behind her chair and was pained to behold catherine with dry eyes and an indifferent air commence cutting up the wing of a goose before her an unfeeling child i thought to myself how lightly she dismisses her old troubles i could not have imagined her to be so selfish she lifted a mouthful to her lips then she set it down again her cheeks flushed and the tears gushed over them she slipped her fork to the floor and hastily dived under the cloth to conceal her emotion i did not cal her unfeeling long for i perceived she was in purgatory through out the day and wearying to find an opportunity of getting by herself or paying a visit to heathcliff who had been locked up b the master as i discovered on endeavouring to introduce to him private mess of victuals 
 in the evening we had a dance cathy begged that he might b liberated then as isabella linton had no partner her entreaties were vain and i was appointed to supply the deficiency we got rid of all gloom in the excitement of the exercise and our pleasure was increased by the arrival of the gimmerton band mustering fifteen strong a trumpet a trombone clarionets bassoon french horns and a bass viol besides singers they go the rounds of all the respectable houses and receive contributions every christmas and we esteemed it a treat to hear them after the usual carols had been sung we set them to songs and glees mrs earnshaw loved the music and so they gave us plenty 
 catherine loved it too but she said it sounded sweetest at the top of the steps and she went up in the dark i followed they shut the house door below never noting our absence it was so full people she made no stay at the head but mounted farther to the garret where heathcliff was confined and called him i stubbornly declined answering for a while she persevered and finally persuaded him to hold communion with her through the boards i let the poor things converse unmolested till i supposed the songs were going to cease and the singers to get some refreshment then i clambered up the ladder to warn her instead of finding her outside i heard her voice within the little monkey had crept by the skylight of one garret along the roof into the skylight of the other and it was with the utmost difficulty i could coax her out again when she did come heathcliff came with her and she insisted that i should take him into the kitchen as my had gone to a to be removed from the sound of our psalmody as it pleased him to call it i told them i intended by no means to encourage their tricks but as the prisoner had never broken his fast since dinner i would wink at his cheating mr hindley that once he went down i set him a stool by the fire and offered him a quantity of good things but he was sick and could eat little and my attempts to entertain him were thrown away he leant his two elbows on his knees and his chin on his hands and remained wrapt in dumb meditation on my inquiring the subject of his thoughts he answered gravely 
 trying to settle how i shall pay hindley back i care how long i wait if i can only do it at last i hope he will not die before i do 
 for shame heathcliff said i it is for god to punish wicked people we should learn to forgive 
 no god have the satisfaction that i shall he returned i only wish i knew the best way let me alone and plan it out while thinking of that i feel pain 
 but mr lockwood i forget these tales cannot divert you annoyed how i should dream of chattering on at such a rate and your gruel cold and you nodding for bed i could have told heathcliffs history all that you need hear in half a dozen words 
 thus interrupting herself the housekeeper rose arid proceeded to lay aside her sewing but i felt incapable of moving from the hearth and i was very far from nodding sit still mrs dean i cried do sit still another done just right to tell the story leisurely that is the method i like and you must finish it in the same style i am interested in every character you have mentioned more or less 
 the clock is on the stroke of eleven sir 
 no not accustomed to go to bed in the long hours one or two is early enough for a person who lies till ten 
 you lie till ten the very prime of the morning gone long before that time a person who has not done one half his work by ten runs a chance of leaving the other half undone 
 nevertheless mrs dean resume your chair because to morrow i intend lengthening the night till afternoon i prognosticate for myself an obstinate cold at least 
 i hope not sir well you must allow me to leap over some three years during that space mrs earnshaw 
 no no allow nothing of the sort are you acquainted with the mood of mind in which if you were seated alone and the cat licking its kitten on the rug before you you would watch the operation so intently that neglect of one ear would put you seriously out of temper 
 a terribly lazy mood i should say 
 on the contrary a tiresomely active one it is mine at present and therefore continue minutely i perceive that people in these regions acquire over people in towns the value that the spider in a dungeon does over a spider in a cottage to their various occupants and yet the deepened attraction is not entirely owing to the situation of the they do live more in earnest more in themselves and less in surface change and frivolous external things i could fancy a love for life here almost possible and i was a fixed unbeliever in any love of a standing one state resembles setting a hungry man down to a single dish on which he may concentrate his entire appetite and do it justice the other introducing him to a table laid out by french cooks he can perhaps extract as much enjoyment from the whole but each part is a mere atom in his regard and remembrance 
 oh here we are the same as anywhere else when you get to know us observed mrs dean somewhat puzzled at my speech 
 excuse me i responded you my good friend are a striking evidence against that assertion excepting a few provincialisms of slight consequence you have no marks of the manners which i am habituated to consider as peculiar to your class i am sure you have thought a great deal more than the generality of servants think you have been compelled to cultivate your reflective faculties for want of occasions for frittering your life away in silly trifles 
 mrs dean laughed 
 i certainly esteem myself a steady reasonable kind of body she said not exactly from living among the hills and seeing one set of faces and one series of actions from end to end but i have undergone sharp discipline which has taught me wisdom and then i have read more than you would fancy mr lockwood you could not open a book in this library that i have not looked into and got something out of also unless it be that range of greek and latin and that of french and those i know one from another it is as much as you can expect of a poor daughter however if i am to follow my story in true fashion i had better go on and instead of leaping three years i will be content to pass to the next summer of that is nearly years ago

 chapter seven 
 
 that boy is a perfect cyclops he said amy one day as laurie clattered by on horseback with a flourish of his whip as he passed 
 how dare you say so when got both his eyes and very handsome ones they are too cried jo who resented any slighting remarks about her friend 
 i day anything about his eyes and i see why you need fire up when i admire his riding 
 oh my goodness that little goose means a centaur and she called him a cyclops exclaimed jo with a burst of laughter you be so rude only a lapse of lingy as mr davis says retorted amy finishing jo with her latin i just wish i had a little of the money laurie spends on that horse she added as if to herself yet hoping her sisters would hear 
 why asked meg kindly for jo had gone off in another laugh at second blunder 
 i need it so much dreadfully in debt and it be my turn to have the rag money for a month 
 in debt amy what do you mean and meg looked sober 
 why i owe at least a dozen pickled limes and i pay them you know till i have money for marmee forbade my having anything charged at the shop 
 tell me all about it are limes the fashion now it used to be pricking bits of rubber to make balls and meg tried to keep her countenance amy looked so grave and important 
 why you see the girls are always buying them and unless you want to be thought mean you must do it too nothing but limes now for everyone is sucking them in their desks in schooltime and trading them off for pencils bead rings paper dolls or something else at recess if one girl likes another she gives her a lime if mad with her she eats one before her face and offer even a suck they treat by turns and had ever so many but returned them and i ought for they are debts of honor you know 
 how much will pay them off and restore your credit asked meg taking out her purse 
 a quarter would more than do it and leave a few cents over for a treat for you you like limes 
 not much you may have my share the money make it last as long as you can for it very plenty you know 
 oh thank you it must be so nice to have pocket money have a grand feast for i tasted a lime this week i felt delicate about taking any as i return them and actually suffering for one 
 next day amy was rather late at school but could not resist the temptation of displaying with pardonable pride a moist parcel before she consigned it to the inmost recesses of her desk during the next few minutes the rumor that amy march had got twenty four delicious limes she ate one on the way and was going to treat circulated through her set and the attentions of her friends became quite overwhelming katy brown invited her to her next party on the spot mary kinglsey insisted on lending her her watch till recess and jenny snow a satirical young lady who had basely twitted amy upon her limeless state promptly buried the hatchet and offered to furnish answers to certain appalling sums but amy had not forgotten miss cutting remarks about some persons whose noses were not too flat to smell other limes and people who were not too proud to ask for them and she instantly crushed that snow hopes by the withering telegram you be so polite all of a sudden for you get any 
 a distinguished personage happened to visit the school that morning and beautifully drawn maps received praise which honor to her foe rankled in the soul of miss snow and caused miss march to assume the airs of a studious young peacock but alas alas pride goes before a fall and the revengeful snow turned the tables with disastrous success no sooner had the guest paid the usual stale compliments and bowed himself out than jenny under pretense of asking an important question informed mr davis the teacher that amy march had pickled limes in her desk 
 now mr davis had declared limes a contraband article and solemnly vowed to publicly ferrule the first person who was found breaking the law this man had succeeded in banishing chewing gum after a long and stormy war had made a bonfire of the confiscated novels and newspapers had suppressed a private post office had forbidden distortions of the face nicknames and caricatures and done all that one man could do to keep half a hundred rebellious girls in order boys are trying enough to human patience goodness knows but girls are infinitely more so especially to nervous gentlemen with tyrannical tempers and no more talent for teaching than dr blimber mr davis knew any quantity of greek latin algebra and ologies of all sorts so he was called a fine teacher and manners morals feelings and examples were not considered of any particular importance it was a most unfortunate moment for denouncing amy and jenny knew it mr davis had evidently taken his coffee too strong that morning there was an east wind which always affected his neuralgia and his pupils had not done him the credit which he felt he deserved therefore to use the expressive if not elegant language of a schoolgirl he was as nervous as a witch and as cross as a bear the word limes was like fire to powder his yellow face flushed and he rapped on his desk with an energy which made jenny skip to her seat with unusual rapidity 
 young ladies attention if you please 
 at the stern order the buzz ceased and fifty pairs of blue black gray and brown eyes were obediently fixed upon his awful countenance 
 miss march come to the desk 
 amy rose to comply with outward composure but a secret fear oppressed her for the limes weighed upon her conscience 
 bring with you the limes you have in your desk was the unexpected command which arrested her before she got out of her seat 
 take all whispered her neighbor a young lady of great presence of mind 
 amy hastily shook out half a dozen and laid the rest down before mr davis feeling that any man possessing a human heart would relent when that delicious perfume met his nose unfortunately mr davis particularly detested the odor of the fashionable pickle and disgust added to his wrath 
 is that all 
 not quite stammered amy 
 bring the rest immediately 
 with a despairing glance at her set she obeyed 
 you are sure there are no more 
 i never lie sir 
 so i see now take these disgusting things two by two and throw them out of the window 
 there was a simultaneous sigh which created quite a little gust as the last hope fled and the treat was ravished from their longing lips scarlet with shame and anger amy went to and fro six dreadful times and as each doomed couple looking oh so plump and juicy fell from her reluctant hands a shout from the street completed the anguish of the girls for it told them that their feast was being exulted over by the little irish children who were their sworn foes was too much all flashed indignant or appealing glances at the inexorable davis and one passionate lime lover burst into tears 
 as amy returned from her last trip mr davis gave a portentous hem and said in his most impressive manner 
 young ladies you remember what i said to you a week ago i am sorry this has happened but i never allow my rules to be infringed and i never break my word miss march hold out your hand 
 amy started and put both hands behind her turning on him an imploring look which pleaded for her better than the words she could not utter she was rather a favorite with old davis as of course he was called and my private belief that he would have broken his word if the indignation of one irrepressible young lady had not found vent in a hiss that hiss faint as it was irritated the irascible gentleman and sealed the fate 
 your hand miss march was the only answer her mute appeal received and too proud to cry or beseech amy set her teeth threw bach her head defiantly and bore without flinching several tingling blows on her little palm they were neither many nor heavy but that made no difference to her for the first time in her life she had been struck and the disgrace in her eyes was as deep as if he had knocked her down 
 you will now stand on the platform till recess said mr davis resolved to do the thing thoroughly since he had begun 
 that was dreadful it would have been bad enough to go to her seat and see the pitying faces of her friends or the satisfied ones of her few enemies but to face the whole school with that shame fresh upon her seemed impossible and for a second she felt as if she could only drop down where she stood and break her heart with crying a bitter sense of wrong and the thought of jenny snow helped her to bear it and taking the ignominious place she fixed her eyes on the stove funnel above what now seemed a sea of faces and stood there so motionless and white that the girls found it hard to study with that pathetic figure before them 
 during the fifteen minutes that followed the proud and sensitive little girl suffered a shame and pain which she never forgot to others it might seem a ludicrous or trivial affair but to her it was a hard experience for during the twelve years of her life she had been governed by love alone and a blow of that sort had never touched her before the smart of her hand and the ache of her heart were forgotten in the sting of the thought i shall have to tell at home and they will be so disappointed in me 
 the fifteen minutes seemed an hour but they came to an end at last and the word recess had never seemed so welcome to her before 
 you can go miss march said mr davis looking as he felt uncomfortable 
 he did not soon forget the reproachful glance amy gave him as she went without a word to anyone straight into the anteroom snatched her things and left the place forever as she passionately declared to herself she was in a sad state when she got home and when the older girls arrived some time later an indignation meeting was held at once mrs march did not say much but looked disturbed and comforted her afflicted little daughter in her tenderest manner meg bathed the insulted hand with glycerine and tears beth felt that even her beloved kittens would fail as a balm for griefs like this jo wrathfully proposed that mr davis be arrested without delay and hannah shook her fist at the villain and pounded potatoes for dinner as if she had him under her pestle 
 no notice was taken of flight except by her mates but the demoiselles discovered that mr davis was quite benignant in the afternoon also unusually nervous just before school closed jo appeared wearing a grim expression as she stalked up to the desk and delivered a letter from her mother then collected property and departed carefully scraping the mud from her boots on the door mat as if she shook that dust of the place off her feet 
 yes you can have a vacation from school but i want you to study a little every day with beth said mrs march that evening i approve of corporal punishment especially for girls i dislike mr manner of teaching and think the girls you associate with are doing you any good so i shall ask your advice before i send you anywhere else 
 good i wish all the girls would leave and spoil his old school perfectly maddening to think of those lovely limes sighed amy with the air of a martyr 
 i am not sorry you lost them for you broke the rules and deserved some punishment for disobedience was the severe reply which rather disappointed the young lady who expected nothing but sympathy 
 do you mean you are glad i was disgraced before the whole school cried amy 
 i should not have chosen that way of mending a fault replied her mother but not sure that it do you more good than a molder method you are getting to be rather conceited my dear and it is quite time you set about correcting it you have a good many little gifts and virtues but there is no need of parading them for conceit spoils the finest genius there is not much danger that real talent or goodness will be overlooked long even if it is the consciousness of possessing and using it well should satisfy one and the great charm of all power is modesty 
 so it is cried laurie who was playing chess in a corner with jo i knew a girl once who had a really remarkable talent for music and she know it never guessed what sweet little things she composed when she was alone and have believed it if anyone had told her 
 i wish known that nice girl maybe she would have helped me so stupid said beth who stood beside him listening eagerly 
 you do know her and she helps you better than anyone else could answered laurie looking at her with such mischievous meaning in his merry black eyes that beth suddenly turned very red and hid her face in the sofa cushion quite overcome by such an unexpected discovery 
 jo let laurie win the game to pay for that praise of her beth who could not be prevailed upon to play for them after her compliment so laurie did his best and sang delightfully being in a particularly lively humor for to the marches he seldom showed the moody side of his character when he was gone amy who had been pensive all evening said suddenly as if busy over some new idea is laurie an accomplished boy 
 yes he has had an excellent education and has much talent he will make a fine man if not spoiled by petting replied her mother 
 and he conceited is he asked amy 
 not in the least that is why he is so charming and we all like him so much i see nice to have accomplishments and be elegant but not to show off or get perked up said amy thoughtfully 
 these things are always seen and felt in a manner and conversations if modestly used but it is not necessary to display them said mrs march 
 any more than proper to wear all your bonnets and gowns and ribbons at once that folks may know got them added jo and the lecture ended in a laugh

 next day amy was rather late at school but could not resist the temptation of displaying with pardonable pride a moist parcel before she consigned it to the inmost recesses of her desk during the next few minutes the rumor that amy march had got twenty four delicious limes she ate one on the way and was going to treat circulated through her set and the attentions of her friends became quite overwhelming katy brown invited her to her next party on the spot mary kinglsey insisted on lending her her watch till recess and jenny snow a satirical young lady who had basely twitted amy upon her limeless state promptly buried the hatchet and offered to furnish answers to certain appalling sums but amy had not forgotten miss cutting remarks about some persons whose noses were not too flat to smell other limes and people who were not too proud to ask for them and she instantly crushed that snow hopes by the withering telegram you be so polite all of a sudden for you get any 
 a distinguished personage happened to visit the school that morning and beautifully drawn maps received praise which honor to her foe rankled in the soul of miss snow and caused miss march to assume the airs of a studious young peacock but alas alas pride goes before a fall and the revengeful snow turned the tables with disastrous success no sooner had the guest paid the usual stale compliments and bowed himself out than jenny under pretense of asking an important question informed mr davis the teacher that amy march had pickled limes in her desk 
 now mr davis had declared limes a contraband article and solemnly vowed to publicly ferrule the first person who was found breaking the law this man had succeeded in banishing chewing gum after a long and stormy war had made a bonfire of the confiscated novels and newspapers had suppressed a private post office had forbidden distortions of the face nicknames and caricatures and done all that one man could do to keep half a hundred rebellious girls in order boys are trying enough to human patience goodness knows but girls are infinitely more so especially to nervous gentlemen with tyrannical tempers and no more talent for teaching than dr blimber mr davis knew any quantity of greek latin algebra and ologies of all sorts so he was called a fine teacher and manners morals feelings and examples were not considered of any particular importance it was a most unfortunate moment for denouncing amy and jenny knew it mr davis had evidently taken his coffee too strong that morning there was an east wind which always affected his neuralgia and his pupils had not done him the credit which he felt he deserved therefore to use the expressive if not elegant language of a schoolgirl he was as nervous as a witch and as cross as a bear the word limes was like fire to powder his yellow face flushed and he rapped on his desk with an energy which made jenny skip to her seat with unusual rapidity 
 young ladies attention if you please 
 at the stern order the buzz ceased and fifty pairs of blue black gray and brown eyes were obediently fixed upon his awful countenance 
 miss march come to the desk 
 amy rose to comply with outward composure but a secret fear oppressed her for the limes weighed upon her conscience 
 bring with you the limes you have in your desk was the unexpected command which arrested her before she got out of her seat 
 take all whispered her neighbor a young lady of great presence of mind 
 amy hastily shook out half a dozen and laid the rest down before mr davis feeling that any man possessing a human heart would relent when that delicious perfume met his nose unfortunately mr davis particularly detested the odor of the fashionable pickle and disgust added to his wrath 
 is that all 
 not quite stammered amy 
 bring the rest immediately 
 with a despairing glance at her set she obeyed 
 you are sure there are no more 
 i never lie sir 
 so i see now take these disgusting things two by two and throw them out of the window 
 there was a simultaneous sigh which created quite a little gust as the last hope fled and the treat was ravished from their longing lips scarlet with shame and anger amy went to and fro six dreadful times and as each doomed couple looking oh so plump and juicy fell from her reluctant hands a shout from the street completed the anguish of the girls for it told them that their feast was being exulted over by the little irish children who were their sworn foes was too much all flashed indignant or appealing glances at the inexorable davis and one passionate lime lover burst into tears 
 as amy returned from her last trip mr davis gave a portentous hem and said in his most impressive manner 
 young ladies you remember what i said to you a week ago i am sorry this has happened but i never allow my rules to be infringed and i never break my word miss march hold out your hand 
 amy started and put both hands behind her turning on him an imploring look which pleaded for her better than the words she could not utter she was rather a favorite with old davis as of course he was called and my private belief that he would have broken his word if the indignation of one irrepressible young lady had not found vent in a hiss that hiss faint as it was irritated the irascible gentleman and sealed the fate 
 your hand miss march was the only answer her mute appeal received and too proud to cry or beseech amy set her teeth threw bach her head defiantly and bore without flinching several tingling blows on her little palm they were neither many nor heavy but that made no difference to her for the first time in her life she had been struck and the disgrace in her eyes was as deep as if he had knocked her down 
 you will now stand on the platform till recess said mr davis resolved to do the thing thoroughly since he had begun 
 that was dreadful it would have been bad enough to go to her seat and see the pitying faces of her friends or the satisfied ones of her few enemies but to face the whole school with that shame fresh upon her seemed impossible and for a second she felt as if she could only drop down where she stood and break her heart with crying a bitter sense of wrong and the thought of jenny snow helped her to bear it and taking the ignominious place she fixed her eyes on the stove funnel above what now seemed a sea of faces and stood there so motionless and white that the girls found it hard to study with that pathetic figure before them 
 during the fifteen minutes that followed the proud and sensitive little girl suffered a shame and pain which she never forgot to others it might seem a ludicrous or trivial affair but to her it was a hard experience for during the twelve years of her life she had been governed by love alone and a blow of that sort had never touched her before the smart of her hand and the ache of her heart were forgotten in the sting of the thought i shall have to tell at home and they will be so disappointed in me 
 the fifteen minutes seemed an hour but they came to an end at last and the word recess had never seemed so welcome to her before 
 you can go miss march said mr davis looking as he felt uncomfortable 
 he did not soon forget the reproachful glance amy gave him as she went without a word to anyone straight into the anteroom snatched her things and left the place forever as she passionately declared to herself she was in a sad state when she got home and when the older girls arrived some time later an indignation meeting was held at once mrs march did not say much but looked disturbed and comforted her afflicted little daughter in her tenderest manner meg bathed the insulted hand with glycerine and tears beth felt that even her beloved kittens would fail as a balm for griefs like this jo wrathfully proposed that mr davis be arrested without delay and hannah shook her fist at the villain and pounded potatoes for dinner as if she had him under her pestle 
 no notice was taken of flight except by her mates but the demoiselles discovered that mr davis was quite benignant in the afternoon also unusually nervous just before school closed jo appeared wearing a grim expression as she stalked up to the desk and delivered a letter from her mother then collected property and departed carefully scraping the mud from her boots on the door mat as if she shook that dust of the place off her feet 
 yes you can have a vacation from school but i want you to study a little every day with beth said mrs march that evening i approve of corporal punishment especially for girls i dislike mr manner of teaching and think the girls you associate with are doing you any good so i shall ask your advice before i send you anywhere else 
 good i wish all the girls would leave and spoil his old school perfectly maddening to think of those lovely limes sighed amy with the air of a martyr 
 i am not sorry you lost them for you broke the rules and deserved some punishment for disobedience was the severe reply which rather disappointed the young lady who expected nothing but sympathy 
 do you mean you are glad i was disgraced before the whole school cried amy 
 i should not have chosen that way of mending a fault replied her mother but not sure that it do you more good than a molder method you are getting to be rather conceited my dear and it is quite time you set about correcting it you have a good many little gifts and virtues but there is no need of parading them for conceit spoils the finest genius there is not much danger that real talent or goodness will be overlooked long even if it is the consciousness of possessing and using it well should satisfy one and the great charm of all power is modesty 
 so it is cried laurie who was playing chess in a corner with jo i knew a girl once who had a really remarkable talent for music and she know it never guessed what sweet little things she composed when she was alone and have believed it if anyone had told her 
 i wish known that nice girl maybe she would have helped me so stupid said beth who stood beside him listening eagerly 
 you do know her and she helps you better than anyone else could answered laurie looking at her with such mischievous meaning in his merry black eyes that beth suddenly turned very red and hid her face in the sofa cushion quite overcome by such an unexpected discovery 
 jo let laurie win the game to pay for that praise of her beth who could not be prevailed upon to play for them after her compliment so laurie did his best and sang delightfully being in a particularly lively humor for to the marches he seldom showed the moody side of his character when he was gone amy who had been pensive all evening said suddenly as if busy over some new idea is laurie an accomplished boy 
 yes he has had an excellent education and has much talent he will make a fine man if not spoiled by petting replied her mother 
 and he conceited is he asked amy 
 not in the least that is why he is so charming and we all like him so much i see nice to have accomplishments and be elegant but not to show off or get perked up said amy thoughtfully 
 these things are always seen and felt in a manner and conversations if modestly used but it is not necessary to display them said mrs march 
 any more than proper to wear all your bonnets and gowns and ribbons at once that folks may know got them added jo and the lecture ended in a laugh

 chapter 
 
 the sounding of the call 
 
 
 when buck earned sixteen hundred dollars in five minutes for john thornton he made it possible for his master to pay off certain debts and to journey with his partners into the east after a fabled lost mine the history of which was as old as the history of the country many men had sought it few had found it and more than a few there were who had never returned from the quest this lost mine was steeped in tragedy and shrouded in mystery no one knew of the first man the oldest tradition stopped before it got back to him from the beginning there had been an ancient and ramshackle cabin dying men had sworn to it and to the mine the site of which it marked clinching their testimony with nuggets that were unlike any known grade of gold in the northland 
 but no living man had looted this treasure house and the dead were dead wherefore john thornton and pete and hans with buck and half a dozen other dogs faced into the east on an unknown trail to achieve where men and dogs as good as themselves had failed they sledded seventy miles up the yukon swung to the left into the stewart river passed the mayo and the mcquestion and held on until the stewart itself became a streamlet threading the upstanding peaks which marked the backbone of the continent 
 
 john thornton asked little of man or nature he was unafraid of the wild with a handful of salt and a rifle he could plunge into the wilderness and fare wherever he pleased and as long as he pleased being in no haste indian fashion he hunted his dinner in the course of the traveling and if he failed to find it like the indian he kept on traveling secure in the knowledge that sooner or later he would come to it so on this great journey into the east straight meat was the bill of fare ammunition and tools principally made up the load on the sled and the timecard was drawn upon the limitless future 
 to buck it was boundless delight this hunting fishing and indefinite wandering through strange places for weeks at a time they would hold on steadily day after day and for weeks upon end they would camp here and there the dogs loafing and the men burning holes through frozen muck and gravel and washing countless pans of dirt by the heat of the fire sometimes they went hungry sometimes they feasted riotously all according to the abundance of game and the fortune of hunting summer arrived and dogs and men packs on their backs rafted across blue mountain lakes and descended or ascended unknown rivers in slender boats whipsawed from the standing forest 
 the months came and went and back and forth they twisted through the uncharted vastness where no men were and yet where men had been if the lost cabin were true they went across divides in summer blizzards shivered under the midnight sun on naked mountains between the timber line and the eternal snows dropped into summer valleys amid swarming gnats and flies and in the shadows of glaciers picked strawberries and flowers as ripe and fair as any the southland could boast in the fall of the year they penetrated a weird lake country sad and silent where wild fowl had been but where then there was no life nor sign of the blowing of chill winds the forming of ice in sheltered places and the melancholy rippling of waves on lonely beaches 
 and through another winter they wandered on the obliterated trails of men who had gone before once they came upon a path blazed throughout the forest an ancient path and the lost cabin seemed very near but the path began nowhere and ended nowhere and remained a mystery as the man who made it and the reason he made it remained a mystery another time they chanced upon the wreckage of a hunting lodge and amid the shreds of rotted blankets john thornton found a flintlock he knew it for a hudson bay company gun of the young days in the northwest when such a gun was worth its weight in beaver skins packed flat and that was hint as to the man who in an early day had reared the lodge and left the gun among the blankets 
 spring came on once more and at the end of all their wandering they found not the lost cabin but a shallow placer in a broad valley where the gold showed like yellow butter across the bottom of the washing pan they sought no farther each day they worked earned them thousands of dollars in clean dust and nuggets and they worked every day the gold was sacked in moosehide bags fifty pounds to the bag and piled like so much firewood outside the lodge like giants they toiled days flashing on the heels of days like dreams as they heaped the treasure up 
 there was nothing for the dogs to do save the hauling of meat now and again that thornton killed and buck spent long hours musing by the fire the vision of the hairy man came to him more frequently now that there was little work to be done and often blinking by the fire buck wandered with him in that other world which he remembered 
 the salient thing of this other world seemed fear when he watched the hairy man sleeping by the fire head between his knees and hands clasped above buck saw that he slept restlessly with many starts and awakenings at which times he would peer fearfully into the darkness and fling more wood upon the fire did they walk by the beach of a sea where the hairy man gathered shellfish and ate them as he gathered it was with eyes that roved everywhere for hidden danger and with legs prepared to run like the wind at its first appearance through the forest they crept noiselessly buck at the hairy heels and they were alert and vigilant the pair of them ears twitching and moving and nostrils quivering for the man heard and smelled as keenly as buck the hairy man could spring up into the trees and travel ahead as fast as on the ground swinging by the arms from limb to limb sometimes a dozen feet apart letting go and catching never falling never missing his grip in fact he seemed as much at home among the trees as on the ground and buck had memories of nights of vigil spent beneath the trees wherein the hairy man roosted holding on tightly as he slept 
 and closely akin to the visions of the hairy man was the call still sounding in the depths of the forest it filled him with a great unrest and strange desires it caused him to feel a vague sweet gladness and he was aware of wild yearnings and stirrings for he knew not what sometimes he pursued the call into the forest looking for it as though it were a tangible thing barking softly or defiantly as the mood might dictate he would thrust his nose into the cool wood moss or into the black soil where long grasses grew and snort with joy at the fat earth smells or he would crouch for hours as if in concealment behind fungus covered trunks of fallen trees and to all that moved and sounded about him it might be lying thus that he hoped to surprise this call he could not understand but he did not know why he did these various things he was impelled to do them and did not reason about them at all 
 irresistible impulses seized him he would be lying in camp dozing lazily in the heat of the day when suddenly his head would lift and his ears cock up intent and listening and he would spring to his feet and dash away and on and on for hours through the forest aisles and across the open spaces where the niggerheads bunched he loved to run down dry watercourses and to creep and spy upon the bird life in the woods for a day at a time he would lie in the underbrush where he could watch the partridges drumming and strutting up and down but especially he loved to run in the dim twilight of the summer midnights listening to the subdued and sleepy murmurs of the forest reading signs and sounds as man may read a book and seeking for the mysterious something that waking or sleeping at all times for him to come 
 one night he sprang from sleep with a start nostrils quivering and scenting his mane bristling in recurrent waves from the forest came the call or one note of it for the call was distinct and definite as never howl like yet unlike any noise made by husky dog and he knew it in the old familiar way as a sound heard before he sprang through the sleeping camp and in swift silence dashed through the woods as he drew closer to the cry he went more slowly with caution in every movement till he came to an open place among the trees and looking out saw erect on haunches with nose pointed to the sky a long lean timber wolf 
 he had made no noise yet it ceased from its howling and tried to sense his presence buck stalked into the open body gathered compactly together tail straight and stiff feet falling with unwonted care every movement advertised commingled threatening and overture of friendliness it was the menacing truce that marks the meeting of wild beasts that prey but the wolf fled at sight of him he followed with wild leapings in a frenzy to overtake he ran him into a blind channel in the bed of the creek where a timber jam barred the way the wolf whirled about pivoting on his hind legs after the fashion of joe and of all cornered husky dogs snarling and bristling clipping his teeth together in a continuous and rapid succession of snaps 
 buck did not attack but circled him about and hedged him in with friendly advances the wolf was suspicious and afraid for buck made three of him in weight while his head barely reached shoulder watching his chance he darted away and the chase was resumed time and again he was cornered and the thing repeated though he was in poor condition or buck could not so easily have overtaken him he would run till head was even with his flank when he would whirl around at bay only to dash away again at the first opportunity 
 but in the end pertinacity was rewarded for the wolf finding that no harm was intended finally sniffed noses with him then they became friendly and played about in the nervous way with which fierce beasts belie their fierceness after some time of this the wolf started off at an easy lope in a manner that plainly showed he was going somewhere he made it clear to buck that he was to come and they ran side by side through the somber twilight straight up the creek bed into the gorge from which it issued and across the bleak divide where it took its rise 
 on the opposite slope of the watershed they came down into a level country where were great stretches of forest and many streams and through these great stretches they ran steadily hour after hour the sun rising higher and the day growing warmer buck was wildly glad he knew he was at last answering the call running by the side of his wood brother toward the place from where the call surely came old memories were coming upon him fast and he was stirring to them as of old he stirred to the realities of which they were the shadows he had done this thing before somewhere in that other and dimly remembered world and he was doing it again now running free in the open the unpacked earth underfoot the wide sky overhead 
 they stopped by a running stream to drink and stopping buck remembered john thornton he sat down the wolf started on toward the place from where the call surely came then returned to him sniffing noses and making actions as though to encourage him but buck turned about and started slowly on the back track for the better part of an hour the wild brother ran by his side whining softly then he sat down pointed his nose upward and howled it was a mournful howl and as buck held steadily on his way he heard it grow faint and fainter until it was lost in the distance 
 john thornton was eating dinner when buck dashed into camp and sprang upon him in a frenzy of affection overturning him scrambling upon him licking his face biting his the general as john thornton characterized it the while he shook buck back and forth and cursed him lovingly 
 for two days and nights buck never left camp never let thornton out of his sight he followed him about at his work watched him while he ate saw him into his blankets at night and out of them in the morning but after two days the call in the forest began to sound more imperiously than ever restlessness came back on him and he was haunted by recollections of the wild brother and of the smiling land beyond the divide and the run side by side through the wide forest stretches once again he took to wandering in the woods but the wild brother came no more and though he listened through long vigils the mournful howl was never raised 
 he began to sleep out at night staying away from camp for days at a time and once he crossed the divide at the head of the creek and went down into the land of timber and streams there he wandered for a week seeking vainly for fresh sign of the wild brother killing his meat as he traveled and traveling with the long easy lope that seems never to tire he fished for salmon in a broad stream that emptied somewhere into the sea and by this stream he killed a large black bear blinded by the mosquitoes while likewise fishing and raging through the forest helpless and terrible even so it was a hard fight and it aroused the last latent remnants of ferocity and two days later when he returned to his kill and found a dozen wolverines quarreling over the spoil he scattered them like chaff and those that fled left two behind who would quarrel no more 
 the became stronger than ever before he was a killer a thing that preyed living on the things that lived unaided alone by virtue of his own strength and prowess surviving triumphantly in a hostile environment where only the strong survived because of all this he became possessed of a great pride in himself which communicated itself like a contagion to his physical being it advertised itself in all his movements was apparent in the play of every muscle spoke plainly as speech in the way he carried himself and made his glorious furry coat if anything more glorious but for the stray brown on his muzzle and above his eyes and for the splash of white hair that ran midmost down his chest he might well have been mistaken for a gigantic wolf larger than the largest of the breed from his st bernard father he had inherited size and weight but it was his shepherd mother who had given shape to that size and weight his muzzle was the long wolf muzzle save that it was larger than the muzzle of any wolf and his head somewhat broader was the wolf head on a massive scale 
 his cunning was wolf cunning and wild cunning his intelligence shepherd intelligence and st bernard intelligence and all this plus an experience gained in the fiercest of schools made him as formidable a creature as any that roamed the wild a carnivorous animal living on a straight meat diet he was in full flower at the high tide of his life with vigor and virility when thornton passed a caressing hand along his back a snapping and crackling followed the hand each hair discharging its pent magnetism at the contact every part brain and body nerve tissue and fiber was keyed to the most exquisite pitch and between all the parts there was a perfect equilibrium or adjustment to sights and sounds and events which required action he responded with rapidity quickly as a husky dog could leap to defend from attack or to attack he could leap twice as quickly he saw the movement or heard sound and responded in less time than another dog required to compass the mere seeing or hearing he perceived and determined and responded in the same instant in point of fact the three actions of perceiving determining and responding were sequential but so infinitesimal were the intervals of time between them that they appeared simultaneous his muscles were surcharged with vitality and snapped into play sharply like steel springs life streamed through him in splendid flood glad and rampant until it seemed that it would burst him asunder in sheer ecstasy and put forth generously over the world 
 never was there such a dog said john thornton one day as the partners watched buck marching out of camp 
 when he was made the mold was broke said pete 
 py jingo i think so mineself hans affirmed 
 they saw him marching out of camp but they did not see the instant and terrible transformation which took place as soon as he was within the secrecy of the forest he no longer marched at once he became a thing of the wild stealing along softly a passing shadow that appeared and disappeared among the shadows he knew how to take advantage of every cover to crawl on his belly like a snake and like a snake to leap and strike he could take a ptarmigan from its nest kill a rabbit as it slept and snap in the little chipmunks fleeing a second too late for the trees fish in open pools were not too quick for him nor were beaver mending their dams too wary he killed to eat not from wantonness but he preferred to eat what he killed himself so a lurking humor ran through his deeds and it was his delight to steal upon the squirrels and when he all but had them to let them go chattering in mortal fear to the 
 as the fall of the year came on the moose appeared in greater abundance moving slowly down to meet the winter in the lower and less rigorous valleys buck had already dragged down a stray calf but he wished strongly for larger and more formidable quarry and he came upon it one day on the divide at the head of the creek a band of twenty moose had crossed over from the land of streams and timber and chief among them was a great bull he was in a savage temper and standing over six feet from the ground was as formidable an antagonist as even buck could desire back and forth the bull tossed his great palmated antlers branching to fourteen points and embracing seven feet with the tips his small eyes burned with a vicious and bitter light while he roared with fury at sight of buck 
 from the side just forward of the flank protruded a feathered which accounted for his savageness guided by that instinct which came from the old hunting days of the primordial world buck proceeded to cut the bull out from the herd it was no slight task he would bark and dance about in front of the bull just out of reach of the great antlers and of the terrible splay hoofs which could have stamped his life out with a single blow unable to turn his back on the fanged danger and go on the bull would be driven into paroxysms of rage at such moments he charged buck who retreated craftily luring him on by a simulated inability to escape but when he was thus separated from his fellows two or three of the younger bulls would charge back upon buck and enable the wounded bull to rejoin the herd 
 there is a patience of the tireless persistent as life holds motionless for endless hours the spider in its web the snake in its coils the panther in its ambuscade this patience belongs peculiarly to life when it hunts its living food and it belonged to buck as he clung to the flank of the herd retarding its march irritating the young bulls worrying the cows with their calves and driving the wounded bull mad with helpless rage for half a day this continued buck multiplied himself attacking from all sides enveloping the herd in a whirlwind of menace cutting out his victim as fast as it could rejoin its mates wearing out the patience of creatures preyed upon which is a lesser patience than that of creatures preying 
 as the day wore along and the sun dropped to its bed in the northwest the darkness had come back and the fall nights were six hours long the young bulls retraced their steps more and more reluctantly to the aid of their beset leader the winter was hurrying them on to the lower levels and it seemed they could never shake off this tireless creature that held them back besides it was not the life of the herd or of the young bulls that was threatened the life of only one member was demanded which was a remoter interest than their lives and in the end they were content to pay the toll 
 as twilight fell the old bull stood with lowered head watching his cows he had known the calves he had fathered the bulls he had they shambled on at a rapid pace through the fading light he could not follow for before his nose leaped the merciless fanged terror that would not let him go three hundred weight more than half a ton he weighed he had lived a long strong life full of fight and struggle and at the end he faced death at the teeth of a creature whose head did not reach beyond his great knuckled knees 
 from then on night and day buck never left his prey never gave it a rest never permitted it to browse the leaves of trees or the shoots of young birch and willow nor did he give the wounded bull opportunity to slake his burning thirst in the slender trickling streams they crossed often in desperation he burst into long stretches of flight at such time buck did not attempt to stay him but loped easily at his heels satisfied with the way the game was played lying down when the moose stood still attacking him fiercely when he strove to eat or drink 
 the great head drooped more and more under its tree of horns and the shambling trot grew weaker and weaker he took to standing for long periods with nose to the ground and dejected ears dropped limply and buck found more time in which to get water for himself and in which to rest at such moments panting with red lolling tongue and with eyes fixed upon the big bull it appeared to buck that a change was coming over the face of things he could feel a new stir in the land as the moose were coming into the land other kinds of life were coming in forest and stream and air seemed palpitant with their presence the news of it was borne in upon him not by sight or sound or smell but by some other and subtler sense he heard nothing saw nothing yet knew that the land was somehow different that through it strange things were afoot and ranging and he resolved to investigate after he had finished the business in hand 
 at last at the end of the fourth day he pulled the great moose down for a day and a night he remained by the kill eating and sleeping turn and turn about then rested refreshed and strong he turned his face toward camp and john thornton he broke into the long easy lope and went on hour after hour never at loss for the tangled way heading straight home through strange country with a certitude of direction that put man and his magnetic needle to shame 
 as he held on he became more and more conscious of the new stir in the land there was life abroad in it different from the life which had been there throughout the summer no longer was this fact borne in upon him in some subtle mysterious way the birds talked of it the squirrels chattered about it the very breeze whispered of it several times he stopped and drew in the fresh morning air in great sniffs reading a message which made him leap on with greater speed he was oppressed with a sense of calamity happening if it were not calamity already happened and as he crossed the last watershed and dropped down into the valley toward camp he proceeded with greater caution 
 three miles away he came upon a fresh trail that sent his neck hair rippling and bristling it led straight toward camp and john thornton buck hurried on swiftly and stealthily every nerve straining and tense alert to the multitudinous details which told a but the end his nose gave him a varying description of the passage of the life on the heels of which he was traveling he remarked the pregnant silence of the forest the bird life had flitted the squirrels were in hiding one only he sleek gray fellow flattened against a gray dead limb so that he seemed a part of it a woody excrescence upon the wood itself 
 as buck slid along with the obscureness of a gliding shadow his nose was jerked suddenly to the side as though a positive force had gripped and pulled it he followed the new scent into a thicket and found nig he was lying on his side dead where he had dragged himself an arrow protruding head and feathers from either side of his body 
 a hundred yards farther on buck came upon one of the sled dogs thornton had bought in dawson this dog was thrashing about in a directly on the trail and buck passed around him without stopping from the camp came the faint sound of many voices rising and falling in a chant bellying forward to the edge of the clearing he found hans lying on his face feathered with arrows like a porcupine at the same instant buck peered out where the lodge had been and saw what made his hair leap straight up on his neck and shoulders a gust of overpowering rage swept over him he did not know that he growled but he growled aloud with a terrible ferocity for the last time in his life he allowed passion to usurp cunning and reason and it was because of his great love for john thornton that he lost his head 
 the yeehats were dancing about the wreckage of the lodge when they heard a fearful roaring and saw rushing upon them an animal the like of which they had never seen before it was buck a live hurricane of fury hurling himself upon them in a frenzy to destroy he sprang at the foremost was the chief of the the throat wide open till the rent jugular spouted a fountain of blood he did not pause to worry the victim but ripped in passing with the next bound tearing wide the throat of a second man there was no withstanding him he plunged about in their very midst tearing rending destroying in constant and terrific motion which defied the arrows they discharged at him in fact so inconceivably rapid were his movements and so closely were the indians tangled together that they shot one another with the arrows and one young hunter hurling a spear at buck in drove it through the chest of another hunter with such force that the point broke through the skin of the back and stood out beyond then a panic seized the yeehats and they fled in terror to the woods proclaiming as they fled the advent of the evil spirit 
 and truly buck was the fiend incarnate raging at their heels and dragging them down like deer as they raced through the trees it was a fateful day for the yeehats they scattered far and wide over the country and it was not till a week later that the last of the survivors gathered together in a lower valley and counted their losses as for buck wearying of the pursuit he returned to the desolated camp he found pete where he had been killed in his blankets in the first moment of surprise desperate struggle was on the earth and buck scented every detail of it down to the edge of a deep pool by the edge head and fore feet in the water lay skeet faithful to the last the pool itself muddy and discolored from the sluice boxes effectually hid what it contained and it contained john thornton for buck followed his trace into the water from which no trace led away 
 all day buck brooded by the pool or roamed restlessly about the camp death as a cessation of movement as a passing out and away from the lives of the living he knew and he knew john thornton was dead it left a great void in him somewhat akin to hunger but a void which ached and ached and which food could not fill at times when he paused to contemplate the carcasses of the yeehats he forgot the pain of it and at such times he was aware of a great pride in pride greater than any he had yet experienced he had killed man the noblest game of all and he had killed in the face of the law of club and fang he sniffed the bodies curiously they had died so easily it was harder to kill a husky dog than them they were no match at all were it not for their arrows and spears and clubs thenceforward he would be unafraid of them except when they bore in their hands their arrows spears and clubs 
 night came on and a full moon rose high over the trees into the sky lighting the land till it lay bathed in ghostly day and with the coming of the night brooding and mourning by the pool buck came alive to a stirring of the new life in the forest other than that which the yeehats had made he stood up listening and scenting from far away drifted a faint sharp yelp followed by a chorus of similar sharp yelps as the moments passed the yelps grew closer and louder again buck knew them as things heard in that other world which persisted in his memory he walked to the center of the open space and listened it was the call the call sounding more luringly and compelling than ever before and as never before he was ready to obey john thornton was dead the last tie was broken man and the claims of man no longer bound him 
 hunting their living meat as the yeehats were hunting it on the flanks of the migrating moose the wolf pack had at last crossed over from the land of streams and timber and invaded valley into the clearing where the moonlight streamed they poured in a silvery flood and in the center of the clearing stood buck motionless as a statue waiting their coming they were awed so still and large he stood and a pause fell till the boldest one leaped straight for him like a flash buck struck breaking the neck then he stood without movement as before the stricken wolf rolling in agony behind him three others tried it in sharp succession and one after the other they drew back streaming blood from slashed throats or shoulders 
 this was sufficient to fling the whole pack forward pellmell crowded together blocked and confused by its eagerness to pull down the prey marvelous quickness and agility stood him in good stead pivoting on his hind legs and snapping and gashing he was everywhere at once presenting a front which was apparently unbroken so swiftly did he whirl and guard from side to side but to prevent them from getting behind him he was forced back down past the pool and into the creek bed till he brought up against a high gravel bank he worked along to a right angle in the bank which the men had made in the course of mining and in this angle he came to bay protected on three sides and with nothing to do but face the front 
 and so well did he face it that at the end of half an hour the wolves drew back discomfited the tongues of all were out and lolling the white fangs showing cruelly white in the moonlight some were lying down with heads raised and ears pricked forward others stood on their feet watching him and still others were lapping water from the pool one wolf long and lean and gray advanced cautiously in a friendly manner and buck recognized the wild brother with whom he had run for a night and a day he was whining softly and as buck whined they touched noses 
 then an old wolf gaunt and came forward buck writhed his lips into the preliminary of a snarl but sniffed noses with him whereupon the old wolf sat down pointed nose at the moon and broke out the long wolf howl the others sat down and howled and now the call came to buck in unmistakable accents he too sat down and howled this over he came out of his angle and the pack crowded around him sniffing in manner the leaders lifted the yelp of the pack and sprang away into the woods the wolves swung in behind yelping in chorus and buck ran with them side by side with the wild brother yelping as he ran 
 and here may well end the story of buck the years were not many when the yeehats noted a change in the breed of timber wolves for some were seen with splashes of brown on head and muzzle and with a rift of white centering down the chest but more remarkable than this the yeehats tell of a ghost dog that runs at the head of the pack they are afraid of this ghost dog for it has cunning greater than they stealing from their camps in the fierce winters robbing their traps slaying their dogs and defying their bravest hunters 
 nay the tale grows worse hunters there are who fail to return to the camp and hunters there have been whom their tribesmen found with throats slashed cruelly open and with wolf prints about them in the snow greater than the prints of any wolf each fall when the yeehats follow the movement of the moose there is a certain valley which they never enter and women there are who become sad when the word goes over the fire of how the evil spirit came to select that valley for an 
 in the summers there is one visitor however to that valley of which the yeehats do not know it is a great gloriously coated wolf like and yet unlike all other wolves he crosses alone from the smiling timber land and comes down into an open space among the trees here a yellow stream flows from rotted sacks and sinks into the ground with long grasses growing through it and vegetable mold overrunning it and hiding its yellow from the sun and here he muses for a time howling once long and mournfully ere he departs 
 but he is not always alone when the long winter nights come on and the wolves follow their meat into the lower valleys he may be seen running at the head of the pack through the pale moonlight or glimmering borealis leaping gigantic above his fellows his great throat as he sings a song of the younger world which is the song of the pack

 the sounding of the call 
 
 
 when buck earned sixteen hundred dollars in five minutes for john thornton he made it possible for his master to pay off certain debts and to journey with his partners into the east after a fabled lost mine the history of which was as old as the history of the country many men had sought it few had found it and more than a few there were who had never returned from the quest this lost mine was steeped in tragedy and shrouded in mystery no one knew of the first man the oldest tradition stopped before it got back to him from the beginning there had been an ancient and ramshackle cabin dying men had sworn to it and to the mine the site of which it marked clinching their testimony with nuggets that were unlike any known grade of gold in the northland 
 but no living man had looted this treasure house and the dead were dead wherefore john thornton and pete and hans with buck and half a dozen other dogs faced into the east on an unknown trail to achieve where men and dogs as good as themselves had failed they sledded seventy miles up the yukon swung to the left into the stewart river passed the mayo and the mcquestion and held on until the stewart itself became a streamlet threading the upstanding peaks which marked the backbone of the continent 
 
 john thornton asked little of man or nature he was unafraid of the wild with a handful of salt and a rifle he could plunge into the wilderness and fare wherever he pleased and as long as he pleased being in no haste indian fashion he hunted his dinner in the course of the traveling and if he failed to find it like the indian he kept on traveling secure in the knowledge that sooner or later he would come to it so on this great journey into the east straight meat was the bill of fare ammunition and tools principally made up the load on the sled and the timecard was drawn upon the limitless future 
 to buck it was boundless delight this hunting fishing and indefinite wandering through strange places for weeks at a time they would hold on steadily day after day and for weeks upon end they would camp here and there the dogs loafing and the men burning holes through frozen muck and gravel and washing countless pans of dirt by the heat of the fire sometimes they went hungry sometimes they feasted riotously all according to the abundance of game and the fortune of hunting summer arrived and dogs and men packs on their backs rafted across blue mountain lakes and descended or ascended unknown rivers in slender boats whipsawed from the standing forest 
 the months came and went and back and forth they twisted through the uncharted vastness where no men were and yet where men had been if the lost cabin were true they went across divides in summer blizzards shivered under the midnight sun on naked mountains between the timber line and the eternal snows dropped into summer valleys amid swarming gnats and flies and in the shadows of glaciers picked strawberries and flowers as ripe and fair as any the southland could boast in the fall of the year they penetrated a weird lake country sad and silent where wild fowl had been but where then there was no life nor sign of the blowing of chill winds the forming of ice in sheltered places and the melancholy rippling of waves on lonely beaches 
 and through another winter they wandered on the obliterated trails of men who had gone before once they came upon a path blazed throughout the forest an ancient path and the lost cabin seemed very near but the path began nowhere and ended nowhere and remained a mystery as the man who made it and the reason he made it remained a mystery another time they chanced upon the wreckage of a hunting lodge and amid the shreds of rotted blankets john thornton found a flintlock he knew it for a hudson bay company gun of the young days in the northwest when such a gun was worth its weight in beaver skins packed flat and that was hint as to the man who in an early day had reared the lodge and left the gun among the blankets 
 spring came on once more and at the end of all their wandering they found not the lost cabin but a shallow placer in a broad valley where the gold showed like yellow butter across the bottom of the washing pan they sought no farther each day they worked earned them thousands of dollars in clean dust and nuggets and they worked every day the gold was sacked in moosehide bags fifty pounds to the bag and piled like so much firewood outside the lodge like giants they toiled days flashing on the heels of days like dreams as they heaped the treasure up 
 there was nothing for the dogs to do save the hauling of meat now and again that thornton killed and buck spent long hours musing by the fire the vision of the hairy man came to him more frequently now that there was little work to be done and often blinking by the fire buck wandered with him in that other world which he remembered 
 the salient thing of this other world seemed fear when he watched the hairy man sleeping by the fire head between his knees and hands clasped above buck saw that he slept restlessly with many starts and awakenings at which times he would peer fearfully into the darkness and fling more wood upon the fire did they walk by the beach of a sea where the hairy man gathered shellfish and ate them as he gathered it was with eyes that roved everywhere for hidden danger and with legs prepared to run like the wind at its first appearance through the forest they crept noiselessly buck at the hairy heels and they were alert and vigilant the pair of them ears twitching and moving and nostrils quivering for the man heard and smelled as keenly as buck the hairy man could spring up into the trees and travel ahead as fast as on the ground swinging by the arms from limb to limb sometimes a dozen feet apart letting go and catching never falling never missing his grip in fact he seemed as much at home among the trees as on the ground and buck had memories of nights of vigil spent beneath the trees wherein the hairy man roosted holding on tightly as he slept 
 and closely akin to the visions of the hairy man was the call still sounding in the depths of the forest it filled him with a great unrest and strange desires it caused him to feel a vague sweet gladness and he was aware of wild yearnings and stirrings for he knew not what sometimes he pursued the call into the forest looking for it as though it were a tangible thing barking softly or defiantly as the mood might dictate he would thrust his nose into the cool wood moss or into the black soil where long grasses grew and snort with joy at the fat earth smells or he would crouch for hours as if in concealment behind fungus covered trunks of fallen trees and to all that moved and sounded about him it might be lying thus that he hoped to surprise this call he could not understand but he did not know why he did these various things he was impelled to do them and did not reason about them at all 
 irresistible impulses seized him he would be lying in camp dozing lazily in the heat of the day when suddenly his head would lift and his ears cock up intent and listening and he would spring to his feet and dash away and on and on for hours through the forest aisles and across the open spaces where the niggerheads bunched he loved to run down dry watercourses and to creep and spy upon the bird life in the woods for a day at a time he would lie in the underbrush where he could watch the partridges drumming and strutting up and down but especially he loved to run in the dim twilight of the summer midnights listening to the subdued and sleepy murmurs of the forest reading signs and sounds as man may read a book and seeking for the mysterious something that waking or sleeping at all times for him to come 
 one night he sprang from sleep with a start nostrils quivering and scenting his mane bristling in recurrent waves from the forest came the call or one note of it for the call was distinct and definite as never howl like yet unlike any noise made by husky dog and he knew it in the old familiar way as a sound heard before he sprang through the sleeping camp and in swift silence dashed through the woods as he drew closer to the cry he went more slowly with caution in every movement till he came to an open place among the trees and looking out saw erect on haunches with nose pointed to the sky a long lean timber wolf 
 he had made no noise yet it ceased from its howling and tried to sense his presence buck stalked into the open body gathered compactly together tail straight and stiff feet falling with unwonted care every movement advertised commingled threatening and overture of friendliness it was the menacing truce that marks the meeting of wild beasts that prey but the wolf fled at sight of him he followed with wild leapings in a frenzy to overtake he ran him into a blind channel in the bed of the creek where a timber jam barred the way the wolf whirled about pivoting on his hind legs after the fashion of joe and of all cornered husky dogs snarling and bristling clipping his teeth together in a continuous and rapid succession of snaps 
 buck did not attack but circled him about and hedged him in with friendly advances the wolf was suspicious and afraid for buck made three of him in weight while his head barely reached shoulder watching his chance he darted away and the chase was resumed time and again he was cornered and the thing repeated though he was in poor condition or buck could not so easily have overtaken him he would run till head was even with his flank when he would whirl around at bay only to dash away again at the first opportunity 
 but in the end pertinacity was rewarded for the wolf finding that no harm was intended finally sniffed noses with him then they became friendly and played about in the nervous way with which fierce beasts belie their fierceness after some time of this the wolf started off at an easy lope in a manner that plainly showed he was going somewhere he made it clear to buck that he was to come and they ran side by side through the somber twilight straight up the creek bed into the gorge from which it issued and across the bleak divide where it took its rise 
 on the opposite slope of the watershed they came down into a level country where were great stretches of forest and many streams and through these great stretches they ran steadily hour after hour the sun rising higher and the day growing warmer buck was wildly glad he knew he was at last answering the call running by the side of his wood brother toward the place from where the call surely came old memories were coming upon him fast and he was stirring to them as of old he stirred to the realities of which they were the shadows he had done this thing before somewhere in that other and dimly remembered world and he was doing it again now running free in the open the unpacked earth underfoot the wide sky overhead 
 they stopped by a running stream to drink and stopping buck remembered john thornton he sat down the wolf started on toward the place from where the call surely came then returned to him sniffing noses and making actions as though to encourage him but buck turned about and started slowly on the back track for the better part of an hour the wild brother ran by his side whining softly then he sat down pointed his nose upward and howled it was a mournful howl and as buck held steadily on his way he heard it grow faint and fainter until it was lost in the distance 
 john thornton was eating dinner when buck dashed into camp and sprang upon him in a frenzy of affection overturning him scrambling upon him licking his face biting his the general as john thornton characterized it the while he shook buck back and forth and cursed him lovingly 
 for two days and nights buck never left camp never let thornton out of his sight he followed him about at his work watched him while he ate saw him into his blankets at night and out of them in the morning but after two days the call in the forest began to sound more imperiously than ever restlessness came back on him and he was haunted by recollections of the wild brother and of the smiling land beyond the divide and the run side by side through the wide forest stretches once again he took to wandering in the woods but the wild brother came no more and though he listened through long vigils the mournful howl was never raised 
 he began to sleep out at night staying away from camp for days at a time and once he crossed the divide at the head of the creek and went down into the land of timber and streams there he wandered for a week seeking vainly for fresh sign of the wild brother killing his meat as he traveled and traveling with the long easy lope that seems never to tire he fished for salmon in a broad stream that emptied somewhere into the sea and by this stream he killed a large black bear blinded by the mosquitoes while likewise fishing and raging through the forest helpless and terrible even so it was a hard fight and it aroused the last latent remnants of ferocity and two days later when he returned to his kill and found a dozen wolverines quarreling over the spoil he scattered them like chaff and those that fled left two behind who would quarrel no more 
 the became stronger than ever before he was a killer a thing that preyed living on the things that lived unaided alone by virtue of his own strength and prowess surviving triumphantly in a hostile environment where only the strong survived because of all this he became possessed of a great pride in himself which communicated itself like a contagion to his physical being it advertised itself in all his movements was apparent in the play of every muscle spoke plainly as speech in the way he carried himself and made his glorious furry coat if anything more glorious but for the stray brown on his muzzle and above his eyes and for the splash of white hair that ran midmost down his chest he might well have been mistaken for a gigantic wolf larger than the largest of the breed from his st bernard father he had inherited size and weight but it was his shepherd mother who had given shape to that size and weight his muzzle was the long wolf muzzle save that it was larger than the muzzle of any wolf and his head somewhat broader was the wolf head on a massive scale 
 his cunning was wolf cunning and wild cunning his intelligence shepherd intelligence and st bernard intelligence and all this plus an experience gained in the fiercest of schools made him as formidable a creature as any that roamed the wild a carnivorous animal living on a straight meat diet he was in full flower at the high tide of his life with vigor and virility when thornton passed a caressing hand along his back a snapping and crackling followed the hand each hair discharging its pent magnetism at the contact every part brain and body nerve tissue and fiber was keyed to the most exquisite pitch and between all the parts there was a perfect equilibrium or adjustment to sights and sounds and events which required action he responded with rapidity quickly as a husky dog could leap to defend from attack or to attack he could leap twice as quickly he saw the movement or heard sound and responded in less time than another dog required to compass the mere seeing or hearing he perceived and determined and responded in the same instant in point of fact the three actions of perceiving determining and responding were sequential but so infinitesimal were the intervals of time between them that they appeared simultaneous his muscles were surcharged with vitality and snapped into play sharply like steel springs life streamed through him in splendid flood glad and rampant until it seemed that it would burst him asunder in sheer ecstasy and put forth generously over the world 
 never was there such a dog said john thornton one day as the partners watched buck marching out of camp 
 when he was made the mold was broke said pete 
 py jingo i think so mineself hans affirmed 
 they saw him marching out of camp but they did not see the instant and terrible transformation which took place as soon as he was within the secrecy of the forest he no longer marched at once he became a thing of the wild stealing along softly a passing shadow that appeared and disappeared among the shadows he knew how to take advantage of every cover to crawl on his belly like a snake and like a snake to leap and strike he could take a ptarmigan from its nest kill a rabbit as it slept and snap in the little chipmunks fleeing a second too late for the trees fish in open pools were not too quick for him nor were beaver mending their dams too wary he killed to eat not from wantonness but he preferred to eat what he killed himself so a lurking humor ran through his deeds and it was his delight to steal upon the squirrels and when he all but had them to let them go chattering in mortal fear to the 
 as the fall of the year came on the moose appeared in greater abundance moving slowly down to meet the winter in the lower and less rigorous valleys buck had already dragged down a stray calf but he wished strongly for larger and more formidable quarry and he came upon it one day on the divide at the head of the creek a band of twenty moose had crossed over from the land of streams and timber and chief among them was a great bull he was in a savage temper and standing over six feet from the ground was as formidable an antagonist as even buck could desire back and forth the bull tossed his great palmated antlers branching to fourteen points and embracing seven feet with the tips his small eyes burned with a vicious and bitter light while he roared with fury at sight of buck 
 from the side just forward of the flank protruded a feathered which accounted for his savageness guided by that instinct which came from the old hunting days of the primordial world buck proceeded to cut the bull out from the herd it was no slight task he would bark and dance about in front of the bull just out of reach of the great antlers and of the terrible splay hoofs which could have stamped his life out with a single blow unable to turn his back on the fanged danger and go on the bull would be driven into paroxysms of rage at such moments he charged buck who retreated craftily luring him on by a simulated inability to escape but when he was thus separated from his fellows two or three of the younger bulls would charge back upon buck and enable the wounded bull to rejoin the herd 
 there is a patience of the tireless persistent as life holds motionless for endless hours the spider in its web the snake in its coils the panther in its ambuscade this patience belongs peculiarly to life when it hunts its living food and it belonged to buck as he clung to the flank of the herd retarding its march irritating the young bulls worrying the cows with their calves and driving the wounded bull mad with helpless rage for half a day this continued buck multiplied himself attacking from all sides enveloping the herd in a whirlwind of menace cutting out his victim as fast as it could rejoin its mates wearing out the patience of creatures preyed upon which is a lesser patience than that of creatures preying 
 as the day wore along and the sun dropped to its bed in the northwest the darkness had come back and the fall nights were six hours long the young bulls retraced their steps more and more reluctantly to the aid of their beset leader the winter was hurrying them on to the lower levels and it seemed they could never shake off this tireless creature that held them back besides it was not the life of the herd or of the young bulls that was threatened the life of only one member was demanded which was a remoter interest than their lives and in the end they were content to pay the toll 
 as twilight fell the old bull stood with lowered head watching his cows he had known the calves he had fathered the bulls he had they shambled on at a rapid pace through the fading light he could not follow for before his nose leaped the merciless fanged terror that would not let him go three hundred weight more than half a ton he weighed he had lived a long strong life full of fight and struggle and at the end he faced death at the teeth of a creature whose head did not reach beyond his great knuckled knees 
 from then on night and day buck never left his prey never gave it a rest never permitted it to browse the leaves of trees or the shoots of young birch and willow nor did he give the wounded bull opportunity to slake his burning thirst in the slender trickling streams they crossed often in desperation he burst into long stretches of flight at such time buck did not attempt to stay him but loped easily at his heels satisfied with the way the game was played lying down when the moose stood still attacking him fiercely when he strove to eat or drink 
 the great head drooped more and more under its tree of horns and the shambling trot grew weaker and weaker he took to standing for long periods with nose to the ground and dejected ears dropped limply and buck found more time in which to get water for himself and in which to rest at such moments panting with red lolling tongue and with eyes fixed upon the big bull it appeared to buck that a change was coming over the face of things he could feel a new stir in the land as the moose were coming into the land other kinds of life were coming in forest and stream and air seemed palpitant with their presence the news of it was borne in upon him not by sight or sound or smell but by some other and subtler sense he heard nothing saw nothing yet knew that the land was somehow different that through it strange things were afoot and ranging and he resolved to investigate after he had finished the business in hand 
 at last at the end of the fourth day he pulled the great moose down for a day and a night he remained by the kill eating and sleeping turn and turn about then rested refreshed and strong he turned his face toward camp and john thornton he broke into the long easy lope and went on hour after hour never at loss for the tangled way heading straight home through strange country with a certitude of direction that put man and his magnetic needle to shame 
 as he held on he became more and more conscious of the new stir in the land there was life abroad in it different from the life which had been there throughout the summer no longer was this fact borne in upon him in some subtle mysterious way the birds talked of it the squirrels chattered about it the very breeze whispered of it several times he stopped and drew in the fresh morning air in great sniffs reading a message which made him leap on with greater speed he was oppressed with a sense of calamity happening if it were not calamity already happened and as he crossed the last watershed and dropped down into the valley toward camp he proceeded with greater caution 
 three miles away he came upon a fresh trail that sent his neck hair rippling and bristling it led straight toward camp and john thornton buck hurried on swiftly and stealthily every nerve straining and tense alert to the multitudinous details which told a but the end his nose gave him a varying description of the passage of the life on the heels of which he was traveling he remarked the pregnant silence of the forest the bird life had flitted the squirrels were in hiding one only he sleek gray fellow flattened against a gray dead limb so that he seemed a part of it a woody excrescence upon the wood itself 
 as buck slid along with the obscureness of a gliding shadow his nose was jerked suddenly to the side as though a positive force had gripped and pulled it he followed the new scent into a thicket and found nig he was lying on his side dead where he had dragged himself an arrow protruding head and feathers from either side of his body 
 a hundred yards farther on buck came upon one of the sled dogs thornton had bought in dawson this dog was thrashing about in a directly on the trail and buck passed around him without stopping from the camp came the faint sound of many voices rising and falling in a chant bellying forward to the edge of the clearing he found hans lying on his face feathered with arrows like a porcupine at the same instant buck peered out where the lodge had been and saw what made his hair leap straight up on his neck and shoulders a gust of overpowering rage swept over him he did not know that he growled but he growled aloud with a terrible ferocity for the last time in his life he allowed passion to usurp cunning and reason and it was because of his great love for john thornton that he lost his head 
 the yeehats were dancing about the wreckage of the lodge when they heard a fearful roaring and saw rushing upon them an animal the like of which they had never seen before it was buck a live hurricane of fury hurling himself upon them in a frenzy to destroy he sprang at the foremost was the chief of the the throat wide open till the rent jugular spouted a fountain of blood he did not pause to worry the victim but ripped in passing with the next bound tearing wide the throat of a second man there was no withstanding him he plunged about in their very midst tearing rending destroying in constant and terrific motion which defied the arrows they discharged at him in fact so inconceivably rapid were his movements and so closely were the indians tangled together that they shot one another with the arrows and one young hunter hurling a spear at buck in drove it through the chest of another hunter with such force that the point broke through the skin of the back and stood out beyond then a panic seized the yeehats and they fled in terror to the woods proclaiming as they fled the advent of the evil spirit 
 and truly buck was the fiend incarnate raging at their heels and dragging them down like deer as they raced through the trees it was a fateful day for the yeehats they scattered far and wide over the country and it was not till a week later that the last of the survivors gathered together in a lower valley and counted their losses as for buck wearying of the pursuit he returned to the desolated camp he found pete where he had been killed in his blankets in the first moment of surprise desperate struggle was on the earth and buck scented every detail of it down to the edge of a deep pool by the edge head and fore feet in the water lay skeet faithful to the last the pool itself muddy and discolored from the sluice boxes effectually hid what it contained and it contained john thornton for buck followed his trace into the water from which no trace led away 
 all day buck brooded by the pool or roamed restlessly about the camp death as a cessation of movement as a passing out and away from the lives of the living he knew and he knew john thornton was dead it left a great void in him somewhat akin to hunger but a void which ached and ached and which food could not fill at times when he paused to contemplate the carcasses of the yeehats he forgot the pain of it and at such times he was aware of a great pride in pride greater than any he had yet experienced he had killed man the noblest game of all and he had killed in the face of the law of club and fang he sniffed the bodies curiously they had died so easily it was harder to kill a husky dog than them they were no match at all were it not for their arrows and spears and clubs thenceforward he would be unafraid of them except when they bore in their hands their arrows spears and clubs 
 night came on and a full moon rose high over the trees into the sky lighting the land till it lay bathed in ghostly day and with the coming of the night brooding and mourning by the pool buck came alive to a stirring of the new life in the forest other than that which the yeehats had made he stood up listening and scenting from far away drifted a faint sharp yelp followed by a chorus of similar sharp yelps as the moments passed the yelps grew closer and louder again buck knew them as things heard in that other world which persisted in his memory he walked to the center of the open space and listened it was the call the call sounding more luringly and compelling than ever before and as never before he was ready to obey john thornton was dead the last tie was broken man and the claims of man no longer bound him 
 hunting their living meat as the yeehats were hunting it on the flanks of the migrating moose the wolf pack had at last crossed over from the land of streams and timber and invaded valley into the clearing where the moonlight streamed they poured in a silvery flood and in the center of the clearing stood buck motionless as a statue waiting their coming they were awed so still and large he stood and a pause fell till the boldest one leaped straight for him like a flash buck struck breaking the neck then he stood without movement as before the stricken wolf rolling in agony behind him three others tried it in sharp succession and one after the other they drew back streaming blood from slashed throats or shoulders 
 this was sufficient to fling the whole pack forward pellmell crowded together blocked and confused by its eagerness to pull down the prey marvelous quickness and agility stood him in good stead pivoting on his hind legs and snapping and gashing he was everywhere at once presenting a front which was apparently unbroken so swiftly did he whirl and guard from side to side but to prevent them from getting behind him he was forced back down past the pool and into the creek bed till he brought up against a high gravel bank he worked along to a right angle in the bank which the men had made in the course of mining and in this angle he came to bay protected on three sides and with nothing to do but face the front 
 and so well did he face it that at the end of half an hour the wolves drew back discomfited the tongues of all were out and lolling the white fangs showing cruelly white in the moonlight some were lying down with heads raised and ears pricked forward others stood on their feet watching him and still others were lapping water from the pool one wolf long and lean and gray advanced cautiously in a friendly manner and buck recognized the wild brother with whom he had run for a night and a day he was whining softly and as buck whined they touched noses 
 then an old wolf gaunt and came forward buck writhed his lips into the preliminary of a snarl but sniffed noses with him whereupon the old wolf sat down pointed nose at the moon and broke out the long wolf howl the others sat down and howled and now the call came to buck in unmistakable accents he too sat down and howled this over he came out of his angle and the pack crowded around him sniffing in manner the leaders lifted the yelp of the pack and sprang away into the woods the wolves swung in behind yelping in chorus and buck ran with them side by side with the wild brother yelping as he ran 
 and here may well end the story of buck the years were not many when the yeehats noted a change in the breed of timber wolves for some were seen with splashes of brown on head and muzzle and with a rift of white centering down the chest but more remarkable than this the yeehats tell of a ghost dog that runs at the head of the pack they are afraid of this ghost dog for it has cunning greater than they stealing from their camps in the fierce winters robbing their traps slaying their dogs and defying their bravest hunters 
 nay the tale grows worse hunters there are who fail to return to the camp and hunters there have been whom their tribesmen found with throats slashed cruelly open and with wolf prints about them in the snow greater than the prints of any wolf each fall when the yeehats follow the movement of the moose there is a certain valley which they never enter and women there are who become sad when the word goes over the fire of how the evil spirit came to select that valley for an 
 in the summers there is one visitor however to that valley of which the yeehats do not know it is a great gloriously coated wolf like and yet unlike all other wolves he crosses alone from the smiling timber land and comes down into an open space among the trees here a yellow stream flows from rotted sacks and sinks into the ground with long grasses growing through it and vegetable mold overrunning it and hiding its yellow from the sun and here he muses for a time howling once long and mournfully ere he departs 
 but he is not always alone when the long winter nights come on and the wolves follow their meat into the lower valleys he may be seen running at the head of the pack through the pale moonlight or glimmering borealis leaping gigantic above his fellows his great throat as he sings a song of the younger world which is the song of the pack

lionfish nov chapter seven mudbloods and murmurscontents prev chapter next chapter 
 harry spent a lot of time over the next few days dodging out of sight whenever he saw gilderoy lockhart coming down a corridor harder to avoid was colin creevey who seemed to have memorized schedule nothing seemed to give colin a bigger thrill than to say all right harry six or seven times a day and hear hello colin back however exasperated harry sounded when he said it 
 
 hedwig was still angry with harry about the disastrous car journey and wand was still malfunctioning surpassing itself on friday morning by shooting out of hand in charms and hitting tiny old professor flitwick squarely between the eyes creating a large throbbing green boil where it had struck so with one thing and another harry was quite glad to reach the weekend he ron and hermione were planning to visit hagrid on saturday morning harry however was shaken awake several hours earlier than he would have liked by oliver wood captain of the gryffindor quidditch team 
 
 whassamatter said harry groggily 
 
 quidditch practice said wood come on 
 
 harry squinted at the window there was a thin mist hanging across the sky now that he was awake he understand how he could have slept through the racket the birds were making 
 
 oliver harry croaked the crack of dawn 
 
 exactly said wood he was a tall and burly sixth year and at the moment his eyes were gleaming with a crazed enthusiasm part of our new training program come on grab your broom and go said wood heartily none of the other teams have started training yet going to be first off the mark this year 
 
 yawning and shivering slightly harry climbed out of bed and tried to find his quidditch robes 
 
 good man said wood meet you on the field in fifteen minutes 
 
 when found his scarlet team robes and pulled on his cloak for warmth harry scribbled a note to ron explaining where gone and went down the spiral staircase to the common room his nimbus two thousand on his shoulder he had just reached the portrait hole when there was a clatter behind him and colin creevey came dashing down the spiral staircase his camera swinging madly around his neck and something clutched in his hand 
 
 i heard someone saying your name on the stairs harry look what got here had it developed i wanted to show you 
 
 harry looked bemusedly at the photograph colin was brandishing under his nose 
 
 a moving lockhart was tugging hard on an arm harry recognized as his own he was pleased to see that his photographic self was putting up a good fight and refusing to be dragged into view as harry watched lockhart gave up and slumped panting against the white edge of the picture 
 
 will you sign it said colin eagerly 
 
 no said harry flatly glancing around to check that the room was really deserted sorry colin in a hurry quidditch practice 
 
 he climbed through the portrait hole 
 
 oh wow wait for me never watched a quidditch game before 
 
 colin scrambled through the hole after him 
 
 be really boring harry said quickly but colin ignored him his face shining with excitement 
 
 you were the youngest house player in a hundred years you harry you said colin trotting alongside him you must be brilliant never flown is it easy is that your own broom is that the best one there is 
 
 harry know how to get rid of him it was like having an extremely talkative shadow 
 
 i really understand quidditch said colin breathlessly is it true there are four balls and two of them fly around trying to knock people off their brooms 
 
 yes said harry heavily resigned to explaining the complicated rules of quidditch called bludgers there are two beaters on each team who carry clubs to beat the bludgers away from their side fred and george weasley are the gryffindor beaters 
 
 and what are the other balls for colin asked tripping down a couple of steps because he was gazing at harry 
 
 well the quaffle the biggish red one is the one that scores goals three chasers on each team throw the quaffle to each other and try and get it through the goal posts at the end of the pitch three long poles with hoops on the end 
 
 and the fourth ball 
 
 is the golden snitch said harry and very small very fast and difficult to catch but what the got to do because a game of quidditch end until the snitch has been caught and whichever seeker gets the snitch earns his team an extra hundred and fifty points 
 
 and the gryffindor seeker you said colin in awe 
 
 yes said harry as they left the castle and started across the grass and the keeper too he guards the goal posts it really 
 
 but colin stop questioning harry all the way down the sloping lawns to the quidditch field and harry only shook him off when he reached the changing rooms colin called after him in a piping voice go and get a good seat harry and hurried off to the stands 
 
 the rest of the gryffindor team were already in the changing room wood was the only person who looked truly awake fred and george weasley were sitting and touslehaired next to fourth year alicia spinnet who seemed to be nodding off against the wall behind her her fellow chasers katie bell and angelina johnson were yawning side by side opposite them 
 
 there you are harry what kept you said wood briskly now i wanted a quick talk with you all before we actually get onto the field because i spent the summer devising a whole new training program which i really think will make all the difference 
 
 wood was holding up a large diagram of a quidditch field on which were drawn many lines arrows and crosses in different colored inks he took out his wand tapped the board and the arrows began to wiggle over the diagram like caterpillars as wood launched into a speech about his new tactics fred head drooped right onto alicia shoulder and he began to snore 
 
 the first board took nearly twenty minutes to explain but there was another board under that and a third under that one harry sank into a stupor as wood droned on and on 
 
 so said wood at long last jerking harry from a wistful fantasy about what he could be eating for breakfast at this very moment up at the castle is that clear any questions 
 
 got a question oliver said george who had woken with a start why you have told us all this yesterday when we were awake 
 
 wood pleased 
 
 now listen here you lot he said glowering at them all we should have won the quidditch cup last year easily the best team but unfortunately owing to circumstances beyond our control 
 
 harry shifted guiltily in his seat he had been unconscious in the hospital wing for the final match of the previous year meaning that gryffindor had been a player short and had suffered their worst defeat in three hundred years 
 
 wood took a moment to regain control of himself their last defeat was clearly still torturing him 
 
 so this year we train harder than ever before okay go and put our new theories into practice wood shouted seizing his broomstick and leading the way out of the locker rooms and still yawning his team followed 
 
 they had been in the locker room so long that the sun was up completely now although remnants of mist hung over the grass in the stadium as harry walked onto the field he saw ron and hermione sitting in the stands 
 
 you finished yet called ron incredulously 
 
 even started said harry looking jealously at the toast and marmalade ron and hermione had brought out of the great hall been teaching us new moves 
 
 he mounted his broomstick and kicked at the ground soaring up into the air the cool morning air whipped his face waking him far more effectively than long talk it felt wonderful to be back on the quidditch field he soared right around the stadium at full speed racing fred and george 
 
 that funny clicking noise called fred as they hurtled around the corner 
 
 harry looked into the stands colin was sitting in one of the highest seats his camera raised taking picture after picture the sound strangely magnified in the deserted stadium 
 
 look this way harry this way he cried shrilly 
 
 that said fred 
 
 no idea harry lied putting on a spurt of speed that took him as far away as possible from colin 
 
 going on said wood frowning as he skimmed through the air toward them that first year taking pictures i like it he could be a slytherin spy trying to find out about our new training program 
 
 in gryffindor said harry quickly 
 
 and the slytherins need a spy oliver said george 
 
 what makes you say that said wood testily 
 
 because here in person said george pointing 
 
 several people in green robes were walking onto the field broomsticks in their hands 
 
 i believe it wood hissed in outrage i booked the field for today see about this 
 
 wood shot toward the ground landing rather harder than he meant to in his anger staggering slightly as he dismounted harry fred and george followed 
 
 flint wood bellowed at the slytherin captain this is our practice time we got up specially you can clear off now 
 
 marcus flint was even larger than wood he had a look of trollish cunning on his face as he replied plenty of room for all of us wood 
 
 angelina alicia and katie had come over too there were no girls on the slytherin team who stood shoulder to shoulder facing the gryffindors leering to a man 
 
 but i booked the field said wood positively spitting with rage i booked it 
 
 ah said flint but got a specially signed note here from professor snape i professor s snape give the slytherin team permission to practice today on the quidditch field owing to the need to train their new seeker 
 
 got a new seeker said wood distracted where 
 
 and from behind the six large figures before them came a seventh smaller boy smirking all over his pale pointed face it was draco malfoy 
 
 you lucius son said fred looking at malfoy with dislike 
 
 funny you should mention father said flint as the whole slytherin team smiled still more broadly let me show you the generous gift made to the slytherin team 
 
 all seven of them held out their broomsticks seven highly polished handles and seven sets of fine gold lettering spelling the words nimbus two thousand and one gleamed under the in the early morning sun 
 
 very latest model only came out last month said flint carelessly flicking a speck of dust from the end of his own i believe it outstrips the old two thousand series by a considerable amount as for the old cleansweeps he smiled nastily at fred and george who were both clutching cleansweep fives sweeps the board with them 
 
 none of the gryffindor team could think of anything to say for a moment malfoy was smirking so broadly his cold eyes were reduced to slits 
 
 oh look said flint a field invasion 
 
 ron and hermione were crossing the grass to see what was going on 
 
 happening ron asked harry why you playing and he doing here 
 
 he was looking at malfoy taking in his slytherin quidditch robes 
 
 the new slytherin seeker weasley said malfoy smugly just been admiring the brooms my bought our team 
 
 ron gaped at the seven superb broomsticks in front of him 
 
 good they said malfoy smoothly but perhaps the gryffindor team will be able to raise some gold and get new brooms too you could raffle off those cleansweep fives i expect a museum would bid for them 
 
 the slytherin team howled with laughter 
 
 at least no one on the gryffindor team had to buy their way in said hermione sharply they got in on pure talent 
 
 the smug look on face flickered 
 
 no one asked your opinion you filthy little mudblood he spat 
 
 harry knew at once that malfoy had said something really bad because there was an instant uproar at his words flint had to dive in front of malfoy to stop fred and george jumping on him alicia shrieked how dare you and ron plunged his hand into his robes pulled out his wand yelling pay for that one malfoy and pointed it furiously under arm at malfoys face 
 
 a loud bang echoed around the stadium and a jet of green light shot out of the wrong end of wand hitting him in the stomach and sending him reeling backward onto the grass 
 
 ron ron are you all right squealed hermione 
 
 ron opened his mouth to speak but no words came out instead he gave an almighty belch and several slugs dribbled out of his mouth onto his lap 
 
 the slytherin team were paralyzed with laughter flint was doubled up hanging onto his new broomstick for support malfoy was on all fours banging the ground with his fist the gryffindors were gathered around ron who kept belching large glistening slugs nobody seemed to want to touch him 
 
 better get him to nearest said harry to hermione who nodded bravely and the pair of them pulled ron up by the arms 
 
 what happened harry what happened is he ill but you can cure him you colin had run down from his seat and was now dancing alongside them as they left the field ron gave a huge heave and more slugs dribbled down his front 
 
 oooh said colin fascinated and raising his camera can you hold him still harry 
 
 get out of the way colin said harry angrily he and hermione supported ron out of the stadium and across the grounds toward the edge of the forest 
 
 nearly there ron said hermione as the cabin came into view be all right in a minute almost there 
 
 they were within twenty feet of house when the front door opened but it hagrid who emerged gilderoy lockhart wearing robes of palest mauve today came striding out 
 
 quick behind here harry hissed dragging ron behind a nearby bush hermione followed somewhat reluctantly 
 
 a simple matter if you know what doing lockhart was saying loudly to hagrid if you need help you know where i am let you have a copy of my book surprised you already got one sign one tonight and send it over well and he strode away toward the castle 
 
 harry waited until lockhart was out of sight then pulled ron out of the bush and up to front door they knocked urgently 
 
 hagrid appeared at once looking very grumpy but his expression brightened when he saw who it was 
 
 bin come ter see me come in come in thought you mighta bin professor lockhart back again 
 
 harry and hermione supported ron over the threshold into the cabin which had an enormous bed in one corner a fire crackling merrily in the other hagrid seem perturbed by slug problem which harry hastily explained as he lowered ron into a chair 
 
 better out than in he said cheerfully plunking a large copper basin in front of him get em all up ron 
 
 i think anything to do except wait for it to stop said hermione anxiously watching ron bend over the basin a difficult curse to work at the best of times but with a broken wand 
 
 hagrid was bustling around making them tea his boarhound fang was slobbering over harry 
 
 what did lockhart want with you hagrid harry asked scratching ears 
 
 advice on out of a well growled hagrid moving a rooster off his scrubbed table and setting down the teapot like i about some banshee he banished if one word of it was true eat my kettle 
 
 it was most unlike hagrid to criticize a and harry looked at him in surprise hermione however said in a voice somewhat higher than usual i think being a bit unfair professor dumbledore obviously thought he was the best man for the job 
 
 he was the man for the job said hagrid offering them a plate of treacle fudge while ron coughed squelchily into his basin mean the one difficult ter find anyone fer the dark arts job people too keen ter take it on see think jinxed no lasted long fer a while now so tell me said hagrid jerking his head at ron who was he curse 
 
 malfoy called hermione something it been really bad because everyone went wild 
 
 it was bad said ron hoarsely emerging over the tabletop looking pale and sweaty malfoy called her 
 
 ron dived out of sight again as a fresh wave of slugs made their appearance hagrid looked outraged 
 
 he didn he growled at hermione 
 
 he did she said but i know what it means i could tell it was really rude of course 
 
 about the most insulting thing he could think of gasped ron coming back up a really foul name for someone who is you know parents there are some wizards like family who think better than everyone else because what people call he gave a small burp and a single slug fell into his outstretched hand he threw it into the basin and continued i mean the rest of us know it make any difference at all look at neville longbottom and he can hardly stand a cauldron the right way up 
 
 invented a spell our hermione said hagrid proudly making hermione go a brilliant shade of magenta 
 
 a disgusting thing to call someone said ron wiping his sweaty brow with a shaking hand dirty blood see common blood ridiculous most wizards these days are anyway if we married muggles died out 
 
 he retched and ducked out of sight again 
 
 well i yeh fer curse him ron said hagrid loudly over the thuds of more slugs hitting the basin it was a good thing yer wand backfired spect lucius malfoy come ter school if cursed his son least yer not in trouble 
 
 harry would have pointed out that trouble come much worse than having slugs pouring out of your mouth but he treacle fudge had cemented his jaws together 
 
 harry said hagrid abruptly as though struck by a sudden thought gotta bone ter pick with yeh heard bin signed photos how come i got one 
 
 furious harry wrenched his teeth apart 
 
 i have not been giving out signed photos he said hotly if still spreading that around 
 
 but then he saw that hagrid was laughing 
 
 jokin he said patting harry genially on the back and sending him face first into the table i knew yeh really i told lockhart yeh teh yer more famous than him without tryin 
 
 bet he like that said harry sitting up and rubbing his chin 
 
 he did said hagrid his eyes twinkling i told him never read one books decided ter go treacle fudge ron he added as ron reappeared 
 
 no thanks said ron weakly better not risk it 
 
 come what bin growin said hagrid as harry and hermione finished the last of their tea 
 
 in the small vegetable patch behind house were a dozen of the largest pumpkins harry had ever seen each was the size of a large boulder 
 
 well they said hagrid happily fer the halloween feast should be big enough by then 
 
 you been feeding them said harry 
 
 hagrid looked over his shoulder to check that they were alone 
 
 well bin you know a bit 
 
 harry noticed flowery pink umbrella leaning against the back wall of the cabin harry had had reason to believe before now that this umbrella was not all it looked in fact he had the strong impression that old school wand was concealed inside it hagrid supposed to use magic he had been expelled from hogwarts in his third year but harry had never found out why any mention of the matter and hagrid would clear his throat loudly and become mysteriously deaf until the subject was changed 
 
 an engorgement charm i suppose said hermione halfway between disapproval and amusement well done a good job on them 
 
 what yer little sister said said hagrid nodding at ron met her hagrid looked sideways at harry his beard twitching said she was the grounds but i reckon she was might run inter someone else at my house he winked at harry if yeh ask me she no ter a signed 
 
 oh shut up said harry ron snorted with laughter and the ground was sprayed with slugs 
 
 watch it hagrid roared pulling ron away from his precious pumpkins 
 
 it was nearly lunchtime and as harry had only had one bit of treacle fudge since dawn he was keen to go back to school to eat they said to hagrid and walked back up to the castle ron hiccoughing occasionally but only bringing up two very small slugs 
 
 they had barely set foot in the cool entrance hall when a voice rang out there you are potter weasley professor mcgonagall was walking toward them looking stern you will both do your detentions this evening 
 
 we doing professor said ron nervously suppressing a burp 
 
 you will be polishing the silver in the trophy room with mr filch said professor mcgonagall and no magic weasley elbow grease 
 
 ron gulped argus filch the caretaker was loathed by every student in the school 
 
 and you potter will be helping professor lockhart answer his fan mail said professor mcgonagall 
 
 oh n professor i go and do the trophy room too said harry desperately 
 
 certainly not said professor mcgonagall raising her eyebrows professor lockhart requested you particularly eight sharp both of you 
 
 harry and ron slouched into the great hall in states of deepest gloom hermione behind them wearing a sort of expression harry enjoy his pie as much as thought both he and ron felt got the worse deal 
 
 have me there all night said ron heavily no magic there must be about a hundred cups in that room no good at muggle cleaning 
 
 swap anytime said harry hollowly had loads of practice with the dursleys answering fan mail be a nightmare 
 
 saturday afternoon seemed to melt away and in what seemed like no time it was five minutes to eight and harry was dragging his feet along the corridor to office he gritted his teeth and knocked 
 
 the door flew open at once lockhart beamed down at him 
 
 ah the scalawag he said come in harry come in 
 
 shining brightly on the walls by the light of many candles were countless framed photographs of lockhart he had even signed a few of them another large pile lay on his desk 
 
 you can address the envelopes lockhart told harry as though this was a huge treat 
 
 this first to gladys gudgeon bless her huge fan of mine 
 
 the minutes snailed by harry let voice wash over him occasionally saying mmm and right and yeah now and then he caught a phrase like a fickle friend harry or celebrity is as celebrity does remember that 
 
 the candles burned lower and lower making the light dance over the many moving faces of lockhart watching him harry moved his aching hand over what felt like the thousandth envelope writing out veronica address it must be nearly time to leave harry thought miserably please let it be nearly time 
 
 and then he heard something something quite apart from the spitting of the dying candles and prattle about his fans 
 
 it was a voice a voice to chill the bone marrow a voice of breathtaking venom 
 
 come come to me let me rip you let me tear you let me kill you 
 
 harry gave a huge jump and a large lilac blot appeared on veronica street 
 
 what he said loudly 
 
 i know said lockhart six solid months at the top of the list broke all records 
 
 no said harry frantically that voice 
 
 sorry said lockhart looking puzzled what voice 
 
 that that voice that said you hear it 
 
 lockhart was looking at harry in high astonishment 
 
 what are you talking about harry perhaps getting a little drowsy great scott look at the time been here nearly four hours never have believed it the flown it 
 
 harry answer he was straining his ears to hear the voice again but there was no sound now except for lockhart telling him he expect a treat like this every time he got detention feeling dazed harry left 
 
 it was so late that the gryffindor common room was almost empty harry went straight up to the dormitory ron back yet harry pulled on his pajamas got into bed and waited half an hour later ron arrived nursing his right arm and bringing a strong smell of polish into the darkened room 
 
 my muscles have all seized up he groaned sinking on his bed fourteen times he made me buff up that quidditch cup before he was satisfied and then i had another slug attack all over a special award for services to the school took ages to get the slime off how was it with lockhart 
 
 keeping his voice low so as not to wake neville dean and seamus harry told ron exactly what he had heard 
 
 and lockhart said he hear it said ron harry could see him frowning in the moonlight think he was lying but i get it even someone invisible had to open the door 
 
 i know said harry lying back in his and staring at the canopy above him i get it either 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the chamber of secrets 
 

lionfish nov chapter seven mudbloods and murmurscontents prev chapter next chapter 
 harry spent a lot of time over the next few days dodging out of sight whenever he saw gilderoy lockhart coming down a corridor harder to avoid was colin creevey who seemed to have memorized schedule nothing seemed to give colin a bigger thrill than to say all right harry six or seven times a day and hear hello colin back however exasperated harry sounded when he said it 
 
 hedwig was still angry with harry about the disastrous car journey and wand was still malfunctioning surpassing itself on friday morning by shooting out of hand in charms and hitting tiny old professor flitwick squarely between the eyes creating a large throbbing green boil where it had struck so with one thing and another harry was quite glad to reach the weekend he ron and hermione were planning to visit hagrid on saturday morning harry however was shaken awake several hours earlier than he would have liked by oliver wood captain of the gryffindor quidditch team 
 
 whassamatter said harry groggily 
 
 quidditch practice said wood come on 
 
 harry squinted at the window there was a thin mist hanging across the sky now that he was awake he understand how he could have slept through the racket the birds were making 
 
 oliver harry croaked the crack of dawn 
 
 exactly said wood he was a tall and burly sixth year and at the moment his eyes were gleaming with a crazed enthusiasm part of our new training program come on grab your broom and go said wood heartily none of the other teams have started training yet going to be first off the mark this year 
 
 yawning and shivering slightly harry climbed out of bed and tried to find his quidditch robes 
 
 good man said wood meet you on the field in fifteen minutes 
 
 when found his scarlet team robes and pulled on his cloak for warmth harry scribbled a note to ron explaining where gone and went down the spiral staircase to the common room his nimbus two thousand on his shoulder he had just reached the portrait hole when there was a clatter behind him and colin creevey came dashing down the spiral staircase his camera swinging madly around his neck and something clutched in his hand 
 
 i heard someone saying your name on the stairs harry look what got here had it developed i wanted to show you 
 
 harry looked bemusedly at the photograph colin was brandishing under his nose 
 
 a moving lockhart was tugging hard on an arm harry recognized as his own he was pleased to see that his photographic self was putting up a good fight and refusing to be dragged into view as harry watched lockhart gave up and slumped panting against the white edge of the picture 
 
 will you sign it said colin eagerly 
 
 no said harry flatly glancing around to check that the room was really deserted sorry colin in a hurry quidditch practice 
 
 he climbed through the portrait hole 
 
 oh wow wait for me never watched a quidditch game before 
 
 colin scrambled through the hole after him 
 
 be really boring harry said quickly but colin ignored him his face shining with excitement 
 
 you were the youngest house player in a hundred years you harry you said colin trotting alongside him you must be brilliant never flown is it easy is that your own broom is that the best one there is 
 
 harry know how to get rid of him it was like having an extremely talkative shadow 
 
 i really understand quidditch said colin breathlessly is it true there are four balls and two of them fly around trying to knock people off their brooms 
 
 yes said harry heavily resigned to explaining the complicated rules of quidditch called bludgers there are two beaters on each team who carry clubs to beat the bludgers away from their side fred and george weasley are the gryffindor beaters 
 
 and what are the other balls for colin asked tripping down a couple of steps because he was gazing at harry 
 
 well the quaffle the biggish red one is the one that scores goals three chasers on each team throw the quaffle to each other and try and get it through the goal posts at the end of the pitch three long poles with hoops on the end 
 
 and the fourth ball 
 
 is the golden snitch said harry and very small very fast and difficult to catch but what the got to do because a game of quidditch end until the snitch has been caught and whichever seeker gets the snitch earns his team an extra hundred and fifty points 
 
 and the gryffindor seeker you said colin in awe 
 
 yes said harry as they left the castle and started across the grass and the keeper too he guards the goal posts it really 
 
 but colin stop questioning harry all the way down the sloping lawns to the quidditch field and harry only shook him off when he reached the changing rooms colin called after him in a piping voice go and get a good seat harry and hurried off to the stands 
 
 the rest of the gryffindor team were already in the changing room wood was the only person who looked truly awake fred and george weasley were sitting and touslehaired next to fourth year alicia spinnet who seemed to be nodding off against the wall behind her her fellow chasers katie bell and angelina johnson were yawning side by side opposite them 
 
 there you are harry what kept you said wood briskly now i wanted a quick talk with you all before we actually get onto the field because i spent the summer devising a whole new training program which i really think will make all the difference 
 
 wood was holding up a large diagram of a quidditch field on which were drawn many lines arrows and crosses in different colored inks he took out his wand tapped the board and the arrows began to wiggle over the diagram like caterpillars as wood launched into a speech about his new tactics fred head drooped right onto alicia shoulder and he began to snore 
 
 the first board took nearly twenty minutes to explain but there was another board under that and a third under that one harry sank into a stupor as wood droned on and on 
 
 so said wood at long last jerking harry from a wistful fantasy about what he could be eating for breakfast at this very moment up at the castle is that clear any questions 
 
 got a question oliver said george who had woken with a start why you have told us all this yesterday when we were awake 
 
 wood pleased 
 
 now listen here you lot he said glowering at them all we should have won the quidditch cup last year easily the best team but unfortunately owing to circumstances beyond our control 
 
 harry shifted guiltily in his seat he had been unconscious in the hospital wing for the final match of the previous year meaning that gryffindor had been a player short and had suffered their worst defeat in three hundred years 
 
 wood took a moment to regain control of himself their last defeat was clearly still torturing him 
 
 so this year we train harder than ever before okay go and put our new theories into practice wood shouted seizing his broomstick and leading the way out of the locker rooms and still yawning his team followed 
 
 they had been in the locker room so long that the sun was up completely now although remnants of mist hung over the grass in the stadium as harry walked onto the field he saw ron and hermione sitting in the stands 
 
 you finished yet called ron incredulously 
 
 even started said harry looking jealously at the toast and marmalade ron and hermione had brought out of the great hall been teaching us new moves 
 
 he mounted his broomstick and kicked at the ground soaring up into the air the cool morning air whipped his face waking him far more effectively than long talk it felt wonderful to be back on the quidditch field he soared right around the stadium at full speed racing fred and george 
 
 that funny clicking noise called fred as they hurtled around the corner 
 
 harry looked into the stands colin was sitting in one of the highest seats his camera raised taking picture after picture the sound strangely magnified in the deserted stadium 
 
 look this way harry this way he cried shrilly 
 
 that said fred 
 
 no idea harry lied putting on a spurt of speed that took him as far away as possible from colin 
 
 going on said wood frowning as he skimmed through the air toward them that first year taking pictures i like it he could be a slytherin spy trying to find out about our new training program 
 
 in gryffindor said harry quickly 
 
 and the slytherins need a spy oliver said george 
 
 what makes you say that said wood testily 
 
 because here in person said george pointing 
 
 several people in green robes were walking onto the field broomsticks in their hands 
 
 i believe it wood hissed in outrage i booked the field for today see about this 
 
 wood shot toward the ground landing rather harder than he meant to in his anger staggering slightly as he dismounted harry fred and george followed 
 
 flint wood bellowed at the slytherin captain this is our practice time we got up specially you can clear off now 
 
 marcus flint was even larger than wood he had a look of trollish cunning on his face as he replied plenty of room for all of us wood 
 
 angelina alicia and katie had come over too there were no girls on the slytherin team who stood shoulder to shoulder facing the gryffindors leering to a man 
 
 but i booked the field said wood positively spitting with rage i booked it 
 
 ah said flint but got a specially signed note here from professor snape i professor s snape give the slytherin team permission to practice today on the quidditch field owing to the need to train their new seeker 
 
 got a new seeker said wood distracted where 
 
 and from behind the six large figures before them came a seventh smaller boy smirking all over his pale pointed face it was draco malfoy 
 
 you lucius son said fred looking at malfoy with dislike 
 
 funny you should mention father said flint as the whole slytherin team smiled still more broadly let me show you the generous gift made to the slytherin team 
 
 all seven of them held out their broomsticks seven highly polished handles and seven sets of fine gold lettering spelling the words nimbus two thousand and one gleamed under the in the early morning sun 
 
 very latest model only came out last month said flint carelessly flicking a speck of dust from the end of his own i believe it outstrips the old two thousand series by a considerable amount as for the old cleansweeps he smiled nastily at fred and george who were both clutching cleansweep fives sweeps the board with them 
 
 none of the gryffindor team could think of anything to say for a moment malfoy was smirking so broadly his cold eyes were reduced to slits 
 
 oh look said flint a field invasion 
 
 ron and hermione were crossing the grass to see what was going on 
 
 happening ron asked harry why you playing and he doing here 
 
 he was looking at malfoy taking in his slytherin quidditch robes 
 
 the new slytherin seeker weasley said malfoy smugly just been admiring the brooms my bought our team 
 
 ron gaped at the seven superb broomsticks in front of him 
 
 good they said malfoy smoothly but perhaps the gryffindor team will be able to raise some gold and get new brooms too you could raffle off those cleansweep fives i expect a museum would bid for them 
 
 the slytherin team howled with laughter 
 
 at least no one on the gryffindor team had to buy their way in said hermione sharply they got in on pure talent 
 
 the smug look on face flickered 
 
 no one asked your opinion you filthy little mudblood he spat 
 
 harry knew at once that malfoy had said something really bad because there was an instant uproar at his words flint had to dive in front of malfoy to stop fred and george jumping on him alicia shrieked how dare you and ron plunged his hand into his robes pulled out his wand yelling pay for that one malfoy and pointed it furiously under arm at malfoys face 
 
 a loud bang echoed around the stadium and a jet of green light shot out of the wrong end of wand hitting him in the stomach and sending him reeling backward onto the grass 
 
 ron ron are you all right squealed hermione 
 
 ron opened his mouth to speak but no words came out instead he gave an almighty belch and several slugs dribbled out of his mouth onto his lap 
 
 the slytherin team were paralyzed with laughter flint was doubled up hanging onto his new broomstick for support malfoy was on all fours banging the ground with his fist the gryffindors were gathered around ron who kept belching large glistening slugs nobody seemed to want to touch him 
 
 better get him to nearest said harry to hermione who nodded bravely and the pair of them pulled ron up by the arms 
 
 what happened harry what happened is he ill but you can cure him you colin had run down from his seat and was now dancing alongside them as they left the field ron gave a huge heave and more slugs dribbled down his front 
 
 oooh said colin fascinated and raising his camera can you hold him still harry 
 
 get out of the way colin said harry angrily he and hermione supported ron out of the stadium and across the grounds toward the edge of the forest 
 
 nearly there ron said hermione as the cabin came into view be all right in a minute almost there

 hagrid appeared at once looking very grumpy but his expression brightened when he saw who it was

 harry and hermione supported ron over the threshold into the cabin which had an enormous bed in one corner a fire crackling merrily in the other hagrid seem perturbed by slug problem which harry hastily explained as he lowered ron into a chair 
 
 better out than in he said cheerfully plunking a large copper basin in front of him get em all up ron

 hagrid was bustling around making them tea his boarhound fang was slobbering over harry

 and then he heard something something quite apart from the spitting of the dying candles and prattle about his fans 
 
 it was a voice a voice to chill the bone marrow a voice of breathtaking venom 
 
 come come to me let me rip you let me tear you let me kill you 
 
 harry gave a huge jump and a large lilac blot appeared on veronica street 
 
 what he said loudly 
 
 i know said lockhart six solid months at the top of the list broke all records 
 
 no said harry frantically that voice 
 
 sorry said lockhart looking puzzled what voice 
 
 that that voice that said you hear it 
 
 lockhart was looking at harry in high astonishment 
 
 what are you talking about harry perhaps getting a little drowsy great scott look at the time been here nearly four hours never have believed it the flown it 
 
 harry answer he was straining his ears to hear the voice again but there was no sound now except for lockhart telling him he expect a treat like this every time he got detention feeling dazed harry left 
 
 it was so late that the gryffindor common room was almost empty harry went straight up to the dormitory ron back yet harry pulled on his pajamas got into bed and waited half an hour later ron arrived nursing his right arm and bringing a strong smell of polish into the darkened room 
 
 my muscles have all seized up he groaned sinking on his bed fourteen times he made me buff up that quidditch cup before he was satisfied and then i had another slug attack all over a special award for services to the school took ages to get the slime off how was it with lockhart 
 
 keeping his voice low so as not to wake neville dean and seamus harry told ron exactly what he had heard 
 
 and lockhart said he hear it said ron harry could see him frowning in the moonlight think he was lying but i get it even someone invisible had to open the door 
 
 i know said harry lying back in his and staring at the canopy above him i get it either

 malfoy reappear in classes until late on thursday morning when the slytherins and gryffindors were halfway through double potions he swaggered into the dungeon his right arm covered in bandages and bound up in a sling acting in opinion as though he were the heroic survivor of some dreadful battle 
 
 how is it draco simpered pansy parkinson does it hurt much 
 
 yeah said malfoy putting on a brave sort of grimace but harry saw him wink at crabbe and goyle when pansy had looked away 
 
 settle down settle down said professor snape idly 
 
 harry and ron scowled at each other snape have said settle down if walked in late have given them detention but malfoy had always been able to get away with anything in classes snape was head of slytherin house and generally favored his own students above all others 
 
 they were making a new potion today a shrinking solution malfoy set up his cauldron right next to harry and ron so that they were preparing their ingredients on the same table 
 
 sir malfoy called sir need help cutting up these daisy roots because of my arm 
 
 weasley cut up roots for him said snape without looking up 
 
 ron went brick red 
 
 nothing wrong with your arm he hissed at malfoy 
 
 malfoy smirked across the table 
 
 weasley you heard professor snape cut up these roots 
 
 ron seized his knife pulled roots toward him and began to chop them roughly so that they were all different sizes 
 
 professor drawled malfoy mutilating my roots sir 
 
 snape approached their table stared down his hooked nose at the roots then gave ron an unpleasant smile from beneath his long greasy black hair 
 
 change roots with malfoy weasley 
 
 but sir 
 
 ron had spent the last quarter of an hour carefully shredding his own roots into exactly equal pieces 
 
 now said snape in his most dangerous voice 
 
 ron shoved his own beautifully cut roots across the table at malfoy then took up the knife again 
 
 and sir need this shrivelfig skinned said malfoy his voice full of malicious laughter 
 
 potter you can skin shrivelfig said snape giving harry the look of loathing he always reserved just for him 
 
 harry took shrivelfig as ron began trying to repair the damage to the roots he now had to use harry skinned the shrivelfig as fast as he could and flung it back across the table at malfoy without speaking malfoy was smirking more broadly than ever 
 
 seen your pal hagrid lately he asked them quietly 
 
 none of your business said ron jerkily without looking up 
 
 afraid he be a teacher much longer said malfoy in a tone of mock sorrow not very happy about my injury 
 
 keep talking malfoy and give you a real injury snarled ron 
 
 c complained to the school governors and to the ministry of magic got a lot of influence you know and a lasting injury like this he gave a huge fake sigh who knows if my ever be the same again 
 
 so why putting it on said harry accidentally beheading a dead caterpillar because his hand was shaking in anger to try to get hagrid fired 
 
 well said malfoy lowering his voice to a whisper partly potter but there are other benefits too weasley slice my caterpillars for me 
 
 a few cauldrons away neville was in trouble neville regularly went to pieces in potions lessons it was his worst subject and his great fear of professor snape made things ten times worse his potion which was supposed to be a bright acid green had turned 
 
 orange longbottom said snape ladling some up and allowing to splash back into the cauldron so that everyone could see 
 
 orange tell me boy does anything penetrate that thick skull of yours you hear me say quite clearly that only one cat spleen was needed i state plainly that a dash of leech juice would suffice what do i have to do to make you understand longbottom 
 
 neville was pink and trembling he looked as though he was on the verge of tears 
 
 please sir said hermione please i could help neville put it right 
 
 i remember asking you to show off miss granger said snape coldly and hermione went as pink as neville longbottom at the end of this lesson we will feed a few drops of this potion to your toad and see what happens perhaps that will encourage you to do it properly 
 
 snape moved away leaving neville breathless with fear 
 
 help me he moaned to hermione 
 
 hey harry said seamus finnigan leaning over to borrow brass scales have you heard daily prophet this morning they reckon sirius been sighted 
 
 where said harry and ron quickly on the other side of the table malfoy looked up listening closely 
 
 not too far from here said seamus who looked excited it was a muggle who saw him course she really understand the muggles think just an ordinary criminal they so she phoned the telephone hot line by the time the ministry of magic got there he was gone 
 
 not too far from here ron repeated looking significantly at harry he turned around and saw malfoy watching closely what malfoy need something else skinned 
 
 but eyes were shining malevolently and they were fixed harry he leaned across the table 
 
 thinking of trying to catch black potter 
 
 yeah right said harry offhandedly 
 
 thin mouth was curving in a mean smile 
 
 of course if it was me he said quietly have done something before now i be staying in school like a good boy be out there looking for him 
 
 what are you talking about malfoy said ron roughly 
 
 you know potter breathed malfoy his pale eyes narrowed 
 
 know what 
 
 malfoy let out a low sneering laugh 
 
 maybe rather not risk your neck he said want to leave it to the dementors do you but if it was me want revenge hunt him down myself 
 
 what are you talking about said harry angrily but at that moment snape called you should have finished adding your ingredients by now this potion needs to stew before it can be drunk so clear away while it simmers and then test 
 
 crabbe and goyle laughed openly watching neville sweat as he stirred his potion feverishly hermione was muttering instructions to him out of the corner of her mouth so that snape see harry and ron packed away their unused ingredients and went to wash their hands and ladles in the stone basin in the corner 
 
 what did malfoy mean harry muttered to ron as he stuck his hands under the icy jet that poured from the mouth why would i want revenge on black he done anything to me yet 
 
 making it up said ron savagely trying to make you do something stupid 
 
 the end of the lesson in sight snape strode over to neville who was cowering by his cauldron 
 
 everyone gather round said snape his black eyes glittering and watch what happens to toad if he has managed to produce a shrinking solution it will shrink to a tadpole if as i doubt he has done it wrong his toad is likely to be poisoned 
 
 the gryffindors watched fearfully the slytherins looked excited snape picked up trevor the toad in his left hand and dipped a small spoon into potion which was now green he trickled a few drops down throat 
 
 there was a moment of hushed silence in which trevor gulped then there was a small pop and trevor the tadpole was wriggling in palm 
 
 the gryffindors burst into applause snape looking sour pulled a small bottle from the pocket of his robe poured a few drops on top of trevor and he reappeared suddenly fully grown 
 
 five points from gryffindor said snape which wiped the smiles from every face i told you not to help him miss granger class dismissed 
 
 harry ron and hermione climbed the steps to the entrance hall harry was still thinking about what malfoy had said while ron was seething about snape 
 
 five points from gryffindor because the potion was all right why you lie hermione you said neville did it all by himself 
 
 hermione answer ron looked around 
 
 where is she 
 
 harry turned too they were at the top of the steps now watching the rest of the class pass them heading for the great hall and lunch 
 
 she was right behind us said ron frowning 
 
 malfoy passed them walking between crabbe and goyle he smirked at harry and disappeared 
 
 there she is said harry 
 
 hermione was panting slightly hurrying up the stairs one hand clutched her bag the other seemed to be tucking something down the front of her robes 
 
 how did you do that said ron 
 
 what said hermione joining them 
 
 one minute you were right behind us the next moment you were back at the bottom of the stairs again 
 
 what hermione looked slightly confused oh i had to go back for something oh no 
 
 a seam had split on bag harry surprised he could see that it was crammed with at least a dozen large and heavy books 
 
 why are you carrying all these around with you ron asked her 
 
 you know how many subjects taking said hermione breathlessly hold these for me could you 
 
 but ron was turning over the books she had handed him looking at the covers you got any of these subjects today only defense against the dark arts this afternoon 
 
 oh yes said hermione vaguely but she packed all the books back into her bag just the same i hope something good for lunch starving she added and she marched off toward the great hall 
 
 get the feeling not telling us something ron asked harry 
 
 
 
 professor lupin there when they arrived at his first defense against the dark arts lesson they all sat down took out their books quills and parchment and were talking when he finally entered the room lupin smiled vaguely and placed his tatty old briefcase on the desk he was as shabby as ever but looked healthier than he had on the train as though he had had a few square meals 
 
 good afternoon he said would you please put all your books back in your bags will be a practical lesson you will need only your wands 
 
 a few curious looks were exchanged as the class put away their books they had never had a practical defense against the dark arts class before unless you counted the memorable class last year when their old teacher had brought a cageful of pixies to class and set them loose 
 
 right then said professor lupin when everyone was ready if follow me 
 
 puzzled but interested the class got to its feet and followed professor lupin out of the classroom he led them along the deserted corridor and around a corner where the first thing they saw was peeves the poltergeist who was floating upside down in midair and stuffing the nearest keyhole with chewing gum 
 
 peeves look up until professor lupin was two feet away then he wiggled his feet and broke into song 
 
 loony loopy lupin peeves sang loony loopy lupin loony loopy lupin 
 
 rude and unmanageable as he almost always was peeves usually showed some respect toward the teachers everyone looked quickly at professor lupin to see how he would take this to their surprise he was still smiling 
 
 take that gum out of the keyhole if i were you peeves he said pleasantly mr filch be able to get in to his brooms 
 
 filch was the hogwarts caretaker a failed wizard who waged a constant war against the students and indeed peeves however peeves paid no attention to professor words except to blow a loud wet raspberry 
 
 professor lupin gave a small sigh and took out his wand 
 
 this is a useful little spell he told the class over his shoulder please watch closely 
 
 he raised the wand to shoulder height said waddiwasi and pointed it at peeves 
 
 with the force of a bullet the wad of chewing gum shot out of the keyhole and straight down left nostril he whirled upright and zoomed away cursing 
 
 cool sir said dean thomas in amazement 
 
 thank you dean said professor lupin putting his wand away again shall we proceed 
 
 they set off again the class looking at shabby professor lupin with increased respect he led them down a second corridor and stopped right outside the staffroom door 
 
 inside please said professor lupin opening it and standing back 
 
 the staffroom a long paneled room full of old mismatched chairs was empty except for one teacher professor snape was sitting in a low armchair and he looked around as the class filed in his eyes were glittering and there was a nasty sneer playing around his mouth as professor lupin came in and made to close the door behind him snape said leave it open lupin rather not witness this he got to his feet and strode past the class his black robes billowing behind him at the doorway he turned on his heel and said possibly no warned you lupin but this class contains neville longbottom i would advise you not to entrust him with anything difficult not unless miss granger is hissing instructions in his ear 
 
 neville went scarlet harry glared at snape it was bad enough that he bullied neville in his own classes let alone doing it in front of other teachers 
 
 professor lupin had raised his eyebrows 
 
 i was hoping that neville would assist me with the first stage of the operation he said and i am sure he will perform it admirably 
 
 face went if possible even redder lip curled but he left shutting the door with a snap 
 
 now then said professor lupin beckoning the class toward the end of the room where there was nothing but an old wardrobe where the teachers kept their spare robes as professor lupin went to stand next to it the wardrobe gave a sudden wobble banging off the wall 
 
 nothing to worry about said professor lupin calmly because a few people had jumped backward in alarm a boggart in there 
 
 most people seemed to feel that this was something to worry about neville gave professor lupin a look of pure terror and seamus finnigan eyed the now rattling doorknob apprehensively 
 
 boggarts like dark enclosed spaces said professor lupin wardrobes the gap beneath beds the cupboards under sinks even met one that had lodged itself in a grandfather clock this one moved in yesterday afternoon and i asked the headmaster if the staff would leave it to give my third years some practice 
 
 so the first question we must ask ourselves is what is a boggart 
 
 hermione put up her hand 
 
 a she said it can take the shape of whatever it thinks will frighten us most 
 
 have put it better myself said professor lupin and hermione glowed so the boggart sitting in the darkness within has not yet assumed a form he does not yet know what will frighten the person on the other side of the door nobody knows what a boggart looks like when he is alone but when i let him out he will immediately become whatever each of us most fears 
 
 this means said professor lupin choosing to ignore small sputter of terror that we have a huge advantage over the boggart before we begin have you spotted it harry 
 
 trying to answer a question with hermione next to him bobbing up and down on the balls of her feet with her hand in the air was very but harry had a go 
 
 er because there are so many of us it know what shape it should be 
 
 precisely said professor lupin and hermione put her hand down looking a little disappointed always best to have company when dealing with a boggart he becomes confused which should he become a headless corpse or a slug i once saw a boggart make that very mistake tried to frighten two people at once and turned himself into half a slug not remotely frightening 
 
 the charm that repels a boggart is simple yet it requires force of mind you see the thing that really finishes a boggart is laughter what you need to do is force it to assume a shape that you find amusing 
 
 we will practice the charm without wands first after me pleaseriddikulus 
 
 riddikulus said the class together 
 
 good said professor lupin very good but that was the easy part afraid you see the word alone is not enough and this is where you come in neville 
 
 the wardrobe shook again though not as much as neville who walked forward as though he were heading for the gallows 
 
 right neville said professor lupin first things first what would you say is the thing that frightens you most in the world 
 
 lips moved but no noise came out 
 
 i catch that neville sorry said professor lupin cheerfully 
 
 neville looked around rather wildly as though begging someone to help him then said in barely more than a whisper professor snape 
 
 nearly everyone laughed even neville grinned apologetically professor lupin however looked thoughtful 
 
 professor snapehmmmneville i believe you live with your grandmother 
 
 er yes said neville nervously but i want the boggart to turn into her either 
 
 no no you misunderstand me said professor lupin now smiling i wonder could you tell us what sort of clothes your grandmother usually wears 
 
 neville looked startled but said wellalways the same hat a tall one with a stuffed vulture on top and a long dressgreen normallyand sometimes a scarf 
 
 and a handbag prompted professor lupin 
 
 a big red one said neville 
 
 right then said professor lupin can you picture those clothes very clearly neville can you see them in your eye 
 
 yes said neville uncertainty plainly wondering what was coming next 
 
 when the boggart bursts out of this wardrobe neville and sees you it will assume the form of professor snape said lupin and you will raise your wand thus and cry riddikulus and concentrate hard on your clothes if all goes well professor boggart snape will be forced into that hat and that green dress with that big red handbag 
 
 there was a great shout of laughter the wardrobe wobbled more violently 
 
 if neville is successful the boggart is likely to shift his attention to each of us in turn said professor lupin i would like all of you to take a moment now to think of the thing that scares you most and imagine how you might force it to look comical 
 
 the room went quiet harry thoughtwhat scared him most in the world 
 
 his first thought was lord voldemort a voldemort returned to full strength but before he had even started to plan a possible counterattack on a a horrible image came floating to the surface of his mind 
 
 a rotting glistening hand slithering back beneath a black cloaka long rattling breath from an unseen mouththen a cold so penetrating it felt like drowning 
 
 harry shivered then looked around hoping no one had noticed many people had their eyes shut tight ron was muttering to himself take its legs off harry was sure he knew what that was about greatest fear was spiders 
 
 everyone ready said professor lupin 
 
 harry felt a lurch of fear he ready how could you make a dementor less frightening but he want to ask for more time everyone else was nodding and rolling up their sleeves 
 
 neville going to back away said professor lupin let you have a clear field all right call the next person forwardeveryone back now so neville can get a clear shot 
 
 they all retreated backed against the walls leaving neville alone beside the wardrobe he looked pale and frightened but he had pushed up the sleeves of his robes and was holding his wand ready 
 
 on the count of three neville said professor lupin who was pointing his own wand at the handle of the wardrobe one two three now 
 
 a jet of sparks shot from the end of professor wand and hit the doorknob the wardrobe burst open and menacing professor snape stepped out his eyes flashing at neville 
 
 neville backed away his wand up mouthing wordlessly snape was bearing down upon him reaching inside his robes 
 
 r r riddikulus squeaked neville 
 
 there was a noise like a whip crack snape stumbled he was wearing a long dress and a towering hat topped with a vulture and he was swinging a huge crimson handbag 
 
 there was a roar of laughter the boggart paused confused and professor lupin shouted parvati forward 
 
 parvati walked forward her face set snape rounded on her there was another crack and where he had stood was a bloodstained bandaged mummy its sightless face was turned to parvati and it began to walk toward her very slowly dragging its feet its stiff arms rising 
 
 riddikulus cried parvati 
 
 a bandage unraveled at the feet it became entangled fell face forward and its head rolled off 
 
 seamus roared professor lupin 
 
 seamus darted past parvati 
 
 crack where the mummy had been was a woman with floorlength black hair and a skeletal face a banshee she opened her mouth wide and an unearthly sound filled the room a long wailing shriek that made the hair on head stand on end riddikulus shouted seamus 
 
 the banshee made a rasping noise and clutched her throat her voice was gone 
 
 crack the banshee turned into a rat which chased its tail in a circle then crack became a rattlesnake which slithered and writhed before crack becoming a single bloody eyeball 
 
 confused shouted lupin getting there dean 
 
 dean hurried forward 
 
 crack the eyeball became a severed hand which flipped over and began to creep along the floor like a crab 
 
 riddikulus yelled dean 
 
 there was a snap and the hand was trapped in a mousetrap 
 
 excellent ron you next 
 
 ron leapt forward 
 
 crack 
 
 quite a few people screamed a giant spider six feet tall and covered in hair was advancing on ron clicking its pincers menacingly for a moment harry thought ron had frozen then 
 
 riddikulus bellowed ron and the legs vanished it rolled over and over lavender brown squealed and ran out of its way and it came to a halt at feet he raised his wand ready but 
 
 here shouted professor lupin suddenly hurrying forward crack 
 
 the legless spider had vanished for a second everyone looked wildly around to see where it was then they saw a orb hanging in the air in front of lupin who said riddikulus almost lazily 
 
 crack 
 
 forward neville and finish him off said lupin as the boggart landed on the floor as a cockroach crack snape was back this time neville charged forward looking determined 
 
 riddikulus he shouted and they had a split view of snape in his lacy dress before neville let out a great ha of laughter and the boggart exploded burst into a thousand tiny wisps of smoke and was gone 
 
 excellent cried professor lupin as the class broke into applause excellent neville well done everyonelet me seefive points to gryffindor for every person to tackle the boggart ten for neville because he did it twiceand five each to hermione and harry 
 
 but i do anything said harry 
 
 you and hermione answered my questions correctly at the start of the class harry lupin said lightly very well everyone an excellent lesson homework kindly read the chapter on boggarts and summarize it for meto be handed in on monday that will be all 
 
 talking excitedly the class left the staffroom harry however feeling cheerful professor lupin had deliberately stopped him from tackling the boggart why was it because seen harry collapse on the train and thought he up to much had he thought harry would pass out again 
 
 but no one else seemed to have noticed anything 
 
 did you see me take that banshee shouted seamus 
 
 and the hand said dean waving his own around 
 
 and snape in that hat 
 
 and my mummy 
 
 i wonder why professor frightened of crystal balls said lavender thoughtfully 
 
 that was the best defense against the dark arts lesson ever had it said ron excitedly as they made their way back to the classroom to get their bags 
 
 he seems like a very good teacher said hermione approvingly but i wish i could have had a turn with the boggart 
 
 what would it have been for you said ron sniggering a piece of homework that only got nine out of ten

 malfoy reappear in classes until late on thursday morning when the slytherins and gryffindors were halfway through double potions he swaggered into the dungeon his right arm covered in bandages and bound up in a sling acting in opinion as though he were the heroic survivor of some dreadful battle 
 
 how is it draco simpered pansy parkinson does it hurt much 
 
 yeah said malfoy putting on a brave sort of grimace but harry saw him wink at crabbe and goyle when pansy had looked away

 harry and ron scowled at each other snape have said settle down if walked in late have given them detention but malfoy had always been able to get away with anything in classes snape was head of slytherin house and generally favored his own students above all others 
 
 they were making a new potion today a shrinking solution malfoy set up his cauldron right next to harry and ron so that they were preparing their ingredients on the same table

 a few cauldrons away neville was in trouble neville regularly went to pieces in potions lessons it was his worst subject and his great fear of professor snape made things ten times worse his potion which was supposed to be a bright acid green had turned 
 
 orange longbottom said snape ladling some up and allowing to splash back into the cauldron so that everyone could see 
 
 orange tell me boy does anything penetrate that thick skull of yours you hear me say quite clearly that only one cat spleen was needed i state plainly that a dash of leech juice would suffice what do i have to do to make you understand longbottom

 there was a moment of hushed silence in which trevor gulped then there was a small pop and trevor the tadpole was wriggling in palm 
 
 the gryffindors burst into applause snape looking sour pulled a small bottle from the pocket of his robe poured a few drops on top of trevor and he reappeared suddenly fully grown 
 
 five points from gryffindor said snape which wiped the smiles from every face i told you not to help him miss granger class dismissed 
 
 harry ron and hermione climbed the steps to the entrance hall harry was still thinking about what malfoy had said while ron was seething about snape 
 
 five points from gryffindor because the potion was all right why you lie hermione you said neville did it all by himself 
 
 hermione answer ron looked around

 one minute you were right behind us the next moment you were back at the bottom of the stairs again 
 
 what hermione looked slightly confused oh i had to go back for something oh no 
 
 a seam had split on bag harry surprised he could see that it was crammed with at least a dozen large and heavy books 
 
 why are you carrying all these around with you ron asked her 
 
 you know how many subjects taking said hermione breathlessly hold these for me could you 
 
 but ron was turning over the books she had handed him looking at the covers you got any of these subjects today only defense against the dark arts this afternoon 
 
 oh yes said hermione vaguely but she packed all the books back into her bag just the same i hope something good for lunch starving she added and she marched off toward the great hall 
 
 get the feeling not telling us something ron asked harry 
 
 
 
 professor lupin there when they arrived at his first defense against the dark arts lesson they all sat down took out their books quills and parchment and were talking when he finally entered the room lupin smiled vaguely and placed his tatty old briefcase on the desk he was as shabby as ever but looked healthier than he had on the train as though he had had a few square meals 
 
 good afternoon he said would you please put all your books back in your bags will be a practical lesson you will need only your wands 
 
 a few curious looks were exchanged as the class put away their books they had never had a practical defense against the dark arts class before unless you counted the memorable class last year when their old teacher had brought a cageful of pixies to class and set them loose 
 
 right then said professor lupin when everyone was ready if follow me 
 
 puzzled but interested the class got to its feet and followed professor lupin out of the classroom he led them along the deserted corridor and around a corner where the first thing they saw was peeves the poltergeist who was floating upside down in midair and stuffing the nearest keyhole with chewing gum 
 
 peeves look up until professor lupin was two feet away then he wiggled his feet and broke into song 
 
 loony loopy lupin peeves sang loony loopy lupin loony loopy lupin 
 
 rude and unmanageable as he almost always was peeves usually showed some respect toward the teachers everyone looked quickly at professor lupin to see how he would take this to their surprise he was still smiling 
 
 take that gum out of the keyhole if i were you peeves he said pleasantly mr filch be able to get in to his brooms 
 
 filch was the hogwarts caretaker a failed wizard who waged a constant war against the students and indeed peeves however peeves paid no attention to professor words except to blow a loud wet raspberry 
 
 professor lupin gave a small sigh and took out his wand 
 
 this is a useful little spell he told the class over his shoulder please watch closely 
 
 he raised the wand to shoulder height said waddiwasi and pointed it at peeves 
 
 with the force of a bullet the wad of chewing gum shot out of the keyhole and straight down left nostril he whirled upright and zoomed away cursing 
 
 cool sir said dean thomas in amazement 
 
 thank you dean said professor lupin putting his wand away again shall we proceed 
 
 they set off again the class looking at shabby professor lupin with increased respect he led them down a second corridor and stopped right outside the staffroom door 
 
 inside please said professor lupin opening it and standing back 
 
 the staffroom a long paneled room full of old mismatched chairs was empty except for one teacher professor snape was sitting in a low armchair and he looked around as the class filed in his eyes were glittering and there was a nasty sneer playing around his mouth as professor lupin came in and made to close the door behind him snape said leave it open lupin rather not witness this he got to his feet and strode past the class his black robes billowing behind him at the doorway he turned on his heel and said possibly no warned you lupin but this class contains neville longbottom i would advise you not to entrust him with anything difficult not unless miss granger is hissing instructions in his ear 
 
 neville went scarlet harry glared at snape it was bad enough that he bullied neville in his own classes let alone doing it in front of other teachers 
 
 professor lupin had raised his eyebrows 
 
 i was hoping that neville would assist me with the first stage of the operation he said and i am sure he will perform it admirably 
 
 face went if possible even redder lip curled but he left shutting the door with a snap 
 
 now then said professor lupin beckoning the class toward the end of the room where there was nothing but an old wardrobe where the teachers kept their spare robes as professor lupin went to stand next to it the wardrobe gave a sudden wobble banging off the wall 
 
 nothing to worry about said professor lupin calmly because a few people had jumped backward in alarm a boggart in there 
 
 most people seemed to feel that this was something to worry about neville gave professor lupin a look of pure terror and seamus finnigan eyed the now rattling doorknob apprehensively 
 
 boggarts like dark enclosed spaces said professor lupin wardrobes the gap beneath beds the cupboards under sinks even met one that had lodged itself in a grandfather clock this one moved in yesterday afternoon and i asked the headmaster if the staff would leave it to give my third years some practice 
 
 so the first question we must ask ourselves is what is a boggart 
 
 hermione put up her hand 
 
 a she said it can take the shape of whatever it thinks will frighten us most 
 
 have put it better myself said professor lupin and hermione glowed so the boggart sitting in the darkness within has not yet assumed a form he does not yet know what will frighten the person on the other side of the door nobody knows what a boggart looks like when he is alone but when i let him out he will immediately become whatever each of us most fears 
 
 this means said professor lupin choosing to ignore small sputter of terror that we have a huge advantage over the boggart before we begin have you spotted it harry 
 
 trying to answer a question with hermione next to him bobbing up and down on the balls of her feet with her hand in the air was very but harry had a go 
 
 er because there are so many of us it know what shape it should be 
 
 precisely said professor lupin and hermione put her hand down looking a little disappointed always best to have company when dealing with a boggart he becomes confused which should he become a headless corpse or a slug i once saw a boggart make that very mistake tried to frighten two people at once and turned himself into half a slug not remotely frightening 
 
 the charm that repels a boggart is simple yet it requires force of mind you see the thing that really finishes a boggart is laughter what you need to do is force it to assume a shape that you find amusing 
 
 we will practice the charm without wands first after me pleaseriddikulus 
 
 riddikulus said the class together 
 
 good said professor lupin very good but that was the easy part afraid you see the word alone is not enough and this is where you come in neville 
 
 the wardrobe shook again though not as much as neville who walked forward as though he were heading for the gallows 
 
 right neville said professor lupin first things first what would you say is the thing that frightens you most in the world 
 
 lips moved but no noise came out 
 
 i catch that neville sorry said professor lupin cheerfully 
 
 neville looked around rather wildly as though begging someone to help him then said in barely more than a whisper professor snape 
 
 nearly everyone laughed even neville grinned apologetically professor lupin however looked thoughtful 
 
 professor snapehmmmneville i believe you live with your grandmother 
 
 er yes said neville nervously but i want the boggart to turn into her either 
 
 no no you misunderstand me said professor lupin now smiling i wonder could you tell us what sort of clothes your grandmother usually wears 
 
 neville looked startled but said wellalways the same hat a tall one with a stuffed vulture on top and a long dressgreen normallyand sometimes a scarf 
 
 and a handbag prompted professor lupin 
 
 a big red one said neville 
 
 right then said professor lupin can you picture those clothes very clearly neville can you see them in your eye 
 
 yes said neville uncertainty plainly wondering what was coming next 
 
 when the boggart bursts out of this wardrobe neville and sees you it will assume the form of professor snape said lupin and you will raise your wand thus and cry riddikulus and concentrate hard on your clothes if all goes well professor boggart snape will be forced into that hat and that green dress with that big red handbag 
 
 there was a great shout of laughter the wardrobe wobbled more violently 
 
 if neville is successful the boggart is likely to shift his attention to each of us in turn said professor lupin i would like all of you to take a moment now to think of the thing that scares you most and imagine how you might force it to look comical 
 
 the room went quiet harry thoughtwhat scared him most in the world 
 
 his first thought was lord voldemort a voldemort returned to full strength but before he had even started to plan a possible counterattack on a a horrible image came floating to the surface of his mind 
 
 a rotting glistening hand slithering back beneath a black cloaka long rattling breath from an unseen mouththen a cold so penetrating it felt like drowning 
 
 harry shivered then looked around hoping no one had noticed many people had their eyes shut tight ron was muttering to himself take its legs off harry was sure he knew what that was about greatest fear was spiders 
 
 everyone ready said professor lupin 
 
 harry felt a lurch of fear he ready how could you make a dementor less frightening but he want to ask for more time everyone else was nodding and rolling up their sleeves 
 
 neville going to back away said professor lupin let you have a clear field all right call the next person forwardeveryone back now so neville can get a clear shot 
 
 they all retreated backed against the walls leaving neville alone beside the wardrobe he looked pale and frightened but he had pushed up the sleeves of his robes and was holding his wand ready 
 
 on the count of three neville said professor lupin who was pointing his own wand at the handle of the wardrobe one two three now 
 
 a jet of sparks shot from the end of professor wand and hit the doorknob the wardrobe burst open and menacing professor snape stepped out his eyes flashing at neville 
 
 neville backed away his wand up mouthing wordlessly snape was bearing down upon him reaching inside his robes 
 
 r r riddikulus squeaked neville 
 
 there was a noise like a whip crack snape stumbled he was wearing a long dress and a towering hat topped with a vulture and he was swinging a huge crimson handbag 
 
 there was a roar of laughter the boggart paused confused and professor lupin shouted parvati forward 
 
 parvati walked forward her face set snape rounded on her there was another crack and where he had stood was a bloodstained bandaged mummy its sightless face was turned to parvati and it began to walk toward her very slowly dragging its feet its stiff arms rising 
 
 riddikulus cried parvati 
 
 a bandage unraveled at the feet it became entangled fell face forward and its head rolled off 
 
 seamus roared professor lupin 
 
 seamus darted past parvati 
 
 crack where the mummy had been was a woman with floorlength black hair and a skeletal face a banshee she opened her mouth wide and an unearthly sound filled the room a long wailing shriek that made the hair on head stand on end riddikulus shouted seamus 
 
 the banshee made a rasping noise and clutched her throat her voice was gone 
 
 crack the banshee turned into a rat which chased its tail in a circle then crack became a rattlesnake which slithered and writhed before crack becoming a single bloody eyeball 
 
 confused shouted lupin getting there dean 
 
 dean hurried forward 
 
 crack the eyeball became a severed hand which flipped over and began to creep along the floor like a crab 
 
 riddikulus yelled dean 
 
 there was a snap and the hand was trapped in a mousetrap 
 
 excellent ron you next 
 
 ron leapt forward 
 
 crack 
 
 quite a few people screamed a giant spider six feet tall and covered in hair was advancing on ron clicking its pincers menacingly for a moment harry thought ron had frozen then 
 
 riddikulus bellowed ron and the legs vanished it rolled over and over lavender brown squealed and ran out of its way and it came to a halt at feet he raised his wand ready but 
 
 here shouted professor lupin suddenly hurrying forward crack 
 
 the legless spider had vanished for a second everyone looked wildly around to see where it was then they saw a orb hanging in the air in front of lupin who said riddikulus almost lazily 
 
 crack 
 
 forward neville and finish him off said lupin as the boggart landed on the floor as a cockroach crack snape was back this time neville charged forward looking determined 
 
 riddikulus he shouted and they had a split view of snape in his lacy dress before neville let out a great ha of laughter and the boggart exploded burst into a thousand tiny wisps of smoke and was gone 
 
 excellent cried professor lupin as the class broke into applause excellent neville well done everyonelet me seefive points to gryffindor for every person to tackle the boggart ten for neville because he did it twiceand five each to hermione and harry 
 
 but i do anything said harry 
 
 you and hermione answered my questions correctly at the start of the class harry lupin said lightly very well everyone an excellent lesson homework kindly read the chapter on boggarts and summarize it for meto be handed in on monday that will be all 
 
 talking excitedly the class left the staffroom harry however feeling cheerful professor lupin had deliberately stopped him from tackling the boggart why was it because seen harry collapse on the train and thought he up to much had he thought harry would pass out again 
 
 but no one else seemed to have noticed anything 
 
 did you see me take that banshee shouted seamus 
 
 and the hand said dean waving his own around 
 
 and snape in that hat 
 
 and my mummy 
 
 i wonder why professor frightened of crystal balls said lavender thoughtfully 
 
 that was the best defense against the dark arts lesson ever had it said ron excitedly as they made their way back to the classroom to get their bags 
 
 he seems like a very good teacher said hermione approvingly but i wish i could have had a turn with the boggart 
 
 what would it have been for you said ron sniggering a piece of homework that only got nine out of ten 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the prisoner of azkaban 
 

lionfish nov chapter seven bagman and crouchcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 harry disentangled himself from ron and got to his feet they had arrived on what appeared to be a deserted stretch of misty moor in front of them was a pair of tired and wizards one of whom was holding a large gold watch the other a thick roll of parchment and a quill both were dressed as muggles though very inexpertly the man with the watch wore a tweed suit with galoshes his colleague a kilt and a poncho 
 
 morning basil said mr weasley picking up the boot and handing it to the kilted wizard who threw it into a large box of used portkeys beside him harry could see an old newspaper an empty drinks can and a punctured football 
 
 hello there arthur said basil wearily not on duty eh all right for been here all better get out of the way got a big party coming in from the black forest at five fifteen hang on find your he consulted his parchment list about a quarter of a walk over there first field you come to site called mr roberts diggorysecond fieldask for mr payne 
 
 thanks basil said mr weasley and he beckoned everyone to follow him 
 
 they set off across the deserted moor unable to make out much through the mist after about twenty minutes a small stone cottage next to a gate swam into view beyond it harry could just make out the ghostly shapes of hundreds and hundreds of tents rising up the gentle slope of a large field toward a dark wood on the horizon they said to the and approached the cottage door 
 
 a man was standing in the doorway looking out at the tents harry knew at a glance that this was the only real muggle for several acres when he heard their footsteps he turned his head to look at them 
 
 morning said mr weasley brightly 
 
 morning said the muggle 
 
 would you be mr roberts 
 
 aye i would said mr roberts and you 
 
 weasley two tents booked a couple of days ago 
 
 aye said mr roberts consulting a list tacked to the door got a space up by the wood there just the one night 
 
 it said mr weasley 
 
 be paying now then said mr roberts 
 
 ah right certainly said mr weasley he retreated a short distance from the cottage and beckoned harry toward him help me harry he muttered pulling a roll of muggle money from his pocket and starting to peel the notes apart this a a a ten ah yes i see the little number on it nowso this is a five 
 
 a twenty harry corrected him in an undertone uncomfortably aware of mr roberts trying to catch every word 
 
 ah yes so it know these little bits of paper 
 
 you foreign said mr roberts as mr weasley returned with the correct notes 
 
 foreign repeated mr weasley puzzled 
 
 not the first one had trouble with money said mr roberts scrutinizing mr weasley closely i had two try and pay me with great gold coins the size of hubcaps ten minutes ago 
 
 did you really said mr weasley nervously 
 
 mr roberts rummaged around in a tin for some change 
 
 never been this crowded he said suddenly looking out over the misty field again hundreds of people usually just turn up 
 
 is that right said mr weasley his hand held out for his change but mr roberts give it to him 
 
 aye he said thoughtfully people from all over loads of foreigners and not just foreigners weirdos you know a bloke walking round in a kilt and a poncho 
 
 he said mr weasley anxiously 
 
 like some sort ofi dunnolike some sort of rally said mr roberts they all seem to know each other like a big party 
 
 at that moment a wizard in appeared out of thin air next to mr front door 
 
 obliviate he said sharply pointing his wand at mr roberts 
 
 instantly mr eyes slid out of focus his brows unknitted and a took of dreamy unconcern fell over his face harry recognized the symptoms of one who had just had his memory modified 
 
 a map of the campsite for you mr roberts said placidly to mr weasley and your change 
 
 thanks very much said mr weasley 
 
 the wizard in accompanied them toward the gate to the campsite he looked exhausted his chin was blue with stubble and there were deep purple shadows under his eyes once out of earshot of mr roberts he muttered to mr weasley been having a lot of trouble with him needs a memory charm ten times a day to keep him happy and ludo not helping trotting around talking about bludgers and quaffles at the top of his voice not a worry about security blimey be glad when this is over see you later arthur 
 
 he disapparated 
 
 i thought mr bagman was head of magical games and sports said ginny looking surprised he should know better than to talk about bludgers near muggles he 
 
 he should said mr weasley smiling and leading them through the gates into the campsite but always been a bitwelllax about security you wish for a more enthusiastic head of the sports department though he played quidditch for england himself you know and he was the best beater the wimbourne wasps ever had 
 
 they trudged up the misty field between long rows of tents most looked almost ordinary their owners had clearly tried to make them as as possible but had slipped up by adding chimneys or bellpulls or weather vanes however here and there was a tent so obviously magical that harry could hardly be surprised that mr roberts was getting suspicious halfway up the field stood an extravagant confection of striped silk like a miniature palace with several live peacocks tethered at the entrance a little farther on they passed a tent that had three floors and several turrets and a short way beyond that was a tent that had a front garden attached complete with birdbath sundial and fountain 
 
 always the same said mr weasley smiling we resist showing off when we get together ah here we are look this is us 
 
 they had reached the very edge of the wood at the top of the field and here was an empty space with a small sign hammered into the ground that read weezly 
 
 have a better spot said mr weasley happily the field is just on the other side of the wood there as close as we could be he hoisted his backpack from his shoulders right he said excitedly no magic allowed strictly speaking not when out in these numbers on muggle land be putting these tents up by hand be too do it all the harry where do you reckon we should start 
 
 harry had never been camping in his life the dursleys had never taken him on any kind of holiday preferring to leave him with mrs figg an old neighbor however he and hermione worked out where most of the poles and pegs should go and though mr weasley was more of a hindrance than a help because he got thoroughly overexcited when it came to using the mallet they finally managed to erect a pair of shabby tents 
 
 all of them stood back to admire their handiwork nobody looking at these tents would guess they belonged to wizards harry thought but the trouble was that once bill charlie and percy arrived they would be a party of ten hermione seemed to have spotted this problem too she gave harry a quizzical look as mr weasley dropped to his hands and knees and entered the first tent 
 
 be a bit cramped he called but i think all squeeze in come and have a look 
 
 harry bent down ducked under the tent flap and felt his jaw drop he had walked into what looked like an three room flat complete with bathroom and kitchen oddly enough it was furnished in exactly the same sort of style as mrs house there were crocheted covers on the mismatched chairs and a strong smell of cats 
 
 well not for long said mr weasley mopping his bald patch with a handkerchief and peering in at the four bunk beds that stood in the bedroom i borrowed this from perkins at the office camp much anymore poor fellow got lumbago 
 
 he picked up the dusty kettle and peered inside it need water 
 
 a tap marked on this map the muggle gave us said ron who had followed harry inside the tent and seemed completely unimpressed by its extraordinary inner proportions on the other side of the field 
 
 well why you harry and hermione go and get us some water then mr weasley handed over the kettle and a couple of saucepans and the rest of us will get some wood for a fire 
 
 but got an oven said ron why we just 
 
 ron security said mr weasley his face shining with anticipation when real muggles camp they cook on fires outdoors seen them at it 
 
 after a quick tour of the girls tent which was slightly smaller than the boys though without the smell of cats harry ron and hermione set off across the campsite with the kettle and saucepans 
 
 now with the sun newly risen and the mist lifting they could see the city of tents that stretched in every direction they made their way slowly through the rows staring eagerly around it was only just dawning on harry how many witches and wizards there must be in the world he had never really thought much about those in other countries 
 
 their fellow campers were starting to wake up first to stir were the families with small children harry had never seen witches and wizards this young before a tiny boy no older than two was crouched outside a large tent holding a wand and poking happily at a slug in the grass which was swelling slowly to the size of a salami as they drew level with him his mother came hurrying out of the tent 
 
 how many times kevin you touch wand yecchh 
 
 she had trodden on the giant slug which burst her scolding carried after them on the still air mingling with the little yells you bust slug you bust slug 
 
 a short way farther on they saw two little witches barely older than kevin who were riding toy broomsticks that rose only high enough for the girls toes to skim the dewy grass a ministry wizard had already spotted them as he hurried past harry ron and hermione he muttered distractedly in broad daylight parents having a i suppose 
 
 here and there adult wizards and witches were emerging from their tents and starting to cook breakfast some with furtive looks around them conjured fires with their wands others were striking matches with dubious looks on their faces as though sure this work three african wizards sat in serious conversation all of them wearing long white robes and roasting what looked like a rabbit on a bright purple fire while a group of american witches sat gossiping happily beneath a spangled banner stretched between their tents that read the salem witches institute harry caught snatches of conversation in strange languages from the inside of tents they passed and though he understand a word the tone of every single voice was excited 
 
 er is it my eyes or has everything gone green said ron 
 
 it just eyes they had walked into a patch of tents that were all covered with a thick growth of shamrocks so that it looked as though small oddly shaped hillocks had sprouted out of the earth grinning faces could be seen under those that had their flaps open then from behind them they heard their names 
 
 harry ron hermione 
 
 it was seamus finnigan their fellow gryffindor fourth year he was sitting in front of his own tent with a woman who had to be his mother and his best friend dean thomas also of gryffindor 
 
 like the decorations said seamus grinning the not too happy 
 
 ah why we show our colors said mrs finnigan you should see what the bulgarians have got dangling all over their tents be supporting ireland of course she added eyeing harry ron and hermione beadily when they had assured her that they were indeed supporting ireland they set off again though as ron said like say anything else surrounded by that lot 
 
 i wonder what the bulgarians have got dangling all over their tents said hermione 
 
 go and have a look said harry pointing to a large patch of tents upfield where the bulgarian flag white green and red was fluttering in the breeze 
 
 the tents here had not been bedecked with plant life but each and every one of them had the same poster attached to it a poster of a very surly face with heavy black eyebrows the picture was of course moving but all it did was blink and scowl 
 
 krum said ron quietly 
 
 what said hermione 
 
 krum said ron viktor krum the bulgarian seeker 
 
 he looks really grumpy said hermione looking around at the many blinking and scowling at them 
 
 really grumpy ron raised his eyes to the heavens who cares what he looks like unbelievable really young too only just eighteen or something a genius you wait until tonight see 
 
 there was already a small queue for the tap in the corner of the field harry ron and hermione joined it right behind a pair of men who were having a heated argument one of them was a very old wizard who was wearing a long flowery nightgown the other was clearly a ministry wizard he was holding out a pair of pinstriped trousers and almost crying with exasperation 
 
 just put them on archie a good chap you walk around like that the muggle at the already getting suspicious 
 
 i bought this in a muggle shop said the old wizard stubbornly muggles wear them 
 
 muggle women wear them archie not the men they wear these said the ministry wizard and he brandished the pinstriped trousers 
 
 not putting them on said old archie in indignation i like a healthy breeze round my privates thanks 
 
 hermione was overcome with such a strong fit of the giggles at this point that she had to duck out of the queue and only returned when archie had collected his water and moved away 
 
 walking more slowly now because of the weight of the water they made their way back through the campsite here and there they saw more familiar faces other hogwarts students with their families oliver wood the old captain of house quidditch team who had just left hogwarts dragged harry over to his parents tent to introduce him and told him excitedly that he had just been signed to the puddlemere united reserve team next they were hailed by ernie macmillan a hufflepuff fourth year and a little farther on they saw cho chang a very pretty girl who played seeker on the ravenclaw team she waved and smiled at harry who slopped quite a lot of water down his front as he waved back more to stop ron from smirking than anything harry hurriedly pointed out a large group of teenagers whom he had never seen before 
 
 who reckon they are he said they go to hogwarts do they 
 
 spect they go to some foreign school said ron i know there are others never met anyone who went to one though bill had a penfriend at a school in brazilthis was years and years agoand he wanted to go on an exchange trip but mum and dad afford it his penfriend got all offended when he said he going and sent him a cursed hat it made his ears shrivel up 
 
 harry laughed but voice the amazement he felt at hearing about other wizarding schools he supposed now that he saw representatives of so many nationalities in the campsite that he had been stupid never to realize that hogwarts be the only one he glanced at hermione who looked utterly unsurprised by the information no doubt she had run across the news about other wizarding schools in some book or other 
 
 been ages said george when they finally got back to the weasleys tents 
 
 met a few people said ron setting the water down not got that fire started yet 
 
 having fun with the matches said fred 
 
 mr weasley was having no success at all in lighting the fire but it for lack of trying splintered matches littered the ground around him but he looked as though he was having the time of his life 
 
 oops he said as he managed to light a match and promptly dropped it in surprise 
 
 come here mr weasley said hermione kindly taking the box from him and showing him how to do it properly 
 
 at last they got the fire lit though it was at least another hour before it was hot enough to cook anything there was plenty to watch while they waited however their tent seemed to be pitched right alongside a kind of thoroughfare to the field and ministry members kept hurrying up and down it greeting mr weasley cordially as they passed mr weasley kept up a running commentary mainly for and benefit his own children knew too much about the ministry to be greatly interested 
 
 that was cuthbert mockridge head of the goblin liaison comes gilbert wimple with the committee on experimental charms had those horns for a while nowhello arniearnold peasegood an obliviator member of the accidental magic reversal squad you knowand bode and unspeakables 
 
 what 
 
 from the department of mysteries top secret no idea what they get up to 
 
 at last the fire was ready and they had just started cooking eggs and sausages when bill charlie and percy came strolling out of the woods toward them 
 
 just apparated dad said percy loudly ah excellent lunch 
 
 they were halfway through their plates of eggs and sausages when mr weasley jumped to his feet waving and grinning at a man who was striding toward them aha he said the man of the moment ludo 
 
 ludo bagman was easily the most noticeable person harry had seen so far even including old archie in his flowered nightdress he was wearing long quidditch robes in thick horizontal stripes of bright yellow and black an enormous picture of a wasp was splashed across his chest he had the look of a powerfully built man gone slightly to seed the robes were stretched tightly across a large belly he surely had not had in the days when he had played quidditch for england his nose was squashed probably broken by a stray bludger harry thought but his round blue eyes short blond hair and rosy complexion made him look like a very overgrown schoolboy 
 
 ahoy there bagman called happily he was walking as though he had springs attached to the balls of his feet and was plainly in a state of wild excitement 
 
 arthur old man he puffed as he reached the campfire what a day eh what a day could we have asked for more perfect weather a cloudless night comingand hardly a hiccough in the much for me to do 
 
 behind him a group of ministry wizards rushed past pointing at the distant evidence of some sort of a magical fire that was sending violet sparks twenty feet into the air 
 
 percy hurried forward with his hand outstretched apparently his disapproval of the way ludo bagman ran his department did not prevent him from wanting to make a good impression 
 
 ah yes said mr weasley grinning this is my son percy just started at the ministry and this is fred no george sorry fred bill charlie ron my daughter ginny and friends hermione granger and harry potter 
 
 bagman did the smallest of double takes when he heard name and his eyes performed the familiar flick upward to the scar on forehead 
 
 everyone mr weasley continued this is ludo bagman you know who he is thanks to him got such good tickets 
 
 bagman beamed and waved his hand as if to say it had been nothing 
 
 fancy a flutter on the match arthur he said eagerly jingling what seemed to be a large amount of gold in the pockets of his robes already got roddy pontner betting me bulgaria will score first i offered him nice odds considering front three are the strongest seen in years and little agatha timms has put up half shares in her eel farm on a weeklong match 
 
 ohgo on then said mr weasley seea galleon on ireland to win 
 
 a galleon ludo bagman looked slightly disappointed but recovered himself very well very wellany other takers 
 
 a bit young to be gambling said mr weasley molly like 
 
 bet galleons fifteen sickles three knuts said fred as he and george quickly pooled all their money that ireland wins but viktor krum gets the snitch oh and throw in a fake wand 
 
 you want to go showing mr bagman rubbish like that percy hissed but bagman seem to think the wand was rubbish at all on the contrary his boyish face shone with excitement as he took it from fred and when the wand gave a loud squawk and turned into a rubber chicken bagman roared with laughter 
 
 excellent i seen one that convincing in years pay five galleons for that 
 
 percy froze in an attitude of stunned disapproval 
 
 boys said mr weasley under his breath i want you all your mother 
 
 be a spoilsport arthur boomed ludo bagman rattling his pockets excitedly old enough to know what they want you reckon ireland will win but get the snitch not a chance boys not a give you excellent odds on that add five galleons for the funny wand then shall we 
 
 mr weasley looked on helplessly as ludo bagman whipped out a notebook and quill and began jotting down the twins names 
 
 cheers said george taking the slip of parchment bagman handed him and tucking it away into the front of his robes bagman turned most cheerfully back to mr weasley 
 
 do me a brew i suppose keeping an eye out for barty crouch my bulgarian opposite making difficulties and i understand a word saying be able to sort it out he speaks about a hundred and fifty languages 
 
 mr crouch said percy suddenly abandoning his look of disapproval and positively writhing with excitement he speaks over two hundred mermish and gobbledegook and troll 
 
 anyone can speak troll said fred dismissively all you have to do is point and grunt 
 
 percy threw fred an extremely nasty look and stoked the fire vigorously to bring the kettle back to the boil 
 
 any news of bertha jorkins yet ludo mr weasley asked as bagman settled himself down on the grass beside them all 
 
 not a dicky bird said bagman comfortably but turn up poor old berthamemory like a leaky cauldron and no sense of direction lost you take my word for it wander back into the office sometime in october thinking still july 
 
 you think it might be time to send someone to look for her mr weasley suggested tentatively as percy handed bagman his tea 
 
 barty crouch keeps saying that said bagman his round eyes widening innocently but we really spare anyone at the moment oh talk of the devil barty 
 
 a wizard had just apparated at their fireside and he could not have made more of a contrast with ludo bagman sprawled on the grass in his old wasp robes barty crouch was a stiff upright elderly man dressed in an impeccably crisp suit and tie the parting in his short gray hair was almost unnaturally straight and his narrow toothbrush mustache looked as though he trimmed it using a slide rule his shoes were very highly polished harry could see at once why percy idolized him percy was a great believer in rigidly following rules and mr crouch had complied with the rule about muggle dressing so thoroughly that he could have passed for a bank manager harry doubted even uncle vernon would have spotted him for what he really was 
 
 pull up a bit of grass barry said ludo brightly patting the ground beside him 
 
 no thank you ludo said crouch and there was a bite of impatience in his voice been looking for you everywhere the bulgarians are insisting we add another twelve seats to the top box 
 
 oh is that what after said bagman i thought the chap was asking to borrow a pair of tweezers bit of a strong accent 
 
 mr crouch said percy breathlessly sunk into a kind of halfbow that made him look like a hunchback would you like a cup of tea 
 
 oh said mr crouch looking over at percy in mild surprise yes thank you weatherby 
 
 fred and george choked into their own cups percy very pink around the ears busied himself with the kettle 
 
 oh and been wanting a word with you too arthur said mr crouch his sharp eyes falling upon mr weasley ali on the warpath he wants a word with you about your embargo on flying carpets 
 
 mr weasley heaved a deep sigh 
 
 i sent him an owl about that just last week if told him once told him a hundred times carpets are defined as a muggle artifact by the registry of proscribed charmable objects but will he listen 
 
 i doubt it said mr crouch accepting a cup from percy desperate to export here 
 
 well never replace brooms in britain will they said bagman 
 
 ali thinks a niche in the market for a family vehicle said mr crouch i remember my grandfather had an axminster that could seat twelve but that was before carpets were banned of course 
 
 he spoke as though he wanted to leave nobody in any doubt that all his ancestors had abided strictly by the law 
 
 so been keeping busy barty said bagman breezily 
 
 fairly said mr crouch dryly organizing portkeys across five continents is no mean feat ludo 
 
 i expect both be glad when this is over said mr weasley 
 
 ludo bagman looked shocked 
 
 glad know when had more not as though we got anything to took forward to eh barty eh plenty left to organize eh 
 
 mr crouch raised his eyebrows at bagman 
 
 we agreed not to make the announcement until all the details 
 
 oh details said bagman waving the word away like a cloud of midges signed they agreed they i bet you anything these know soon enough anyway i mean happening at hogwarts 
 
 ludo we need to meet the bulgarians you know said mr crouch sharply cutting remarks short thank you for the tea weatherby 
 
 he pushed his undrunk tea back at percy and waited for ludo to rise bagman struggled to his feet swigging down the last of his tea the gold in his pockets chinking merrily 
 
 see you all later he said be up in the top box with me commentating he waved barty crouch nodded curtly and both of them disapparated 
 
 happening at hogwarts dad said fred at once what were they talking about 
 
 find out soon enough said smiling 
 
 classified information until such time as the ministry decides to release it said percy stiffly mr crouch was quite right not to disclose it 
 
 oh shut up weatherby said fred 
 
 a sense of excitement rose like a palpable cloud over the campsite as the afternoon wore on by dusk the still summer air itself seemed to be quivering with anticipation and as darkness spread like a curtain over the thousands of waiting wizards the last vestiges of pretence disappeared the ministry seemed to have bowed to the inevitable and stopped fighting the signs of blatant magic now breaking out everywhere 
 
 salesmen were apparating every few feet carrying trays and pushing carts full of extraordinary merchandise there were luminous rosettes green for ireland red for bulgaria which were squealing the names of the players pointed green hats bedecked with dancing shamrocks bulgarian scarves adorned with lions that really roared flags from both countries that played their national anthems as they were waved there were tiny models of firebolts that really flew and collectible figures of famous players which strolled across the palm of your hand preening themselves 
 
 been saving my pocket money all summer for this ron told harry as they and hermione strolled through the salesmen buying souvenirs though ron purchased a dancing shamrock hat and a large green rosette he also bought a small figure of viktor krum the bulgarian seeker the miniature krum walked backward and forward over hand scowling up at the green rosette above him 
 
 wow look at these said harry hurrying over to a cart piled high with what looked like brass binoculars except that they were covered with all sorts of weird knobs and dials 
 
 omnioculars said the saleswizard eagerly you can replay actionslow everything downand they flash up a breakdown if you need it bargain ten galleons each 
 
 wish i bought this now said ron gesturing at his dancing shamrock hat and gazing longingly at the omnioculars 
 
 three pairs said harry firmly to the wizard 
 
 no bother said ron going red he was always touchy about the fact that harry who had inherited a small fortune from his parents had much more money than he did 
 
 you be getting anything for christmas harry told him thrusting omnioculars into his and hands for about ten years mind 
 
 fair enough said ron grinning 
 
 oooh thanks harry said hermione and get us some programs look 
 
 their money bags considerably lighter they went back to the tents bill charlie and ginny were all sporting green rosettes too and mr weasley was carrying an irish flag fred and george had no souvenirs as they had given bagman all their gold 
 
 and then a deep booming gong sounded somewhere beyond the woods and at once green and red lanterns blazed into life in the trees lighting a path to the field 
 
 time said mr weasley looking as excited as any of them come on go 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the goblet of fire 
 

lionfish nov chapter seven bagman and crouchcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 harry disentangled himself from ron and got to his feet they had arrived on what appeared to be a deserted stretch of misty moor in front of them was a pair of tired and wizards one of whom was holding a large gold watch the other a thick roll of parchment and a quill both were dressed as muggles though very inexpertly the man with the watch wore a tweed suit with galoshes his colleague a kilt and a poncho 
 
 morning basil said mr weasley picking up the boot and handing it to the kilted wizard who threw it into a large box of used portkeys beside him harry could see an old newspaper an empty drinks can and a punctured football 
 
 hello there arthur said basil wearily not on duty eh all right for been here all better get out of the way got a big party coming in from the black forest at five fifteen hang on find your he consulted his parchment list about a quarter of a walk over there first field you come to site called mr roberts diggorysecond fieldask for mr payne 
 
 thanks basil said mr weasley and he beckoned everyone to follow him 
 
 they set off across the deserted moor unable to make out much through the mist after about twenty minutes a small stone cottage next to a gate swam into view beyond it harry could just make out the ghostly shapes of hundreds and hundreds of tents rising up the gentle slope of a large field toward a dark wood on the horizon they said to the and approached the cottage door 
 
 a man was standing in the doorway looking out at the tents harry knew at a glance that this was the only real muggle for several acres when he heard their footsteps he turned his head to look at them 
 
 morning said mr weasley brightly 
 
 morning said the muggle 
 
 would you be mr roberts 
 
 aye i would said mr roberts and you 
 
 weasley two tents booked a couple of days ago 
 
 aye said mr roberts consulting a list tacked to the door got a space up by the wood there just the one night 
 
 it said mr weasley 
 
 be paying now then said mr roberts 
 
 ah right certainly said mr weasley he retreated a short distance from the cottage and beckoned harry toward him help me harry he muttered pulling a roll of muggle money from his pocket and starting to peel the notes apart this a a a ten ah yes i see the little number on it nowso this is a five 
 
 a twenty harry corrected him in an undertone uncomfortably aware of mr roberts trying to catch every word 
 
 ah yes so it know these little bits of paper 
 
 you foreign said mr roberts as mr weasley returned with the correct notes 
 
 foreign repeated mr weasley puzzled 
 
 not the first one had trouble with money said mr roberts scrutinizing mr weasley closely i had two try and pay me with great gold coins the size of hubcaps ten minutes ago 
 
 did you really said mr weasley nervously 
 
 mr roberts rummaged around in a tin for some change 
 
 never been this crowded he said suddenly looking out over the misty field again hundreds of people usually just turn up 
 
 is that right said mr weasley his hand held out for his change but mr roberts give it to him 
 
 aye he said thoughtfully people from all over loads of foreigners and not just foreigners weirdos you know a bloke walking round in a kilt and a poncho 
 
 he said mr weasley anxiously 
 
 like some sort ofi dunnolike some sort of rally said mr roberts they all seem to know each other like a big party 
 
 at that moment a wizard in appeared out of thin air next to mr front door 
 
 obliviate he said sharply pointing his wand at mr roberts 
 
 instantly mr eyes slid out of focus his brows unknitted and a took of dreamy unconcern fell over his face harry recognized the symptoms of one who had just had his memory modified 
 
 a map of the campsite for you mr roberts said placidly to mr weasley and your change 
 
 thanks very much said mr weasley 
 
 the wizard in accompanied them toward the gate to the campsite he looked exhausted his chin was blue with stubble and there were deep purple shadows under his eyes once out of earshot of mr roberts he muttered to mr weasley been having a lot of trouble with him needs a memory charm ten times a day to keep him happy and ludo not helping trotting around talking about bludgers and quaffles at the top of his voice not a worry about security blimey be glad when this is over see you later arthur 
 
 he disapparated 
 
 i thought mr bagman was head of magical games and sports said ginny looking surprised he should know better than to talk about bludgers near muggles he 
 
 he should said mr weasley smiling and leading them through the gates into the campsite but always been a bitwelllax about security you wish for a more enthusiastic head of the sports department though he played quidditch for england himself you know and he was the best beater the wimbourne wasps ever had 
 
 they trudged up the misty field between long rows of tents most looked almost ordinary their owners had clearly tried to make them as as possible but had slipped up by adding chimneys or bellpulls or weather vanes however here and there was a tent so obviously magical that harry could hardly be surprised that mr roberts was getting suspicious halfway up the field stood an extravagant confection of striped silk like a miniature palace with several live peacocks tethered at the entrance a little farther on they passed a tent that had three floors and several turrets and a short way beyond that was a tent that had a front garden attached complete with birdbath sundial and fountain 
 
 always the same said mr weasley smiling we resist showing off when we get together ah here we are look this is us 
 
 they had reached the very edge of the wood at the top of the field and here was an empty space with a small sign hammered into the ground that read weezly 
 
 have a better spot said mr weasley happily the field is just on the other side of the wood there as close as we could be he hoisted his backpack from his shoulders right he said excitedly no magic allowed strictly speaking not when out in these numbers on muggle land be putting these tents up by hand be too do it all the harry where do you reckon we should start 
 
 harry had never been camping in his life the dursleys had never taken him on any kind of holiday preferring to leave him with mrs figg an old neighbor however he and hermione worked out where most of the poles and pegs should go and though mr weasley was more of a hindrance than a help because he got thoroughly overexcited when it came to using the mallet they finally managed to erect a pair of shabby tents 
 
 all of them stood back to admire their handiwork nobody looking at these tents would guess they belonged to wizards harry thought but the trouble was that once bill charlie and percy arrived they would be a party of ten hermione seemed to have spotted this problem too she gave harry a quizzical look as mr weasley dropped to his hands and knees and entered the first tent 
 
 be a bit cramped he called but i think all squeeze in come and have a look 
 
 harry bent down ducked under the tent flap and felt his jaw drop he had walked into what looked like an three room flat complete with bathroom and kitchen oddly enough it was furnished in exactly the same sort of style as mrs house there were crocheted covers on the mismatched chairs and a strong smell of cats 
 
 well not for long said mr weasley mopping his bald patch with a handkerchief and peering in at the four bunk beds that stood in the bedroom i borrowed this from perkins at the office camp much anymore poor fellow got lumbago 
 
 he picked up the dusty kettle and peered inside it need water 
 
 a tap marked on this map the muggle gave us said ron who had followed harry inside the tent and seemed completely unimpressed by its extraordinary inner proportions on the other side of the field 
 
 well why you harry and hermione go and get us some water then mr weasley handed over the kettle and a couple of saucepans and the rest of us will get some wood for a fire 
 
 but got an oven said ron why we just 
 
 ron security said mr weasley his face shining with anticipation when real muggles camp they cook on fires outdoors seen them at it 
 
 after a quick tour of the girls tent which was slightly smaller than the boys though without the smell of cats harry ron and hermione set off across the campsite with the kettle and saucepans 
 
 now with the sun newly risen and the mist lifting they could see the city of tents that stretched in every direction they made their way slowly through the rows staring eagerly around it was only just dawning on harry how many witches and wizards there must be in the world he had never really thought much about those in other countries 
 
 their fellow campers were starting to wake up first to stir were the families with small children harry had never seen witches and wizards this young before a tiny boy no older than two was crouched outside a large tent holding a wand and poking happily at a slug in the grass which was swelling slowly to the size of a salami as they drew level with him his mother came hurrying out of the tent 
 
 how many times kevin you touch wand yecchh 
 
 she had trodden on the giant slug which burst her scolding carried after them on the still air mingling with the little yells you bust slug you bust slug 
 
 a short way farther on they saw two little witches barely older than kevin who were riding toy broomsticks that rose only high enough for the girls toes to skim the dewy grass a ministry wizard had already spotted them as he hurried past harry ron and hermione he muttered distractedly in broad daylight parents having a i suppose 
 
 here and there adult wizards and witches were emerging from their tents and starting to cook breakfast some with furtive looks around them conjured fires with their wands others were striking matches with dubious looks on their faces as though sure this work three african wizards sat in serious conversation all of them wearing long white robes and roasting what looked like a rabbit on a bright purple fire while a group of american witches sat gossiping happily beneath a spangled banner stretched between their tents that read the salem witches institute harry caught snatches of conversation in strange languages from the inside of tents they passed and though he understand a word the tone of every single voice was excited 
 
 er is it my eyes or has everything gone green said ron 
 
 it just eyes they had walked into a patch of tents that were all covered with a thick growth of shamrocks so that it looked as though small oddly shaped hillocks had sprouted out of the earth grinning faces could be seen under those that had their flaps open then from behind them they heard their names 
 
 harry ron hermione 
 
 it was seamus finnigan their fellow gryffindor fourth year he was sitting in front of his own tent with a woman who had to be his mother and his best friend dean thomas also of gryffindor 
 
 like the decorations said seamus grinning the not too happy 
 
 ah why we show our colors said mrs finnigan you should see what the bulgarians have got dangling all over their tents be supporting ireland of course she added eyeing harry ron and hermione beadily when they had assured her that they were indeed supporting ireland they set off again though as ron said like say anything else surrounded by that lot 
 
 i wonder what the bulgarians have got dangling all over their tents said hermione 
 
 go and have a look said harry pointing to a large patch of tents upfield where the bulgarian flag white green and red was fluttering in the breeze 
 
 the tents here had not been bedecked with plant life but each and every one of them had the same poster attached to it a poster of a very surly face with heavy black eyebrows the picture was of course moving but all it did was blink and scowl 
 
 krum said ron quietly 
 
 what said hermione 
 
 krum said ron viktor krum the bulgarian seeker 
 
 he looks really grumpy said hermione looking around at the many blinking and scowling at them 
 
 really grumpy ron raised his eyes to the heavens who cares what he looks like unbelievable really young too only just eighteen or something a genius you wait until tonight see 
 
 there was already a small queue for the tap in the corner of the field harry ron and hermione joined it right behind a pair of men who were having a heated argument one of them was a very old wizard who was wearing a long flowery nightgown the other was clearly a ministry wizard he was holding out a pair of pinstriped trousers and almost crying with exasperation 
 
 just put them on archie a good chap you walk around like that the muggle at the already getting suspicious 
 
 i bought this in a muggle shop said the old wizard stubbornly muggles wear them 
 
 muggle women wear them archie not the men they wear these said the ministry wizard and he brandished the pinstriped trousers 
 
 not putting them on said old archie in indignation i like a healthy breeze round my privates thanks 
 
 hermione was overcome with such a strong fit of the giggles at this point that she had to duck out of the queue and only returned when archie had collected his water and moved away 
 
 walking more slowly now because of the weight of the water they made their way back through the campsite here and there they saw more familiar faces other hogwarts students with their families oliver wood the old captain of house quidditch team who had just left hogwarts dragged harry over to his parents tent to introduce him and told him excitedly that he had just been signed to the puddlemere united reserve team next they were hailed by ernie macmillan a hufflepuff fourth year and a little farther on they saw cho chang a very pretty girl who played seeker on the ravenclaw team she waved and smiled at harry who slopped quite a lot of water down his front as he waved back more to stop ron from smirking than anything harry hurriedly pointed out a large group of teenagers whom he had never seen before 
 
 who reckon they are he said they go to hogwarts do they 
 
 spect they go to some foreign school said ron i know there are others never met anyone who went to one though bill had a penfriend at a school in brazilthis was years and years agoand he wanted to go on an exchange trip but mum and dad afford it his penfriend got all offended when he said he going and sent him a cursed hat it made his ears shrivel up 
 
 harry laughed but voice the amazement he felt at hearing about other wizarding schools he supposed now that he saw representatives of so many nationalities in the campsite that he had been stupid never to realize that hogwarts be the only one he glanced at hermione who looked utterly unsurprised by the information no doubt she had run across the news about other wizarding schools in some book or other 
 
 been ages said george when they finally got back to the weasleys tents 
 
 met a few people said ron setting the water down not got that fire started yet 
 
 having fun with the matches said fred 
 
 mr weasley was having no success at all in lighting the fire but it for lack of trying splintered matches littered the ground around him but he looked as though he was having the time of his life 
 
 oops he said as he managed to light a match and promptly dropped it in surprise 
 
 come here mr weasley said hermione kindly taking the box from him and showing him how to do it properly 
 
 at last they got the fire lit though it was at least another hour before it was hot enough to cook anything there was plenty to watch while they waited however their tent seemed to be pitched right alongside a kind of thoroughfare to the field and ministry members kept hurrying up and down it greeting mr weasley cordially as they passed mr weasley kept up a running commentary mainly for and benefit his own children knew too much about the ministry to be greatly interested 
 
 that was cuthbert mockridge head of the goblin liaison comes gilbert wimple with the committee on experimental charms had those horns for a while nowhello arniearnold peasegood an obliviator member of the accidental magic reversal squad you knowand bode and unspeakables 
 
 what 
 
 from the department of mysteries top secret no idea what they get up to 
 
 at last the fire was ready and they had just started cooking eggs and sausages when bill charlie and percy came strolling out of the woods toward them 
 
 just apparated dad said percy loudly ah excellent lunch 
 
 they were halfway through their plates of eggs and sausages when mr weasley jumped to his feet waving and grinning at a man who was striding toward them aha he said the man of the moment ludo 
 
 ludo bagman was easily the most noticeable person harry had seen so far even including old archie in his flowered nightdress he was wearing long quidditch robes in thick horizontal stripes of bright yellow and black an enormous picture of a wasp was splashed across his chest he had the look of a powerfully built man gone slightly to seed the robes were stretched tightly across a large belly he surely had not had in the days when he had played quidditch for england his nose was squashed probably broken by a stray bludger harry thought but his round blue eyes short blond hair and rosy complexion made him look like a very overgrown schoolboy 
 
 ahoy there bagman called happily he was walking as though he had springs attached to the balls of his feet and was plainly in a state of wild excitement 
 
 arthur old man he puffed as he reached the campfire what a day eh what a day could we have asked for more perfect weather a cloudless night comingand hardly a hiccough in the much for me to do 
 
 behind him a group of ministry wizards rushed past pointing at the distant evidence of some sort of a magical fire that was sending violet sparks twenty feet into the air 
 
 percy hurried forward with his hand outstretched apparently his disapproval of the way ludo bagman ran his department did not prevent him from wanting to make a good impression 
 
 ah yes said mr weasley grinning this is my son percy just started at the ministry and this is fred no george sorry fred bill charlie ron my daughter ginny and friends hermione granger and harry potter 
 
 bagman did the smallest of double takes when he heard name and his eyes performed the familiar flick upward to the scar on forehead 
 
 everyone mr weasley continued this is ludo bagman you know who he is thanks to him got such good tickets 
 
 bagman beamed and waved his hand as if to say it had been nothing 
 
 fancy a flutter on the match arthur he said eagerly jingling what seemed to be a large amount of gold in the pockets of his robes already got roddy pontner betting me bulgaria will score first i offered him nice odds considering front three are the strongest seen in years and little agatha timms has put up half shares in her eel farm on a weeklong match 
 
 ohgo on then said mr weasley seea galleon on ireland to win 
 
 a galleon ludo bagman looked slightly disappointed but recovered himself very well very wellany other takers 
 
 a bit young to be gambling said mr weasley molly like 
 
 bet galleons fifteen sickles three knuts said fred as he and george quickly pooled all their money that ireland wins but viktor krum gets the snitch oh and throw in a fake wand 
 
 you want to go showing mr bagman rubbish like that percy hissed but bagman seem to think the wand was rubbish at all on the contrary his boyish face shone with excitement as he took it from fred and when the wand gave a loud squawk and turned into a rubber chicken bagman roared with laughter 
 
 excellent i seen one that convincing in years pay five galleons for that 
 
 percy froze in an attitude of stunned disapproval 
 
 boys said mr weasley under his breath i want you all your mother 
 
 be a spoilsport arthur boomed ludo bagman rattling his pockets excitedly old enough to know what they want you reckon ireland will win but get the snitch not a chance boys not a give you excellent odds on that add five galleons for the funny wand then shall we 
 
 mr weasley looked on helplessly as ludo bagman whipped out a notebook and quill and began jotting down the twins names 
 
 cheers said george taking the slip of parchment bagman handed him and tucking it away into the front of his robes bagman turned most cheerfully back to mr weasley 
 
 do me a brew i suppose keeping an eye out for barty crouch my bulgarian opposite making difficulties and i understand a word saying be able to sort it out he speaks about a hundred and fifty languages 
 
 mr crouch said percy suddenly abandoning his look of disapproval and positively writhing with excitement he speaks over two hundred mermish and gobbledegook and troll 
 
 anyone can speak troll said fred dismissively all you have to do is point and grunt 
 
 percy threw fred an extremely nasty look and stoked the fire vigorously to bring the kettle back to the boil 
 
 any news of bertha jorkins yet ludo mr weasley asked as bagman settled himself down on the grass beside them all 
 
 not a dicky bird said bagman comfortably but turn up poor old berthamemory like a leaky cauldron and no sense of direction lost you take my word for it wander back into the office sometime in october thinking still july 
 
 you think it might be time to send someone to look for her mr weasley suggested tentatively as percy handed bagman his tea 
 
 barty crouch keeps saying that said bagman his round eyes widening innocently but we really spare anyone at the moment oh talk of the devil barty 
 
 a wizard had just apparated at their fireside and he could not have made more of a contrast with ludo bagman sprawled on the grass in his old wasp robes barty crouch was a stiff upright elderly man dressed in an impeccably crisp suit and tie the parting in his short gray hair was almost unnaturally straight and his narrow toothbrush mustache looked as though he trimmed it using a slide rule his shoes were very highly polished harry could see at once why percy idolized him percy was a great believer in rigidly following rules and mr crouch had complied with the rule about muggle dressing so thoroughly that he could have passed for a bank manager harry doubted even uncle vernon would have spotted him for what he really was 
 
 pull up a bit of grass barry said ludo brightly patting the ground beside him 
 
 no thank you ludo said crouch and there was a bite of impatience in his voice been looking for you everywhere the bulgarians are insisting we add another twelve seats to the top box 
 
 oh is that what after said bagman i thought the chap was asking to borrow a pair of tweezers bit of a strong accent 
 
 mr crouch said percy breathlessly sunk into a kind of halfbow that made him look like a hunchback would you like a cup of tea 
 
 oh said mr crouch looking over at percy in mild surprise yes thank you weatherby 
 
 fred and george choked into their own cups percy very pink around the ears busied himself with the kettle 
 
 oh and been wanting a word with you too arthur said mr crouch his sharp eyes falling upon mr weasley ali on the warpath he wants a word with you about your embargo on flying carpets 
 
 mr weasley heaved a deep sigh 
 
 i sent him an owl about that just last week if told him once told him a hundred times carpets are defined as a muggle artifact by the registry of proscribed charmable objects but will he listen 
 
 i doubt it said mr crouch accepting a cup from percy desperate to export here 
 
 well never replace brooms in britain will they said bagman 
 
 ali thinks a niche in the market for a family vehicle said mr crouch i remember my grandfather had an axminster that could seat twelve but that was before carpets were banned of course 
 
 he spoke as though he wanted to leave nobody in any doubt that all his ancestors had abided strictly by the law 
 
 so been keeping busy barty said bagman breezily 
 
 fairly said mr crouch dryly organizing portkeys across five continents is no mean feat ludo 
 
 i expect both be glad when this is over said mr weasley 
 
 ludo bagman looked shocked 
 
 glad know when had more not as though we got anything to took forward to eh barty eh plenty left to organize eh 
 
 mr crouch raised his eyebrows at bagman 
 
 we agreed not to make the announcement until all the details 
 
 oh details said bagman waving the word away like a cloud of midges signed they agreed they i bet you anything these know soon enough anyway i mean happening at hogwarts 
 
 ludo we need to meet the bulgarians you know said mr crouch sharply cutting remarks short thank you for the tea weatherby 
 
 he pushed his undrunk tea back at percy and waited for ludo to rise bagman struggled to his feet swigging down the last of his tea the gold in his pockets chinking merrily 
 
 see you all later he said be up in the top box with me commentating he waved barty crouch nodded curtly and both of them disapparated 
 
 happening at hogwarts dad said fred at once what were they talking about 
 
 find out soon enough said smiling 
 
 classified information until such time as the ministry decides to release it said percy stiffly mr crouch was quite right not to disclose it 
 
 oh shut up weatherby said fred 
 
 a sense of excitement rose like a palpable cloud over the campsite as the afternoon wore on by dusk the still summer air itself seemed to be quivering with anticipation and as darkness spread like a curtain over the thousands of waiting wizards the last vestiges of pretence disappeared the ministry seemed to have bowed to the inevitable and stopped fighting the signs of blatant magic now breaking out everywhere 
 
 salesmen were apparating every few feet carrying trays and pushing carts full of extraordinary merchandise there were luminous rosettes green for ireland red for bulgaria which were squealing the names of the players pointed green hats bedecked with dancing shamrocks bulgarian scarves adorned with lions that really roared flags from both countries that played their national anthems as they were waved there were tiny models of firebolts that really flew and collectible figures of famous players which strolled across the palm of your hand preening themselves 
 
 been saving my pocket money all summer for this ron told harry as they and hermione strolled through the salesmen buying souvenirs though ron purchased a dancing shamrock hat and a large green rosette he also bought a small figure of viktor krum the bulgarian seeker the miniature krum walked backward and forward over hand scowling up at the green rosette above him 
 
 wow look at these said harry hurrying over to a cart piled high with what looked like brass binoculars except that they were covered with all sorts of weird knobs and dials 
 
 omnioculars said the saleswizard eagerly you can replay actionslow everything downand they flash up a breakdown if you need it bargain ten galleons each 
 
 wish i bought this now said ron gesturing at his dancing shamrock hat and gazing longingly at the omnioculars 
 
 three pairs said harry firmly to the wizard 
 
 no bother said ron going red he was always touchy about the fact that harry who had inherited a small fortune from his parents had much more money than he did 
 
 you be getting anything for christmas harry told him thrusting omnioculars into his and hands for about ten years mind 
 
 fair enough said ron grinning 
 
 oooh thanks harry said hermione and get us some programs look
