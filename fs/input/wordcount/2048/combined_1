 athenian stranger and now having made an end of the preliminarieswe will proceed to the appointment of magistracies 
 cleinias very good 
 ath in the ordering of a state there are two parts first thenumber of the magistracies and the mode of establishing them when they have been established laws again will have tobe provided for each of them suitable in nature and number butbefore electing the magistrates let us stop a little and say a word inseason about the election of them 
 cle what have you got to say 
 ath this is what i have to say every one can see that althoughthe work of legislation is a most important matter yet if city superadd to good laws unsuitable offices not onlywill there be no use in having the good only will they beridiculous and useless but the greatest political injury and evilwill accrue from them 
 cle of course 
 ath then now my friend let us observe what will happen in theconstitution of out intended state in the first place you willacknowledge that those who are duly appointed to magisterial their families should severally have given satisfactory proofof what they are from youth upward until the time of election in thenext place those who are to elect should have been trained inhabits of law and be well educated that they may have a rightjudgment and may be able to select or reject men whom they approve ordisapprove as they are worthy of either but how can we imaginethat those who are brought together for the first time and arestrangers to one another and also uneducated will avoid makingmistakes in the choice of magistrates 
 cle impossible 
 ath the matter is serious and excuses will not serve the turn iwill tell you then what you and i will have to do since you as youtell me with nine others have offered to settle the new state onbehalf of the people of crete and i am to help you by the inventionof the present romance i certainly should not like to leave thetale wandering all over the world without a headless monsteris such a hideous thing 
 cle excellent stranger 
 ath yes and i will be as good as my word 
 cle let us by all means do as you propose 
 ath that we will by the grace of god if old age will onlypermit us 
 cle but god will be gracious 
 ath yes and under his guidance let us consider further point 
 cle what is it 
 ath let us remember what a courageously mad and daring creationthis our city is 
 cle what had you in your mind when you said that 
 ath i had in my mind the free and easy manner in which we areordaining that the inexperienced colonists shall receive our laws nowa man need not be very wise cleinias in order to see that no one caneasily receive laws at their first imposition but if we couldanyhow wait until those who have been imbued with them from have been nurtured in them and become habituated to them taketheir part in the public elections of the state i say if thiscould be accomplished and rightly accomplished by any way i think that there would be very little danger atthe end of the time of a state thus trained not being permanent 
 cle a reasonable supposition 
 ath then let us consider if we can find any way out of thedifficulty for i maintain cleinias that the cnosians above all theother cretans should not be satisfied with barely discharging theirduty to the colony but they ought to take the utmost pains toestablish the offices which are first created by them in the bestand surest manner above all this applies to the selection of theguardians of the law who must be chosen first of all and with thegreatest care the others are of less importance 
 cle what method can we devise of electing them 
 ath this will be the of the cretans i shall say tothem inasmuch as the cnosians have precedence over the otherstates they should in common with those who join this a body of in all nineteen of them being takenfrom the settlers and the remainder from the citizens of cnosus ofthose latter the cnosians shall make a present to your colony and youyourself shall be one of the eighteen and shall become a citizen ofthe new state and if you and they cannot be persuaded to go thecnosians may fairly use a little violence in order to make you 
 cle but why stranger do not you and megillus take a part in ournew city 
 ath o cleinias athens is proud and sparta too and they are botha long way off but you and likewise the other colonists areconveniently situated as you describe i have been speaking of the wayin which the new citizens may be best managed under presentcircumstances but in if the city continues to the election be on this wise all who are horse or footsoldiers or have seen military service at the proper ages when theywere severally fitted for it shall share in the election ofmagistrates and the election shall be held in whatever temple thestate deems most venerable and every one shall carry his vote tothe altar of the god writing down on a tablet the name of theperson for whom he votes and his name and his tribe andward and at the side he shall write his own name in like one who pleases may take away any tablet which he does not thinkproperly filled up and exhibit it in the agara for a period of notless than thirty days the tablets which are judged to be first tothe number of shall be shown by the magistrates to the wholecity and the citizens shall in like manner select from these thecandidates whom they prefer and this second selection to thenumber of shall be again exhibited to the citizens in the any one who pleases select whom pleases out of the walkingthrough the parts of victims and let them choose for magistratesand proclaim the seven and thirty who have the greatest number ofvotes but who cleinias and megillus will order for us in the colonyall this matter of the magistrates and the scrutinies of them ifwe reflect we shall see that cities which are in process ofconstruction like ours must have some such persons who cannotpossibly be elected before there are any magistrates and yet theymust be elected in some way and they are not to be inferior the best possible for as the proverb says a good beginning ishalf the business and to have begun well is praised by all and inmy opinion is a great deal more than half the business and hasnever been praised by any one enough 
 cle that is very true 
 ath then let us recognize the difficulty and make clear to our ownminds how the beginning is to be accomplished there is only oneproposal which i have to offer and that is one which under ourcircumstances is both necessary and expedient 
 cle what is it 
 ath i maintain that this colony of ours has a father and are no other than the colonizing state well i know that manycolonies have been and will be at enmity with their parents butin early days the child as in a family loves and is beloved even ifthere come a time later when the tie is broken still while he isin want of education he naturally loves his parents and is beloved bythem and flies to his relatives for protection and finds in them hisonly natural allies in time of need and this parental feeling alreadyexists in the cnosians as is shown by their care of the new city andthere is a similar feeling on the part of the young city towardscnosus and i repeat what i was there is no harm inrepeating a good the cnosians should take a common interestin all these matters and choose as far as they can the eldest andbest of the colonists to the number of not less than a hundred andlet there be another hundred of the cnosians themselves these i their arrival should have a joint care that the magistrates shouldbe appointed according to law and that when they are appointed theyshould undergo a scrutiny when this has been effected the cnosiansshall return home and the new city do the best she can for her ownpreservation and happiness i would have the now andin all future time chosen to fulfil the following the first place be the guardians of the law and secondly of theregisters in which each one registers before the magistrate the amountof his property excepting four minae which are allowed to citizens ofthe first class three allowed to the second two to the third anda single mina to the fourth and if any one despising the laws forthe sake of gain be found to possess anything more which has not beenregistered let all that he has in excess be confiscated and lethim be liable to a suit which shall be the reverse of honourable orfortunate and let any one who will indict him on the charge ofloving base gains and proceed against him before the guardians of thelaw and if he be cast let him lose his share of the publicpossessions and when there is any public distribution let him havenothing but his original lot and let him be written down acondemned man as long as he lives in some place in which any onewho pleases can read about his onces the guardian of the law shallnot hold office longer than twenty years and shall not be less thanfifty years of age when he is elected or if he is elected when heis sixty years of age he shall hold office for ten years only andupon the same principle he must not imagine that he will be permittedto hold such an important office as that of guardian of the laws afterhe is seventy years of age if he live so long 
 these are the three first ordinances about the guardians of the the work of legislation progresses each law in turn will assign tothem their further duties and now we may proceed in order to speak ofthe election of other officers for generals have to be elected andthese again must have their ministers commanders and colonels ofhorse and commanders of brigades of foot who would be more rightlycalled by their popular name of brigadiers the guardians of the lawshall propose as generals men who are natives of the city and aselection from the candidates proposed shall be made by those whoare or have been of the age for military service and if one who isnot proposed is thought by somebody to be better than one who him name whom he prefers in the place of whom and make oaththat he is better and propose him and whichever of them isapproved by vote shall be admitted to the final selection and thethree who have the greatest number of votes shall be appointedgenerals and superintendents of military affairs after previouslyundergoing a scrutiny like the guardians of the law and let thegenerals thus elected propose twelve brigadiers one for each there shall be a right of counterproposal as in the case of thegenerals and the voting and decision shall take place in the sameway until the prytanes and council are elected the guardians ofthe law shall convene the assembly in some holy spot which is suitableto the purpose placing the hoplites by themselves and the cavalry bythemselves and in a third division all the rest of the army allare to vote for the generals and for the colonels of horse butthe brigadiers are to be voted for only by those who carry the hoplites let the body of cavalry choose phylarchs forthe generals but captains of light troops or archers or any otherdivision of the army shall be appointed by the generals forthemselves there only remains the appointment of officers of shall be proposed by the same persons who proposed the the election and the of other candidates shall bearranged in the same way as in the case of the generals and let thecavalry vote and the infantry look on at the election the two whohave the greatest number of votes shall be the leaders of all thehorse disputes about the voting may be raised once or twice but ifthe dispute be raised a third time the officers who preside at theseveral elections shall decide 
 the council shall consist of x members will be aconvenient number for if we divide the whole number intofour parts of ninety each we get ninety counsellors for each all the citizens shall select candidates from the firstclass they shall be compelled to vote and if they do not shallbe duly fined when the candidates have been selected some oneshall mark them down this shall be the business of the first day andon the following day candidates shall be selected from the secondclass in the same manner and under the same conditions as on theprevious day and on the third day a selection shall be made fromthe third class at which every one may if he likes vote and thethree first classes shall be compelled to vote but the fourth andlowest class shall be under no compulsion and any member of thisclass who does not vote shall not be punished on the fourth daycandidates shall be selected from the fourth and smallest shall be selected by all but he who is of the fourth class shallsuffer no penalty nor he who is of the third if he be not willing tovote but he who is of the first or second class if he does notvote shall be who is of the second class shall pay a fineof triple the amount which was exacted at first and he who is ofthe first class quadruple on the fifth day the rulers shall bring outthe names noted down for all the citizens to see and every man shallchoose out of them under pain if he do not of suffering the firstpenalty and when they have chosen out of each of the classes theyshall choose of them by lot who shall undergo are to form the council for the year 
 the mode of election which has been described is in a mean betweenmonarchy and democracy and such a mean the state ought always toobserve for servants and masters never can be friends nor good andbad merely because they are declared to have equal privileges for tounequals equals become unequal if they are not harmonized by both by reason of equality and by reason of inequality citiesare filled with seditions the old saying that equality makesfriendship is happy and also true but there is obscurity andconfusion as to what sort of equality is meant for there are twoequalities which are called by the same name but are in reality inmany ways almost the opposite of one another one of them may beintroduced without difficulty by any state or any legislator in thedistribution of honours this is the rule of measure weight andnumber which regulates and apportions them but there is anotherequality of a better and higher kind which is not so easilyrecognized this is the judgment of zeus among men it avails butlittle that little however is the source of the greatest good toindividuals and states for it gives to the greater more and to theinferior less and in proportion to the nature of each and above honour always to the greater virtue and to the less less andto either in proportion to their respective measure of virtue andeducation and this is justice and is ever the true principle ofstates at which we ought to aim and according to this rule order thenew city which is now being founded and any other city which may behereafter founded to this the legislator should to theinterests of tyrants one or more or to the power of the people butto justice always which as i was saying the distribution of naturalequality among unequals in each case but there are times at whichevery state is compelled to use the words just equal in asecondary sense in the hope of escaping in some degree from equity and indulgence are infractions of the perfect and strictrule of justice and this is the reason why we are obliged to usethe equality of the lot in order to avoid the discontent of thepeople and so we invoke god and fortune in our prayers and begthat they themselves will direct the lot with a view to supremejustice and therefore although we are compelled to use bothequalities we should use that into which the element of chance entersas seldom as possible 
 thus o my friends and for the reasons given should a state actwhich would endure and be saved but as a ship sailing on the seahas to be watched night and day in like manner a city also is sailingon a sea of politics and is liable to all sorts of insidiousassaults and therefore from morning to night and from night tomorning rulers must join hands with rulers and watchers withwatchers receiving and giving up their trust in a perpetualsuccession now a multitude can never fulfil a duty of this sortwith anything like energy moreover the greater number of thesenators will have to be left during the greater part of the year toorder their concerns at their own homes they will therefore have tobe arranged in twelve portions answering to the twelve months andfurnish guardians of the state each portion for a single month theirbusiness is to be at hand and receive any foreigner or citizen whocomes to them whether to give information or to put one of thosequestions to which when asked by other cities a city should give ananswer and to which if she ask them herself she should receive ananswer or again when there is a likelihood of internal are always liable to happen in some form or other they will ifthey can prevent their occurring or if they have already lose time in making them known to the city and healing the also this which is the presiding body of the state oughtalways to have the control of their assemblies and of thedissolutions of them ordinary as well as extraordinary all this isto be ordered by the twelfth part of the council which is always tokeep watch together with the other officers of the state during oneportion of the year and to rest during the remaining eleven portions 
 thus will the city be fairly ordered and now who is to have thesuperintendence of the country and what shall be the that the whole city and the entire country have been both ofthem divided into twelve portions ought there not to be appointedsuperintendents of the streets of the city and of the houses andbuildings and harbours and the agora and fountains and sacreddomains and temples and the like 
 cle to be sure there ought 
 ath let us assume then that there ought to be servants of thetemples and priests and priestesses there must also besuperintendents of roads and buddings who will have a care of they may do no harm and also of beasts both within theenclosure and in the suburbs three kinds of officers will thus haveto be appointed in order that the city may be suitably providedaccording to her needs those who have the care of the city shall becalled wardens of the city and those who have the care of the agorashall be called wardens of the agora and those who have the care ofthe temples shall be called priests those who hold hereditary officesas priests or priestesses shall not be disturbed but if there be fewor none such as is probable at the foundation of a new and priestesses shall be appointed to be servants of thegods who have no servants some of our officers shall be others appointed by lot those who are of the people and those whoare not of the people mingling in a friendly manner in every place andcity that the state may be as far as possible of one mind theofficers of the temples shall be appointed by lot in this way theirelection will be committed to god that he may do what is agreeable tohim and he who obtains a lot shall undergo a scrutiny first as towhether he is sound of body and of legitimate birth and in the secondplace in order to show that he is of a perfectly pure family notstained with homicide or any similar impiety in his own person andalso that his father and mother have led a similar unstained life nowthe laws about all divine things should be brought from delphi andinterpreters appointed under whose direction they should be used thetenure of the priesthood should always be for a year and no he who will duly execute the sacred office according to thelaws of religion must be not less than sixty years of lawsshall be the same about priestesses as for the interpreters theyshall be appointed the twelve tribes be distributed intogroups of four and let each group select four one out of eachtribe within the group three times and let the three who have thegreatest number of votes out of the twelve appointed by eachgroup after undergoing a scrutiny nine in all be sent to order that the god may return one out of each triad their ageshall be the same as that of the priests and the scrutiny of themshall be conducted in the same manner let them be interpreters forlife and when any one dies let the four tribes select another fromthe tribe of the deceased moreover besides priests and must be treasurers who will take charge of the property ofthe several temples and of the sacred domains and shall haveauthority over the produce and the letting of them and three ofthem shall be chosen from the highest classes for the greater two for the lesser and one for the least of all the manner oftheir election and the scrutiny of them shall be the same as that ofthe generals this shall be the order of the temples 
 let everything have a guard as far as possible let the defence ofthe city be commited to the generals and taxiarchs and phylarchs and prytanes and the wardens of the city and of theagora when the election of them has been completed the defence ofthe country shall be provided for as entire land has beenalready distributed into twelve as nearly as possible equal parts andlet the tribe allotted to a division provide annually for it fivewardens of the country and commanders of the watch and let eachbody of five have the power of selecting twelve others out of theyouth of their own shall be not less than of age and not more than thirty and let there be allotted tothem severally every month the various districts in order that theymay all acquire knowledge and experience of the whole country theterm of service for commanders and for watchers shall continueduring two years after having had their stations allotted to will go from place to place in regular order making theirround from left to right as their commanders direct them when ispeak of going to the right i mean that they are to go to theeast and at the commencement of the second year in order that asmany as possible of the guards may not only get a knowledge of thecountry at any one season of the year but may also have experience ofthe manner in which different places are affected at different seasonsof the year their then commanders shall lead them again towards theleft from place to place in succession until they have completed thesecond year in the third year other wardens of the country shall bechosen and commanders of the watch five for each division who are tobe the superintendents of the bands of twelve while on service ateach station their attention shall be directed to the the first place they shall see that the country is wellprotected against enemies they shall trench and dig wherever thisis required and as far as they can they shall by fortificationskeep off the in order to prevent them from doing anyharm to the country or the property they shall use the beasts ofburden and the labourers whom they find on the spot these will betheir instruments whom they will superintend taking them as far aspossible at the times when they are not engaged in their regularbusiness they shall make every part of the country inaccessible toenemies and as accessible as possible to friends there shall be waysfor man and beasts of burden and for cattle and they shall takecare to have them always as smooth as they can and shall provideagainst the rains doing harm instead of good to the land when theycome down from the mountains into the hollow dells and shall keepin the overflow by the help of works and ditches in order that thevalleys receiving and drinking up the rain from heaven and providingfountains and streams in the fields and regions which lieunderneath may furnish even to the dry places plenty of good fountains of water whether of rivers or of springs shall beornamented with plantations and buildings for beauty and let thembring together the streams in subterraneous channels and make allthings plenteous and if there be a sacred grove or dedicated precinctin the neighbourhood they shall conduct the water to the actualtemples of the gods and so beautify them at all seasons of theyear everywhere in such places the youth shall make gymnasia forthemselves and warm baths for the aged placing by them abundanceof dry wood for the benefit of those labouring under weary frame of the rustic worn with toil will receive a kindlywelcome far better than he would at the hands of a not 
 the building of these and the like works will be useful andornamental they will provide a pleasing amusement but they will be aserious employment too for the sixty wardens will have to guard theirseveral divisions not only with a view to enemies but also with aneye to professing friends when a quarrel arises among neighbours orcitizens and any one whether slave or freeman wrongs another letthe five wardens decide small matters on their own authority butwhere the charge against another relates to greater matters theseventeen composed of the fives and twelves shall determine anycharges which one man brings against another not involving morethan three minae every judge and magistrate shall be liable to givean account of his conduct in office except those who like the final decision moreover as regards the aforesaid wardens ofthe country if they do any wrong to those of whom they have the by imposing upon them unequal tasks or by taking theproduce of the soil or implements of husbandry without theirconsent also if they receive anything in the way of a bribe ordecide suits unjustly or if they yield to the influences of them be publicly dishonoured and in regard to any other wrongwhich they do to the inhabitants of the country if the question be ofa mina let them submit to the decision of the villagers in theneighbourhood but in suits of greater amount or in case of they refuse to submit trusting that their monthly removal intoanother part of the country will enable them to such casesthe injured party may bring his suit in the common court and if heobtain a verdict he may exact from the defendant who refused tosubmit a double penalty

 after the wardens of the country we have to speak of the electionof wardens of the agora and of the city the wardens of the countrywere sixty in number and the wardens of the city will be three andwill divide the twelve parts of the city into three like theformer they shall have care of the ways and of the different highroads which lead out of the country into the city and of thebuildings that they may be all made according to of thewaters which the guardians of the supply preserve and convey to being taken that they may reach the fountains pure andabundant and be both an ornament and a benefit to the city thesealso should be men of influence and at leisure to take care of thepublic interest let every man propose as warden of the city any onewhom he likes out of the highest class and when the vote has beengiven on them and the number is reduced to the six who have thegreatest number of votes let the electing officers choose by lotthree out of the six and when they have undergone a scrutiny let themhold office according to the laws laid down for them next let thewardens of the agora be elected in like manner out of the first andsecond class five in number ten are to be first elected and outof the ten five are to be chosen by lot as in the election of thewardens of the when they have undergone a scrutiny areto be declared magistrates every one shall vote for every one and hewho will not vote if he be informed against before the be fined fifty drachmae and shall also be deemed a bad any one who likes go to the assembly and to the general shall be compulsory to go on citizens of the first and secondclass and they shall pay a fine of ten drachmae if they be foundnot answering to their names at the assembly the third and fourthclass shall be under no compulsion and shall be let off without afine unless the magistrates have commanded all to be present inconsequence of some urgent necessity the wardens of the agora shallobserve the order appointed by law for the agora and shall have thecharge of the temples and fountains which are in the agora and theyshall see that no one injures anything and punish him who stripes and bonds if he be a slave or stranger but if he be acitizen who misbehaves in this way they shall have the powerthemselves of inflicting a fine upon him to the amount of a hundreddrachmae or with the consent of the wardens of the city up todouble that amount and let the wardens of the city have a similarpower of imposing punishments and fines in their own department andlet them impose fines by their own department and let them imposefines by their own authority up to a mina or up to two minae withthe consent of the wardens of the agora 
 in the next place it will be proper to appoint directors of musicand gymnastic two kinds of the one kind the business willbe education of the other the superintendence of contests inspeaking of education the law means to speak of those who have thecare of order and instruction in gymnasia and schools and of thegoing to school and of school buildings for boys and girls and inspeaking of contests the law refers to the judges of gymnastics andof music these again are divided into two classes the one havingto do with music the other with gymnastics and the same who judge ofthe gymnastic contests of men shall judge of horses but in musicthere shall be one set of judges of solo singing and of of rhapsodists players on the harp the flute and the another who shall judge of choral song first of all we mustchoose directors for the choruses of boys and men and they shall follow in the amusement of the dance and for ourother musical arrangements one director will be enough for thechoruses and he should be not less than forty years of age onedirector will also be enough to introduce the solo singers and togive judgment on the competitors and he ought not to be less thanthirty years of age the director and manager of the choruses shall beelected after the following any persons who commonlytake an interest in such matters go to the meeting and be fined ifthey do not go the guardians of the law shall judge of theirfault but those who have no interest shall not be compelled theelector shall propose as director some one who understands he in the scrutiny may be challenged on the one part by thosewho say he has no skill and defended on the other hand by those whosay that he has ten are to be elected by vote and he of the tenwho is chosen by lot shall undergo a scrutiny and lead the chorusesfor a year according to law and in like manner the competitor whowins the lot shall be leader of the solo and concert music for thatyear and he who is thus elected shall deliver the award to thejudges in the next place we have to choose judges in the contests ofhorses and of men these shall be selected from the third and alsofrom the second class of citizens and three first classes shall becompelled to go to the election but the lowest may stay away withimpunity and let there be three elected by lot out of the twentywho have been chosen previously and they must also have the voteand approval of the examiners but if any one is rejected in thescrutiny at any ballot or decision others shall be chosen in the samemanner and undergo a similar scrutiny 
 there remains the minister of the education of youth male andfemale he too will rule according to law one such minister will besufficient and he must be fifty years old and have children lawfullybegotten both boys and girls by preference at any rate one or theother he who is elected and he who is the elector should considerthat of all the great offices of state this is the greatest forthe first shoot of any plant if it makes a good start towards theattainment of its natural excellence has the greatest effect on itsmaturity and this is not only true of plants but of animals wild andtame and also of men man as we say is a tame or civilizedanimal nevertheless he requires proper instruction and a fortunatenature and then of all animals he becomes the most divine and mostcivilized but if he be insufficiently or ill educated he is themost savage of earthly creatures wherefore the legislator ought notto allow the education of children to become a secondary or accidentalmatter in the first place he who would be rightly provident aboutthem should begin by taking care that he is elected who of all thecitizens is in every way best him the legislator shall do hisutmost to appoint guardian and superintendent to this end all themagistrates with the exception of the council and prytanes shallgo to the temple of apollo and elect by ballot him of the guardiansof the law whom they severally think will be the best superintendentof education and he who has the greatest number of votes after hehas undergone a scrutiny at the hands of all the magistrates whohave been his electors with the exception of the guardians of hold office for five years and in the sixth year letanother be chosen in like manner to fill his office 
 if any one dies while he is holding a public office and more thanthirty days before his term of office expires let those whosebusiness it is elect another to the office in the same manner asbefore and if any one who is entrusted with orphans dies let therelations both on the and side who are residingat home including cousins appoint another guardian within tendays or be fined a drachma a day for neglect to do so 
 a city which has no regular courts of law ceases to be a city andagain if a judge is silent and says no more in preliminaryproceedings than the litigants as is the case in arbitrations hewill never be able to decide justly wherefore a multitude of judgeswill not easily judge well nor a few if they are bad the point indispute between the parties should be made clear and time anddeliberation and repeated examination greatly tend to clear updoubts for this reason he who goes to law with another should gofirst of all to his neighbours and friends who know best the questionsat issue and if he be unable to obtain from them a satisfactorydecision let him have recourse to another court and if the twocourts cannot settle the matter let a third put an end to the suit 
 now the establishment of courts of justice may be regarded as achoice of magistrates for every magistrate must also be a judge ofsome things and the judge though he be not a magistrate yet incertain respects is a very important magistrate on the day on which heis determining a suit regarding then the judges also asmagistrates let us say who are fit to be judges and of what they areto be judges and how many of them are to judge in each suit let thatbe the supreme tribunal which the litigants appoint in common forthemselves choosing certain persons by agreement and let there betwo other tribunals one for private causes when a citizen accusesanother of wronging him and wishes to get a decision the other forpublic causes in which some citizen is of opinion that the public hasbeen wronged by an individual and is willing to vindicate thecommon interests and we must not forget to mention how the judges areto be qualified and who they are to be in the first place let therebe a tribunal open to all private persons who are trying causes oneagainst another for the third time and let this be composed the officers of state as well annual as those holdingoffice for a longer period when the new year is about to commence inthe month following after the summer solstice on the last day but oneof the year shall meet in some temple and calling god to dedicate one judge from every magistracy to be choosing in each office him who seems to them to bethe best and whom they deem likely to decide the causes of during the ensuing year in the best and holiestmanner and when the election is completed a scrutiny shall be heldin the presence of the electors themselves and if any one be rejectedanother shall be chosen in the same manner those who have undergonethe scrutiny shall judge the causes of those who have declined theinferior courts and shall give their vote openly the councillors andother magistrates who have elected them shall be required to behearers and spectators of the causes and any one else may bepresent who pleases if one man charges another with havingintentionally decided wrong let him go to the guardians of the lawand lay his accusation before them and he who is found guilty in sucha case shall pay damages to the injured party equal to half theinjury but if he shall appear to deserve a greater penalty thejudges shall determine what additional punishment he shall suffer andhow much more he ought to pay to the public treasury and to the partywho brought the suit 
 in the judgment of offences against the state the people ought toparticipate for when any one wrongs the state all are wronged andmay reasonably complain if they are not allowed to share in thedecision such causes ought to originate with the people and theought also to have the final decision of them but the trial of themshall take place before three of the highest magistrates upon whomthe plaintiff and the defendant shall agree and if they are notable to come to an agreement themselves the council shall chooseone of the two proposed and in private suits too as far as ispossible all should have a share for he who has no share in theadministration of justice is apt to imagine that he has no share inthe state at all and for this reason there shall be a court of law inevery tribe and the judges shall be chosen by shall givetheir decisions at once and shall be inaccessible to final judgment shall rest with that court which as we been established in the most incorruptible form of which humanthings admit this shall be the court established for those who areunable to get rid of their suits either in the courts of neighbours orof the tribes 
 thus much of the courts of law which as i was saying cannot beprecisely defined either as being or not being offices asuperficial sketch has been given of them in which some things havebeen told and others omitted for the right place of an exactstatement of the laws respecting suits under their several be at the end of the body of us then expect themat the end hitherto our legislation has been chiefly occupied withthe appointment of offices perfect unity and exactness extendingto the whole and every particular of political be attained to the full until the discussion shall have abeginning middle and end and is complete in every part atpresent we have reached the election of magistrates and this may beregarded as a sufficient termination of what preceded and now thereneed no longer be any delay or hesitation in beginning the work oflegislation 
 cle i like what you have said i particularly likeyour manner of tacking on the beginning of your new discourse to theend of the former one 
 ath thus far then the old rational pastime has gone offwell 
 cle you mean i suppose their serious and noble pursuit 
 ath perhaps but i should like to know whether you and i are agreedabout a certain thing 
 cle about what thing 
 ath you know the endless labour which painters expend upon are always putting in or taking out colours or whateverbe the term which artists employ they seem as if they would nevercease touching up their works which are always being made brighterand more beautiful 
 cle i know something of these matters from report although ihave never had any great acquaintance with the art 
 ath no matter we may make use of the that some one had a mind to paint a figure inthe most beautiful manner in the hope that his work instead of losingwould always improve as time went you not see that being amortal unless he leaves some one to succeed him who will correctthe flaws which time may introduce and be able to add what is leftimperfect through the defect of the artist and who will furtherbrighten up and improve the picture all his great labour will lastbut a short time 
 cle true 
 ath and is not the aim of the legislator similar first he desiresthat his laws should be written down with all possible exactness inthe second place as time goes on and he has made an actual trial ofhis decrees will he not find omissions do you imagine that thereever was a legislator so foolish as not to know that many things arenecessarily omitted which some one coming after him must the constitution and the order of government is not to to improve in the state which he has established 
 cle assuredly that is the sort of thing which every one woulddesire 
 ath and if any one possesses any means of accomplishing this byword or deed or has any way great or small by which he can teach aperson to understand how he can maintain and amend the laws he shouldfinish what he has to say and not leave the work incomplete 
 cle by all means 
 ath and is not this what you and i have to do at the presentmoment 
 cle what have we to do 
 ath as we are about to legislate and have chosen our guardians ofthe law and are ourselves in the evening of life and they ascompared with us are young men we ought not only to legislate forthem but to endeavour to make them not only guardians of the lawbut legislators themselves as far as this is possible 
 cle certainly if we can 
 ath at any rate we must do our best 
 cle of course 
 ath we will say to friends and saviours of our laws inlaying down any law there are many particulars which we shall this cannot be helped at the same time we will do our utmostto describe what is important and will give an outline which youshall fill up and i will explain on what principle you are to and cleinias and i have often spoken to one anothertouching these matters and we are of opinion that we have spokenwell and we hope that you will be of the same mind with us andbecome our disciples and keep in view the things which in ourunited opinion the legislator and guardian of the law ought to keep inview there was one main point about which we were a energies throughout life should be devoted to the acquisition ofthe virtue proper to a man whether this was to be gained by study orhabit or some mode of acquisition or desire or opinion this applies equally to men and women old and of all should always be such as i have described anything whichmay be an impediment the good man ought to show that he utterlydisregards and if at last necessity plainly compels him to be anoutlaw from his native land rather than bow his neck to the yoke ofslavery and be ruled by inferiors and he has to fly an exile he mustbe and endure all such trials rather than accept another form ofgovernment which is likely to make men worse these are ouroriginal principles and do you now fixing your eyes upon thestandard of what a man and a citizen ought or ought not to and blame the those which have not this power ofmaking the citizen better but embrace those which have and withgladness receive and live in them bidding a long farewell to otherinstitutions which aim at goods as they are termed of a differentkind 
 let us proceed to another class of laws beginning with theirfoundation in religion and we must first return to the entire number had and has a great many convenientdivisions and the number of the tribes which was a twelfth part ofthe whole being correctly formed by x x also has them and not only is the whole numberdivisible by twelve but also the number of each tribe is divisible bytwelve now every portion should be regarded by us as a sacred gift ofheaven corresponding to the months and to the revolution of theuniverse every city has a guiding and sacred principle given bynature but in some the division or distribution has been more rightthan in others and has been more sacred and fortunate in ouropinion nothing can be more right than the selection of the number which may be divided by all numbers from one to twelve withthe single exception of eleven and that admits of a very easycorrection for if turning to the dividend we deduct twofamilies the defect in the division is cured and the truth of thismay be easily proved when we have leisure but for the to the mere assertion of this principle let us divide thestate and assigning to each portion some god or son of a god letus give them altars and sacred rites and at the altars let us holdassemblies for sacrifice twice in the assemblies forthe tribes and twelve for the city according to their divisions thefirst in honour of the gods and divine things and the second topromote friendship and better acquaintance as the phrase is andevery sort of good fellowship with one another for people must beacquainted with those into whose families and whom they marry and withthose to whom they give in marriage in such matters as far aspossible a man should deem it all important to avoid a mistake andwith this serious purpose let games be instituted in which youthsand maidens shall dance together seeing one another and being seennaked at a proper age and on a suitable occasion nottransgressing the rules of modesty 
 the directors of choruses will be the superintendents and regulatorsof these games and they together with the guardians of the law willlegislate in any matters which we have omitted for as we said wherethere are numerous and minute details the legislator must leave outsomething and the annual officers who have experience and knowwhat is wanted must make arrangements and improvements year byyear until such enactments and provisions are sufficientlydetermined a ten years experience of sacrifices and dances ifextending to all particulars will be quite sufficient and if thelegislator be alive they shall communicate with him but if he be deadthen the several officers shall refer the omissions which come undertheir notice to the guardians of the law and correct them untilall is perfect and from that time there shall be no more they shall establish and use the new laws with the others whichthe legislator originally gave them and of which they are never ifthey can help to change aught or if some necessity overtakesthem the magistrates must be called into counsel and the wholepeople and they must go to all the oracles of the gods and if theyare all agreed in that case they may make the change but if they arenot agreed by no manner of means and any one who dissents shallprevail as the law ordains 
 whenever any one over years of age having seen and beenseen by others believes himself to have found a marriage connectionwhich is to his mind and suitable for the procreation of him marry if he be still under the age of let him first hear how he ought to seek after what is suitable andappropriate for as cleinias says every law should have a suitableprelude 
 cle you recollect at the right moment stranger and do not missthe opportunity which the argument affords of saying a word in season 
 ath i thank you we will say to him who is born of good son you ought to make such a marriage as wise men would they would advise you neither to avoid a poor marriage norspecially to desire a rich one but if other things are to honour inferiors and with them to form be for the benefit of the city and of the families which areunited for the equable and symmetrical tends infinitely more tovirtue than the unmixed and he who is conscious of being tooheadstrong and carried away more than is fitting in all hisactions ought to desire to become the relation of orderly he who is of the opposite temper ought to seek the oppositealliance let there be one word concerning all manshall follow not after the marriage which is most pleasing tohimself but after that which is most beneficial to the state forsomehow every one is by nature prone to that which is likest tohimself and in this way the whole city becomes unequal in propertyand in disposition and hence there arise in most states the veryresults which we least desire to happen now to add to the law anexpress provision not only that the rich man shall not marry into therich family nor the powerful into the family of the powerful butthat the slower natures shall be compelled to enter into marriage withthe quicker and the quicker with the slower may awaken anger as wellas laughter in the minds of many for there is a difficulty inperceiving that the city ought to be well mingled like a cup in whichthe maddening wine is hot and fiery but when chastened by a soberergod receives a fair associate and becomes an excellent andtemperate drink yet in marriage no one is able to see that the sameresult occurs wherefore also the law must let alone such matters butwe should try to charm the spirits of men into believing theequability of their disposition to be of more importancethan equality in excessive fortune when they marry and him who is toodesirous of making a rich marriage we should endeavour to turn asideby reproaches not however by any compulsion of written law 
 let this then be our exhortation concerning marriage and let usremember what was said a man should cling toimmortality and leave behind him children to be theservants of god in his place for ever all this and much more may betruly said by way of prelude about the duty of marriage but if aman will not listen and remains unsocial and alien among and is still unmarried at years of him pay a yearly who of the highest class shall pay afine of a hundred drachmae and he who is of the second dass a fine ofseventy drachmae the third class shall pay sixty drachmae and thefourth thirty drachmae and let the money be sacred to here he whodoes not pay the fine annually shall owe ten times the sum whichthe treasurer of the goddess shall exact and if he fails in doing him be answerable and give an account of the money at hisaudit he who refuses to marry shall be thus punished in money andalso be deprived of all honour which the younger show to the no young man voluntarily obey him and if he attempt to punish anyone let every one come to the rescue and defend the injured he who is present and does not come to the rescue shall bepronounced by the law to be a coward and a bad citizen of themarriage portion i have already spoken and again i say for theinstruction of poor men that he who neither gives nor receives a dowryon account of poverty has a compensation for the citizens of ourstate are provided with the necessaries of life and wives will beless likely to be insolent and husbands to be mean and subservient tothem on account of property and he who obeys this law will do a nobleaction but he who will not obey and gives or receives more thanfifty drachmae as the price of the marriage garments if he be of thelowest or more than a mina or a mina if he be of thethird or second classes or two minae if he be of the highest owe to the public treasury a similar sum and that which isgiven or received shall be sacred to here and zeus and let thetreasurers of these gods exact the money as was said before about the treasurers of here were to exact the money orpay the fine themselves 
 the betrothal by a father shall be valid in the first degree thatby a grandfather in the second degree and in the third by brothers who have the same father but if there arenone of these alive the betrothal by a mother shall be valid inlike manner in cases of unexampled fatality the next of kin andthe guardians shall have authority what are to be the rites beforemarriages or any other sacred acts relating either to or past marriages shall be referred to the interpreters andhe who follows their advice may be satisfied touching the marriagefestival they shall assemble not more than five male and fivefemale friends of both families and a like number of members of thefamily of either sex and no man shall spend more than his meanswill allow he who is of the richest class may spend a whois of the second half a mina and in the same proportion as thecensus of each decreases all men shall praise him who is obedientto the law but he who is disobedient shall be punished by theguardians of the law as a man wanting in true taste anduninstructed in the laws of bridal song drunkenness is alwaysimproper except at the festivals of the god who gave wine andpeculiarly dangerous when a man is engaged in the business ofmarriage at such a crisis of their lives a bride and bridegroom oughtto have all their wits about ought to take care that theiroffspring may be born of reasonable beings for on what day or nightheaven will give them increase who can say moreover they oughtnot to begetting children when their bodies are dissipated byintoxication but their offspring should be compact and solid quietand compounded properly whereas the drunkard is all abroad in all hisactions and beside himself both in body and soul wherefore drunken man is bad and unsteady in sowing the seed of is likely to beget offspring who will be unstable anduntrustworthy and cannot be expected to walk straight either inbody or mind hence during the whole year and all his life long andespecially while he is begetting children ought to take care andnot intentionally do what is injurious to health or what involvesinsolence and wrong for he cannot help leaving the impression ofhimself on the souls and bodies of his offspring and he begetschildren in every way inferior and especially on the day and night ofmarriage should a man abstain from such things for the is also a god dwelling in man preserves all things if itmeet with proper respect from each individual he who marries isfurther to consider that one of the two houses in the lot is thenest and nursery of his young and there he is to marry and make ahome for himself and bring up his children going away from his fatherand mother for in friendships there must be some degree of desire inorder to cement and bind together diversities of character butexcessive intercourse not having the desire which is created bytime insensibly dissolves friendships from a feeling of a man and his wife shall leave to his and her father andmother their own and themselves go as to a colony anddwell there and visit and be visited by their parents and they shallbeget and bring up children handing on the torch of life from onegeneration to another and worshipping the gods according to law forever 
 in the next place we have to consider what sort of property will bemost convenient there is no difficulty either in understanding oracquiring most kinds of property but there is great difficulty inwhat relates to slaves and the reason is that we speak about themin a way which is right and which is not right for what we sayabout our slaves is consistent and also inconsistent with our practiceabout them 
 megillus i do not understand stranger what you mean 
 ath i am not surprised megillus for the state of the helots amongthe lacedaemonians is of all hellenic forms of slavery the mostcontroverted and disputed about some approving and some condemningit there is less dispute about the slavery which exists among theheracleots who have subjugated the mariandynians and about thethessalian penestae looking at these and the like examples whatought we to do concerning property in slaves i made a remark inpassing which naturally elicited a question about my meaning fromyou it was know that all would agree that we should have thebest and most attached slaves whom we can get for many a man hasfound his slaves better in every way than brethren or sons and manytimes they have saved the lives and property of their masters andtheir whole tales are well known 
 meg to be sure 
 ath but may we not also say that the soul of the slave is utterlycorrupt and that no man of sense ought to trust them and thewisest of our poets speaking of zeus says 
 zeus takes away half the understanding of men whom theday of slavery persons have got these two different notions of slaves intheir of them utterly distrust their servants and as ifthey were wild beasts chastise them with goads and whips and maketheir souls three times or rather many times as slavish as they others do just the opposite 
 meg true 
 cle then what are we to do in our own country stranger seeingthat there are such differences in the treatment of slaves by theirowners 
 ath well cleinias there can be no doubt that man is a troublesomeanimal and therefore he is not very manageable nor likely tobecome so when you attempt to introduce the necessary and freeman and master 
 cle that is obvious 
 ath he is a troublesome piece of goods as has been often shownby the frequent revolts of the messenians and the great mischiefswhich happen in states having many slaves who speak the same the numerous robberies and lawless life of the italian they are called a man who considers all this is fairly at aloss two remedies alone remain to to have the slaves of thesame country nor if possible speaking the same language in this waythey will more easily be held in subjection secondly we shouldtend them carefully not only out of regard to them but yet moreout of respect to ourselves and the right treatment of slaves is tobehave properly to them and to do to them if possible even morejustice than to those who are our equals for he who naturally andgenuinely reverences justice and hates injustice is discovered inhis dealings with any class of men to whom he can easily be he who in regard to the natures and actions of his slaves isundefiled by impiety and injustice will best sow the seeds ofvirtue in them and this may be truly said of every master andtyrant and of every other having authority in relation to hisinferiors slaves ought to be punished as they deserve and notadmonished as if they were freemen which will only make themconceited the language used to a servant ought always to be that of acommand and we ought not to jest with them whether they are males is a foolish way which many people have of setting uptheir slaves and making the life of servitude more disagreeableboth for them and for their masters 
 cle true 
 ath now that each of the citizens is provided as far aspossible with a sufficient number of suitable slaves who can help himin what he has to do we may next proceed to describe their dwellings 
 cle very good 
 ath the city being new and hitherto uninhabited care ought to betaken of all the buildings and the manner of building each of also of the temples and walls these cleinias were matters whichproperly came before the marriages but as we are only talking thereis no objection to changing the order if however our plan oflegislation is ever to take effect then the house shall precede themarriage if god so will and afterwards we will come to theregulations about marriage but at present we are only describingthese matters in a general outline 
 cle quite true 
 ath the temples are to be placed all round the agora and the wholecity built on the heights in a circle for the sake of defence and forthe sake of purity near the temples are to be placed buildings forthe magistrates and the courts of law in these plaintiff anddefendant will receive their due and the places will be regarded asmost holy partly because they have to do with the holy things andpartly because they are the of holy gods and inthem will be held the courts in which cases of homicide and othertrials of capital offenses may fitly take place as to the i agree with sparta in thinking that they should beallowed to sleep in the earth and that we should not attempt todisinter them there is a poetical saying which is finelyexpressed that walls ought to be of steel and iron and not ofearth besides how ridiculous of us to be sending out our young menannually into the country to dig and to trench and to keep off theenemy by fortifications under the idea that they are not to beallowed to set foot in our territory and then that we shouldsurround ourselves with a wall which in the first place is by nomeans conducive to the health of cities and is also apt to producea certain effeminacy in the minds of the inhabitants inviting mento run thither instead of repelling their enemies and leading them toimagine that their safety is due not to their keeping guard day andnight but that when they are protected by walls and gates thenthey may sleep in safety as if they were not meant to labour and didnot know that true repose comes from labour and that disgracefulindolence and a careless temper of mind is only the renewal oftrouble but if men must have walls the private houses ought to be soarranged from the first that the whole city may be one wall havingall the houses capable of defence by reason of their uniformity andequality towards the streets the form of the city being that of asingle dwelling will have an agreeable aspect and being easilyguarded will be infinitely better for security until the originalbuilding is completed these should be the principal objects of theinhabitants and the wardens of the city should superintend thework and should impose a fine on him who is negligent and in allthat relates to the city they should have a care of cleanliness andnot allow a private person to encroach upon any public property eitherby buildings or excavations further they ought to take care that therains from heaven flow off easily and of any other matters whichmay have to be administered either within or without the city theguardians of the law shall pass any further enactments which theirexperience may show to be necessary and supply any other points inwhich the law may be deficient and now that these matters and thebuildings about the agora and the gymnasia and places ofinstruction and theatres are all ready and waiting for scholarsand spectators let us proceed to the subjects which follow marriagein the order of legislation 
 cle by all means 
 ath assuming that marriages exist already cleinias the mode oflife during the year after marriage before children are born willfollow next in order in what way bride and bridegroom ought to livein a city which is to be superior to other cities is a matter notat all easy for us to determine there have been many difficultiesalready but this will be the greatest of them and the mostdisagreeable to the many still i cannot but say what appears to me tobe right and true cleinias 
 cle certainly 
 ath he who imagines that he can give laws for the public conduct ofstates while he leaves the private life of citizens wholly to takecare of itself who thinks that individuals may pass the day as theyplease and that there is no necessity of order in all things he isay who gives up the control of their private lives and supposesthat they will conform to law in their common and public life ismaking a great mistake why have i made this remark why because i amgoing to enact that the bridegrooms should live at the commontables just as they did before marriage this was a singularitywhen first enacted by the legislator in your parts of the and cleinias as i should suppose on the occasion of somewar or other similar danger which caused the passing of the which would be likely to occur in places and intimes of pressure but when men had once tried and been accustomedto a common table experience showed that the institution greatlyconduced to security and in some such manner the custom of havingcommon tables arose among you 
 cle likely enough 
 ath i said that there may have been singularity and danger inimposing such a custom at first but that now there is not the samedifficulty there is however another institution which is thenatural sequel to this and would be excellent if it existedanywhere but at present it does not the institution of which i amabout to speak is not easily described or executed and would belike the legislator combing wool into the fire as people say orperforming any other impossible and useless feat 
 cle what is the cause stranger of this extreme hesitation 
 ath you shall hear without any fruitless loss of time that whichhas law and order in a state is the cause of every good but thatwhich is disordered or is often the ruin of that whichis and at this point the argument is now waiting forwith you cleinias and megillus the common tables of men are as isaid a and admirable institution but you are mistaken inleaving the women unregulated by law they have no similar institutionof public tables in the light of day and just that part of thehuman race which is by nature prone to secrecy and stealth onaccount of their mean the female been leftwithout regulation by the legislator which is a great mistake consequence of this neglect many things have grown lax amongyou which might have been far better if they had been only regulatedby law for the neglect of regulations about women may not only beregarded as a neglect of half the entire matter but in proportionas nature is inferior to that of men in capacity for that degree the consequence of such neglect is more than twice asimportant the careful consideration of this matter and the arrangingand ordering on a common principle of all our institutions relatingboth to men and women greatly conduces to the happiness of the at present such is the unfortunate condition of mankind thatno man of sense will even venture to speak of common tables inplaces and cities in which they have never been established at how can any one avoid being utterly ridiculous who attempts tocompel women to show in public how much they eat and drink there isnothing at which the sex is more likely to take offence for women areaccustomed to creep into dark places and when dragged out into thelight they will exert their utmost powers of resistance and be fartoo much for the legislator and therefore as i said before inmost places they will not endure to have the truth spoken withoutraising a tremendous outcry but in this state perhaps they may andif we may assume that our whole discussion about the state has notbeen mere idle talk i should like to prove to you if you willconsent to listen that this institution is good and proper but ifyou had rather not i will refrain 
 cle there is nothing which we should both of us like than to hear what you have to say 
 ath very good and you must not be surprised if i go back a we have plenty of leisure and there is nothing to prevent us fromconsidering in every point of view the subject of law 
 cle true 
 ath then let us return once more to what we were saying at man should understand that the human race either had nobeginning at all and will never have an end but always will be andhas been or that it began an immense while ago 
 cle certainly 
 ath well and have there not been constitutions and destructions ofstates and all sorts of pursuits both orderly and disorderly anddiverse desires of meats and drinks always and in all the all sorts of changes of the seasons in which animals may beexpected to have undergone innumerable transformations of themselves 
 cle no doubt 
 ath and may we not suppose that vines appeared which hadpreviously no existence and also olives and the gifts of demeter andher daughter of which one triptolemus was the minister and these existed animals took to devouring each other as theydo still 
 cle true 
 ath again the practice of men sacrificing one another still existsamong many nations while on the other hand we hear of other humanbeings who did not even venture to taste the flesh of a cow and had noanimal sacrifices but only cakes and fruits dipped in honey andsimilar pure offerings but no flesh of animals from these theyabstained under the idea that they ought not to eat them and mightnot stain the altars of the gods with blood for in those days men aresaid to have lived a sort of orphic life having the use of alllifeless things but abstaining from all living things 
 cle such has been the constant tradition and is very likely true 
 ath some one might say to us what is the drift of all this 
 cle a very pertinent question stranger 
 ath and therefore i will endeavour cleinias if i can to draw thenatural inference 
 cle proceed 
 ath i see that among men all things depend upon three wants anddesires of which the end is virtue if they are rightly led bythem or the opposite if wrongly now these are eating and begin at animal has a natural desire for them andis violently excited and rebels against him who says that he must notsatisfy all his pleasures and appetites and get rid of all thecorresponding the third and greatest and sharpest want anddesire breaks out last and is the fire of sexual lust whichkindles in men every species of wantonness and madness and thesethree disorders we must endeavour to master by the three greatprinciples of fear and law and right reason turning them away fromthat which is called pleasantest to the best using the muses andthe gods who preside over contests to extinguish their increase andinflux 
 but to marriage let us speak of the birth of after their birth of their nurture and education in the course ofdiscussion the several laws will be perfected and we shall at lastarrive at the common tables whether such associations are to beconfined to men or extended to women also we shall see better whenwe approach and take a nearer view of them and we may thendetermine what previous institutions are required and will have toprecede them as i said before we shall see them more in detail andshall be better able to lay down the laws which are proper or suitedto them 
 cle very true 
 ath let us keep in mind the words which have now been spoken forhereafter there may be need of them 
 cle what do you bid us keep in mind 
 ath that which we comprehended under the three drinking thirdly the excitement of love 
 cle we shall be sure to remember stranger 
 ath very good then let us now proceed to marriage and teachpersons in what way they shall beget children threatening them ifthey disobey with the terrors of the law 
 cle what do you mean 
 ath the bride and bridegroom should consider that they are toproduce for the state the best and fairest specimens of children whichthey can now all men who are associated any action always succeedwhen they attend and give their mind to what they are doing butwhen they do not give their mind or have no mind they fail whereforelet the bridegroom give his mind to the bride and to the begettingof children and the bride in like manner give her mind to thebridegroom and particularly at the time when their children are notyet born and let the women whom we have chosen be the overseers ofsuch matters and let them in whatever number large or small andat whatever time the magistrates may command assemble every day inthe temple of eileithyia during a third part of the day and beingthere assembled let them inform one another of any one whom they man or woman of those who are begetting the ordinances given at the time when the nuptialsacrifices and ceremonies were performed let the begetting ofchildren and the supervision of those who are begetting themcontinue ten years and no longer during the time when marriage isfruitful but if any continue without children up to this time letthem take counsel with their kindred and with the women holding theoffice of overseer and be divorced for their mutual benefit any dispute arises about what is proper and for theinterest of either party they shall choose ten of the guardians ofthe law and abide by their permission and appointment the women whopreside over these matters shall enter into the houses of the partly by admonitions and partly by threats make them give overtheir folly and error if they persist let the women go and tellthe guardians of the law and the guardians shall prevent them but ifthey too cannot prevent them they shall bring the matter before thepeople and let them write up their names and make oath that theycannot reform such and such an one and let him who is thus writtenup if he cannot in a court of law convict those who have inscribedhis name be deprived of the privileges of a citizen in thefollowing him not go to weddings nor to thethanksgivings after the birth of children and if he go let any onewho pleases strike him with impunity and let the same regulationshold about women let not a woman be allowed to appear abroad orreceive honour or go to nuptial and birthday festivals if she inlike manner be written up as acting disorderly and cannot obtain averdict and if when they themselves have done begetting childrenaccording to the law a man or woman have connection with anotherman or woman who are still begetting children let the samepenalties be inflicted upon them as upon those who are still havinga family and when the time for procreation has passed let the manor woman who refrains in such matters be held in esteem and let thosewho do not refrain be held in the contrary of is to now if the greater part of mankind behave modestly theenactments of law may be left to slumber but if they are enactments having been passed let them be carried into every man the first year is the beginning of life and the timeof birth ought to be written down in the temples of their fathers asthe beginning of existence to every child whether boy or girl letevery phratria have inscribed on a whited wall the names of thesuccessive archons by whom the years are reckoned and near to themlet the living members of the phratria be inscribed and when theydepart life let them be erased the limit of marriageable ages for awoman shall be from sixteen to twenty years at the aman from thirty to years and let a woman hold officeat forty and a man at thirty years let a man go out to war fromtwenty to sixty years and for a woman if there appear any need tomake use of her in military service let the time of service beafter she shall have brought forth children up to fifty years ofage and let regard be had to what is possible and suitable to each

 and now assuming children of both sexes to have been born itwill be proper for us to consider in the next place their nurtureand education this cannot be left altogether unnoticed and yet maybe thought a subject fitted rather for precept and admonition than forlaw in private life there are many little things not alwaysapparent arising out of the pleasures and pains and desires ofindividuals which run counter to the intention of the legislator andmake the characters of the citizens various and is anevil in states for by reason of their smallness and frequentoccurrence there would be an unseemliness and want of propriety inmaking them penal by law and if made penal they are thedestruction of the written law because mankind get the habit offrequently transgressing the law in small matters the result isthat you cannot legislate about them and still less can you besilent i speak somewhat darkly but i shall endeavour also to bringmy wares into the light of day for i acknowledge that at presentthere is a want of clearness in what i am saying 
 cleinias very true 
 athenian stranger am i not right in maintaining that a goodeducation is that which tends most to the improvement of mind andbody 
 cle undoubtedly 
 ath and nothing can be plainer than that the fairest bodies arethose which grow up from infancy in the best and straightest manner 
 cle certainly 
 ath and do we not further observe that the first shoot of everyliving thing is by far the greatest and fullest many will evencontend that a man at does not reach twice the heightwhich he attained at five 
 cle true 
 ath well and is not rapid growth without proper and abundantexercise the source endless evils in the body 
 cle yes 
 ath and the body should have the most exercise when it receivesmost nourishment 
 cle but stranger are we to impose this great amount of exerciseupon infants 
 ath nay rather on the bodies of infants still unborn 
 cle what do you mean my good sir in the process of gestation 
 ath exactly i am not at all surprised that you have never heard ofthis very peculiar sort of gymnastic applied to such little although strange i will endeavour to explain to you 
 cle by all means 
 ath the practice is more easy for us to understand than for you byreason of certain amusements which are carried to excess by us atathens not only boys but often older persons are in the habit ofkeeping quails and cocks which they train to fight one another andthey are far from thinking that the contests in which they stir themup to fight with one another are sufficient exercise for in additionto this they carry them about tucked beneath their armpits holdingthe smaller birds in their hands the larger under their arms andgo for a walk of a great many miles for the sake of health that is tosay not their own health but the health of the birds wherebythey prove to any intelligent person that all bodies are benefited byshakings and movements when they are moved without weariness whethermotion proceeds from themselves or is caused by a swing or at on horseback or by other bodies in whatever way moving and thatthus gaining the mastery over food and drink they are able toimpart beauty and health and strength but admitting all this whatfollows shall we make a ridiculous law that the pregnant womanshall walk about and fashion the embryo within as we fashion waxbefore it hardens and after birth swathe the infant for two that we compel nurses under penalty of a legal fine to bealways carrying the children somewhere or other either to thetemples or into the country or to their relations houses untilthey are well able to stand and to take care that their limbs are notdistorted by leaning on them when they are too shouldcontinue to carry them until the infant has completed its thirdyear the nurses should be strong and there should be more than oneof them shall these be our rules and shall we impose a penalty forthe neglect of them no no the penalty of which we were speakingwill fall upon our own heads more than enough 
 cle what penalty 
 ath ridicule and the difficulty of getting the feminine dispositions of the nurses to comply 
 cle then why was there any need to speak of the matter at all 
 ath the reason is that masters and freemen in states when theyhear of it are very likely to arrive at a true conviction thatwithout due regulation of private life in cities stability in thelaying down of laws is hardly to be expected and he who makes thisreflection may himself adopt the laws just now mentioned them may order his house and state well and be happy 
 cle likely enough 
 ath and therefore let us proceed with our legislation until we havedetermined the exercises which are suited to the souls of youngchildren in the same manner in which we have begun to go throughthe rules relating to their bodies 
 cle by all means 
 ath let us assume then as a first principle in relation both tothe body and soul of very young creatures that nursing and movingabout by day and night is good for them all and that the younger theyare the more they will need it infants should live if that werepossible as if they were always rocking at sea this is the lessonwhich we may gather from the experience of nurses and likewise fromthe use of the remedy of motion in the rites of the corybantes forwhen mothers want their restless children to go to sleep they do notemploy rest but on the contrary them in theirarms nor do they give them silence but they sing to them and lapthem in sweet strains and the bacchic women are cured of their frenzyin the same manner by the use of the dance and of music 
 cle well stranger and what is the reason of this 
 ath the reason is obvious 
 cle what 
 ath the affection both of the bacchantes and of the children isan emotion of fear which springs out of an evil habit of the when some one applies external agitation to affections of thissort the motion coming from without gets the better of the terribleand violent internal one and produces a peace and calm in the quiets the restless palpitation of the heart which is a thingmuch to be desired sending the children to sleep and making thebacchantes although they remain awake to dance to the pipe withthe help of the gods to whom they offer acceptable sacrifices andproducing in them a sound mind which takes the place of their to express what i mean in a word there is a good deal to be saidin favour of this treatment 
 cle certainly 
 ath but if fear has such a power we ought to infer from thesefacts that every soul which from youth upward has been familiarwith fears will be made more liable to fear and every one will allowthat this is the way to form a habit of cowardice and not of courage 
 cle no doubt 
 ath and on the other hand the habit of overcoming from our youthupwards the fears and terrors which beset us may be said to be anexercise of courage 
 cle true 
 ath and we may say that the use of exercise and motion in theearliest years of life greatly contributes to create a part ofvirtue in the soul 
 cle quite true 
 ath further a cheerful temper or the reverse may be regardedas having much to do with high spirit on the one hand or withcowardice on the other 
 cle to be sure 
 ath then now we must endeavour to show how and to what extent wemay if we please without difficulty implant either character inthe young 
 cle certainly 
 ath there is a common opinion that luxury makes the disposition ofyouth discontented and irascible and vehemently excited by on the other hand excessive and savage servitude makes men meanand abject and haters of their kind and therefore makes themundesirable associates 
 cle but how must the state educate those who do not as yetunderstand the language of the country and are therefore incapable ofappreciating any sort of instruction 
 ath i will tell you animal that is born is wont to uttersome cry and this is especially the case with man and he is alsoaffected with the inclination to weep more than any other animal 
 cle quite true 
 ath do not nurses when they want to know what an infant by these anything is brought to the infant and he issilent then he is supposed to be pleased but when he weeps andcries out then he is not pleased for tears and cries are theinauspicious signs by which children show what they love and hate nowthe time which is thus spent is no less than three years and is avery considerable portion of life to be passed ill or well 
 cle true 
 ath does not the discontented and ungracious nature appear to youto be full of lamentations and sorrows more than a good man ought tobe 
 cle certainly 
 ath well but if during these three years every possible carewere taken that our nursling should have as little of sorrow and in general of pain as was possible might we not expect in earlychildhood to make his soul more gentle and cheerful 
 cle to be sure especially if we could procure hima variety of pleasures 
 ath there i can no longer agree cleinias you amaze me to bringhim up in such a way would be his utter ruin for the beginning isalways the most critical part of education let us see whether i amright 
 cle proceed 
 ath the point about which you and i differ is of greatimportance and i hope that you megillus will help to decide betweenus for i maintain that the true life should neither seek forpleasures nor on the other hand entirely avoid pains but shouldembrace the middle state which i just spoke of as gentle andbenign and is a state which we by some divine presage and inspirationrightly ascribe to god now i say he among men too who would bedivine ought to pursue after this mean should not rushheadlong into pleasures for he will not be free from pains norshould we allow any one young or old male or female to be thusgiven any more than ourselves and least of all the in infancy more than at any other time the character isengrained by habit nay more if i were not afraid of appearing to beridiculous i would say that a woman during her year of pregnancyshould of all women be most carefully tended and kept from violent orexcessive pleasures and pains and should at that time cultivategentleness and benevolence and kindness 
 cle you need not ask megillus stranger which of us has mosttruly spoken for i myself agree that all men ought to avoid thelife of unmingled pain or pleasure and pursue always a middle having spoken well may i add that you have been well answered 
 ath very good cleinias and now let us all three consider afurther point 
 cle what is it 
 ath that all the matters which we are now describing are commonlycalled by the general name of unwritten customs and what are termedthe laws of our ancestors are all of similar nature and thereflection which lately arose in our minds that we can neither callthese things laws nor yet leave them unmentioned is justified forthey are the bonds of the whole state and come in between the writtenlaws which are or are hereafter to be laid down they are justancestral customs of great antiquity which if they are rightlyordered and made habitual shield and preserve the previously existingwritten law but if they depart from right and fall into they are like the props of builders which slip away out oftheir place and cause a universal part drags another the fair falls because the old foundations areundermined reflecting upon this cleinias you ought to bind togetherthe new state in every possible way omitting nothing whether greator small of what are called laws or manners or pursuits for by thesemeans a city is bound together and all these things are onlylasting when they depend upon one another and therefore we must notwonder if we find that many apparently trifling customs or usages comepouring in and lengthening out our laws 
 cle very true we are disposed to agree with you 
 ath up to the age of three years whether of boy or girl if aperson strictly carries out our previous regulations and makes thema principal aim he will do much for the advantage of the youngcreatures but at three four five and even six years the childishnature will require sports now is the time to get rid of inhim punishing him but not so as to disgrace him we were sayingabout slaves that we ought neither to add insult to punishment soas to anger them nor yet to leave them unpunished lest they and a like rule is to be observed in the case of children at that age have certain natural modes ofamusement which they find out for themselves when they meet and allthe children who are between the ages of three and six ought to meetat the temples the villages the several families of a village unitingon one spot the nurses are to see that the children behave properlyand themselves and all their companies are to be underthe control of twelve matrons one for each company who areannually selected to inspect them from the women previously the women who have authority over marriage whom the guardiansof the law appoint these matrons shall be chosen by the women whohave authority over marriage one out of each tribe all are to beof the same age and let each of them as soon as she is office and go to the temples every day punishing alloffenders male or female who are slaves or strangers by the help ofsome of the public slaves but if any citizen disputes the her bring him before the wardens of the city or if there be nodispute let her punish him herself after the age of six years thetime has arrived for the separation of the boys live withboys and girls in like manner with girls now they must begin boys going to teachers of horsemanship and the use of thebow the javelin and sling and the girls too if they do not any rate until they know how to manage these weapons andespecially how to handle heavy arms for i may note that the practicewhich now prevails is almost universally misunderstood 
 cle in what respect 
 ath in that the right and left hand are supposed to be by naturedifferently suited for our various uses of them whereas no differenceis found in the use of the feet and the lower limbs but in the use ofthe hands we are as it were maimed by the folly of nurses andmothers for although our several limbs are by nature balanced wecreate a difference in them by bad habit in some cases this is ofno consequence as for example when we hold the lyre in the lefthand and the plectrum in the right but it is downright folly to makethe same distinction in other cases the custom of the scythiansproves our error for they not only hold the bow from them with theleft hand and draw the arrow to them with their right but useeither hand for both purposes and there are many similar examplesin charioteering and other things from which we may learn thatthose who make the left side weaker than the right act contrary tonature in the case of the plectrum which is of horn only andsimilar instruments as i was saying it is of no consequence butmakes a great difference and may be of very great importance to thewarrior who has to use iron weapons bows and javelins and thelike above all when in heavy armour he has to fight against heavyarmour and there is a very great difference between one who haslearnt and one who has not and between one who has been trained ingymnastic exercises and one who has not been for as he who isperfectly skilled in the pancratium or boxing or wrestling is notunable to fight from his left side and does not limp and draggle inconfusion when his opponent makes him change his position so fighting and in all other things if i am not like who has these double powers of attack and defenceought not in any case to leave them either unused or untrained ifhe can help and if a person had the nature of geryon or briareus heought to be able with his hundred hands to throw a hundred darts magistrates male and female should see to all these women superintending the nursing and amusements of the the men superintending their education that all of them boys andgirls alike may be sound hand and foot and may not if they canhelp spoil the gifts of nature by bad habits 
 education has two of gymnastic which is concerned withthe body and the other of music which is designed for theimprovement of the soul and gymnastic has also two wrestling and one sort of dancing imitates musical aims at preserving dignity and freedom the other aims atproducing health agility and beauty in the limbs and parts of thebody giving the proper flexion and extension to each of them aharmonious motion being diffused everywhere and forming a suitableaccompaniment to the dance as regards wrestling the tricks whichantaeus and cercyon devised in their systems out of a vain spirit ofcompetition or the tricks of boxing which epeius or amycusinvented are useless and unsuitable for war and do not deserve tohave much said about them but the art of wrestling erect andkeeping free the neck and hands and sides working with energy andconstancy with a composed strength and for the sake are always useful and are not to be neglected but to beenjoined alike on masters and scholars when we reach that part oflegislation and we will desire the one to give their instructionsfreely and the others to receive them thankfully nor again must weomit suitable imitations of war in our choruses here in crete youhave the armed dances if the curetes and the lacedaemonians havethose of the dioscuri and our virgin lady delighting in theamusement of the dance thought it not fit to amuse herself with emptyhands she must be clothed in a complete suit of armour and in thisattire go through the dance and youths and maidens should in everyrespect imitate her esteeming highly the favour of the with a view to the necessities of war and to festiveoccasions it will be right also for the boys until such time as theygo out to war to make processions and supplications to all the godsin goodly array armed and on horseback in dances and or slow offering up prayers to the gods and to the sons of also engaging in contests and preludes of contests if at these objects for these sorts of exercises and no others areuseful both in peace and war and are beneficial alike to states andto private houses but other labours and sports and exercises of thebody are unworthy of freemen o megillus and cleinias 
 i have now completely described the kind of gymnastic which i saidat first ought to be described if you know of any better will youcommunicate your thoughts 
 cle it is not easy stranger to put aside these principles ofgymnastic and wrestling and to enunciate better ones 
 ath now we must say what has yet to be said about the gifts ofthe muses and of apollo before we fancied that we had said that gymnastic alone remained but now we see clearly whatpoints have been omitted and should be first proclaimed of let us proceed to speak 
 cle by all means 
 ath let me tell you once you have heard me say thesame before that caution must be always exercised both by the speakerand by the hearer about anything that is very singular and my tale is one which many a man would be afraid to tell andyet i have a confidence which makes me go on 
 cle what have you to say stranger 
 ath i say that in states generally no one has observed that theplays of childhood have a great deal to do with the permanence or wantof permanence in legislation for when plays are ordered with a viewto children having the same plays and amusing themselves after thesame manner and finding delight in the same playthings the moresolemn institutions of the state are allowed to remain if sports are disturbed and innovations are made in them andthey constantly change and the young never speak of their havingthe same likings or the same established notions of good and badtaste either in the bearing of their bodies or in their dress but hewho devises something new and out of the way in figures and coloursand the like is held in special honour we may truly say that nogreater evil can happen in a state for he who changes the sports issecretly changing the manners of the young and making the old to bedishonoured among them and the new to be honoured and i affirm thatthere is nothing which is a greater injury to all states than sayingor thinking thus will you hear me tell how great i deem the evil tobe 
 cle you mean the evil of blaming antiquity in states 
 ath exactly 
 cle if you are speaking of that you will find in us hearers whoare disposed to receive what you say not unfavourably but mostfavourably 
 ath i should expect so 
 cle proceed 
 ath well then let us give all the greater heed to one the argument affirms that any change whatever except fromevil is the most dangerous of all things this is true in the caseof the seasons and of the winds in the management of our bodies andthe habits of our of all things except as i said the bad he who looks at the constitution of individuals accustomedto eat any sort of meat or drink any drink or to do any work whichthey can get may see that they are at first disordered by them butafterwards as time goes on their bodies grow adapted to them andthey learn to know and like variety and have good health andenjoyment of life and if ever afterwards they are confined again to asuperior diet at first they are troubled with disorders and withdifficulty become habituated to their new food a similar principle wemay imagine to hold good about the minds of men and the natures oftheir souls for when they have been brought up in certain laws whichby some divine providence have remained unchanged during long ages sothat no one has any memory or tradition of their ever having beenotherwise than they are then every one is afraid and ashamed tochange that which is established the legislator must somehow find away of implanting this reverence for antiquity and i would proposethe following are apt to fancy as i was saying when the plays of children are altered they are merely plays notseeing that the most serious and detrimental consequences arise out ofthe change and they readily comply with the wishes instead ofdeterring him not considering that these children who makeinnovations in their games when they grow up to be men will bedifferent from the last generation of children and beingdifferent will desire a different sort of life and under theinfluence of this desire will want other institutions and laws and noone of them reflects that there will follow what i just now called thegreatest of evils to states changes in bodily fashions are no suchserious evils but frequent changes in the praise and censure ofmanners are the greatest of evils and require the utmost prevision 
 cle to be sure 
 ath and now do we still hold to our former assertion thatrhythms and music in general are imitations of good and evilcharacters in men what say you 
 cle that is the only doctrine which we can admit 
 ath must we not then try in every possible way to prevent ouryouth from even desiring to imitate new modes either in dance or must any one be allowed to offer them varieties of pleasures 
 cle most true 
 ath can any of us imagine a better mode of effecting this objectthan that of the egyptians 
 cle what is their method 
 ath to consecrate every sort of dance or melody first we shouldordain for the year what they ought to be andat what time and in honour of what gods sons of gods and heroesthey ought to be celebrated and in the next place what hymnsought to be sung at the several sacrifices and with what dances theparticular festival is to be honoured this has to be arranged atfirst by certain persons and when arranged the whole assembly ofthe citizens are to offer sacrifices and libations to the fates andall the other gods and to consecrate the several odes to gods andheroes and if any one offers any other hymns or dances to any oneof the gods the priests and priestesses acting in concert with theguardians of the law shall with the sanction of religion and thelaw exclude him and he who is excluded if he do not submit shallbe liable all his life long to have a suit of impiety broughtagainst him by any one who likes 
 cle very good 
 ath in the consideration of this subject let us remember what isdue to ourselves 
 cle to what are you referring 
 ath i mean that any young man and much more any old one when hesees or hears anything strange or unaccustomed does not at once runto embrace the paradox but he stands considering like a person whois at a place where three paths meet and does not very well knowhis may be alone or he may be walking with others and hewill say to himself and them which is the way and will not moveforward until he is satisfied that he is going right and this is whatwe must do in the present strange discussion on thesubject of law has arisen which requires the utmost we should not at our age be too ready to speak about such greatmatters or be confident that we can say anything certain all in amoment 
 cle most true 
 ath then we will allow time for reflection and decide when we havegiven the subject sufficient consideration but that we may not behindered from completing the natural arrangement of our laws let usproceed to the conclusion of them in due order for very god will the exposition of them when completed may throw lighton our present perplexity 
 cle excellent stranger let us do as you propose 
 ath let us then affirm the paradox that strains of music are ourlaws nomoi and this latter being the name which the ancients gaveto lyric songs they probably would not have very much objected to ourproposed application of the word some one either asleep or have had a dreamy suspicion of their nature and let our decreebe as one in singing or dancing shall offend againstpublic and consecrated models and the general fashion among theyouth any more than he would offend against any other law and he whoobserves this law shall be blameless but he who is disobedient asi was saying shall be punished by the guardians of the laws and bythe priests and priestesses suppose that we imagine this to be ourlaw 
 cle very good 
 ath can any one who makes such laws escape ridicule let us think that our only safety will be in first framing certain modelsfor composers one of these models shall be as when asacrifice is going on and the victims are being burnt according i say any one who may be a son or brother standing byanother at the altar and over the victims horribly blasphemes willnot his words inspire despondency and evil omens and forebodings inthe mind of his father and of his other kinsmen 
 cle of course 
 ath and this is just what takes place in almost all our cities amagistrate offers a public sacrifice and there come in not one butmany choruses who take up a position a little way from the altar andfrom time to time pour forth all sorts of horrible blasphemies onthe sacred rites exciting the souls of the audience with words andrhythms and melodies most sorrowful to hear and he who at themoment when the city is offering sacrifice makes the citizens weepmost carries away the palm of victory now ought we not to forbidsuch strains as these and if ever our citizens must hear suchlamentations then on some unblest and inauspicious day let there bechoruses of foreign and hired minstrels like those hirelings whoaccompany the departed at funerals with barbarous carian is the sort of thing which will be appropriate if we have suchstrains at all and let the apparel of the singers be not circletsand ornaments of gold but the reverse enough of all this i willsimply ask once more whether we shall lay down as one of ourprinciples of song 
 cle what 
 ath that we should avoid every word of evil omen let that kindof song which is of good omen be heard everywhere and always in ourstate i need hardly ask again but shall assume that you agree withme 
 cle by all means that law is approved by the suffrages of us all 
 ath but what shall be our next musical law or type ought notprayers to be offered up to the gods when we sacrifice 
 cle certainly 
 ath and our third law if i am not mistaken will be to theeffect that our poets understanding prayers to be requests which wemake to the gods will take especial heed that they do not bymistake ask for evil instead of good to make such a prayer wouldsurely be too ridiculous 
 cle very true 
 ath were we not a little while ago quite convinced that no silveror golden plutus should dwell in our state 
 cle to be sure 
 ath and what has it been the object of our argument to show did wenot imply that the poets are not always quite capable of knowingwhat is good or evil and if one of them utters a mistaken prayer insong or words he will make our citizens pray for the opposite of whatis good in matters of the highest import than which as i was can be few greater mistakes shall we then propose as one of ourlaws and models relating to the muses 
 cle you explain the law more precisely 
 ath shall we make a law that the poet shall compose nothingcontrary to the ideas of the lawful or just or beautiful or are allowed in the state nor shall he be permitted tocommunicate his compositions to any private individuals until heshall have shown them to the appointed judges and the guardians of thelaw and they are satisfied with them as to the persons whom weappoint to be our legislators about music and as to the director ofeducation these have been already indicated once more then as ihave asked more than once shall this be our third law and do you say 
 cle let it be so by all means 
 ath then it will be proper to have hymns and praises of the with prayers and after the gods prayers and praisesshould be offered in like manner to demigods and heroes suitable totheir several characters 
 cle certainly 
 ath in the next place there will be no objection to a law thatcitizens who are departed and have done good and energetic with their souls or with their bodies and have been obedientto the laws should receive eulogies this will be very fitting 
 cle quite true 
 ath but to honour with hymns and panegyrics those who are stillalive is not safe a man should run his course and make a fairending and then we will praise him and let praise be given equallyto women as well as men who have been distinguished in virtue theorder of songs and dances shall be as are manyancient musical compositions and dances which are excellent andfrom these the city may freely select what is proper andsuitable and they shall choose judges of not less than fifty years ofage who shall make the selection and any of the old poems which theydeem sufficient they shall include any that are deficient oraltogether unsuitable they shall either utterly throw aside orexamine and amend taking into their counsel poets and making use of their poetical genius but explaining to them thewishes of the legislator in order that they may regulate and all choral strains according to the mind of the not allowing them to indulge except in some few matters theirindividual pleasures and fancies now the irregular strain of music isalways made ten thousand times better by attaining to law and rejecting the honeyed however that we mean wholly toexclude pleasure which is the characteristic of all music and if aman be brought up from childhood to the age of discretion and maturityin the use of the orderly and severe music when he hears the oppositehe detests it and calls it illiberal but if trained in the sweet andvulgar music he deems the severer kind cold and displeasing so i was saying before while he who hears them gains no more pleasurefrom the one than from the other the one has the advantage ofmaking those who are trained in it better men whereas the other makesthem worse 
 cle very true 
 ath again we must distinguish and determine on some generalprinciple what songs are suitable to women and what to men andmust assign to them their proper melodies and rhythms it isshocking for a whole harmony to be inharmonical or for a rhythm to beunrhythmical and this will happen when the melody is inappropriate tothem and therefore the legislator must assign to these also theirforms now both sexes have melodies and rhythms which of necessitybelong to them and those of women are clearly enough indicated bytheir natural difference the grand and that which tends tocourage may be fairly called manly but that which inclines tomoderation and temperance may be declared both in law and in ordinaryspeech to be the more womanly quality this then will be the generalorder of them 
 let us now speak of the manner of teaching and imparting them andthe persons to whom and the time when they are severally to beimparted as the shipwright first lays down the lines of the keel andthus as it were draws the ship in outline so do i seek todistinguish the patterns of life and lay down their keels accordingto the nature of different souls seeking truly to consider bywhat means and in what ways we may go through the voyage of lifebest now human affairs are hardly worth considering in earnest andyet we must be in earnest about sad necessity constrains having got thus far there will be a fitness in our completing thematter if we can only find some suitable method of doing so but whatdo i mean some one may ask this very question and quite 
 cle certainly 
 ath i say that about serious matters a man should be serious andabout a matter which is not serious he should not be serious andthat god is the natural and worthy object of our most serious andblessed endeavours for man as i said before is made to be theplaything of god and this truly considered is the best of also every man and woman should walk seriously and passlife in the noblest of pastimes and be of another mind from what theyare at present 
 cle in what respect 
 ath at present they think that their serious suits should be forthe sake of their sports for they deem war a serious must be managed well for the sake of peace but the truth there neither is nor has been nor ever will be eitheramusement or instruction in any degree worth speaking of in is nevertheless deemed by us to be the most serious of ourpursuits and therefore as we say every one of us should live thelife of peace as long and as well as he can and what is the right wayof living are we to live in sports always if so in what kind ofsports we ought to live sacrificing and singing and dancing andthen a man will be able to propitiate the gods and to defendhimself against his enemies and conquer them in battle the type ofsong or dance by which he will propitiate them has been described andthe paths along which he is to proceed have been cut for him hewill go forward in the spirit of the poet 
 telemachus some things thou wilt thyself find in thy heart butother things god will suggest for i deem that thou wast not broughtup without the will of the this ought to be the view of our alumni they ought to thinkthat what has been said is enough for them and that any otherthings their genius and god will suggest to will tell themto whom and when and to what gods severally they are to sacrificeand perform dances and how they may propitiate the deities andlive according to the appointment of nature being for the most partpuppets but having some little share of reality 
 megillus you have a low opinion of mankind stranger 
 ath nay megillus be not amazed but forgive was comparingthem with the gods and under that feeling i spoke let us grant ifyou wish that the human race is not to be despised but is worthyof some consideration 
 next follow the buildings for gymnasia and schools open to are to be in three places in the midst of the city andoutside the city and in the surrounding country also in three shall be schools for horse exercise and large groundsarranged with a view to archery and the throwing of missiles at whichyoung men may learn and practise of these mention has already beenmade and if the mention be not sufficiently explicit let us of them and embody them in laws in these several schoolslet there be dwellings for teachers who shall be brought from foreignparts by pay and let them teach those who attend the schools theart of war and the art of music and the children shall come notonly if their parents please but if they do not please there shallbe compulsory education as the saying is of all and sundry as farthis is possible and the pupils shall be regarded as belonging to thestate rather than to their parents my law would apply to females aswell as males they shall both go through the same exercises i assertwithout fear of contradiction that gymnastic and horsemanship are assuitable to women as to men of the truth of this i am persuadedfrom ancient tradition and at the present day there are said to becountless myriads of women in the neighbourhood of the black sauromatides who not only ride on horseback like men but haveenjoined upon them the use of bows and other weapons equally withthe men and i further affirm that if these things are can be more absurd than the practice which prevails in our owncountry of men and women not following the same pursuits with alltheir strength and with one mind for thus the state instead of beinga whole is reduced to a half but has the same imposts to pay and thesame toils to undergo and what can be a greater mistake for anylegislator to make than this 
 cle very true yet much of what has been asserted by us strangeris contrary to the custom of states still in saying that thediscourse should be allowed to proceed and that when the discussionis completed we should choose what seems best you spoke veryproperly and i now feel compunction for what i have said tell what you would next wish to say 
 ath i should wish to say cleinias as i said before that if thepossibility of these things were not sufficiently proven in fact thenthere might be an objection to the argument but the fact being as ihave said he who rejects the law must find some other ground ofobjection and failing this our exhortation will still hold will any one deny that women ought to share as far as possiblein education and in other ways with men for women do notshare in their whole life with men then they must have some otherorder of life 
 cle certainly 
 ath and what arrangement of life to be found anywhere is preferableto this community which we are now assigning to them shall weprefer that which is adopted by the thracians and many other races whouse their women to till the ground and to be shepherds of theirherds and flocks and to minister to them like shall wedo as we and people in our part of the world together asthe phrase is all our goods and chattels into one dwelling weentrust them to our women who are the stewards of them and whoalso preside over the shuttles and the whole art of spinning or shallwe take a middle course in lacedaemon the girlsshare in gymnastic and music while the women no longeremployed in spinning wool are hard at work weaving the web of will be no cheap or mean employment and in the duty ofserving and taking care of the household and bringing up which they will observe a sort of mean not participating in thetoils of war and if there were any necessity that they should fightfor their city and families unlike the amazons they would beunable to take part in archery or any other skilled use of could they after the example of the goddess carry shield orspear or stand up nobly for their country when it was beingdestroyed and strike terror into their enemies if only becausethey were seen in regular order living as they do they would neverdare at all to imitate the sauromatides who when compared withordinary women would appear to be like men let him who your legislators but i must say what i think the legislatorought to be whole and perfect and not half a man only he ought notto let the female sex live softly and waste money and have no order oflife while he takes the utmost care of the male sex and leaveshalf of life only blest with happiness when he might have made thewhole state happy 
 meg what shall we do cleinias shall we allow a stranger to rundown sparta in this fashion 
 cle yes for as we have given him liberty of speech we must let himgo on until we have perfected the work of legislation 
 meg very true 
 ath then now i may proceed 
 cle by all means 
 ath what will be the manner of life among men who may be supposedto have their food and clothing provided for them in moderation andwho have entrusted the practice of the arts to others and whosehusbandry committed to slaves paying a part of the produce bringsthem a return sufficient for men living temperately who common tables in which the men are placed apart and near themare the common tables of their families of their daughters andmothers which day by day the officers male and female are shall see to the behaviour of the company and so dismissthem after which the presiding magistrate and his attendants shallhonour with libations those gods to whom that day and night arededicated and then go home to men whose lives are thus ordered isthere no work remaining to be done which is necessary and fitting butshall each one of them live fattening like a beast such a life isneither just nor honourable nor can he who lives it fail of meetinghis due and the due reward of the idle fatted beast is that he shouldbe torn in pieces by some other valiant beast whose fatness is worndown by brave deeds and toil these regulations if we duly considerthem will never be exactly carried into execution under presentcircumstances nor as long as women and children and houses and allother things are the private property of individuals but if we canattain the form of polity we shall be very well to men living under this second polity there remains a work tobe accomplished which is far from being small or insignificant but isthe greatest of all works and ordained by the appointment ofrighteous law for the life which may be truly said to be concernedwith the virtue of body and soul is twice or more than twice as fullof toil and trouble as the pursuit after pythian and olympicvictories which debars a man from every employment of life for thereought to be no interfering with the greater work of providingthe necessary exercise and nourishment for the body and instructionand education for the soul night and day are not long enough forthe accomplishment of their perfection and consummation and thereforeto this end all freemen ought to arrange the way in which they willspend their time during the whole course of the day from morning tillevening and from evening till the morning of the next sunrise theremay seem to be some impropriety in the legislator determining minutelythe numberless details of the management of the house includingsuch particulars as the duty of wakefulness in those who are to beperpetual watchmen of the whole city for that any citizen shouldcontinue during the whole of any night in sleep instead of being seenby all his servants always the first to awake and get the regulation is to be called a law or only a be deemed base and unworthy of a freeman also that themistress of the house should be awakened by her handmaidens instead ofherself first awakening them is what the slaves male and female andthe and if that were possible everybody and everythingin the house should regard as base if they rise early they may allof them do much of their public and of their household business asmagistrates in the city and masters and mistresses in their privatehouses before the sun is up much sleep is not required by for our souls or bodies or for the actions which they no one who is asleep is good for anything any more than if hewere dead but he of us who has the most regard for life and reasonkeeps awake as long he can reserving only so much time for sleep asis expedient for health and much sleep is not required if thehabit of moderation be once rightly formed magistrates in stateswho keep awake at night are terrible to the bad whether enemies orcitizens and are honoured and reverenced by the just and are useful to themselves and to the whole state 
 a night which is passed in such a manner in addition to all advantages infuses a sort of courage into the mindsof the citizens when the day breaks the time has arrived for youthto go to their schoolmasters now neither sheep nor any otheranimals can live without a shepherd nor can children be leftwithout tutors or slaves without masters and of all animals theboy is the most unmanageable inasmuch as he has the fountain ofreason in him not yet regulated he is the most and insubordinate of animals wherefore he must be boundwith many bridles in the first place when he gets away frommothers and nurses he must be under the management of tutors onaccount of his childishness and foolishness then again being afreeman he must be controlled by teachers no matter what they by studies but he is also a slave and in that regard any freemanwho comes in his way may punish him and his tutor and hisinstructor if any of them does anything wrong and he who comesacross him and does not inflict upon him the punishment which hedeserves shall incur the greatest disgrace and let the guardian ofthe law who is the director of education see to him who coming inthe way of the offences which we have mentioned does not chastisethem when he ought or chastises them in a way which he ought not lethim keep a sharp and take especial care of the training ofour children directing their natures and always turning them to goodaccording to the law 
 but how can our law sufficiently train the director of for as yet all has been imperfect and nothing has beensaid either clear or satisfactory now as far as possible the lawought to leave nothing to him but to explain everything that hemay be an interpreter and tutor to others about dances and musicand choral strains i have already spoken both to the character of theselection of them and the manner in which they are to be amendedand consecrated but we have not as yet spoken o illustrious guardianof education of the manner in which your pupils are to use thosestrains which are written in prose although you have been informedwhat martial strains they are to learn and practise what relates inthe first place to the learning of letters and secondly to the also to calculation which as we were saying is needful for themall to learn and any other things which are required with a view towar and the management of house and city and looking to the sameobject what is useful in the revolutions of the heavenly and sun and moon and the various regulations about thesematters which are necessary for the whole am speaking of thearrangements of days in periods of months and of months in are to be observed in order that seasons and sacrifices andfestivals may have their regular and natural order and keep thecity alive and awake the gods receiving the honours due to men having a better understanding about them all these my friend have not yet been sufficiently declared to you by thelegislator attend then to what i am now going to weretelling you in the first place that you were not sufficientlyinformed about letters and the objection was to this were never told whether he who was meant to be a respectablecitizen should apply himself in detail to that sort of learning ornot apply himself at all and the same remark holds good of thestudy of the lyre but now we say that he ought to attend to them afair time for a boy of ten years old to spend in letters is threeyears the age of thirteen is the proper time for him to begin tohandle the lyre and he may continue at this for another threeyears neither more nor less and whether his father or himself likeor dislike the study he is not to be allowed to spend more or lesstime in learning music than the law allows and let him who disobeysthe law be deprived of those youthful honours of which we shallhereafter speak hear however first of all what the young oughtto learn in the early years of life and what their instructorsought to teach them they ought to be occupied with their lettersuntil they are to read and write but the acquisition of perfectbeauty or quickness in writinig if nature has not stimulated themto acquire these accomplishments in the given number of years theyshould let alone and as to the learning of compositions committedto writing which are not set to the lyre whether metrical orwithout rhythmical divisions compositions in prose as they aretermed having no rhythm or how dangerous are thewritings handed down to us by many writers of this will youdo with them o most excellent guardians of the law or how can thelawgiver rightly direct you about them i believe that he will be ingreat difficulty 
 cle what troubles you stranger and why are you so perplexed inyour mind 
 ath you naturally ask cleinias and to you and megillus who aremy partners in the work of legislation i must state the moredifficult as well as the easier parts of the task 
 cle to what do you refer in this instance 
 ath i will tell you there is a difficulty in opposing many myriadsof mouths 
 cle well and have we not already opposed the popular voice in manyimportant enactments 
 ath that is quite true and you mean to imply that the roadwhich we are taking may be disagreeable to some but is agreeable to asmany others or if not to as many at any rate to persons not inferiorto the others and in company with them you bid me at whateverrisk to proceed along the path of legislation which has opened out ofour present discourse and to be of good cheer and not to faint 
 cle certainly 
 ath and i do not faint i say indeed that we have a great manypoets writing in hexameter trimeter and all sorts of are serious others who aim only at raising a allmankind declare that the youth who are rightly educated should bebrought up in them and saturated with them some insist that theyshould be constantly hearing them read aloud and always learningthem so as to get by heart entire poets while others select choicepassages and long speeches and make compendiums of them sayingthat these ought to be committed to memory if a man is to be madegood and wise by experience and learning of many things and youwant me now to tell them plainly in what they are right and in whatthey are wrong 
 cle yes i do ath but how can i in one word rightly comprehend all of them i amof opinion and if i am not mistaken there is a general every one of these poets has said many things well and manythings the reverse of well and if this be true then i do affirm thatmuch learning is dangerous to youth 
 cle how would you advise the guardian of the law to act 
 ath in what respect 
 cle i mean to what pattern should he look as his guide inpermitting the young to learn some things and forbidding them to learnothers do not shrink from answering 
 ath my good cleinias i rather think that i am fortunate 
 cle how so 
 ath i think that i am not wholly in want of a pattern for when iconsider the words which we have spoken from early dawn until now andwhich as i believe have been inspired by heaven they appear to meto be quite like a poem when i reflected upon all these words ofours i naturally felt pleasure for of all the discourses which ihave ever learnt or heard either in poetry or prose this seemed tome to be the justest and most suitable for young men to hear icannot imagine any better pattern than this which the guardian ofthe law who is also the director of education can have he cannot dobetter than advise the teachers to teach the young these words and anywhich are of a like nature if he should happen to find them eitherin poetry or prose or if he come across unwritten discourses akinto ours he should certainly preserve them and commit them towriting and first of all he shall constrain the teachers themselvesto learn and approve them and any of them who will not shall notbe employed by him but those whom he finds agreeing in hisjudgment he shall make use of and shall commit to them theinstruction and education of youth and here and on this wise let myfanciful tale about letters and teachers of letters come to an end 
 cle i do not think stranger that we have wandered out of theproposed limits of the argument but whether we are right or not inour whole conception i cannot be very certain 
 ath the truth cleinias may be expected to become clearer when aswe have often said we arrive at the end of the whole discussion aboutlaws 
 cle yes 
 ath and now that we have done with the teacher of letters theteacher of the lyre has to receive orders from us 
 cle certainly 
 ath i think that we have only to recollect our previousdiscussions and we shall be able to give suitable regulationstouching all this part of instruction and education to the teachers ofthe lyre 
 cle to what do you refer 
 ath we were saying if i remember rightly that choristers of dionysus were to be specially quick intheir perceptions of rhythm and musical composition that they mightbe able to distinguish good and bad imitation that is to say theimitation of the good or bad soul when under the influence of the one and displaying the other in hymns and the souls of youth and inviting them to follow and attainvirtue by the way of imitation 
 cle very true 
 ath and with this view the teacher and the learner ought to usethe sounds of the lyre because its notes are pure the player whoteaches and his pupil rendering note for note in unison butcomplexity and variation of notes when the strings give one soundand the poet or composer of the melody gives when theymake concords and harmonies in which lesser and greater and quick or high and low notes are again whenthey make complex variations of rhythms which they adapt to the notesof the that sort of thing is not suited to those who haveto acquire a speedy and useful knowledge of music in three opposite principles are confusing and create a difficulty inlearning and our young men should learn quickly and their merenecessary acquirements are not few or trifling as will be shown indue course let the director of education attend to the principlesconcerning music which we are laying down as to the songs and wordsthemselves which the masters of choruses are to teach and thecharacter of them they have been already described by us and are thesame which when consecrated and adapted to the different said were to benefit cities by affording them an innocentamusement 
 cle that again is true 
 ath then let him who has been elected a director of music receivethese rules from us as containing the very truth and may he prosperin his office let us now proceed to lay down other rules inaddition to the preceding about dancing and gymnastic exercise ingeneral having said what remained to be said about the teaching ofmusic let us speak in like manner about gymnastic for boys and girlsought to learn to dance and practise gymnastic theynot 
 cle yes 
 ath then the boys ought to have dancing masters and the girlsdancing mistresses to exercise them 
 cle very good 
 ath then once more let us summon him who has the chief concern inthe business the superintendent of youth the director ofeducation he will have plenty to do if he is to have the chargeof music and gymnastic 
 cle but how will old man be able to attend to such great charges 
 ath o my friend there will be no difficulty for the law hasalready given and will give him permission to select as his assistantsin this charge any citizens male or female whom he desires and hewill know whom he ought to choose and will be anxious not to make amistake from a due sense of responsibility and from aconsciousness of the importance of his office and also because hewill consider that if young men have been and are well brought all things go swimmingly but if not it is not meet to do we say what will follow lest the regarders of omens shouldtake alarm about our infant state many things have been said by usabout dancing and about gymnastic movements in general for we includeunder gymnastics all military exercises such as archery and allhurling of weapons and the use of the light shield and allfighting with heavy arms and military evolutions and movements ofarmies and encampings and all that relates to horsemanship of allthese things there ought to be public teachers receiving pay from thestate and their pupils should be the men and boys in the state andalso the girls and women who are to know all these things while theyare yet girls they should have practised dancing in arms and the wholeart of women they should apply themselves toevolutions and tactics and the mode of grounding and taking uparms if for no other reason yet in case the whole military forceshould have to leave the city and carry on operations of waroutside that those who will have to guard the young and the rest ofthe city may be equal to the task and on the other hand whenenemies whether barbarian or hellenic come from without withmighty force and make a violent assault upon them and thus compelthem to fight for the possession of the city which is far frombeing an impossibility great would be the disgrace to the state ifthe women had been so miserably trained that they could not fightfor their young as birds will against any creature however die or undergo any danger but must instantly rush to thetemples and crowd at the altars and shrines and bring upon humannature the reproach that of all animals man is the most cowardly 
 cle such a want of education stranger is certainly an unseemlything to happen in a state as well as a great misfortune 
 ath suppose that we carry our law to the extent of saying thatwomen ought not to neglect military matters but that all and female alike shall attend to them 
 cle i quite agree 
 ath of wrestling we have spoken in part but of what i shouldcall the most important part we have not spoken and cannot easilyspeak without showing at the same time by gesture as well as in wordwhat we mean when word and action combine and not till then weshall explain clearly what has been said pointing out that of allmovements wrestling is most akin to the military art and is to bepursued for the sake of this and not this for the sake of wrestling 
 cle excellent 
 ath enough of wrestling we will now proceed to speak of othermovements of the body such motion may be in general called is of two kinds one of nobler figures imitating thehonourable the other of the more ignoble figures imitating the of both these there are two further subdivisions of theserious one kind is of those engaged in war and vehement is the exercise of a noble person and a manly heart the otherexhibits a temperate soul in the enjoyment of prosperity and modestpleasures and may be truly called and is the dance of peace thewarrior dance is different from the peaceful one and may be rightlytermed pyrrhic this imitates the modes of avoiding blows and missilesby dropping or giving way or springing aside or rising up or fallingdown also the opposite postures which are those of action as forexample the imitation of archery and the hurling of javelins andof all sorts of blows and when the imitation is of brave bodies andsouls and the action is direct and muscular giving for the most parta straight movement to the limbs of the i say is thetrue sort but the opposite is not right in the dance of peace whatwe have to consider is whether a man bears himself naturally andgracefully and after the manner of men who duly conform to the before proceeding i must distinguish the dancing about which thereis any doubt from that about which there is no doubt which is thedoubtful kind and how are the two to be distinguished there aredances of the bacchic sort both those in which as they say theyimitate drunken men and which are named after the nymphs and silenuses and satyrs and also those in which purifications aremade or mysteries this sort of dancing cannot berightly defined as having either a peaceful or a warlike character orindeed as having any meaning whatever and may i think be mosttruly described as distinct from the warlike dance and distinctfrom the peaceful and not suited for a city at all there let it so leaving it to lie we will proceed to the dances of war andpeace for with these we are undoubtedly concerned now theunwarlike muse which honours in dance the gods and the sons of thegods is entirely associated with the consciousness of class may be subdivided into two lesser classes of which oneis expressive of an escape from some labour or danger into good andhas greater pleasures the other expressive of preservation andincrease of former good in which the pleasure is less these cases every man when the pleasure is greater moves hisbody more and less when the pleasure is less and again if he bemore orderly and has learned courage from discipline he waves if he be a coward and has no training or he makesgreater and more violent movements and in general when he is speakingor singing he is not altogether able to keep his body still and soout of the imitation of words in gestures the whole art of dancing hasarisen and in these various kinds of imitation one man moves in anorderly another in a disorderly manner and as the ancients may beobserved to have given many names which are according to nature anddeserving of praise so there is an excellent one which they havegiven to the dances of men who in their times of prosperity aremoderate in their giver of names whoever he to them a very true and poetical and rational name when hecalled them emmeleiai or dances of order thus establishing two kindsof dances of the nobler sort the dance of war which he called thepyrrhic and the dance of peace which he called emmeleia or the danceof order giving to each their appropriate and becoming name thesethings the legislator should indicate in general outline and theguardian of the law should enquire into them and search them dancing with music and assigning to the several sacrificialfeasts that which is suitable to them and when he has consecrated allof them in due order he shall for the future change of dance or song thenceforward the city and the citizensshall continue to have the same pleasures themselves being as faras possible alike and shall live well and happily 
 i have described the dances which are appropriate to noble bodiesand generous souls but it is necessary also to consider and knowuncomely persons and thoughts and those which are intended to producelaughter in comedy and have a comic character in respect of and dance and of the imitations which these afford for seriousthings cannot be understood without laughable things nor opposites atall without opposites if a man is really to have intelligence ofeither but he can not carry out both in action if he is to haveany degree of virtue and for this very reason he should learn themboth in order that he may not in ignorance do or say anything whichis ridiculous and out of should command slaves and hiredstrangers to imitate such things but he should never take any seriousinterest in them himself nor should any freeman or freewoman bediscovered taking pains to learn them and there should always be someelement of novelty in the imitation let these then be laid down bothin law and in our discourse as the regulations of laughableamusements which are generally called comedy and if any of theserious poets as they are termed who write tragedy come to us strangers may we go to your city and country or may we shall we bring with us our is your will about shall we answer the divine men i think that ouranswer should be as of strangers we will say to also according to our ability are tragic poets and our tragedyis the best and noblest for our whole state is an imitation of thebest and noblest life which we affirm to be indeed the very truthof tragedy you are poets and we are poets both makers of the samestrains rivals and antagonists in the noblest of dramas which truelaw can alone perfect as our hope is do not then suppose that weshall all in a moment allow you to erect your stage in the agora orintroduce the fair voices of your actors speaking above our permit you to harangue our women and children and the commonpeople about our institutions in language other than our own andvery often the opposite of our own for a state would be mad whichgave you this licence until the magistrates had determined whetheryour poetry might be recited and was fit for publication or o ye sons and scions of the softer muses first of all showyour songs to the magistrates and let them compare them with our if they are the same or better we will give you a chorus but ifnot then my friends we cannot let these then be the customsordained by law about all dances and the teaching of them and letmatters relating to slaves be separated from those relating tomasters if you do not object 
 cle we can have no hesitation in assenting when you put thematter thus 
 ath there still remain three studies suitable for is one of them the measurement of length surface anddepth is the second and the third has to do with the revolutions ofthe stars in relation to one another not every one has need to toilthrough all these things in a strictly scientific manner but only afew and who they are to be we will hereafter indicate at the will be the proper place not to know what is necessary formankind in general and what is the truth is disgraceful to everyone and yet to enter into these matters minutely is neither easy norat all possible for every one but there is something in them which isnecessary and cannot be set aside and probably he who made theproverb about god originally had this in view when he said even god himself can fight against meant if iam not mistaken divine necessity for as to the human necessitiesof which the many speak when they talk in this manner nothing can bemore ridiculous than such an application of the words 
 cle and what necessities of knowledge are there stranger whichare divine and not human 
 ath i conceive them to be those of which he who has no use norany knowledge at all cannot be a god or or hero to able to take any serious thought or charge of them and very unlikea divine man would he be who is unable to count one two three orto distinguish odd and even numbers or is unable to count at reckon night and day and who is totally unacquainted with therevolution of the sun and moon and the other stars there would begreat folly in supposing that all these are not necessary parts ofknowledge to him who intends to know anything about the highestkinds of knowledge but which these are and how many there are ofthem and when they are to be learned and what is to be learnedtogether and what apart and the whole correlation of them must berightly apprehended first and these leading the way we may proceed tothe other parts of knowledge for so necessity grounded in natureconstrains us against which we say that no god contends or ever willcontend 
 cle i think stranger that what you have now said is very true andagreeable to nature 
 ath yes cleinias that is so but it is difficult for thelegislator to begin with these studies at a more convenient time wewill make regulations for them 
 cle you seem stranger to be afraid of our habitual ignorance ofthe subject there is no reason why that should prevent you fromspeaking out 
 ath i certainly am afraid of the difficulties to which youallude but i am still more afraid of those who apply themselves tothis sort of knowledge and apply themselves badly for entireignorance is not so terrible or extreme an evil and is far from beingthe greatest of all too much cleverness and too much with an ill bringing up are far more fatal 
 cle true 
 ath all freemen i conceive should learn as much of these branchesof knowledge as every child in egypt is taught when he learns thealphabet in that country arithmetical games have been invented forthe use of mere children which they learn as a pleasure andamusement they have to distribute apples and garlands using the samenumber sometimes for a larger and sometimes for a lesser number ofpersons and they arrange pugilists and wrestlers as they pairtogether by lot or remain over and show how their turns come innatural order another mode of amusing them is to distributevessels sometimes of gold brass silver and the like intermixedwith one another sometimes of one metal only as i was saying theyadapt to their amusement the numbers in common use and in this waymake more intelligible to their pupils the arrangements andmovements of armies and expeditions in the management of ahousehold they make people more useful to themselves and more wideawake and again in measurements of things which have length andbreadth and depth they free us from that natural ignorance of allthese things which is so ludicrous and disgraceful 
 cle what kind of ignorance do you mean 
 ath o my dear cleinias i like yourself have late in life heardwith amazement of our ignorance in these matters to me we appear tobe more like pigs than men and i am quite ashamed not only ofmyself but of all hellenes 
 cle about what say stranger what you mean 
 ath i will or rather i will show you my meaning by a question anddo you please to answer me you know i suppose what length is 
 cle certainly 
 ath and what breadth is 
 cle to be sure 
 ath and you know that these are two distinct things and that thereis a third thing called depth 
 cle of course 
 ath and do not all these seem to you to be commensurable withthemselves 
 cle yes 
 ath that is to say length is naturally commensurable withlength and breadth with breadth and depth in like manner with depth 
 cle undoubtedly 
 ath but if some things are commensurable and others whollyincommensurable and you think that all things are commensurable whatis your position in regard to them 
 cle clearly far from good 
 ath concerning length and breadth when compared with depth orbreadth when and length when compared with one another are not allthe hellenes agreed that these are commensurable with one in some way 
 cle quite true 
 ath but if they are absolutely incommensurable and yet all of usregard them as commensurable have we not reason to be ashamed ofour compatriots and might we not say to ye best ofhellenes is not this one of the things of which we were saying thatnot to know them is disgraceful and of which to have a bare knowledgeonly is no great distinction 
 cle certainly 
 ath and there are other things akin to these in which there springup other errors of the same family 
 cle what are they 
 ath the natures of commensurable and incommensurable quantitiesin their relation to one another a man who is good for a thingought to be able when he thinks to distinguish them and differentpersons should compete with one another in asking questions whichwill be a fair better and more graceful way of passing their timethan the old game of draughts 
 cle i dare say and these pastimes are not so very unlike a game ofdraughts 
 ath and these as i maintain cleinias are the studies which ouryouth ought to learn for they are innocent and not difficult thelearning of them will be an amusement and they will benefit thestate if anyone is of another mind let him say what he has to say 
 cle certainly 
 ath then if these studies are such as we maintain we will includethem if not they shall be excluded 
 cle assuredly but may we not now stranger prescribe thesestudies as necessary and so fill up the lacunae of our laws 
 ath they shall be regarded as pledges which may be hereafterredeemed and removed from our state if they do not please either uswho give them or you who accept them 
 cle a fair condition 
 ath next let us see whether we are or are not willing that thestudy of astronomy shall be proposed for our youth 
 cle proceed 
 ath here occurs a strange phenomenon which certainly cannot in anypoint of view be tolerated 
 cle to what are you referring 
 ath men say that we ought not to enquire into the supreme god andthe nature of the universe nor busy ourselves in searching out thecauses of things and that such enquiries are impious whereas thevery opposite is the truth 
 cle what do you mean 
 ath perhaps what i am saying may seem paradoxical and atvariance with the usual language of age but when any one has any goodand true notion which is for the advantage of the state and in everyway acceptable to god he cannot abstain from expressing it 
 cle your words are reasonable enough but shall we find any good ortrue notion about the stars 
 ath my good friends at this hour all of us hellenes tell i may use such an expression about those great gods the sun andthe moon 
 cle lies of what nature 
 ath we say that they and divers other stars do not keep the samepath and we call them planets or wanderers 
 cle very true stranger and in the course of my life i haveoften myself seen the morning star and the evening star and diversothers not moving in their accustomed course but wandering out oftheir path in all manner of ways and i have seen the sun and moondoing what we all know that they do 
 ath just so megillus and cleinias and i maintain that ourcitizens and our youth ought to learn about the nature of the godsin heaven so far as to be able to offer sacrifices and pray to themin pious language and not to blaspheme about them 
 cle there you are right if such a knowledge be only attainable andif we are wrong in our mode of speaking now and can be betterinstructed and learn to use better language then i quite agree withyou that such a degree of knowledge as will enable us to speak rightlyshould be acquired by us and now do you try to explain to us yourwhole meaning and we on our part will endeavour to understand you 
 ath there is some difficulty in understanding my meaning but not avery great one nor will any great length of time be required andof this i am myself a proof for i did not know these things long in the days of my youth and yet i can explain them to you in abrief space of time whereas if they had been difficult i couldcertainly never have explained them all old as i am to old menlike yourselves 
 cle true but what is this study which you describe as wonderfuland fitting for youth to learn but of which we are ignorant tryand explain the nature of it to us as clearly as you can 
 ath i will for o my good friends that other doctrine about thewandering of the sun and the moon and the other stars is not thetruth but the very reverse of the truth each of them moves in thesame in many paths but in one only which is circular andthe varieties are only apparent nor are we right in supposing thatthe swiftest of them is the slowest nor conversely that theslowest is the quickest and if what i say is true only justimagine that we had a similar notion about horses running atolympia or about men who ran in the long course and that weaddressed the swiftest as the slowest and the slowest as the sang the praises of the vanquished as though he were that case our praises would not be true nor very agreeableto the runners though they be but men and now to commit the sameerror about the gods which would have been ludicrous and erroneousin the case of not that ludicrous and erroneous 
 cle worse than ludicrous i should say 
 ath at all events the gods cannot like us to be spreading afalse report of them 
 cle most true if such is the fact 
 ath and if we can show that such is really the fact then all thesematters ought to be learned so far as is necessary for the avoidanceof impiety but if we cannot they may be let alone and let this beour decision 
 cle very good 
 ath enough of laws relating to education and learning buthunting and similar pursuits in like manner claim our attention forthe legislator appears to have a duty imposed upon him which goesbeyond mere legislation there is something over and above law whichlies in a region between admonition and law and has several timesoccurred to us in the course of discussion for example in theeducation of very young children there were things as we are not to be defined and to regard them as matters of positivelaw is a great absurdity now our laws and the whole constitutionof our state having been thus delineated the praise of the virtuouscitizen is not complete when he is described as the person whoserves the laws best and obeys them most but the higher form ofpraise is that which describes him as the good citizen who passesthrough life undefiled and is obedient to the words of the when he is giving laws and when he assigns praise and blame thisis the truest word that can be spoken in praise of a citizen andthe true legislator ought not only to write his laws but also tointerweave with them all such things as seem to him honourable anddishonourable and the perfect citizen ought to seek to strengthenthese no less than the principles of law which are sanctioned bypunishments i will adduce an example which will clear up mymeaning and will be a sort of witness to my words hunting is of wideextent and has a name under which many things are included for thereis a hunting of creatures in the water and of creatures in the there is a great deal of hunting of land animals of all kinds andnot of wild beasts only the hunting after man is also worthy ofconsideration there is the hunting after him in war and there isoften a hunting after him in the way of friendship which is praisedand also blamed and there is thieving and the hunting which ispractised by robbers and that of armies against armies now thelegislator in laying down laws about hunting can neither abstainfrom noting these things nor can he make threatening ordinances whichwill assign rules and penalties about all of them what is he to will have to praise and blame hunting with a view to the exerciseand pursuits of youth and on the other hand the young man mustlisten obediently neither pleasure nor pain should hinder him and heshould regard as his standard of action the praises and injunctions ofthe legislator rather than the punishments which he imposes by being premised there will follow next in order moderate praiseand censure of hunting the praise being assigned to that kind whichwill make the souls of young men better and the censure to that whichhas the opposite effect 
 and now let us address young men in the form of a prayer for theirwelfare o friends we will say to them may no desire or love ofhunting in the sea or of angling or of catching the creatures inthe waters ever take possession of you either when you are awakeor when you are asleep by hook or with weels which latter is avery lazy contrivance and let not any desire of catching men and ofpiracy by sea enter into your souls and make you cruel and lawlesshunters and as to the desire of thieving in town or country may itnever enter into your most passing thoughts nor let the insidiousfancy of catching birds which is hardly worthy of freemen comeinto the head of any youth there remains therefore for our athletesonly the hunting and catching of land animals of which the one sortis called hunting by night in which the hunters sleep in turn and arelazy this is not to be commended any more than that which hasintervals of rest in which the will strength of beasts is subduedby nets and snares and not by the victory of a laborious only the best kind of hunting is allowed at ofquadrupeds which is carried on with horses and dogs and ownpersons and they get the victory over the animals by running themdown and striking them and hurling at them those who have a care ofgodlike manhood taking them with their own hands the praise and blamewhich is assigned to all these things has now been declared and letthe law be as no one hinder these who verily are sacredhunters from following the chase wherever and whither soever theywill but the hunter by night who trusts to his nets and not be allowed to hunt anywhere the fowler in the mountains andwaste places shall be permitted but on cultivated ground and onconsecrated wilds he shall not be permitted and any one who meets himmay stop him as to the hunter in waters he may hunt anywhereexcept in harbours or sacred streams or marshes or pools providedonly that he do not pollute the water with poisonous juices and nowwe may say that all our enactments about education are complete

 book vii 
 
 and now assuming children of both sexes to have been born itwill be proper for us to consider in the next place their nurtureand education this cannot be left altogether unnoticed and yet maybe thought a subject fitted rather for precept and admonition than forlaw in private life there are many little things not alwaysapparent arising out of the pleasures and pains and desires ofindividuals which run counter to the intention of the legislator andmake the characters of the citizens various and is anevil in states for by reason of their smallness and frequentoccurrence there would be an unseemliness and want of propriety inmaking them penal by law and if made penal they are thedestruction of the written law because mankind get the habit offrequently transgressing the law in small matters the result isthat you cannot legislate about them and still less can you besilent i speak somewhat darkly but i shall endeavour also to bringmy wares into the light of day for i acknowledge that at presentthere is a want of clearness in what i am saying 
 cleinias very true 
 athenian stranger am i not right in maintaining that a goodeducation is that which tends most to the improvement of mind andbody 
 cle undoubtedly 
 ath and nothing can be plainer than that the fairest bodies arethose which grow up from infancy in the best and straightest manner 
 cle certainly 
 ath and do we not further observe that the first shoot of everyliving thing is by far the greatest and fullest many will evencontend that a man at does not reach twice the heightwhich he attained at five 
 cle true 
 ath well and is not rapid growth without proper and abundantexercise the source endless evils in the body 
 cle yes 
 ath and the body should have the most exercise when it receivesmost nourishment 
 cle but stranger are we to impose this great amount of exerciseupon infants 
 ath nay rather on the bodies of infants still unborn 
 cle what do you mean my good sir in the process of gestation 
 ath exactly i am not at all surprised that you have never heard ofthis very peculiar sort of gymnastic applied to such little although strange i will endeavour to explain to you 
 cle by all means 
 ath the practice is more easy for us to understand than for you byreason of certain amusements which are carried to excess by us atathens not only boys but often older persons are in the habit ofkeeping quails and cocks which they train to fight one another andthey are far from thinking that the contests in which they stir themup to fight with one another are sufficient exercise for in additionto this they carry them about tucked beneath their armpits holdingthe smaller birds in their hands the larger under their arms andgo for a walk of a great many miles for the sake of health that is tosay not their own health but the health of the birds wherebythey prove to any intelligent person that all bodies are benefited byshakings and movements when they are moved without weariness whethermotion proceeds from themselves or is caused by a swing or at on horseback or by other bodies in whatever way moving and thatthus gaining the mastery over food and drink they are able toimpart beauty and health and strength but admitting all this whatfollows shall we make a ridiculous law that the pregnant womanshall walk about and fashion the embryo within as we fashion waxbefore it hardens and after birth swathe the infant for two that we compel nurses under penalty of a legal fine to bealways carrying the children somewhere or other either to thetemples or into the country or to their relations houses untilthey are well able to stand and to take care that their limbs are notdistorted by leaning on them when they are too shouldcontinue to carry them until the infant has completed its thirdyear the nurses should be strong and there should be more than oneof them shall these be our rules and shall we impose a penalty forthe neglect of them no no the penalty of which we were speakingwill fall upon our own heads more than enough 
 cle what penalty 
 ath ridicule and the difficulty of getting the feminine dispositions of the nurses to comply 
 cle then why was there any need to speak of the matter at all 
 ath the reason is that masters and freemen in states when theyhear of it are very likely to arrive at a true conviction thatwithout due regulation of private life in cities stability in thelaying down of laws is hardly to be expected and he who makes thisreflection may himself adopt the laws just now mentioned them may order his house and state well and be happy 
 cle likely enough 
 ath and therefore let us proceed with our legislation until we havedetermined the exercises which are suited to the souls of youngchildren in the same manner in which we have begun to go throughthe rules relating to their bodies 
 cle by all means 
 ath let us assume then as a first principle in relation both tothe body and soul of very young creatures that nursing and movingabout by day and night is good for them all and that the younger theyare the more they will need it infants should live if that werepossible as if they were always rocking at sea this is the lessonwhich we may gather from the experience of nurses and likewise fromthe use of the remedy of motion in the rites of the corybantes forwhen mothers want their restless children to go to sleep they do notemploy rest but on the contrary them in theirarms nor do they give them silence but they sing to them and lapthem in sweet strains and the bacchic women are cured of their frenzyin the same manner by the use of the dance and of music 
 cle well stranger and what is the reason of this 
 ath the reason is obvious 
 cle what 
 ath the affection both of the bacchantes and of the children isan emotion of fear which springs out of an evil habit of the when some one applies external agitation to affections of thissort the motion coming from without gets the better of the terribleand violent internal one and produces a peace and calm in the quiets the restless palpitation of the heart which is a thingmuch to be desired sending the children to sleep and making thebacchantes although they remain awake to dance to the pipe withthe help of the gods to whom they offer acceptable sacrifices andproducing in them a sound mind which takes the place of their to express what i mean in a word there is a good deal to be saidin favour of this treatment 
 cle certainly 
 ath but if fear has such a power we ought to infer from thesefacts that every soul which from youth upward has been familiarwith fears will be made more liable to fear and every one will allowthat this is the way to form a habit of cowardice and not of courage 
 cle no doubt 
 ath and on the other hand the habit of overcoming from our youthupwards the fears and terrors which beset us may be said to be anexercise of courage 
 cle true 
 ath and we may say that the use of exercise and motion in theearliest years of life greatly contributes to create a part ofvirtue in the soul 
 cle quite true 
 ath further a cheerful temper or the reverse may be regardedas having much to do with high spirit on the one hand or withcowardice on the other 
 cle to be sure 
 ath then now we must endeavour to show how and to what extent wemay if we please without difficulty implant either character inthe young 
 cle certainly 
 ath there is a common opinion that luxury makes the disposition ofyouth discontented and irascible and vehemently excited by on the other hand excessive and savage servitude makes men meanand abject and haters of their kind and therefore makes themundesirable associates 
 cle but how must the state educate those who do not as yetunderstand the language of the country and are therefore incapable ofappreciating any sort of instruction 
 ath i will tell you animal that is born is wont to uttersome cry and this is especially the case with man and he is alsoaffected with the inclination to weep more than any other animal 
 cle quite true 
 ath do not nurses when they want to know what an infant by these anything is brought to the infant and he issilent then he is supposed to be pleased but when he weeps andcries out then he is not pleased for tears and cries are theinauspicious signs by which children show what they love and hate nowthe time which is thus spent is no less than three years and is avery considerable portion of life to be passed ill or well 
 cle true 
 ath does not the discontented and ungracious nature appear to youto be full of lamentations and sorrows more than a good man ought tobe 
 cle certainly 
 ath well but if during these three years every possible carewere taken that our nursling should have as little of sorrow and in general of pain as was possible might we not expect in earlychildhood to make his soul more gentle and cheerful 
 cle to be sure especially if we could procure hima variety of pleasures 
 ath there i can no longer agree cleinias you amaze me to bringhim up in such a way would be his utter ruin for the beginning isalways the most critical part of education let us see whether i amright 
 cle proceed 
 ath the point about which you and i differ is of greatimportance and i hope that you megillus will help to decide betweenus for i maintain that the true life should neither seek forpleasures nor on the other hand entirely avoid pains but shouldembrace the middle state which i just spoke of as gentle andbenign and is a state which we by some divine presage and inspirationrightly ascribe to god now i say he among men too who would bedivine ought to pursue after this mean should not rushheadlong into pleasures for he will not be free from pains norshould we allow any one young or old male or female to be thusgiven any more than ourselves and least of all the in infancy more than at any other time the character isengrained by habit nay more if i were not afraid of appearing to beridiculous i would say that a woman during her year of pregnancyshould of all women be most carefully tended and kept from violent orexcessive pleasures and pains and should at that time cultivategentleness and benevolence and kindness 
 cle you need not ask megillus stranger which of us has mosttruly spoken for i myself agree that all men ought to avoid thelife of unmingled pain or pleasure and pursue always a middle having spoken well may i add that you have been well answered 
 ath very good cleinias and now let us all three consider afurther point 
 cle what is it 
 ath that all the matters which we are now describing are commonlycalled by the general name of unwritten customs and what are termedthe laws of our ancestors are all of similar nature and thereflection which lately arose in our minds that we can neither callthese things laws nor yet leave them unmentioned is justified forthey are the bonds of the whole state and come in between the writtenlaws which are or are hereafter to be laid down they are justancestral customs of great antiquity which if they are rightlyordered and made habitual shield and preserve the previously existingwritten law but if they depart from right and fall into they are like the props of builders which slip away out oftheir place and cause a universal part drags another the fair falls because the old foundations areundermined reflecting upon this cleinias you ought to bind togetherthe new state in every possible way omitting nothing whether greator small of what are called laws or manners or pursuits for by thesemeans a city is bound together and all these things are onlylasting when they depend upon one another and therefore we must notwonder if we find that many apparently trifling customs or usages comepouring in and lengthening out our laws 
 cle very true we are disposed to agree with you 
 ath up to the age of three years whether of boy or girl if aperson strictly carries out our previous regulations and makes thema principal aim he will do much for the advantage of the youngcreatures but at three four five and even six years the childishnature will require sports now is the time to get rid of inhim punishing him but not so as to disgrace him we were sayingabout slaves that we ought neither to add insult to punishment soas to anger them nor yet to leave them unpunished lest they and a like rule is to be observed in the case of children at that age have certain natural modes ofamusement which they find out for themselves when they meet and allthe children who are between the ages of three and six ought to meetat the temples the villages the several families of a village unitingon one spot the nurses are to see that the children behave properlyand themselves and all their companies are to be underthe control of twelve matrons one for each company who areannually selected to inspect them from the women previously the women who have authority over marriage whom the guardiansof the law appoint these matrons shall be chosen by the women whohave authority over marriage one out of each tribe all are to beof the same age and let each of them as soon as she is office and go to the temples every day punishing alloffenders male or female who are slaves or strangers by the help ofsome of the public slaves but if any citizen disputes the her bring him before the wardens of the city or if there be nodispute let her punish him herself after the age of six years thetime has arrived for the separation of the boys live withboys and girls in like manner with girls now they must begin boys going to teachers of horsemanship and the use of thebow the javelin and sling and the girls too if they do not any rate until they know how to manage these weapons andespecially how to handle heavy arms for i may note that the practicewhich now prevails is almost universally misunderstood 
 cle in what respect 
 ath in that the right and left hand are supposed to be by naturedifferently suited for our various uses of them whereas no differenceis found in the use of the feet and the lower limbs but in the use ofthe hands we are as it were maimed by the folly of nurses andmothers for although our several limbs are by nature balanced wecreate a difference in them by bad habit in some cases this is ofno consequence as for example when we hold the lyre in the lefthand and the plectrum in the right but it is downright folly to makethe same distinction in other cases the custom of the scythiansproves our error for they not only hold the bow from them with theleft hand and draw the arrow to them with their right but useeither hand for both purposes and there are many similar examplesin charioteering and other things from which we may learn thatthose who make the left side weaker than the right act contrary tonature in the case of the plectrum which is of horn only andsimilar instruments as i was saying it is of no consequence butmakes a great difference and may be of very great importance to thewarrior who has to use iron weapons bows and javelins and thelike above all when in heavy armour he has to fight against heavyarmour and there is a very great difference between one who haslearnt and one who has not and between one who has been trained ingymnastic exercises and one who has not been for as he who isperfectly skilled in the pancratium or boxing or wrestling is notunable to fight from his left side and does not limp and draggle inconfusion when his opponent makes him change his position so fighting and in all other things if i am not like who has these double powers of attack and defenceought not in any case to leave them either unused or untrained ifhe can help and if a person had the nature of geryon or briareus heought to be able with his hundred hands to throw a hundred darts magistrates male and female should see to all these women superintending the nursing and amusements of the the men superintending their education that all of them boys andgirls alike may be sound hand and foot and may not if they canhelp spoil the gifts of nature by bad habits 
 education has two of gymnastic which is concerned withthe body and the other of music which is designed for theimprovement of the soul and gymnastic has also two wrestling and one sort of dancing imitates musical aims at preserving dignity and freedom the other aims atproducing health agility and beauty in the limbs and parts of thebody giving the proper flexion and extension to each of them aharmonious motion being diffused everywhere and forming a suitableaccompaniment to the dance as regards wrestling the tricks whichantaeus and cercyon devised in their systems out of a vain spirit ofcompetition or the tricks of boxing which epeius or amycusinvented are useless and unsuitable for war and do not deserve tohave much said about them but the art of wrestling erect andkeeping free the neck and hands and sides working with energy andconstancy with a composed strength and for the sake are always useful and are not to be neglected but to beenjoined alike on masters and scholars when we reach that part oflegislation and we will desire the one to give their instructionsfreely and the others to receive them thankfully nor again must weomit suitable imitations of war in our choruses here in crete youhave the armed dances if the curetes and the lacedaemonians havethose of the dioscuri and our virgin lady delighting in theamusement of the dance thought it not fit to amuse herself with emptyhands she must be clothed in a complete suit of armour and in thisattire go through the dance and youths and maidens should in everyrespect imitate her esteeming highly the favour of the with a view to the necessities of war and to festiveoccasions it will be right also for the boys until such time as theygo out to war to make processions and supplications to all the godsin goodly array armed and on horseback in dances and or slow offering up prayers to the gods and to the sons of also engaging in contests and preludes of contests if at these objects for these sorts of exercises and no others areuseful both in peace and war and are beneficial alike to states andto private houses but other labours and sports and exercises of thebody are unworthy of freemen o megillus and cleinias 
 i have now completely described the kind of gymnastic which i saidat first ought to be described if you know of any better will youcommunicate your thoughts 
 cle it is not easy stranger to put aside these principles ofgymnastic and wrestling and to enunciate better ones 
 ath now we must say what has yet to be said about the gifts ofthe muses and of apollo before we fancied that we had said that gymnastic alone remained but now we see clearly whatpoints have been omitted and should be first proclaimed of let us proceed to speak 
 cle by all means 
 ath let me tell you once you have heard me say thesame before that caution must be always exercised both by the speakerand by the hearer about anything that is very singular and my tale is one which many a man would be afraid to tell andyet i have a confidence which makes me go on 
 cle what have you to say stranger 
 ath i say that in states generally no one has observed that theplays of childhood have a great deal to do with the permanence or wantof permanence in legislation for when plays are ordered with a viewto children having the same plays and amusing themselves after thesame manner and finding delight in the same playthings the moresolemn institutions of the state are allowed to remain if sports are disturbed and innovations are made in them andthey constantly change and the young never speak of their havingthe same likings or the same established notions of good and badtaste either in the bearing of their bodies or in their dress but hewho devises something new and out of the way in figures and coloursand the like is held in special honour we may truly say that nogreater evil can happen in a state for he who changes the sports issecretly changing the manners of the young and making the old to bedishonoured among them and the new to be honoured and i affirm thatthere is nothing which is a greater injury to all states than sayingor thinking thus will you hear me tell how great i deem the evil tobe 
 cle you mean the evil of blaming antiquity in states 
 ath exactly 
 cle if you are speaking of that you will find in us hearers whoare disposed to receive what you say not unfavourably but mostfavourably 
 ath i should expect so 
 cle proceed 
 ath well then let us give all the greater heed to one the argument affirms that any change whatever except fromevil is the most dangerous of all things this is true in the caseof the seasons and of the winds in the management of our bodies andthe habits of our of all things except as i said the bad he who looks at the constitution of individuals accustomedto eat any sort of meat or drink any drink or to do any work whichthey can get may see that they are at first disordered by them butafterwards as time goes on their bodies grow adapted to them andthey learn to know and like variety and have good health andenjoyment of life and if ever afterwards they are confined again to asuperior diet at first they are troubled with disorders and withdifficulty become habituated to their new food a similar principle wemay imagine to hold good about the minds of men and the natures oftheir souls for when they have been brought up in certain laws whichby some divine providence have remained unchanged during long ages sothat no one has any memory or tradition of their ever having beenotherwise than they are then every one is afraid and ashamed tochange that which is established the legislator must somehow find away of implanting this reverence for antiquity and i would proposethe following are apt to fancy as i was saying when the plays of children are altered they are merely plays notseeing that the most serious and detrimental consequences arise out ofthe change and they readily comply with the wishes instead ofdeterring him not considering that these children who makeinnovations in their games when they grow up to be men will bedifferent from the last generation of children and beingdifferent will desire a different sort of life and under theinfluence of this desire will want other institutions and laws and noone of them reflects that there will follow what i just now called thegreatest of evils to states changes in bodily fashions are no suchserious evils but frequent changes in the praise and censure ofmanners are the greatest of evils and require the utmost prevision 
 cle to be sure 
 ath and now do we still hold to our former assertion thatrhythms and music in general are imitations of good and evilcharacters in men what say you 
 cle that is the only doctrine which we can admit 
 ath must we not then try in every possible way to prevent ouryouth from even desiring to imitate new modes either in dance or must any one be allowed to offer them varieties of pleasures 
 cle most true 
 ath can any of us imagine a better mode of effecting this objectthan that of the egyptians 
 cle what is their method 
 ath to consecrate every sort of dance or melody first we shouldordain for the year what they ought to be andat what time and in honour of what gods sons of gods and heroesthey ought to be celebrated and in the next place what hymnsought to be sung at the several sacrifices and with what dances theparticular festival is to be honoured this has to be arranged atfirst by certain persons and when arranged the whole assembly ofthe citizens are to offer sacrifices and libations to the fates andall the other gods and to consecrate the several odes to gods andheroes and if any one offers any other hymns or dances to any oneof the gods the priests and priestesses acting in concert with theguardians of the law shall with the sanction of religion and thelaw exclude him and he who is excluded if he do not submit shallbe liable all his life long to have a suit of impiety broughtagainst him by any one who likes 
 cle very good 
 ath in the consideration of this subject let us remember what isdue to ourselves 
 cle to what are you referring 
 ath i mean that any young man and much more any old one when hesees or hears anything strange or unaccustomed does not at once runto embrace the paradox but he stands considering like a person whois at a place where three paths meet and does not very well knowhis may be alone or he may be walking with others and hewill say to himself and them which is the way and will not moveforward until he is satisfied that he is going right and this is whatwe must do in the present strange discussion on thesubject of law has arisen which requires the utmost we should not at our age be too ready to speak about such greatmatters or be confident that we can say anything certain all in amoment 
 cle most true 
 ath then we will allow time for reflection and decide when we havegiven the subject sufficient consideration but that we may not behindered from completing the natural arrangement of our laws let usproceed to the conclusion of them in due order for very god will the exposition of them when completed may throw lighton our present perplexity 
 cle excellent stranger let us do as you propose 
 ath let us then affirm the paradox that strains of music are ourlaws nomoi and this latter being the name which the ancients gaveto lyric songs they probably would not have very much objected to ourproposed application of the word some one either asleep or have had a dreamy suspicion of their nature and let our decreebe as one in singing or dancing shall offend againstpublic and consecrated models and the general fashion among theyouth any more than he would offend against any other law and he whoobserves this law shall be blameless but he who is disobedient asi was saying shall be punished by the guardians of the laws and bythe priests and priestesses suppose that we imagine this to be ourlaw 
 cle very good 
 ath can any one who makes such laws escape ridicule let us think that our only safety will be in first framing certain modelsfor composers one of these models shall be as when asacrifice is going on and the victims are being burnt according i say any one who may be a son or brother standing byanother at the altar and over the victims horribly blasphemes willnot his words inspire despondency and evil omens and forebodings inthe mind of his father and of his other kinsmen 
 cle of course 
 ath and this is just what takes place in almost all our cities amagistrate offers a public sacrifice and there come in not one butmany choruses who take up a position a little way from the altar andfrom time to time pour forth all sorts of horrible blasphemies onthe sacred rites exciting the souls of the audience with words andrhythms and melodies most sorrowful to hear and he who at themoment when the city is offering sacrifice makes the citizens weepmost carries away the palm of victory now ought we not to forbidsuch strains as these and if ever our citizens must hear suchlamentations then on some unblest and inauspicious day let there bechoruses of foreign and hired minstrels like those hirelings whoaccompany the departed at funerals with barbarous carian is the sort of thing which will be appropriate if we have suchstrains at all and let the apparel of the singers be not circletsand ornaments of gold but the reverse enough of all this i willsimply ask once more whether we shall lay down as one of ourprinciples of song 
 cle what 
 ath that we should avoid every word of evil omen let that kindof song which is of good omen be heard everywhere and always in ourstate i need hardly ask again but shall assume that you agree withme 
 cle by all means that law is approved by the suffrages of us all 
 ath but what shall be our next musical law or type ought notprayers to be offered up to the gods when we sacrifice 
 cle certainly 
 ath and our third law if i am not mistaken will be to theeffect that our poets understanding prayers to be requests which wemake to the gods will take especial heed that they do not bymistake ask for evil instead of good to make such a prayer wouldsurely be too ridiculous 
 cle very true 
 ath were we not a little while ago quite convinced that no silveror golden plutus should dwell in our state 
 cle to be sure 
 ath and what has it been the object of our argument to show did wenot imply that the poets are not always quite capable of knowingwhat is good or evil and if one of them utters a mistaken prayer insong or words he will make our citizens pray for the opposite of whatis good in matters of the highest import than which as i was can be few greater mistakes shall we then propose as one of ourlaws and models relating to the muses 
 cle you explain the law more precisely 
 ath shall we make a law that the poet shall compose nothingcontrary to the ideas of the lawful or just or beautiful or are allowed in the state nor shall he be permitted tocommunicate his compositions to any private individuals until heshall have shown them to the appointed judges and the guardians of thelaw and they are satisfied with them as to the persons whom weappoint to be our legislators about music and as to the director ofeducation these have been already indicated once more then as ihave asked more than once shall this be our third law and do you say 
 cle let it be so by all means 
 ath then it will be proper to have hymns and praises of the with prayers and after the gods prayers and praisesshould be offered in like manner to demigods and heroes suitable totheir several characters 
 cle certainly 
 ath in the next place there will be no objection to a law thatcitizens who are departed and have done good and energetic with their souls or with their bodies and have been obedientto the laws should receive eulogies this will be very fitting 
 cle quite true 
 ath but to honour with hymns and panegyrics those who are stillalive is not safe a man should run his course and make a fairending and then we will praise him and let praise be given equallyto women as well as men who have been distinguished in virtue theorder of songs and dances shall be as are manyancient musical compositions and dances which are excellent andfrom these the city may freely select what is proper andsuitable and they shall choose judges of not less than fifty years ofage who shall make the selection and any of the old poems which theydeem sufficient they shall include any that are deficient oraltogether unsuitable they shall either utterly throw aside orexamine and amend taking into their counsel poets and making use of their poetical genius but explaining to them thewishes of the legislator in order that they may regulate and all choral strains according to the mind of the not allowing them to indulge except in some few matters theirindividual pleasures and fancies now the irregular strain of music isalways made ten thousand times better by attaining to law and rejecting the honeyed however that we mean wholly toexclude pleasure which is the characteristic of all music and if aman be brought up from childhood to the age of discretion and maturityin the use of the orderly and severe music when he hears the oppositehe detests it and calls it illiberal but if trained in the sweet andvulgar music he deems the severer kind cold and displeasing so i was saying before while he who hears them gains no more pleasurefrom the one than from the other the one has the advantage ofmaking those who are trained in it better men whereas the other makesthem worse 
 cle very true 
 ath again we must distinguish and determine on some generalprinciple what songs are suitable to women and what to men andmust assign to them their proper melodies and rhythms it isshocking for a whole harmony to be inharmonical or for a rhythm to beunrhythmical and this will happen when the melody is inappropriate tothem and therefore the legislator must assign to these also theirforms now both sexes have melodies and rhythms which of necessitybelong to them and those of women are clearly enough indicated bytheir natural difference the grand and that which tends tocourage may be fairly called manly but that which inclines tomoderation and temperance may be declared both in law and in ordinaryspeech to be the more womanly quality this then will be the generalorder of them 
 let us now speak of the manner of teaching and imparting them andthe persons to whom and the time when they are severally to beimparted as the shipwright first lays down the lines of the keel andthus as it were draws the ship in outline so do i seek todistinguish the patterns of life and lay down their keels accordingto the nature of different souls seeking truly to consider bywhat means and in what ways we may go through the voyage of lifebest now human affairs are hardly worth considering in earnest andyet we must be in earnest about sad necessity constrains having got thus far there will be a fitness in our completing thematter if we can only find some suitable method of doing so but whatdo i mean some one may ask this very question and quite 
 cle certainly 
 ath i say that about serious matters a man should be serious andabout a matter which is not serious he should not be serious andthat god is the natural and worthy object of our most serious andblessed endeavours for man as i said before is made to be theplaything of god and this truly considered is the best of also every man and woman should walk seriously and passlife in the noblest of pastimes and be of another mind from what theyare at present 
 cle in what respect 
 ath at present they think that their serious suits should be forthe sake of their sports for they deem war a serious must be managed well for the sake of peace but the truth there neither is nor has been nor ever will be eitheramusement or instruction in any degree worth speaking of in is nevertheless deemed by us to be the most serious of ourpursuits and therefore as we say every one of us should live thelife of peace as long and as well as he can and what is the right wayof living are we to live in sports always if so in what kind ofsports we ought to live sacrificing and singing and dancing andthen a man will be able to propitiate the gods and to defendhimself against his enemies and conquer them in battle the type ofsong or dance by which he will propitiate them has been described andthe paths along which he is to proceed have been cut for him hewill go forward in the spirit of the poet 
 telemachus some things thou wilt thyself find in thy heart butother things god will suggest for i deem that thou wast not broughtup without the will of the this ought to be the view of our alumni they ought to thinkthat what has been said is enough for them and that any otherthings their genius and god will suggest to will tell themto whom and when and to what gods severally they are to sacrificeand perform dances and how they may propitiate the deities andlive according to the appointment of nature being for the most partpuppets but having some little share of reality 
 megillus you have a low opinion of mankind stranger 
 ath nay megillus be not amazed but forgive was comparingthem with the gods and under that feeling i spoke let us grant ifyou wish that the human race is not to be despised but is worthyof some consideration 
 next follow the buildings for gymnasia and schools open to are to be in three places in the midst of the city andoutside the city and in the surrounding country also in three shall be schools for horse exercise and large groundsarranged with a view to archery and the throwing of missiles at whichyoung men may learn and practise of these mention has already beenmade and if the mention be not sufficiently explicit let us of them and embody them in laws in these several schoolslet there be dwellings for teachers who shall be brought from foreignparts by pay and let them teach those who attend the schools theart of war and the art of music and the children shall come notonly if their parents please but if they do not please there shallbe compulsory education as the saying is of all and sundry as farthis is possible and the pupils shall be regarded as belonging to thestate rather than to their parents my law would apply to females aswell as males they shall both go through the same exercises i assertwithout fear of contradiction that gymnastic and horsemanship are assuitable to women as to men of the truth of this i am persuadedfrom ancient tradition and at the present day there are said to becountless myriads of women in the neighbourhood of the black sauromatides who not only ride on horseback like men but haveenjoined upon them the use of bows and other weapons equally withthe men and i further affirm that if these things are can be more absurd than the practice which prevails in our owncountry of men and women not following the same pursuits with alltheir strength and with one mind for thus the state instead of beinga whole is reduced to a half but has the same imposts to pay and thesame toils to undergo and what can be a greater mistake for anylegislator to make than this 
 cle very true yet much of what has been asserted by us strangeris contrary to the custom of states still in saying that thediscourse should be allowed to proceed and that when the discussionis completed we should choose what seems best you spoke veryproperly and i now feel compunction for what i have said tell what you would next wish to say 
 ath i should wish to say cleinias as i said before that if thepossibility of these things were not sufficiently proven in fact thenthere might be an objection to the argument but the fact being as ihave said he who rejects the law must find some other ground ofobjection and failing this our exhortation will still hold will any one deny that women ought to share as far as possiblein education and in other ways with men for women do notshare in their whole life with men then they must have some otherorder of life 
 cle certainly 
 ath and what arrangement of life to be found anywhere is preferableto this community which we are now assigning to them shall weprefer that which is adopted by the thracians and many other races whouse their women to till the ground and to be shepherds of theirherds and flocks and to minister to them like shall wedo as we and people in our part of the world together asthe phrase is all our goods and chattels into one dwelling weentrust them to our women who are the stewards of them and whoalso preside over the shuttles and the whole art of spinning or shallwe take a middle course in lacedaemon the girlsshare in gymnastic and music while the women no longeremployed in spinning wool are hard at work weaving the web of will be no cheap or mean employment and in the duty ofserving and taking care of the household and bringing up which they will observe a sort of mean not participating in thetoils of war and if there were any necessity that they should fightfor their city and families unlike the amazons they would beunable to take part in archery or any other skilled use of could they after the example of the goddess carry shield orspear or stand up nobly for their country when it was beingdestroyed and strike terror into their enemies if only becausethey were seen in regular order living as they do they would neverdare at all to imitate the sauromatides who when compared withordinary women would appear to be like men let him who your legislators but i must say what i think the legislatorought to be whole and perfect and not half a man only he ought notto let the female sex live softly and waste money and have no order oflife while he takes the utmost care of the male sex and leaveshalf of life only blest with happiness when he might have made thewhole state happy 
 meg what shall we do cleinias shall we allow a stranger to rundown sparta in this fashion 
 cle yes for as we have given him liberty of speech we must let himgo on until we have perfected the work of legislation 
 meg very true 
 ath then now i may proceed 
 cle by all means 
 ath what will be the manner of life among men who may be supposedto have their food and clothing provided for them in moderation andwho have entrusted the practice of the arts to others and whosehusbandry committed to slaves paying a part of the produce bringsthem a return sufficient for men living temperately who common tables in which the men are placed apart and near themare the common tables of their families of their daughters andmothers which day by day the officers male and female are shall see to the behaviour of the company and so dismissthem after which the presiding magistrate and his attendants shallhonour with libations those gods to whom that day and night arededicated and then go home to men whose lives are thus ordered isthere no work remaining to be done which is necessary and fitting butshall each one of them live fattening like a beast such a life isneither just nor honourable nor can he who lives it fail of meetinghis due and the due reward of the idle fatted beast is that he shouldbe torn in pieces by some other valiant beast whose fatness is worndown by brave deeds and toil these regulations if we duly considerthem will never be exactly carried into execution under presentcircumstances nor as long as women and children and houses and allother things are the private property of individuals but if we canattain the form of polity we shall be very well to men living under this second polity there remains a work tobe accomplished which is far from being small or insignificant but isthe greatest of all works and ordained by the appointment ofrighteous law for the life which may be truly said to be concernedwith the virtue of body and soul is twice or more than twice as fullof toil and trouble as the pursuit after pythian and olympicvictories which debars a man from every employment of life for thereought to be no interfering with the greater work of providingthe necessary exercise and nourishment for the body and instructionand education for the soul night and day are not long enough forthe accomplishment of their perfection and consummation and thereforeto this end all freemen ought to arrange the way in which they willspend their time during the whole course of the day from morning tillevening and from evening till the morning of the next sunrise theremay seem to be some impropriety in the legislator determining minutelythe numberless details of the management of the house includingsuch particulars as the duty of wakefulness in those who are to beperpetual watchmen of the whole city for that any citizen shouldcontinue during the whole of any night in sleep instead of being seenby all his servants always the first to awake and get the regulation is to be called a law or only a be deemed base and unworthy of a freeman also that themistress of the house should be awakened by her handmaidens instead ofherself first awakening them is what the slaves male and female andthe and if that were possible everybody and everythingin the house should regard as base if they rise early they may allof them do much of their public and of their household business asmagistrates in the city and masters and mistresses in their privatehouses before the sun is up much sleep is not required by for our souls or bodies or for the actions which they no one who is asleep is good for anything any more than if hewere dead but he of us who has the most regard for life and reasonkeeps awake as long he can reserving only so much time for sleep asis expedient for health and much sleep is not required if thehabit of moderation be once rightly formed magistrates in stateswho keep awake at night are terrible to the bad whether enemies orcitizens and are honoured and reverenced by the just and are useful to themselves and to the whole state 
 a night which is passed in such a manner in addition to all advantages infuses a sort of courage into the mindsof the citizens when the day breaks the time has arrived for youthto go to their schoolmasters now neither sheep nor any otheranimals can live without a shepherd nor can children be leftwithout tutors or slaves without masters and of all animals theboy is the most unmanageable inasmuch as he has the fountain ofreason in him not yet regulated he is the most and insubordinate of animals wherefore he must be boundwith many bridles in the first place when he gets away frommothers and nurses he must be under the management of tutors onaccount of his childishness and foolishness then again being afreeman he must be controlled by teachers no matter what they by studies but he is also a slave and in that regard any freemanwho comes in his way may punish him and his tutor and hisinstructor if any of them does anything wrong and he who comesacross him and does not inflict upon him the punishment which hedeserves shall incur the greatest disgrace and let the guardian ofthe law who is the director of education see to him who coming inthe way of the offences which we have mentioned does not chastisethem when he ought or chastises them in a way which he ought not lethim keep a sharp and take especial care of the training ofour children directing their natures and always turning them to goodaccording to the law 
 but how can our law sufficiently train the director of for as yet all has been imperfect and nothing has beensaid either clear or satisfactory now as far as possible the lawought to leave nothing to him but to explain everything that hemay be an interpreter and tutor to others about dances and musicand choral strains i have already spoken both to the character of theselection of them and the manner in which they are to be amendedand consecrated but we have not as yet spoken o illustrious guardianof education of the manner in which your pupils are to use thosestrains which are written in prose although you have been informedwhat martial strains they are to learn and practise what relates inthe first place to the learning of letters and secondly to the also to calculation which as we were saying is needful for themall to learn and any other things which are required with a view towar and the management of house and city and looking to the sameobject what is useful in the revolutions of the heavenly and sun and moon and the various regulations about thesematters which are necessary for the whole am speaking of thearrangements of days in periods of months and of months in are to be observed in order that seasons and sacrifices andfestivals may have their regular and natural order and keep thecity alive and awake the gods receiving the honours due to men having a better understanding about them all these my friend have not yet been sufficiently declared to you by thelegislator attend then to what i am now going to weretelling you in the first place that you were not sufficientlyinformed about letters and the objection was to this were never told whether he who was meant to be a respectablecitizen should apply himself in detail to that sort of learning ornot apply himself at all and the same remark holds good of thestudy of the lyre but now we say that he ought to attend to them afair time for a boy of ten years old to spend in letters is threeyears the age of thirteen is the proper time for him to begin tohandle the lyre and he may continue at this for another threeyears neither more nor less and whether his father or himself likeor dislike the study he is not to be allowed to spend more or lesstime in learning music than the law allows and let him who disobeysthe law be deprived of those youthful honours of which we shallhereafter speak hear however first of all what the young oughtto learn in the early years of life and what their instructorsought to teach them they ought to be occupied with their lettersuntil they are to read and write but the acquisition of perfectbeauty or quickness in writinig if nature has not stimulated themto acquire these accomplishments in the given number of years theyshould let alone and as to the learning of compositions committedto writing which are not set to the lyre whether metrical orwithout rhythmical divisions compositions in prose as they aretermed having no rhythm or how dangerous are thewritings handed down to us by many writers of this will youdo with them o most excellent guardians of the law or how can thelawgiver rightly direct you about them i believe that he will be ingreat difficulty 
 cle what troubles you stranger and why are you so perplexed inyour mind 
 ath you naturally ask cleinias and to you and megillus who aremy partners in the work of legislation i must state the moredifficult as well as the easier parts of the task 
 cle to what do you refer in this instance 
 ath i will tell you there is a difficulty in opposing many myriadsof mouths 
 cle well and have we not already opposed the popular voice in manyimportant enactments 
 ath that is quite true and you mean to imply that the roadwhich we are taking may be disagreeable to some but is agreeable to asmany others or if not to as many at any rate to persons not inferiorto the others and in company with them you bid me at whateverrisk to proceed along the path of legislation which has opened out ofour present discourse and to be of good cheer and not to faint 
 cle certainly 
 ath and i do not faint i say indeed that we have a great manypoets writing in hexameter trimeter and all sorts of are serious others who aim only at raising a allmankind declare that the youth who are rightly educated should bebrought up in them and saturated with them some insist that theyshould be constantly hearing them read aloud and always learningthem so as to get by heart entire poets while others select choicepassages and long speeches and make compendiums of them sayingthat these ought to be committed to memory if a man is to be madegood and wise by experience and learning of many things and youwant me now to tell them plainly in what they are right and in whatthey are wrong 
 cle yes i do ath but how can i in one word rightly comprehend all of them i amof opinion and if i am not mistaken there is a general every one of these poets has said many things well and manythings the reverse of well and if this be true then i do affirm thatmuch learning is dangerous to youth 
 cle how would you advise the guardian of the law to act 
 ath in what respect 
 cle i mean to what pattern should he look as his guide inpermitting the young to learn some things and forbidding them to learnothers do not shrink from answering 
 ath my good cleinias i rather think that i am fortunate 
 cle how so 
 ath i think that i am not wholly in want of a pattern for when iconsider the words which we have spoken from early dawn until now andwhich as i believe have been inspired by heaven they appear to meto be quite like a poem when i reflected upon all these words ofours i naturally felt pleasure for of all the discourses which ihave ever learnt or heard either in poetry or prose this seemed tome to be the justest and most suitable for young men to hear icannot imagine any better pattern than this which the guardian ofthe law who is also the director of education can have he cannot dobetter than advise the teachers to teach the young these words and anywhich are of a like nature if he should happen to find them eitherin poetry or prose or if he come across unwritten discourses akinto ours he should certainly preserve them and commit them towriting and first of all he shall constrain the teachers themselvesto learn and approve them and any of them who will not shall notbe employed by him but those whom he finds agreeing in hisjudgment he shall make use of and shall commit to them theinstruction and education of youth and here and on this wise let myfanciful tale about letters and teachers of letters come to an end 
 cle i do not think stranger that we have wandered out of theproposed limits of the argument but whether we are right or not inour whole conception i cannot be very certain 
 ath the truth cleinias may be expected to become clearer when aswe have often said we arrive at the end of the whole discussion aboutlaws 
 cle yes 
 ath and now that we have done with the teacher of letters theteacher of the lyre has to receive orders from us 
 cle certainly 
 ath i think that we have only to recollect our previousdiscussions and we shall be able to give suitable regulationstouching all this part of instruction and education to the teachers ofthe lyre 
 cle to what do you refer 
 ath we were saying if i remember rightly that choristers of dionysus were to be specially quick intheir perceptions of rhythm and musical composition that they mightbe able to distinguish good and bad imitation that is to say theimitation of the good or bad soul when under the influence of the one and displaying the other in hymns and the souls of youth and inviting them to follow and attainvirtue by the way of imitation 
 cle very true 
 ath and with this view the teacher and the learner ought to usethe sounds of the lyre because its notes are pure the player whoteaches and his pupil rendering note for note in unison butcomplexity and variation of notes when the strings give one soundand the poet or composer of the melody gives when theymake concords and harmonies in which lesser and greater and quick or high and low notes are again whenthey make complex variations of rhythms which they adapt to the notesof the that sort of thing is not suited to those who haveto acquire a speedy and useful knowledge of music in three opposite principles are confusing and create a difficulty inlearning and our young men should learn quickly and their merenecessary acquirements are not few or trifling as will be shown indue course let the director of education attend to the principlesconcerning music which we are laying down as to the songs and wordsthemselves which the masters of choruses are to teach and thecharacter of them they have been already described by us and are thesame which when consecrated and adapted to the different said were to benefit cities by affording them an innocentamusement 
 cle that again is true 
 ath then let him who has been elected a director of music receivethese rules from us as containing the very truth and may he prosperin his office let us now proceed to lay down other rules inaddition to the preceding about dancing and gymnastic exercise ingeneral having said what remained to be said about the teaching ofmusic let us speak in like manner about gymnastic for boys and girlsought to learn to dance and practise gymnastic theynot 
 cle yes 
 ath then the boys ought to have dancing masters and the girlsdancing mistresses to exercise them 
 cle very good 
 ath then once more let us summon him who has the chief concern inthe business the superintendent of youth the director ofeducation he will have plenty to do if he is to have the chargeof music and gymnastic 
 cle but how will old man be able to attend to such great charges 
 ath o my friend there will be no difficulty for the law hasalready given and will give him permission to select as his assistantsin this charge any citizens male or female whom he desires and hewill know whom he ought to choose and will be anxious not to make amistake from a due sense of responsibility and from aconsciousness of the importance of his office and also because hewill consider that if young men have been and are well brought all things go swimmingly but if not it is not meet to do we say what will follow lest the regarders of omens shouldtake alarm about our infant state many things have been said by usabout dancing and about gymnastic movements in general for we includeunder gymnastics all military exercises such as archery and allhurling of weapons and the use of the light shield and allfighting with heavy arms and military evolutions and movements ofarmies and encampings and all that relates to horsemanship of allthese things there ought to be public teachers receiving pay from thestate and their pupils should be the men and boys in the state andalso the girls and women who are to know all these things while theyare yet girls they should have practised dancing in arms and the wholeart of women they should apply themselves toevolutions and tactics and the mode of grounding and taking uparms if for no other reason yet in case the whole military forceshould have to leave the city and carry on operations of waroutside that those who will have to guard the young and the rest ofthe city may be equal to the task and on the other hand whenenemies whether barbarian or hellenic come from without withmighty force and make a violent assault upon them and thus compelthem to fight for the possession of the city which is far frombeing an impossibility great would be the disgrace to the state ifthe women had been so miserably trained that they could not fightfor their young as birds will against any creature however die or undergo any danger but must instantly rush to thetemples and crowd at the altars and shrines and bring upon humannature the reproach that of all animals man is the most cowardly 
 cle such a want of education stranger is certainly an unseemlything to happen in a state as well as a great misfortune 
 ath suppose that we carry our law to the extent of saying thatwomen ought not to neglect military matters but that all and female alike shall attend to them 
 cle i quite agree 
 ath of wrestling we have spoken in part but of what i shouldcall the most important part we have not spoken and cannot easilyspeak without showing at the same time by gesture as well as in wordwhat we mean when word and action combine and not till then weshall explain clearly what has been said pointing out that of allmovements wrestling is most akin to the military art and is to bepursued for the sake of this and not this for the sake of wrestling 
 cle excellent 
 ath enough of wrestling we will now proceed to speak of othermovements of the body such motion may be in general called is of two kinds one of nobler figures imitating thehonourable the other of the more ignoble figures imitating the of both these there are two further subdivisions of theserious one kind is of those engaged in war and vehement is the exercise of a noble person and a manly heart the otherexhibits a temperate soul in the enjoyment of prosperity and modestpleasures and may be truly called and is the dance of peace thewarrior dance is different from the peaceful one and may be rightlytermed pyrrhic this imitates the modes of avoiding blows and missilesby dropping or giving way or springing aside or rising up or fallingdown also the opposite postures which are those of action as forexample the imitation of archery and the hurling of javelins andof all sorts of blows and when the imitation is of brave bodies andsouls and the action is direct and muscular giving for the most parta straight movement to the limbs of the i say is thetrue sort but the opposite is not right in the dance of peace whatwe have to consider is whether a man bears himself naturally andgracefully and after the manner of men who duly conform to the before proceeding i must distinguish the dancing about which thereis any doubt from that about which there is no doubt which is thedoubtful kind and how are the two to be distinguished there aredances of the bacchic sort both those in which as they say theyimitate drunken men and which are named after the nymphs and silenuses and satyrs and also those in which purifications aremade or mysteries this sort of dancing cannot berightly defined as having either a peaceful or a warlike character orindeed as having any meaning whatever and may i think be mosttruly described as distinct from the warlike dance and distinctfrom the peaceful and not suited for a city at all there let it so leaving it to lie we will proceed to the dances of war andpeace for with these we are undoubtedly concerned now theunwarlike muse which honours in dance the gods and the sons of thegods is entirely associated with the consciousness of class may be subdivided into two lesser classes of which oneis expressive of an escape from some labour or danger into good andhas greater pleasures the other expressive of preservation andincrease of former good in which the pleasure is less these cases every man when the pleasure is greater moves hisbody more and less when the pleasure is less and again if he bemore orderly and has learned courage from discipline he waves if he be a coward and has no training or he makesgreater and more violent movements and in general when he is speakingor singing he is not altogether able to keep his body still and soout of the imitation of words in gestures the whole art of dancing hasarisen and in these various kinds of imitation one man moves in anorderly another in a disorderly manner and as the ancients may beobserved to have given many names which are according to nature anddeserving of praise so there is an excellent one which they havegiven to the dances of men who in their times of prosperity aremoderate in their giver of names whoever he to them a very true and poetical and rational name when hecalled them emmeleiai or dances of order thus establishing two kindsof dances of the nobler sort the dance of war which he called thepyrrhic and the dance of peace which he called emmeleia or the danceof order giving to each their appropriate and becoming name thesethings the legislator should indicate in general outline and theguardian of the law should enquire into them and search them dancing with music and assigning to the several sacrificialfeasts that which is suitable to them and when he has consecrated allof them in due order he shall for the future change of dance or song thenceforward the city and the citizensshall continue to have the same pleasures themselves being as faras possible alike and shall live well and happily 
 i have described the dances which are appropriate to noble bodiesand generous souls but it is necessary also to consider and knowuncomely persons and thoughts and those which are intended to producelaughter in comedy and have a comic character in respect of and dance and of the imitations which these afford for seriousthings cannot be understood without laughable things nor opposites atall without opposites if a man is really to have intelligence ofeither but he can not carry out both in action if he is to haveany degree of virtue and for this very reason he should learn themboth in order that he may not in ignorance do or say anything whichis ridiculous and out of should command slaves and hiredstrangers to imitate such things but he should never take any seriousinterest in them himself nor should any freeman or freewoman bediscovered taking pains to learn them and there should always be someelement of novelty in the imitation let these then be laid down bothin law and in our discourse as the regulations of laughableamusements which are generally called comedy and if any of theserious poets as they are termed who write tragedy come to us strangers may we go to your city and country or may we shall we bring with us our is your will about shall we answer the divine men i think that ouranswer should be as of strangers we will say to also according to our ability are tragic poets and our tragedyis the best and noblest for our whole state is an imitation of thebest and noblest life which we affirm to be indeed the very truthof tragedy you are poets and we are poets both makers of the samestrains rivals and antagonists in the noblest of dramas which truelaw can alone perfect as our hope is do not then suppose that weshall all in a moment allow you to erect your stage in the agora orintroduce the fair voices of your actors speaking above our permit you to harangue our women and children and the commonpeople about our institutions in language other than our own andvery often the opposite of our own for a state would be mad whichgave you this licence until the magistrates had determined whetheryour poetry might be recited and was fit for publication or o ye sons and scions of the softer muses first of all showyour songs to the magistrates and let them compare them with our if they are the same or better we will give you a chorus but ifnot then my friends we cannot let these then be the customsordained by law about all dances and the teaching of them and letmatters relating to slaves be separated from those relating tomasters if you do not object 
 cle we can have no hesitation in assenting when you put thematter thus 
 ath there still remain three studies suitable for is one of them the measurement of length surface anddepth is the second and the third has to do with the revolutions ofthe stars in relation to one another not every one has need to toilthrough all these things in a strictly scientific manner but only afew and who they are to be we will hereafter indicate at the will be the proper place not to know what is necessary formankind in general and what is the truth is disgraceful to everyone and yet to enter into these matters minutely is neither easy norat all possible for every one but there is something in them which isnecessary and cannot be set aside and probably he who made theproverb about god originally had this in view when he said even god himself can fight against meant if iam not mistaken divine necessity for as to the human necessitiesof which the many speak when they talk in this manner nothing can bemore ridiculous than such an application of the words 
 cle and what necessities of knowledge are there stranger whichare divine and not human 
 ath i conceive them to be those of which he who has no use norany knowledge at all cannot be a god or or hero to able to take any serious thought or charge of them and very unlikea divine man would he be who is unable to count one two three orto distinguish odd and even numbers or is unable to count at reckon night and day and who is totally unacquainted with therevolution of the sun and moon and the other stars there would begreat folly in supposing that all these are not necessary parts ofknowledge to him who intends to know anything about the highestkinds of knowledge but which these are and how many there are ofthem and when they are to be learned and what is to be learnedtogether and what apart and the whole correlation of them must berightly apprehended first and these leading the way we may proceed tothe other parts of knowledge for so necessity grounded in natureconstrains us against which we say that no god contends or ever willcontend 
 cle i think stranger that what you have now said is very true andagreeable to nature 
 ath yes cleinias that is so but it is difficult for thelegislator to begin with these studies at a more convenient time wewill make regulations for them 
 cle you seem stranger to be afraid of our habitual ignorance ofthe subject there is no reason why that should prevent you fromspeaking out 
 ath i certainly am afraid of the difficulties to which youallude but i am still more afraid of those who apply themselves tothis sort of knowledge and apply themselves badly for entireignorance is not so terrible or extreme an evil and is far from beingthe greatest of all too much cleverness and too much with an ill bringing up are far more fatal 
 cle true 
 ath all freemen i conceive should learn as much of these branchesof knowledge as every child in egypt is taught when he learns thealphabet in that country arithmetical games have been invented forthe use of mere children which they learn as a pleasure andamusement they have to distribute apples and garlands using the samenumber sometimes for a larger and sometimes for a lesser number ofpersons and they arrange pugilists and wrestlers as they pairtogether by lot or remain over and show how their turns come innatural order another mode of amusing them is to distributevessels sometimes of gold brass silver and the like intermixedwith one another sometimes of one metal only as i was saying theyadapt to their amusement the numbers in common use and in this waymake more intelligible to their pupils the arrangements andmovements of armies and expeditions in the management of ahousehold they make people more useful to themselves and more wideawake and again in measurements of things which have length andbreadth and depth they free us from that natural ignorance of allthese things which is so ludicrous and disgraceful 
 cle what kind of ignorance do you mean 
 ath o my dear cleinias i like yourself have late in life heardwith amazement of our ignorance in these matters to me we appear tobe more like pigs than men and i am quite ashamed not only ofmyself but of all hellenes 
 cle about what say stranger what you mean 
 ath i will or rather i will show you my meaning by a question anddo you please to answer me you know i suppose what length is 
 cle certainly 
 ath and what breadth is 
 cle to be sure 
 ath and you know that these are two distinct things and that thereis a third thing called depth 
 cle of course 
 ath and do not all these seem to you to be commensurable withthemselves 
 cle yes 
 ath that is to say length is naturally commensurable withlength and breadth with breadth and depth in like manner with depth 
 cle undoubtedly 
 ath but if some things are commensurable and others whollyincommensurable and you think that all things are commensurable whatis your position in regard to them 
 cle clearly far from good 
 ath concerning length and breadth when compared with depth orbreadth when and length when compared with one another are not allthe hellenes agreed that these are commensurable with one in some way 
 cle quite true 
 ath but if they are absolutely incommensurable and yet all of usregard them as commensurable have we not reason to be ashamed ofour compatriots and might we not say to ye best ofhellenes is not this one of the things of which we were saying thatnot to know them is disgraceful and of which to have a bare knowledgeonly is no great distinction 
 cle certainly 
 ath and there are other things akin to these in which there springup other errors of the same family 
 cle what are they 
 ath the natures of commensurable and incommensurable quantitiesin their relation to one another a man who is good for a thingought to be able when he thinks to distinguish them and differentpersons should compete with one another in asking questions whichwill be a fair better and more graceful way of passing their timethan the old game of draughts 
 cle i dare say and these pastimes are not so very unlike a game ofdraughts 
 ath and these as i maintain cleinias are the studies which ouryouth ought to learn for they are innocent and not difficult thelearning of them will be an amusement and they will benefit thestate if anyone is of another mind let him say what he has to say 
 cle certainly 
 ath then if these studies are such as we maintain we will includethem if not they shall be excluded 
 cle assuredly but may we not now stranger prescribe thesestudies as necessary and so fill up the lacunae of our laws 
 ath they shall be regarded as pledges which may be hereafterredeemed and removed from our state if they do not please either uswho give them or you who accept them 
 cle a fair condition 
 ath next let us see whether we are or are not willing that thestudy of astronomy shall be proposed for our youth 
 cle proceed 
 ath here occurs a strange phenomenon which certainly cannot in anypoint of view be tolerated 
 cle to what are you referring 
 ath men say that we ought not to enquire into the supreme god andthe nature of the universe nor busy ourselves in searching out thecauses of things and that such enquiries are impious whereas thevery opposite is the truth 
 cle what do you mean 
 ath perhaps what i am saying may seem paradoxical and atvariance with the usual language of age but when any one has any goodand true notion which is for the advantage of the state and in everyway acceptable to god he cannot abstain from expressing it 
 cle your words are reasonable enough but shall we find any good ortrue notion about the stars 
 ath my good friends at this hour all of us hellenes tell i may use such an expression about those great gods the sun andthe moon 
 cle lies of what nature 
 ath we say that they and divers other stars do not keep the samepath and we call them planets or wanderers 
 cle very true stranger and in the course of my life i haveoften myself seen the morning star and the evening star and diversothers not moving in their accustomed course but wandering out oftheir path in all manner of ways and i have seen the sun and moondoing what we all know that they do 
 ath just so megillus and cleinias and i maintain that ourcitizens and our youth ought to learn about the nature of the godsin heaven so far as to be able to offer sacrifices and pray to themin pious language and not to blaspheme about them 
 cle there you are right if such a knowledge be only attainable andif we are wrong in our mode of speaking now and can be betterinstructed and learn to use better language then i quite agree withyou that such a degree of knowledge as will enable us to speak rightlyshould be acquired by us and now do you try to explain to us yourwhole meaning and we on our part will endeavour to understand you 
 ath there is some difficulty in understanding my meaning but not avery great one nor will any great length of time be required andof this i am myself a proof for i did not know these things long in the days of my youth and yet i can explain them to you in abrief space of time whereas if they had been difficult i couldcertainly never have explained them all old as i am to old menlike yourselves 
 cle true but what is this study which you describe as wonderfuland fitting for youth to learn but of which we are ignorant tryand explain the nature of it to us as clearly as you can 
 ath i will for o my good friends that other doctrine about thewandering of the sun and the moon and the other stars is not thetruth but the very reverse of the truth each of them moves in thesame in many paths but in one only which is circular andthe varieties are only apparent nor are we right in supposing thatthe swiftest of them is the slowest nor conversely that theslowest is the quickest and if what i say is true only justimagine that we had a similar notion about horses running atolympia or about men who ran in the long course and that weaddressed the swiftest as the slowest and the slowest as the sang the praises of the vanquished as though he were that case our praises would not be true nor very agreeableto the runners though they be but men and now to commit the sameerror about the gods which would have been ludicrous and erroneousin the case of not that ludicrous and erroneous 
 cle worse than ludicrous i should say 
 ath at all events the gods cannot like us to be spreading afalse report of them 
 cle most true if such is the fact 
 ath and if we can show that such is really the fact then all thesematters ought to be learned so far as is necessary for the avoidanceof impiety but if we cannot they may be let alone and let this beour decision 
 cle very good 
 ath enough of laws relating to education and learning buthunting and similar pursuits in like manner claim our attention forthe legislator appears to have a duty imposed upon him which goesbeyond mere legislation there is something over and above law whichlies in a region between admonition and law and has several timesoccurred to us in the course of discussion for example in theeducation of very young children there were things as we are not to be defined and to regard them as matters of positivelaw is a great absurdity now our laws and the whole constitutionof our state having been thus delineated the praise of the virtuouscitizen is not complete when he is described as the person whoserves the laws best and obeys them most but the higher form ofpraise is that which describes him as the good citizen who passesthrough life undefiled and is obedient to the words of the when he is giving laws and when he assigns praise and blame thisis the truest word that can be spoken in praise of a citizen andthe true legislator ought not only to write his laws but also tointerweave with them all such things as seem to him honourable anddishonourable and the perfect citizen ought to seek to strengthenthese no less than the principles of law which are sanctioned bypunishments i will adduce an example which will clear up mymeaning and will be a sort of witness to my words hunting is of wideextent and has a name under which many things are included for thereis a hunting of creatures in the water and of creatures in the there is a great deal of hunting of land animals of all kinds andnot of wild beasts only the hunting after man is also worthy ofconsideration there is the hunting after him in war and there isoften a hunting after him in the way of friendship which is praisedand also blamed and there is thieving and the hunting which ispractised by robbers and that of armies against armies now thelegislator in laying down laws about hunting can neither abstainfrom noting these things nor can he make threatening ordinances whichwill assign rules and penalties about all of them what is he to will have to praise and blame hunting with a view to the exerciseand pursuits of youth and on the other hand the young man mustlisten obediently neither pleasure nor pain should hinder him and heshould regard as his standard of action the praises and injunctions ofthe legislator rather than the punishments which he imposes by being premised there will follow next in order moderate praiseand censure of hunting the praise being assigned to that kind whichwill make the souls of young men better and the censure to that whichhas the opposite effect 
 and now let us address young men in the form of a prayer for theirwelfare o friends we will say to them may no desire or love ofhunting in the sea or of angling or of catching the creatures inthe waters ever take possession of you either when you are awakeor when you are asleep by hook or with weels which latter is avery lazy contrivance and let not any desire of catching men and ofpiracy by sea enter into your souls and make you cruel and lawlesshunters and as to the desire of thieving in town or country may itnever enter into your most passing thoughts nor let the insidiousfancy of catching birds which is hardly worthy of freemen comeinto the head of any youth there remains therefore for our athletesonly the hunting and catching of land animals of which the one sortis called hunting by night in which the hunters sleep in turn and arelazy this is not to be commended any more than that which hasintervals of rest in which the will strength of beasts is subduedby nets and snares and not by the victory of a laborious only the best kind of hunting is allowed at ofquadrupeds which is carried on with horses and dogs and ownpersons and they get the victory over the animals by running themdown and striking them and hurling at them those who have a care ofgodlike manhood taking them with their own hands the praise and blamewhich is assigned to all these things has now been declared and letthe law be as no one hinder these who verily are sacredhunters from following the chase wherever and whither soever theywill but the hunter by night who trusts to his nets and not be allowed to hunt anywhere the fowler in the mountains andwaste places shall be permitted but on cultivated ground and onconsecrated wilds he shall not be permitted and any one who meets himmay stop him as to the hunter in waters he may hunt anywhereexcept in harbours or sacred streams or marshes or pools providedonly that he do not pollute the water with poisonous juices and nowwe may say that all our enactments about education are complete

 book viii 
 
 athenian stranger next with the help of the delphian oracle wehave to institute festivals and make laws about them and to determinewhat sacrifices will be for the good of the city and to what godsthey shall be offered but when they shall be offered and howoften may be partly regulated by us 
 cleinias the 
 ath then we will first determine the number and let the wholenumber be one for every that one magistrate at least willsacrifice daily to some god or on behalf of the city and thecitizens and their possessions and the interpreters and priestesses and prophets shall meet and in company with theguardians of the law ordain those things which the legislator ofnecessity omits and i may remark that they are the very persons whoought to take note of what is omitted the law will say that there aretwelve feasts dedicated to the twelve gods after whom the severaltribes are named and that to each of them they shall sacrificeevery month and appoint choruses and musical and gymnastic them so as to suit the gods and seasons of the year andthey shall have festivals for women distinguishing those whichought to be separated from the festivals and those whichought not further they shall not confuse the infernal deities andtheir rites with the gods who are termed heavenly and their rites butshall separate them giving to pluto his own in the twelfth is sacred to him according to the law to such a deitywarlike men should entertain no aversion but they should honour himas being always the best friend of man for the connection of soul andbody is no way better than the dissolution of them as i am ready tomaintain quite seriously moreover those who would regulate thesematters rightly should consider that our city among existing citieshas fellow either in respect of leisure or comin and of thenecessaries of life and that like an individual she ought to livehappily and those who would live happily should in the first place dono wrong to one another and ought not themselves to be wronged byothers to attain the first is not difficult but there is greatdifficulty in acquiring the power of not being wronged no man can beperfectly secure against wrong unless he has become perfectly cities are like individuals in this for a city if good has a lifeof peace but if evil a life of war within and without wherefore thecitizens ought to practise in time of war but rather whilethey are at peace and every city which has any sense should take thefield at least for one day in every month and for more if themagistrates think fit having no regard to winter cold or summer they should go out en masse including their wives and theirchildren when the magistrates determine to lead forth the wholepeople or in separate portions when summoned by them and they shouldalways provide that there should be games and sacrificial they should have tournaments imitating in as lively a manner asthey can real battles and they should distribute prizes of victoryand valour to the competitors passing censures and encomiums on oneanother according to the characters which they bear in the contestsand their whole life honouring him who seems to be the best andblaming him who is the opposite and let poets celebrate however every poet but only one who in the first place isnot less than fifty years of age nor should he be one who althoughhe may have musical and poetical gifts has never in his life done anynoble or illustrious action but those who are themselves good andalso honourable in the state creators of noble theirpoems be sung even though they be not very musical and let thejudgment of them rest with the instructor of youth and the otherguardians of the laws who shall give them this privilege and theyalone shall be free to sing but the rest of the world shall nothave this liberty nor shall any one dare to sing a song which has notbeen approved by the judgment of the guardians of the laws not evenif his strain be sweeter than the songs of thamyras and orpheus butonly and orpheus but only such poems as have been judged sacred anddedicated to the gods and such as are the works of good men whichpraise of blame has been awarded and which have been deemed tofulfil their design fairly 
 the regulations about and about liberty of speech in poitry oughtto apply equally to men and women the legislator may be supposed toargue the question in his own are my citizens for whom ihave set in order the city are they not competitors in the greatestof all contests and have they not innumerable rivals to be be the natural reply well but if we were training boxers orpancratiasts or any other sort of athletes would they never meetuntil the hour of contest arrived and should we do nothing to prepareourselves previously by daily practice surely if we were boxers weshould have been learning to fight for many days before andexercising ourselves in imitating all those blows and wards which wewere intending to use in the hour of conflict and in order that wemight come as near to reality as possible instead of cestuses weshould put on boxing gloves that the blows and the wards might bepractised by us to the utmost of our power and if there were a lackof competitors the ridicule of fools would ryot deter us from hangingup a lifeless image and practising at that or if we had noadversary at all animate or inanimate should we not venture in thedearth of antagonists to spar by ourselves in what other manner couldwe ever study the art of 
 cle the way which you mention stranger would be the only way 
 ath and shall the warriors of our city who are destined whenoccasion calli to enter the greatest of all contests and to fight fortheir lives and their children and their property and the wholecity be worse prepared than boxers and will the he is afraid that their practising with one another may appearto some ridiculous abstain from commanding them to go out andfight will he not ordain that soldiers shall perform lesser exerciseswithout arms every day making dancing and all gymnastic tend tothis end and also will he not require that they shall practise somegymnastic exercises greater as well as lesser as often as everymonth and that they shall have contests one with another in everypart of the country seizing upon posts and lying in ambush andimitating in every respect the reality of war fighting and hurling javelins and using weapons somewhatdangerous and as nearly as possible like the true ones in order thatthe sport may not be altogether without fear but may have terrors andto a certain degree show the man who has and who has not that the honour and dishonour which are assigned to themrespectively may prepare the whole city for the true conflict oflife if any one dies in these mimic contests the homicide isinvoluntary and we will make the slayer when he has been purifiedaccording to law to be pure of blood considering that if a few menshould die others as good as they will be born but that if fear isdead then the citizens will never find a test of superior and inferiornatures which is a far greater evil to the state than the loss of afew 
 cle we are quite agreed stranger that we should legislate aboutsuch things and that the whole state should practise them supposed 
 ath and what is the reason that dances and contests of this sorthardly ever exist in states at least not to any extent worth speakingof is this due to the ignorance of mankind and their legislators 
 cle perhaps 
 ath certainly not sweet cleinias there are two causes whichare quite enough to account for the deficiency 
 cle what are they 
 ath one cause is the love of wealth which wholly absorbs never for a moment allows them to think of anything but theirown private possessions on this the soul of every citizen hangssuspended and can attend to nothing but his daily gain mankind areready to learn any branch of knowledge and to follow any pursuitwhich tends to this end and they laugh at every is onereason why a city will not be in earnest about such contests or anyother good and honourable pursuit but from an insatiable love of goldand silver every man will stoop to any art or contrivance seemlyor unseemly in the hope of becoming rich and will make noobjection to performing any action holy or unholy and utterlybase if only like a beast he have the power of eating and drinkingall kinds of things and procuring for himself in every sort of waythe gratification of his lusts 
 cle true 
 ath let this then be deemed one of the causes which preventstates from pursuing in an efficient manner the art of war or anyother noble aim but makes the orderly and temperate part of mankindinto merchants and captains of ships and servants and convertsthe valiant sort into thieves and burglars and robbers of temples andviolent tyrannical persons many of whom are not without ability butthey are unfortunate 
 cle what do you mean 
 ath must not they be truly unfortunate whose souls are compelled topass through life always hungering 
 cle then that is one cause stranger but you spoke of another 
 ath thank you for reminding me 
 cle the insatiable life long love of wealth as you were sayingis one clause which absorbs mankind and prevents them from rightlypractising the arts of and now tell me what is theother 
 ath do you imagine that i delay because i am in a perplexity 
 cle no but we think that you are too severe upon temper of which you seem in the present discussion tohave a peculiar dislike 
 ath that is a very fair rebuke cleinias and i will now proceedto the second cause 
 cle proceed 
 ath i say that governments are a concerning which i have often spoken in the previousdiscourse or rather governments they are not for none of themexercises a voluntary rule over voluntary subjects but they may betruly called states of discord in which while the government isvoluntary the subjects always obey against their will and have to becoerced and the ruler fears the subject and will not if he canhelp allow him to become either noble or rich or strong orvaliant or warlike at all these two are the chief causes of almostall evils and of the evils of which i have been speaking they arenotably the causes but our state has escaped both of them for hercitizens have the greatest leisure and they are not subject to oneanother and will i think be made by these laws the reverse oflovers of money such a constitution may be reasonably supposed tobe the only one existing which will accept the education which we havedescribed and the martial pastimes which have been perfectedaccording to our idea 
 cle true 
 ath then next we must remember about all gymnastic only the warlike sort of them are to be practised and to haveprizes of victory and those which are not military are to be givenup the military sort had better be completely described andestablished by law and first let us speak of running and swiftness 
 cle very good 
 ath certainly the most military of all qualities is generalactivity of body whether of foot or hand for escaping or forcapturing an enemy quickness of foot is required but and combat need vigour and strength 
 cle very true 
 ath neither of them can attain their greatest efficiency withoutarms 
 cle how can they 
 ath then our herald in accordance with the prevailing first summon the will appear armed for to anunarmed competitor we will not give a prize and he shall enterfirst who is to run the single course bearing arms next he who is torun the double course third he who is to run the andfourthly he who is to run the long course the fifth whom we be the first sent forth in heavy armour and shall run acourse of sixty stadia to some temple of we will send forthanother whom we will style the more heavily armed to run oversmoother ground there remains the archer and he shall run in thefull equipments of an archer a distance of stadia overmountains and across every sort of country to a temple of apollo andartemis this shall be the order of the contest and we will waitfor them until they return and will give a prize to the conquerorin each 
 cle very good 
 ath let us suppose that there are three kinds of ofboys another of beardless youths and a third of men for theyouths we will fix the length of the contest at and forthe boys at half of the entire course whether they contend as archersor as heavy armed touching the women let the girls who are not grownup compete naked in the stadium and the double course and and the long course and let them run on itself those who are thirteen years of age and upwardsuntil their marriage shall continue to share in contests if they arenot more than twenty and shall be compelled to run up to they shall descend into the arena in suitable dresses let thesebe the regulations about contests in running both for men and women 
 respecting contests of strength instead of wrestling and similarcontests of the heavier sort we will institute conflicts in armour ofone against one and two against two and so on up to ten against to what a man ought not to suffer or do and to what extent inorder to gain the in wrestling the masters of the art havelaid down what is fair and what is not fair so in fighting ought to call in skilful persons who shall judge for us andbe our assessors in the work of legislation they shall say whodeserves to be victor in combats of this sort and what he is not todo or have done to him and in like manner what rule determines who isdefeated and let these ordinances apply to women until they marriedas well as to men the pancration shall have a counterpart in a combatof the light armed they shall contend with bows and with lightshields and with javelins and in the throwing of stones by slingsand by hand and laws shall be made about it and rewards and prizesgiven to him who best fulfils the ordinances of the law 
 next in order we shall have to legislate about the horse we do not need many horses for they cannot be of much use in acountry like crete and hence we naturally do not take great painsabout the rearing of them or about horse races there is no one whokeeps a chariot among us and any rivalry in such matters would bealtogether out of place there would be no sense nor any shadow ofsense in instituting contests which are not after the manner of ourcountry and therefore we give our prizes for single who have not yet cast their teeth and for those who areintermediate and for the horses themselves and thus ourequestrian games will accord with the nature of the country letthem have conflict and rivalry in these matters in accordance with thelaw and let the colonels and generals of horse decide togetherabout all courses and about the armed competitors in them but we havenothing to say to the unarmed either in gymnastic exercises or inthese contests on the other hand the cretan bowman or fights in armour on horseback is useful and therefore we may aswell place a competition of this sort among amusements women arenot to be forced to compete by laws and ordinances but if fromprevious training they have acquired the habit and are strong enoughand like to take part let them do so girls as well as boys and noblame to them 
 thus the competition in gymnastic and the mode of learning it havebeen described and we have spoken also of the toils of the of daily exercises under the superintendence of masters relates to music has been for the most part completed but asto rhapsodes and the like and the contests of choruses which are toperform at feasts all this shall be arranged when the months and daysand years have been appointed for gods and whether everythird year or again every fifth year or in whatever way or mannerthe gods may put into minds the distribution and order ofthem at the same time we may expect that the musical contests willbe celebrated in their turn by the command of the judges and thedirector of education and the guardians of the law meeting togetherfor this purpose and themselves becoming legislators of the times andnature and conditions of the choral contests and of dancing ingeneral what they ought severally to be in language and song andin the admixture of harmony with rhythm and the dance has beenoften declared by the original legislator and his successors ought tofollow him making the games and sacrifices duly to correspond atfitting times and appointing public festivals it is not difficult todetermine how these and the like matters may have a regular again will the alteration of them do any great good or harm tothe state there is however another matter of great importance anddifficulty concerning which god should legislate if there were anypossibility of obtaining from him an ordinance about it but seeingthat divine aid is not to be had there appears to be a need of somebold man who specially honours plainness of speech and will sayoutright what he thinks best for the city and is good and convenient for the whole state amid the corruptionsof human souls opposing the mightiest lusts and having no man hishelper but himself standing alone and following reason only 
 cle what is this stranger that you are saying for we do not asyet understand your meaning 
 ath very likely i will endeavour to explain myself more i came to the subject of education i beheld young men andmaidens holding friendly intercourse with one another and therenaturally arose in my mind a sort of could not helpthinking how one is to deal with a city in which youths and maidensare well nurtured and have nothing to do and are not undergoingthe excessive and servile toils which extinguish wantonness and whoseonly cares during their whole life are sacrifices and festivals anddances how in such a state as this will they abstain from desireswhich thrust many a man and woman into perdition and from whichreason assuming the functions of law commands them to abstain theordinances already made may possibly get the better of most of thesedesires the prohibition of excessive wealth is a very considerablegain in the direction of temperance and the whole education of ouryouth imposes a law of moderation on them moreover the eye of therulers is required always to watch over the young and never to losesight of them and these provisions do as far as human means caneffect anything exercise a regulating influence upon the desires ingeneral but how can we take precautions against the unnatural lovesof either sex from which innumerable evils have come upon individualsand cities how shall we devise a remedy and way of escape out of sogreat a danger truly cleinias here is a difficulty in many wayscrete and lacedaemon furnish a great help to those who make peculiarlaws but in the matter of love as we are alone i must confessthat they are quite against us for if any one following nature shouldlay down the law which existed before the days of laius anddenounce these lusts as contrary to nature adducing the animals asa proof that such unions were monstrous he might prove his point buthe would be wholly at variance with the custom of your they are repugnant to a principle which we say that alegislator should always observe for we are always enquiring which ofour enactments tends to virtue and which not and suppose we grantthat these loves are accounted by law to be honourable or at leastnot disgraceful in what degree will they contribute to virtue willsuch passions implant in the soul of him who is seduced the habit ofcourage or in the soul of the seducer the principle of will ever believe rather who will not blame theeffeminacy of him who yields to pleasures and is unable to hold outagainst them will not all men censure as womanly him who imitates thewoman and who would ever think of establishing such a practice bylaw certainly no one who had in his mind the image of true law howcan we prove that what i am saying is true he who would rightlyconsider these matters must see the nature of friendship and of these loves for they are of two kinds and out ofthe two arises a third kind having the same name and this similarityof name causes all the difficulty and obscurity 
 cle how is that 
 ath dear is the like in virtue to the like and the equal to theequal dear also though unlike is he who has abundance to him who isin want and when either of these friendships becomes excessive weterm the excess love 
 cle very true 
 ath the friendship which arises from contraries is horrible andcoarse and has often no tie of communion but that which arises fromlikeness is gentle and has a tie of communion which lasts throughlife as to the mixed sort which is made up of them both there of all a in determining what he who is possessed by thisthird love desires moreover he is drawn different ways and is indoubt between the two principles the one exhorting him to enjoy thebeauty of youth and the other forbidding him for the one is alover of the body and hungers after beauty like ripe fruit andwould fain satisfy himself without any regard to the character ofthe beloved the other holds the desire of the body to be asecondary matter and looking rather than loving and with his souldesiring the soul of the other in a becoming manner regards thesatisfaction of the bodily love as wantonness he reverences andrespects temperance and courage and magnanimity and wisdom and wishesto live chastely with the chaste object of his affection now the sortof love which is made up of the other two is that which we havedescribed as the third seeing then that there are these three sortsof love ought the law to prohibit and forbid them all to existamong us is it not rather clear that we should wish to have in thestate the love which is of virtue and which desires the belovedyouth to be the best possible and the other two if possible weshould hinder what do you say friend megillus 
 megillus i think stranger that you are perfectly right in whatyou have been now saying 
 ath i knew well my friend that i should obtain your assent whichi accept and therefore have no need to analyse your custom anyfurther cleinias shall be prevailed upon to give me his assent atsome other time enough of this and now let us proceed to the laws 
 meg very good 
 ath upon reflection i see a way of imposing the law which inone respect is easy but in another is of the utmost difficulty 
 meg what do you mean 
 ath we are all aware that most men in spite of their lawlessnatures are very strictly and precisely restrained from intercoursewith the fair and this is not at all against their will but entirelywith their will 
 meg when do you mean 
 ath when any one has a brother or sister who is fair and about ason or daughter the same unwritten law holds and is a most perfectsafeguard so that no open or secret connection ever takes placebetween them nor does the thought of such a thing ever enter at allinto the minds of most of them 
 meg very true 
 ath does not a little word extinguish all pleasures of that sort 
 meg what word 
 ath the declaration that they are unholy hated of god and mostinfamous and is not the reason of this that no one has ever saidthe opposite but every one from his earliest childhood has heardmen speaking in the same manner about them always and in comedy or in the graver language of tragedy when thepoet introduces on the stage a thyestes or an oedipus or a macareushaving secret intercourse with his sister he represents him whenfound out ready to kill himself as the penalty of his sin 
 meg you are very right in saying that tradition if no breath ofopposition ever assails it has a marvellous power 
 ath am i not also right in saying that the legislator who wantsto master any of the passions which master man may easily know howto subdue them he will consecrate the tradition of their evilcharacter among all slaves and freemen women and the will be the surest foundation of the lawwhich he can make 
 meg yes but will he ever succeed in making all mankind use thesame language about them 
 ath a good objection but was i not just now saying that i had away to make men use natural love and abstain from unnatural notintentionally destroying the seeds of human increase or sowing themin stony places in which they will take no root and that i wouldcommand them to abstain too from any female field of increase in whichthat which is sown is not likely to grow now if a law to thiseffect could only be made perpetual and gain an authority such asalready prevents intercourse of parents and a to other sensual desires and conquering them would bethe source of ten thousand blessings for in the first is the appointment of nature and deters men from allfrenzy and madness of love and from all adulteries and immoderate useof meats and drinks and makes them good friends to their own innumerable other benefits would result if such a could only beenforced i can imagine some lusty youth who is standing by andwho on hearing this enactment declares in scurrilous terms that weare making foolish and impossible laws and fills the world with hisoutcry and therefore i said that i knew a way of enacting andperpetuating such a law which was very easy in one respect but inanother most difficult there is no difficulty in seeing that such alaw is possible and in what way for as i was saying theordinance once consecrated would master the soul of every man andterrify him into obedience but matters have now come to such a passthat even then the desired result seems as if it could not beattained just as the continuance of an entire state in the practiceof common meals is also deemed impossible and although this latter ispartly disproven by the fact of their existence among you stilleven in your cities the common meals of women would be regarded asunnatural and impossible i was thinking of the rebelliousness ofthe human heart when i said that the permanent establishment ofthese things is very difficult 
 meg very true 
 ath shall i try and find some sort of persuasive argument whichwill prove to you that such enactments are possible and not beyondhuman nature 
 cle by all means 
 ath is a man more likely to abstain from the pleasures of loveand to do what he is bidden about them when his body is in a goodcondition or when he is in an ill condition and out of training 
 cle he will be far more temperate when he is in training 
 ath and have we not heard of iccus of tarentum who with a view tothe olympic and other contests in his zeal for his art ind alsobecause he was of a manly and temperate disposition never had anyconnection with a woman or a youth during the whole time of histraining and the same is said of crison and astylus and diopompus andmany others and yet cleinias they were far worse educated intheir minds than your and my citizens and in their bodies far morelusty 
 cle no doubt this fact has been often affirmed positively by theancients of these athletes 
 ath and had they courage to abstain from what is ordinarillydeemed a pleasure for the sake of a victory in wrestling running andthe like and shall our young men be incapable of a similarendurance for the sake of a much nobler victory which is thenoblest of all as from their youth upwards we will tell them as we hope into the belief of this by tales andsayings and songs 
 cle of what victory are you speaking 
 ath of the victory over pleasure which if they win they will livehappily or if they are conquered the reverse of happily may we not suppose that the fear of impiety will enablethem to master that which other inferior people have mastered 
 cle i dare say 
 ath and since we have reached this point in our legislation andhave fallen into a difficulty by reason of the vices of mankind iaffirm that our ordinance should simply run in the following citizens ought not to fall below the nature of birds and beasts ingeneral who are born in great multitudes and yet remain until theage for procreation virgin and unmarried but when they have reachedthe proper time of life are coupled male and female and lovinglypair together and live the rest of their lives in holiness andinnocence abiding firmly in their original we willsay to them you should be better than the animals but if they arecorrupted by the other hellenes and the common practice of they see with their eyes and hear with their ears of the love everywhere prevailing among them and they themselves arenot able to get the better of the temptation the guardians of thelaw exercising the functions of lawgivers shall devise a secondlaw against them 
 cle and what law would you advise them to pass if this one failed 
 ath clearly cleinias the one which would naturally follow 
 cle what is that 
 ath our citizens should not allow pleasures to strengthen withindulgence but should by toil divert the aliment and exuberance ofthem into other parts of the body and this will happen if noimmodesty be allowed in the practice of love then they will beashamed of frequent intercourse and they will find pleasure ifseldom enjoyed to be a less imperious mistress they should not befound out doing anything of the sort concealment shall be sanctioned by custom and made law by unwritten prescription onthe other hand to be detected shall be esteemed dishonourable butnot to abstain wholly in this way there will be a second legalstandard of honourable and dishonourable involving a second notion ofright three principles will comprehend all those corrupt natures whomwe call inferior to themselves and who form but one dass and willcompel them not to transgress 
 cle what are they 
 ath the principle of piety the love of honour and the desire ofbeauty not in the body but in the soul these are aspirations but they are the noblest of aspirations if theycould only be realized in all states and god willing in thematter of love we may be able to enforce one of two thatno one shall venture to touch any person of the freeborn or nobleclass except his wedded wife or sow the unconsecrated and bastardseed among harlots or in barren and unnatural lusts or at least wemay abolish altogether the connection of men with men and as towomen if any man has to do with any but those who come into his houseduly married by sacred rites whether they be bought or acquired inany other way and he offends publicly in the face of all shall be right in enacting that he be deprived of civic honours andprivileges and be deemed to be as he truly is a stranger letthis law then whether it is one or ought rather to be called laid down respecting love in general and the intercourse of thesexes which arises out of the desires whether rightly or wronglyindulged 
 meg i for my part stranger would gladly receive this shall speak for himself and tell you what is his opinion 
 cle i will megillus when an opportunity offers at present ithink that we had better allow the stranger to proceed with his laws 
 meg very good 
 ath we had got about as far as the establishment of the commontables which in most places would be difficult but in crete no onewould think of introducing any other custom there might arise aquestion about the manner of they shall be such as theyare here in crete or such as they are in is there athird kind which may be better than either of them the answer to thisquestion might be easily discovered but the discovery would do nogreat good for at present they are very well ordered 
 leaving the common tables we may therefore proceed to the meansof providing food now in cities the means of life are gained in manyways and from divers sources and in general from two sources whereasour city has only one for most of the hellenes obtain their food fromsea and land but our citizens from land only and this makes the taskof the legislator less as many laws will be enough andmuch less than half and they will be of a kind better suited tofree men for he has nothing to do with laws about shipowners andmerchants and retailers and innkeepers and tax collectors and minesand moneylending and compound interest and innumerable to these he gives laws to husbandmen andshepherds and and to the guardians and superintendents oftheir implements and he has already legislated for greater for example respecting marriage and the procreation and nurture ofchildren and for education and the establishment of he must direct his laws to those who provide food and labour inpreparing it 
 let us first of all then have a class of laws which shall becalled the laws of husbandmen and let the first of them be the law ofzeus the god of boundaries let no one shift the boundary line eitherof a who is a neighbour or if he dwells at theextremity of the land of any stranger who is conterminous with that this is truly to move the immovable and everyone should be more willing to move the largest rock which is not alandmark than the least stone which is the sworn mark of friendshipand hatred between neighbours for zeus the god of kindred is thewitness of the citizen and zeus the god of strangers of thestranger and when aroused terrible are the wars which they stirup he who obeys the law will never know the fatal consequences ofdisobedience but he who despises the law shall be liable to adouble penalty the first coming from the gods and the second fromthe law for let no one wilfully remove the boundaries of land and if any one does let him who will inform thelandowners and let them bring him into court and if he beconvicted of the land by stealth or by force let thecourt determine what he ought to suffer or pay in the next small injuries done by neighbours to one another through theirmultiplication may cause a weight of enmity and make neighbourhood avery disagreeable and bitter thing wherefore a man ought to be verycareful of committing any offence against his neighbour andespecially of encroaching on his land for any man mayeasily do harm but not every man can do good to another he whoencroaches on his land and transgresses his make good the damage and to cure him of his impudence and alsoof his meanness he shall pay a double penalty to the injured these and the like matters the wardens of the country shall takecognizance and be the judges of them and assessors of the the more important cases as has been already said the wholenumber of them belonging to any one of the twelve divisions shalldecide and in the lesser cases the commanders or again if anyone pastures his cattle on his land they shall see theinjury and adjudge the penalty and if any one by decoying the possession of swarms and draws them to himself bymaking noises he shall pay the damage or if anyone sets fire tohis own wood and takes no care of his property he shallbe fined at the discretion of the magistrates and if in planting hedoes not leave a fair distance between his own and his he shall be punished in accordance with the enactments ofmany law givers which we may use not deeming it necessary that thegreat legislator of our state should determine all the trifles whichmight be decided by any body for example husbandmen have had ofold excellent laws about waters and there is no reason why weshould propose to divert their course who likes may draw water fromthe of the common stream on to his own land if he donot cut off the spring which clearly belongs to some other he may take the water in any direction which he pleases exceptthrough a house or temple or sepulchre but he must be careful to dono harm beyond the channel and if there be in any place a naturaldryness of the earth which keeps in the rain from heaven andcauses a deficiency in the supply of water let him dig down on hisown land as far as the clay and if at this depth he finds no him obtain water from his neighbours as much as is requiredfor his servants drinking and if his neighbours too are limited intheir supply let him have a fixed measure which shall bedetermined by the wardens of the country this he shall receive eachday and on these terms have a share of his neighbours water ifthere be heavy rain and one of those on the lower ground injures sometiller of the upper ground or some one who has a common wall byrefusing to give the man outlet for water or again if some oneliving on the higher ground recklessly lets off the water on his lowerneighbour and they cannot come to terms with one another let him whowill call in a warden of the city if he be in the city or if he bein the country warden of the country and let him obtain a decisiondetermining what each of them is to do and he who will not abide bythe decision shall suffer for his malignant and morose temper and paya fine to the injured party equivalent to double the value of theinjury because he was unwilling to submit to the magistrates 
 now the participation of fruits shall be ordered on this wise thegoddess of autumn has two gracious gifts one the joy of dionysuswhich is not treasured up the other which nature intends to bestored let this be the law then concerning the fruits of autumn hewho tastes the common or storing fruits of autumn whether grapes orfigs before the season of vintage which coincides with on his own land or on that of him pay fiftydrachmae which shall be sacred to dionysus if he pluck them from hisown land and if from his land a mina and if from anyothers of a mina and he who would gather the or the choice figs as they are now termed if he take themoff his own land let him pluck them how and when he likes but ifhe take them from the ground of others without their leave let him inthat case be always punished in accordance with the law whichordains that he should not move what he has not laid down and if aslave touches any fruit of this sort without the consent of the ownerof the land he shall be beaten with as many blows as there are grapeson the bunch or figs on the let a metic purchase autumnal fruit and then if he pleases he may gather if a stranger is passing along the road and desires to eat lethim take of the choice grapes for himself and a single followerwithout payment as a tribute of hospitality the law howeverforbids strangers from sharing in the sort which is not used foreating and if any one whether he be master or slave takes of themin ignorance let the slave be beaten and the freeman dismissedwith admonitions and instructed to take of the other autumnalfruits which are unfit for making raisins and wine or for laying byas dried figs as to pears and apples and pomegranates andsimilar fruits there shall be no disgrace in taking them he who is caught if he be of less than thirty years of age shallbe struck and beaten off but not wounded and no freeman shall haveany right of satisfaction for such blows of these fruits the strangermay partake just as he may of the fruits of autumn and if anelder who is more than thirty years of age eat of them on thespot let him like the stranger be allowed to partake of all suchfruits but he must carry away nothing if however he will notobey the law let him run risk of failing in the competition ofvirtue in case any one takes notice of his actions before thejudges at the time 
 water is the greatest element of nutrition in gardens but is easilypolluted you cannot poison the soil or the soil or the sun orthe air which are other elements of nutrition in plants or divertthem or steal them but all these things may very likely happen inregard to water which must therefore be protected by law and letthis be the any one intentionally pollutes the water ofanother whether the water of a spring or collected in by poisonous substances or by digging or by theft let theinjured party bring the cause before the wardens of the city andclaim in writing the value of the loss if the accused be found guiltyof injuring the water by deleterious substances let him not onlypay damages but purify the stream or the cistern which contains thewater in such manner as the laws of the interpreters order thepurification to be made by the offender in each case 
 with respect to the gathering in of the fruits of the soil let aman if he pleases carry his own fruits through any place in which heeither does no harm to any one or himself gains three times as muchas his neighbour loses now of these things the magistrates shouldbe cognisant as of all other things in which a man intentionally doesinjury to another or to the property of another by fraud or force inthe use which he makes of his own property all these matters a manshould lay before the magistrates and receive damages supposingthe injury to be not more than three minae or if he have a chargeagainst another which involves a larger amount let him bring his suitinto the public courts and have the punished but if anyof the magistrates appear to adjudge the penalties which he imposes inan unjust spirit let him be liable to pay double to the injuredparty any one may bring the offences of magistrates in anyparticular case before the public courts there are innumerablelittle matters relating to the modes of punishment and applicationsfor suits and summonses and the witnesses to two witnesses should be required for a summons or all such details which cannot be omitted in legislation butare beneath the wisdom of an aged legislator these lesser matters asthey indeed are in comparison with the greater ones let a youngergeneration regulate by law after the patterns which have according to their own experience of the usefulness andnecessity of such laws and when they are duly regulated let therebe no alteration but let the citizens live in the observance of them 
 now of artisans let the regulations be as the firstplace let no citizen or servant of a citizen be occupied inhandicraft arts for he who is to secure and preserve the public orderof the state has an art which requires much study and many kinds ofknowledge and does not admit of being made a secondary hardly any human being is capable of pursuing two professions ortwo arts rightly or of practising one art himself and superintendingsome one else who is practising another let this then be ourfirst principle in the one who is a smith shall also be acarpenter and if he be a carpenter he shall not superintend art rather than his own under the pretext that insuperintending many servants who are working for him he is likelyto superintend them better because more revenue will accrue to himfrom them than from his own art but let every man in the state haveone art and get his living by that let the wardens of the citylabour to maintain this law and if any citizen incline to any otherart than the study of virtue let them punish him with disgrace andinfamy until they bring him back into his own right course and ifany stranger profess two arts let them chastise him with bonds andmoney penalties and expulsion from the state until they compel himto be one only and not many 
 but as touching payments for hire and contracts of work or in caseany one does wrong to any of the citizens or they do wrong to anyother up to fifty drachmae let the wardens of the city decide thecase but if greater amount be involved then let the public courtsdecide according to law let no one pay any duty either on theimportation or exportation of goods and as to frankincense andsimilar perfumes used in the service of the gods which come fromabroad and purple and other dyes which are not produced in thecountry or the materials of any art which have to be imported andwhich are not one should import them nor again shouldany one export anything which is wanted in the country of all thesethings let there be inspectors and superintendents taken from theguardians of the law and they shall be the twelve next in order tothe five seniors concerning arms and all implements which are formilitary purposes if there be need of introducing any art orplant or metal or chains of any kind or animals for use in war letthe commanders of the horse and the generals have authority over theirimportation and exportation the city shall send them out and alsoreceive them and the guardians of the law shall make fit and properlaws about them but let there be no retail trade for the sake either in these or any other articles in the city orcountry at all 
 with respect to food and the distribution of the produce of thecountry the right and proper way seems to be nearly that which is thecustom of crete for all should be required to distribute the fruitsof the soil into twelve parts and in this way consume them let thetwelfth portion of each as for instance of wheat and barley to whichthe rest of the fruits of the earth shall be added as well as theanimals which are for sale in each of the twelve divisions be dividedin due proportion into three parts one part for freemen anotherfor their servants and a third for craftsmen and in general forstrangers whether sojourners who may be dwelling in the city andlike other men must live or those who come on some business whichthey have with the state or with some individual let only this thirdpart of all necessaries be required to be sold out of the no one shall be compelled to sell and how will they bebest distributed in the first place we see clearly that thedistribution will be of equals in one point of view and in anotherpoint of view of unequals 
 cle what do you mean 
 ath i mean that the earth of necessity produces and nourishes thevarious articles of food sometimes better and sometimes worse 
 cle of course 
 ath such being the case let no one of the three portions begreater than either of the other that which is assigned tomasters or to slaves nor again that of the stranger but let thedistribution to all be equal and alike and let every citizen take histwo portions and distribute them among slaves and freemen he havingpower to determine the quantity and quality and what remains he shalldistribute by measure and numb among the animals who have to besustained from the earth taking the whole number of them 
 in the second place our citizens should have separate houses dulyordered and this will be the order proper for men like them thereshall be twelve hamlets one in the middle of each twelfth in each hamlet they shall first set apart a andthe temples of the gods and of their attendant demigods and if therebe any local deities of the magnetes or holy seats of other ancientdeities whose memory has been preserved to these let them paytheir ancient honours but hestia and zeus and athene will havetemples everywhere together with the god who presides in each of thetwelve districts and the first erection of houses shall be aroundthese temples where the ground is highest in order to provide thesafest and most defensible place of retreat for the guards all therest of the country they shall settle in the following make thirteen divisions of the craftsmen one of them they shallestablish in the city and this again they shall subdivide intotwelve lesser divisions among the twelve districts of the city andthe remainder shall be distributed in the country round about andin each village they shall settle various classes of craftsmen with aview to the convenience of the husbandmen and the chief officers ofthe wardens of the country shall superintend all these matters andsee how many of them and which class of them each place fix them where they are likely to be least troublesome and mostuseful to the husbandman and the wardens of the city shall see tosimilar matters in the city 
 now the wardens of the agora ought to see to the details of theagora their first care after the temples which are in the agora havebeen seen to should be to prevent any one from doing any indealings between man and man in the second place as beinginspectors of temperance and violence they should chastise him whorequires chastisement touching articles of gale they should firstsee whether the articles which the citizens are under regulations tosell to strangers are sold to them as the law ordains and let thelaw be as the first day of the month the persons incharge whoever they are whether strangers or slaves who have thecharge on behalf of the citizens shall produce to the strangers theportion which falls to them in the first place a twelfth portionof the stranger shall purchase corn for the whole month andother cereals on the first market day and on the tenth day of themonth the one party shall sell and the other buy liquidssufficient to last during the whole month and on the daythere shall be a sale of animals by those who are willing to sell tothe people who want to buy and of implements and other things whichhusbandmen sell such as skins and all kinds of clothing either wovenor made of felt and other goods of the same sort and which strangersare compelled to buy and purchase of others as to the retail trade inthese things whether of barley or wheat set apart for meal and any other kind of food no one shall sell them to citizens or theirslaves nor shall any one buy of a citizen but let the strangersell them in the market of strangers to artisans and their an exchange of wine and food which is commonly called retailtrade and butchers shall offer for sale parts of dismemberedanimals to the strangers and artisans and their servants let anystranger who likes buy fuel from day to day wholesale from thosewho have the care of it in the country and let him sell to thestrangers as much he pleases and when he pleases as to other goodsand implements which are likely to be wanted they shall sell themin common market at any place which the guardians of the law andthe wardens of the market and city choosing according to theirjudgment shall determine at such places they shall exchange moneyfor goods and goods for money neither party giving credit to theother and he who gives credit must be satisfied whether he obtainhis money not for in such exchanges he will not be protected bylaw but whenever property has been bought or sold greater inquantity or value than is allowed by the law which has determinedwithin what limited a man may increase and diminish his the excess be registered in the books of the guardians of the case of diminution let there be an erasure made and let thesame rule be observed about the registration of the property of themetics any one who likes may come and be a metic on certainconditions a foreigner if he likes and is able to settle may dwellin the land but he must practise an art and not abide more thantwenty years from the time at which he has registered himself andhe shall pay no tax however small except good any other tax for buying and selling but when the twenty yearshave expired he shall take his property with him and depart and ifin the course of these years he should chance to distinguish himselfby any considerable benefit which he confers on the state and hethinks that he can persuade the council and assembly either togrant him delay in leaving the country or to allow him to remainfor the whole of his life let him go and persuade the city andwhatever they assent to at his instance shall take effect for thechildren of the metics being artisans and of fifteen years of the time of their sojourn commence after their fifteenth year andlet them remain for twenty years and then go where they like but anyof them who wishes to remain may do so if he can persuade thecouncil and assembly and if he depart let him erase all theentries which have been made by him in the register kept by themagistrates

 book viii 
 
 athenian stranger next with the help of the delphian oracle wehave to institute festivals and make laws about them and to determinewhat sacrifices will be for the good of the city and to what godsthey shall be offered but when they shall be offered and howoften may be partly regulated by us 
 cleinias the 
 ath then we will first determine the number and let the wholenumber be one for every that one magistrate at least willsacrifice daily to some god or on behalf of the city and thecitizens and their possessions and the interpreters and priestesses and prophets shall meet and in company with theguardians of the law ordain those things which the legislator ofnecessity omits and i may remark that they are the very persons whoought to take note of what is omitted the law will say that there aretwelve feasts dedicated to the twelve gods after whom the severaltribes are named and that to each of them they shall sacrificeevery month and appoint choruses and musical and gymnastic them so as to suit the gods and seasons of the year andthey shall have festivals for women distinguishing those whichought to be separated from the festivals and those whichought not further they shall not confuse the infernal deities andtheir rites with the gods who are termed heavenly and their rites butshall separate them giving to pluto his own in the twelfth is sacred to him according to the law to such a deitywarlike men should entertain no aversion but they should honour himas being always the best friend of man for the connection of soul andbody is no way better than the dissolution of them as i am ready tomaintain quite seriously moreover those who would regulate thesematters rightly should consider that our city among existing citieshas fellow either in respect of leisure or comin and of thenecessaries of life and that like an individual she ought to livehappily and those who would live happily should in the first place dono wrong to one another and ought not themselves to be wronged byothers to attain the first is not difficult but there is greatdifficulty in acquiring the power of not being wronged no man can beperfectly secure against wrong unless he has become perfectly cities are like individuals in this for a city if good has a lifeof peace but if evil a life of war within and without wherefore thecitizens ought to practise in time of war but rather whilethey are at peace and every city which has any sense should take thefield at least for one day in every month and for more if themagistrates think fit having no regard to winter cold or summer they should go out en masse including their wives and theirchildren when the magistrates determine to lead forth the wholepeople or in separate portions when summoned by them and they shouldalways provide that there should be games and sacrificial they should have tournaments imitating in as lively a manner asthey can real battles and they should distribute prizes of victoryand valour to the competitors passing censures and encomiums on oneanother according to the characters which they bear in the contestsand their whole life honouring him who seems to be the best andblaming him who is the opposite and let poets celebrate however every poet but only one who in the first place isnot less than fifty years of age nor should he be one who althoughhe may have musical and poetical gifts has never in his life done anynoble or illustrious action but those who are themselves good andalso honourable in the state creators of noble theirpoems be sung even though they be not very musical and let thejudgment of them rest with the instructor of youth and the otherguardians of the laws who shall give them this privilege and theyalone shall be free to sing but the rest of the world shall nothave this liberty nor shall any one dare to sing a song which has notbeen approved by the judgment of the guardians of the laws not evenif his strain be sweeter than the songs of thamyras and orpheus butonly and orpheus but only such poems as have been judged sacred anddedicated to the gods and such as are the works of good men whichpraise of blame has been awarded and which have been deemed tofulfil their design fairly 
 the regulations about and about liberty of speech in poitry oughtto apply equally to men and women the legislator may be supposed toargue the question in his own are my citizens for whom ihave set in order the city are they not competitors in the greatestof all contests and have they not innumerable rivals to be be the natural reply well but if we were training boxers orpancratiasts or any other sort of athletes would they never meetuntil the hour of contest arrived and should we do nothing to prepareourselves previously by daily practice surely if we were boxers weshould have been learning to fight for many days before andexercising ourselves in imitating all those blows and wards which wewere intending to use in the hour of conflict and in order that wemight come as near to reality as possible instead of cestuses weshould put on boxing gloves that the blows and the wards might bepractised by us to the utmost of our power and if there were a lackof competitors the ridicule of fools would ryot deter us from hangingup a lifeless image and practising at that or if we had noadversary at all animate or inanimate should we not venture in thedearth of antagonists to spar by ourselves in what other manner couldwe ever study the art of 
 cle the way which you mention stranger would be the only way 
 ath and shall the warriors of our city who are destined whenoccasion calli to enter the greatest of all contests and to fight fortheir lives and their children and their property and the wholecity be worse prepared than boxers and will the he is afraid that their practising with one another may appearto some ridiculous abstain from commanding them to go out andfight will he not ordain that soldiers shall perform lesser exerciseswithout arms every day making dancing and all gymnastic tend tothis end and also will he not require that they shall practise somegymnastic exercises greater as well as lesser as often as everymonth and that they shall have contests one with another in everypart of the country seizing upon posts and lying in ambush andimitating in every respect the reality of war fighting and hurling javelins and using weapons somewhatdangerous and as nearly as possible like the true ones in order thatthe sport may not be altogether without fear but may have terrors andto a certain degree show the man who has and who has not that the honour and dishonour which are assigned to themrespectively may prepare the whole city for the true conflict oflife if any one dies in these mimic contests the homicide isinvoluntary and we will make the slayer when he has been purifiedaccording to law to be pure of blood considering that if a few menshould die others as good as they will be born but that if fear isdead then the citizens will never find a test of superior and inferiornatures which is a far greater evil to the state than the loss of afew 
 cle we are quite agreed stranger that we should legislate aboutsuch things and that the whole state should practise them supposed 
 ath and what is the reason that dances and contests of this sorthardly ever exist in states at least not to any extent worth speakingof is this due to the ignorance of mankind and their legislators 
 cle perhaps 
 ath certainly not sweet cleinias there are two causes whichare quite enough to account for the deficiency 
 cle what are they 
 ath one cause is the love of wealth which wholly absorbs never for a moment allows them to think of anything but theirown private possessions on this the soul of every citizen hangssuspended and can attend to nothing but his daily gain mankind areready to learn any branch of knowledge and to follow any pursuitwhich tends to this end and they laugh at every is onereason why a city will not be in earnest about such contests or anyother good and honourable pursuit but from an insatiable love of goldand silver every man will stoop to any art or contrivance seemlyor unseemly in the hope of becoming rich and will make noobjection to performing any action holy or unholy and utterlybase if only like a beast he have the power of eating and drinkingall kinds of things and procuring for himself in every sort of waythe gratification of his lusts 
 cle true 
 ath let this then be deemed one of the causes which preventstates from pursuing in an efficient manner the art of war or anyother noble aim but makes the orderly and temperate part of mankindinto merchants and captains of ships and servants and convertsthe valiant sort into thieves and burglars and robbers of temples andviolent tyrannical persons many of whom are not without ability butthey are unfortunate 
 cle what do you mean 
 ath must not they be truly unfortunate whose souls are compelled topass through life always hungering 
 cle then that is one cause stranger but you spoke of another 
 ath thank you for reminding me 
 cle the insatiable life long love of wealth as you were sayingis one clause which absorbs mankind and prevents them from rightlypractising the arts of and now tell me what is theother 
 ath do you imagine that i delay because i am in a perplexity 
 cle no but we think that you are too severe upon temper of which you seem in the present discussion tohave a peculiar dislike 
 ath that is a very fair rebuke cleinias and i will now proceedto the second cause 
 cle proceed 
 ath i say that governments are a concerning which i have often spoken in the previousdiscourse or rather governments they are not for none of themexercises a voluntary rule over voluntary subjects but they may betruly called states of discord in which while the government isvoluntary the subjects always obey against their will and have to becoerced and the ruler fears the subject and will not if he canhelp allow him to become either noble or rich or strong orvaliant or warlike at all these two are the chief causes of almostall evils and of the evils of which i have been speaking they arenotably the causes but our state has escaped both of them for hercitizens have the greatest leisure and they are not subject to oneanother and will i think be made by these laws the reverse oflovers of money such a constitution may be reasonably supposed tobe the only one existing which will accept the education which we havedescribed and the martial pastimes which have been perfectedaccording to our idea 
 cle true 
 ath then next we must remember about all gymnastic only the warlike sort of them are to be practised and to haveprizes of victory and those which are not military are to be givenup the military sort had better be completely described andestablished by law and first let us speak of running and swiftness 
 cle very good 
 ath certainly the most military of all qualities is generalactivity of body whether of foot or hand for escaping or forcapturing an enemy quickness of foot is required but and combat need vigour and strength 
 cle very true 
 ath neither of them can attain their greatest efficiency withoutarms 
 cle how can they 
 ath then our herald in accordance with the prevailing first summon the will appear armed for to anunarmed competitor we will not give a prize and he shall enterfirst who is to run the single course bearing arms next he who is torun the double course third he who is to run the andfourthly he who is to run the long course the fifth whom we be the first sent forth in heavy armour and shall run acourse of sixty stadia to some temple of we will send forthanother whom we will style the more heavily armed to run oversmoother ground there remains the archer and he shall run in thefull equipments of an archer a distance of stadia overmountains and across every sort of country to a temple of apollo andartemis this shall be the order of the contest and we will waitfor them until they return and will give a prize to the conquerorin each 
 cle very good 
 ath let us suppose that there are three kinds of ofboys another of beardless youths and a third of men for theyouths we will fix the length of the contest at and forthe boys at half of the entire course whether they contend as archersor as heavy armed touching the women let the girls who are not grownup compete naked in the stadium and the double course and and the long course and let them run on itself those who are thirteen years of age and upwardsuntil their marriage shall continue to share in contests if they arenot more than twenty and shall be compelled to run up to they shall descend into the arena in suitable dresses let thesebe the regulations about contests in running both for men and women 
 respecting contests of strength instead of wrestling and similarcontests of the heavier sort we will institute conflicts in armour ofone against one and two against two and so on up to ten against to what a man ought not to suffer or do and to what extent inorder to gain the in wrestling the masters of the art havelaid down what is fair and what is not fair so in fighting ought to call in skilful persons who shall judge for us andbe our assessors in the work of legislation they shall say whodeserves to be victor in combats of this sort and what he is not todo or have done to him and in like manner what rule determines who isdefeated and let these ordinances apply to women until they marriedas well as to men the pancration shall have a counterpart in a combatof the light armed they shall contend with bows and with lightshields and with javelins and in the throwing of stones by slingsand by hand and laws shall be made about it and rewards and prizesgiven to him who best fulfils the ordinances of the law 
 next in order we shall have to legislate about the horse we do not need many horses for they cannot be of much use in acountry like crete and hence we naturally do not take great painsabout the rearing of them or about horse races there is no one whokeeps a chariot among us and any rivalry in such matters would bealtogether out of place there would be no sense nor any shadow ofsense in instituting contests which are not after the manner of ourcountry and therefore we give our prizes for single who have not yet cast their teeth and for those who areintermediate and for the horses themselves and thus ourequestrian games will accord with the nature of the country letthem have conflict and rivalry in these matters in accordance with thelaw and let the colonels and generals of horse decide togetherabout all courses and about the armed competitors in them but we havenothing to say to the unarmed either in gymnastic exercises or inthese contests on the other hand the cretan bowman or fights in armour on horseback is useful and therefore we may aswell place a competition of this sort among amusements women arenot to be forced to compete by laws and ordinances but if fromprevious training they have acquired the habit and are strong enoughand like to take part let them do so girls as well as boys and noblame to them 
 thus the competition in gymnastic and the mode of learning it havebeen described and we have spoken also of the toils of the of daily exercises under the superintendence of masters relates to music has been for the most part completed but asto rhapsodes and the like and the contests of choruses which are toperform at feasts all this shall be arranged when the months and daysand years have been appointed for gods and whether everythird year or again every fifth year or in whatever way or mannerthe gods may put into minds the distribution and order ofthem at the same time we may expect that the musical contests willbe celebrated in their turn by the command of the judges and thedirector of education and the guardians of the law meeting togetherfor this purpose and themselves becoming legislators of the times andnature and conditions of the choral contests and of dancing ingeneral what they ought severally to be in language and song andin the admixture of harmony with rhythm and the dance has beenoften declared by the original legislator and his successors ought tofollow him making the games and sacrifices duly to correspond atfitting times and appointing public festivals it is not difficult todetermine how these and the like matters may have a regular again will the alteration of them do any great good or harm tothe state there is however another matter of great importance anddifficulty concerning which god should legislate if there were anypossibility of obtaining from him an ordinance about it but seeingthat divine aid is not to be had there appears to be a need of somebold man who specially honours plainness of speech and will sayoutright what he thinks best for the city and is good and convenient for the whole state amid the corruptionsof human souls opposing the mightiest lusts and having no man hishelper but himself standing alone and following reason only 
 cle what is this stranger that you are saying for we do not asyet understand your meaning 
 ath very likely i will endeavour to explain myself more i came to the subject of education i beheld young men andmaidens holding friendly intercourse with one another and therenaturally arose in my mind a sort of could not helpthinking how one is to deal with a city in which youths and maidensare well nurtured and have nothing to do and are not undergoingthe excessive and servile toils which extinguish wantonness and whoseonly cares during their whole life are sacrifices and festivals anddances how in such a state as this will they abstain from desireswhich thrust many a man and woman into perdition and from whichreason assuming the functions of law commands them to abstain theordinances already made may possibly get the better of most of thesedesires the prohibition of excessive wealth is a very considerablegain in the direction of temperance and the whole education of ouryouth imposes a law of moderation on them moreover the eye of therulers is required always to watch over the young and never to losesight of them and these provisions do as far as human means caneffect anything exercise a regulating influence upon the desires ingeneral but how can we take precautions against the unnatural lovesof either sex from which innumerable evils have come upon individualsand cities how shall we devise a remedy and way of escape out of sogreat a danger truly cleinias here is a difficulty in many wayscrete and lacedaemon furnish a great help to those who make peculiarlaws but in the matter of love as we are alone i must confessthat they are quite against us for if any one following nature shouldlay down the law which existed before the days of laius anddenounce these lusts as contrary to nature adducing the animals asa proof that such unions were monstrous he might prove his point buthe would be wholly at variance with the custom of your they are repugnant to a principle which we say that alegislator should always observe for we are always enquiring which ofour enactments tends to virtue and which not and suppose we grantthat these loves are accounted by law to be honourable or at leastnot disgraceful in what degree will they contribute to virtue willsuch passions implant in the soul of him who is seduced the habit ofcourage or in the soul of the seducer the principle of will ever believe rather who will not blame theeffeminacy of him who yields to pleasures and is unable to hold outagainst them will not all men censure as womanly him who imitates thewoman and who would ever think of establishing such a practice bylaw certainly no one who had in his mind the image of true law howcan we prove that what i am saying is true he who would rightlyconsider these matters must see the nature of friendship and of these loves for they are of two kinds and out ofthe two arises a third kind having the same name and this similarityof name causes all the difficulty and obscurity 
 cle how is that 
 ath dear is the like in virtue to the like and the equal to theequal dear also though unlike is he who has abundance to him who isin want and when either of these friendships becomes excessive weterm the excess love 
 cle very true 
 ath the friendship which arises from contraries is horrible andcoarse and has often no tie of communion but that which arises fromlikeness is gentle and has a tie of communion which lasts throughlife as to the mixed sort which is made up of them both there of all a in determining what he who is possessed by thisthird love desires moreover he is drawn different ways and is indoubt between the two principles the one exhorting him to enjoy thebeauty of youth and the other forbidding him for the one is alover of the body and hungers after beauty like ripe fruit andwould fain satisfy himself without any regard to the character ofthe beloved the other holds the desire of the body to be asecondary matter and looking rather than loving and with his souldesiring the soul of the other in a becoming manner regards thesatisfaction of the bodily love as wantonness he reverences andrespects temperance and courage and magnanimity and wisdom and wishesto live chastely with the chaste object of his affection now the sortof love which is made up of the other two is that which we havedescribed as the third seeing then that there are these three sortsof love ought the law to prohibit and forbid them all to existamong us is it not rather clear that we should wish to have in thestate the love which is of virtue and which desires the belovedyouth to be the best possible and the other two if possible weshould hinder what do you say friend megillus 
 megillus i think stranger that you are perfectly right in whatyou have been now saying 
 ath i knew well my friend that i should obtain your assent whichi accept and therefore have no need to analyse your custom anyfurther cleinias shall be prevailed upon to give me his assent atsome other time enough of this and now let us proceed to the laws 
 meg very good 
 ath upon reflection i see a way of imposing the law which inone respect is easy but in another is of the utmost difficulty 
 meg what do you mean 
 ath we are all aware that most men in spite of their lawlessnatures are very strictly and precisely restrained from intercoursewith the fair and this is not at all against their will but entirelywith their will 
 meg when do you mean 
 ath when any one has a brother or sister who is fair and about ason or daughter the same unwritten law holds and is a most perfectsafeguard so that no open or secret connection ever takes placebetween them nor does the thought of such a thing ever enter at allinto the minds of most of them 
 meg very true 
 ath does not a little word extinguish all pleasures of that sort 
 meg what word 
 ath the declaration that they are unholy hated of god and mostinfamous and is not the reason of this that no one has ever saidthe opposite but every one from his earliest childhood has heardmen speaking in the same manner about them always and in comedy or in the graver language of tragedy when thepoet introduces on the stage a thyestes or an oedipus or a macareushaving secret intercourse with his sister he represents him whenfound out ready to kill himself as the penalty of his sin 
 meg you are very right in saying that tradition if no breath ofopposition ever assails it has a marvellous power 
 ath am i not also right in saying that the legislator who wantsto master any of the passions which master man may easily know howto subdue them he will consecrate the tradition of their evilcharacter among all slaves and freemen women and the will be the surest foundation of the lawwhich he can make 
 meg yes but will he ever succeed in making all mankind use thesame language about them 
 ath a good objection but was i not just now saying that i had away to make men use natural love and abstain from unnatural notintentionally destroying the seeds of human increase or sowing themin stony places in which they will take no root and that i wouldcommand them to abstain too from any female field of increase in whichthat which is sown is not likely to grow now if a law to thiseffect could only be made perpetual and gain an authority such asalready prevents intercourse of parents and a to other sensual desires and conquering them would bethe source of ten thousand blessings for in the first is the appointment of nature and deters men from allfrenzy and madness of love and from all adulteries and immoderate useof meats and drinks and makes them good friends to their own innumerable other benefits would result if such a could only beenforced i can imagine some lusty youth who is standing by andwho on hearing this enactment declares in scurrilous terms that weare making foolish and impossible laws and fills the world with hisoutcry and therefore i said that i knew a way of enacting andperpetuating such a law which was very easy in one respect but inanother most difficult there is no difficulty in seeing that such alaw is possible and in what way for as i was saying theordinance once consecrated would master the soul of every man andterrify him into obedience but matters have now come to such a passthat even then the desired result seems as if it could not beattained just as the continuance of an entire state in the practiceof common meals is also deemed impossible and although this latter ispartly disproven by the fact of their existence among you stilleven in your cities the common meals of women would be regarded asunnatural and impossible i was thinking of the rebelliousness ofthe human heart when i said that the permanent establishment ofthese things is very difficult 
 meg very true 
 ath shall i try and find some sort of persuasive argument whichwill prove to you that such enactments are possible and not beyondhuman nature 
 cle by all means 
 ath is a man more likely to abstain from the pleasures of loveand to do what he is bidden about them when his body is in a goodcondition or when he is in an ill condition and out of training 
 cle he will be far more temperate when he is in training 
 ath and have we not heard of iccus of tarentum who with a view tothe olympic and other contests in his zeal for his art ind alsobecause he was of a manly and temperate disposition never had anyconnection with a woman or a youth during the whole time of histraining and the same is said of crison and astylus and diopompus andmany others and yet cleinias they were far worse educated intheir minds than your and my citizens and in their bodies far morelusty 
 cle no doubt this fact has been often affirmed positively by theancients of these athletes 
 ath and had they courage to abstain from what is ordinarillydeemed a pleasure for the sake of a victory in wrestling running andthe like and shall our young men be incapable of a similarendurance for the sake of a much nobler victory which is thenoblest of all as from their youth upwards we will tell them as we hope into the belief of this by tales andsayings and songs 
 cle of what victory are you speaking 
 ath of the victory over pleasure which if they win they will livehappily or if they are conquered the reverse of happily may we not suppose that the fear of impiety will enablethem to master that which other inferior people have mastered 
 cle i dare say 
 ath and since we have reached this point in our legislation andhave fallen into a difficulty by reason of the vices of mankind iaffirm that our ordinance should simply run in the following citizens ought not to fall below the nature of birds and beasts ingeneral who are born in great multitudes and yet remain until theage for procreation virgin and unmarried but when they have reachedthe proper time of life are coupled male and female and lovinglypair together and live the rest of their lives in holiness andinnocence abiding firmly in their original we willsay to them you should be better than the animals but if they arecorrupted by the other hellenes and the common practice of they see with their eyes and hear with their ears of the love everywhere prevailing among them and they themselves arenot able to get the better of the temptation the guardians of thelaw exercising the functions of lawgivers shall devise a secondlaw against them 
 cle and what law would you advise them to pass if this one failed 
 ath clearly cleinias the one which would naturally follow 
 cle what is that 
 ath our citizens should not allow pleasures to strengthen withindulgence but should by toil divert the aliment and exuberance ofthem into other parts of the body and this will happen if noimmodesty be allowed in the practice of love then they will beashamed of frequent intercourse and they will find pleasure ifseldom enjoyed to be a less imperious mistress they should not befound out doing anything of the sort concealment shall be sanctioned by custom and made law by unwritten prescription onthe other hand to be detected shall be esteemed dishonourable butnot to abstain wholly in this way there will be a second legalstandard of honourable and dishonourable involving a second notion ofright three principles will comprehend all those corrupt natures whomwe call inferior to themselves and who form but one dass and willcompel them not to transgress 
 cle what are they 
 ath the principle of piety the love of honour and the desire ofbeauty not in the body but in the soul these are aspirations but they are the noblest of aspirations if theycould only be realized in all states and god willing in thematter of love we may be able to enforce one of two thatno one shall venture to touch any person of the freeborn or nobleclass except his wedded wife or sow the unconsecrated and bastardseed among harlots or in barren and unnatural lusts or at least wemay abolish altogether the connection of men with men and as towomen if any man has to do with any but those who come into his houseduly married by sacred rites whether they be bought or acquired inany other way and he offends publicly in the face of all shall be right in enacting that he be deprived of civic honours andprivileges and be deemed to be as he truly is a stranger letthis law then whether it is one or ought rather to be called laid down respecting love in general and the intercourse of thesexes which arises out of the desires whether rightly or wronglyindulged 
 meg i for my part stranger would gladly receive this shall speak for himself and tell you what is his opinion 
 cle i will megillus when an opportunity offers at present ithink that we had better allow the stranger to proceed with his laws 
 meg very good 
 ath we had got about as far as the establishment of the commontables which in most places would be difficult but in crete no onewould think of introducing any other custom there might arise aquestion about the manner of they shall be such as theyare here in crete or such as they are in is there athird kind which may be better than either of them the answer to thisquestion might be easily discovered but the discovery would do nogreat good for at present they are very well ordered 
 leaving the common tables we may therefore proceed to the meansof providing food now in cities the means of life are gained in manyways and from divers sources and in general from two sources whereasour city has only one for most of the hellenes obtain their food fromsea and land but our citizens from land only and this makes the taskof the legislator less as many laws will be enough andmuch less than half and they will be of a kind better suited tofree men for he has nothing to do with laws about shipowners andmerchants and retailers and innkeepers and tax collectors and minesand moneylending and compound interest and innumerable to these he gives laws to husbandmen andshepherds and and to the guardians and superintendents oftheir implements and he has already legislated for greater for example respecting marriage and the procreation and nurture ofchildren and for education and the establishment of he must direct his laws to those who provide food and labour inpreparing it 
 let us first of all then have a class of laws which shall becalled the laws of husbandmen and let the first of them be the law ofzeus the god of boundaries let no one shift the boundary line eitherof a who is a neighbour or if he dwells at theextremity of the land of any stranger who is conterminous with that this is truly to move the immovable and everyone should be more willing to move the largest rock which is not alandmark than the least stone which is the sworn mark of friendshipand hatred between neighbours for zeus the god of kindred is thewitness of the citizen and zeus the god of strangers of thestranger and when aroused terrible are the wars which they stirup he who obeys the law will never know the fatal consequences ofdisobedience but he who despises the law shall be liable to adouble penalty the first coming from the gods and the second fromthe law for let no one wilfully remove the boundaries of land and if any one does let him who will inform thelandowners and let them bring him into court and if he beconvicted of the land by stealth or by force let thecourt determine what he ought to suffer or pay in the next small injuries done by neighbours to one another through theirmultiplication may cause a weight of enmity and make neighbourhood avery disagreeable and bitter thing wherefore a man ought to be verycareful of committing any offence against his neighbour andespecially of encroaching on his land for any man mayeasily do harm but not every man can do good to another he whoencroaches on his land and transgresses his make good the damage and to cure him of his impudence and alsoof his meanness he shall pay a double penalty to the injured these and the like matters the wardens of the country shall takecognizance and be the judges of them and assessors of the the more important cases as has been already said the wholenumber of them belonging to any one of the twelve divisions shalldecide and in the lesser cases the commanders or again if anyone pastures his cattle on his land they shall see theinjury and adjudge the penalty and if any one by decoying the possession of swarms and draws them to himself bymaking noises he shall pay the damage or if anyone sets fire tohis own wood and takes no care of his property he shallbe fined at the discretion of the magistrates and if in planting hedoes not leave a fair distance between his own and his he shall be punished in accordance with the enactments ofmany law givers which we may use not deeming it necessary that thegreat legislator of our state should determine all the trifles whichmight be decided by any body for example husbandmen have had ofold excellent laws about waters and there is no reason why weshould propose to divert their course who likes may draw water fromthe of the common stream on to his own land if he donot cut off the spring which clearly belongs to some other he may take the water in any direction which he pleases exceptthrough a house or temple or sepulchre but he must be careful to dono harm beyond the channel and if there be in any place a naturaldryness of the earth which keeps in the rain from heaven andcauses a deficiency in the supply of water let him dig down on hisown land as far as the clay and if at this depth he finds no him obtain water from his neighbours as much as is requiredfor his servants drinking and if his neighbours too are limited intheir supply let him have a fixed measure which shall bedetermined by the wardens of the country this he shall receive eachday and on these terms have a share of his neighbours water ifthere be heavy rain and one of those on the lower ground injures sometiller of the upper ground or some one who has a common wall byrefusing to give the man outlet for water or again if some oneliving on the higher ground recklessly lets off the water on his lowerneighbour and they cannot come to terms with one another let him whowill call in a warden of the city if he be in the city or if he bein the country warden of the country and let him obtain a decisiondetermining what each of them is to do and he who will not abide bythe decision shall suffer for his malignant and morose temper and paya fine to the injured party equivalent to double the value of theinjury because he was unwilling to submit to the magistrates 
 now the participation of fruits shall be ordered on this wise thegoddess of autumn has two gracious gifts one the joy of dionysuswhich is not treasured up the other which nature intends to bestored let this be the law then concerning the fruits of autumn hewho tastes the common or storing fruits of autumn whether grapes orfigs before the season of vintage which coincides with on his own land or on that of him pay fiftydrachmae which shall be sacred to dionysus if he pluck them from hisown land and if from his land a mina and if from anyothers of a mina and he who would gather the or the choice figs as they are now termed if he take themoff his own land let him pluck them how and when he likes but ifhe take them from the ground of others without their leave let him inthat case be always punished in accordance with the law whichordains that he should not move what he has not laid down and if aslave touches any fruit of this sort without the consent of the ownerof the land he shall be beaten with as many blows as there are grapeson the bunch or figs on the let a metic purchase autumnal fruit and then if he pleases he may gather if a stranger is passing along the road and desires to eat lethim take of the choice grapes for himself and a single followerwithout payment as a tribute of hospitality the law howeverforbids strangers from sharing in the sort which is not used foreating and if any one whether he be master or slave takes of themin ignorance let the slave be beaten and the freeman dismissedwith admonitions and instructed to take of the other autumnalfruits which are unfit for making raisins and wine or for laying byas dried figs as to pears and apples and pomegranates andsimilar fruits there shall be no disgrace in taking them he who is caught if he be of less than thirty years of age shallbe struck and beaten off but not wounded and no freeman shall haveany right of satisfaction for such blows of these fruits the strangermay partake just as he may of the fruits of autumn and if anelder who is more than thirty years of age eat of them on thespot let him like the stranger be allowed to partake of all suchfruits but he must carry away nothing if however he will notobey the law let him run risk of failing in the competition ofvirtue in case any one takes notice of his actions before thejudges at the time 
 water is the greatest element of nutrition in gardens but is easilypolluted you cannot poison the soil or the soil or the sun orthe air which are other elements of nutrition in plants or divertthem or steal them but all these things may very likely happen inregard to water which must therefore be protected by law and letthis be the any one intentionally pollutes the water ofanother whether the water of a spring or collected in by poisonous substances or by digging or by theft let theinjured party bring the cause before the wardens of the city andclaim in writing the value of the loss if the accused be found guiltyof injuring the water by deleterious substances let him not onlypay damages but purify the stream or the cistern which contains thewater in such manner as the laws of the interpreters order thepurification to be made by the offender in each case 
 with respect to the gathering in of the fruits of the soil let aman if he pleases carry his own fruits through any place in which heeither does no harm to any one or himself gains three times as muchas his neighbour loses now of these things the magistrates shouldbe cognisant as of all other things in which a man intentionally doesinjury to another or to the property of another by fraud or force inthe use which he makes of his own property all these matters a manshould lay before the magistrates and receive damages supposingthe injury to be not more than three minae or if he have a chargeagainst another which involves a larger amount let him bring his suitinto the public courts and have the punished but if anyof the magistrates appear to adjudge the penalties which he imposes inan unjust spirit let him be liable to pay double to the injuredparty any one may bring the offences of magistrates in anyparticular case before the public courts there are innumerablelittle matters relating to the modes of punishment and applicationsfor suits and summonses and the witnesses to two witnesses should be required for a summons or all such details which cannot be omitted in legislation butare beneath the wisdom of an aged legislator these lesser matters asthey indeed are in comparison with the greater ones let a youngergeneration regulate by law after the patterns which have according to their own experience of the usefulness andnecessity of such laws and when they are duly regulated let therebe no alteration but let the citizens live in the observance of them 
 now of artisans let the regulations be as the firstplace let no citizen or servant of a citizen be occupied inhandicraft arts for he who is to secure and preserve the public orderof the state has an art which requires much study and many kinds ofknowledge and does not admit of being made a secondary hardly any human being is capable of pursuing two professions ortwo arts rightly or of practising one art himself and superintendingsome one else who is practising another let this then be ourfirst principle in the one who is a smith shall also be acarpenter and if he be a carpenter he shall not superintend art rather than his own under the pretext that insuperintending many servants who are working for him he is likelyto superintend them better because more revenue will accrue to himfrom them than from his own art but let every man in the state haveone art and get his living by that let the wardens of the citylabour to maintain this law and if any citizen incline to any otherart than the study of virtue let them punish him with disgrace andinfamy until they bring him back into his own right course and ifany stranger profess two arts let them chastise him with bonds andmoney penalties and expulsion from the state until they compel himto be one only and not many 
 but as touching payments for hire and contracts of work or in caseany one does wrong to any of the citizens or they do wrong to anyother up to fifty drachmae let the wardens of the city decide thecase but if greater amount be involved then let the public courtsdecide according to law let no one pay any duty either on theimportation or exportation of goods and as to frankincense andsimilar perfumes used in the service of the gods which come fromabroad and purple and other dyes which are not produced in thecountry or the materials of any art which have to be imported andwhich are not one should import them nor again shouldany one export anything which is wanted in the country of all thesethings let there be inspectors and superintendents taken from theguardians of the law and they shall be the twelve next in order tothe five seniors concerning arms and all implements which are formilitary purposes if there be need of introducing any art orplant or metal or chains of any kind or animals for use in war letthe commanders of the horse and the generals have authority over theirimportation and exportation the city shall send them out and alsoreceive them and the guardians of the law shall make fit and properlaws about them but let there be no retail trade for the sake either in these or any other articles in the city orcountry at all 
 with respect to food and the distribution of the produce of thecountry the right and proper way seems to be nearly that which is thecustom of crete for all should be required to distribute the fruitsof the soil into twelve parts and in this way consume them let thetwelfth portion of each as for instance of wheat and barley to whichthe rest of the fruits of the earth shall be added as well as theanimals which are for sale in each of the twelve divisions be dividedin due proportion into three parts one part for freemen anotherfor their servants and a third for craftsmen and in general forstrangers whether sojourners who may be dwelling in the city andlike other men must live or those who come on some business whichthey have with the state or with some individual let only this thirdpart of all necessaries be required to be sold out of the no one shall be compelled to sell and how will they bebest distributed in the first place we see clearly that thedistribution will be of equals in one point of view and in anotherpoint of view of unequals 
 cle what do you mean 
 ath i mean that the earth of necessity produces and nourishes thevarious articles of food sometimes better and sometimes worse 
 cle of course 
 ath such being the case let no one of the three portions begreater than either of the other that which is assigned tomasters or to slaves nor again that of the stranger but let thedistribution to all be equal and alike and let every citizen take histwo portions and distribute them among slaves and freemen he havingpower to determine the quantity and quality and what remains he shalldistribute by measure and numb among the animals who have to besustained from the earth taking the whole number of them 
 in the second place our citizens should have separate houses dulyordered and this will be the order proper for men like them thereshall be twelve hamlets one in the middle of each twelfth in each hamlet they shall first set apart a andthe temples of the gods and of their attendant demigods and if therebe any local deities of the magnetes or holy seats of other ancientdeities whose memory has been preserved to these let them paytheir ancient honours but hestia and zeus and athene will havetemples everywhere together with the god who presides in each of thetwelve districts and the first erection of houses shall be aroundthese temples where the ground is highest in order to provide thesafest and most defensible place of retreat for the guards all therest of the country they shall settle in the following make thirteen divisions of the craftsmen one of them they shallestablish in the city and this again they shall subdivide intotwelve lesser divisions among the twelve districts of the city andthe remainder shall be distributed in the country round about andin each village they shall settle various classes of craftsmen with aview to the convenience of the husbandmen and the chief officers ofthe wardens of the country shall superintend all these matters andsee how many of them and which class of them each place fix them where they are likely to be least troublesome and mostuseful to the husbandman and the wardens of the city shall see tosimilar matters in the city 
 now the wardens of the agora ought to see to the details of theagora their first care after the temples which are in the agora havebeen seen to should be to prevent any one from doing any indealings between man and man in the second place as beinginspectors of temperance and violence they should chastise him whorequires chastisement touching articles of gale they should firstsee whether the articles which the citizens are under regulations tosell to strangers are sold to them as the law ordains and let thelaw be as the first day of the month the persons incharge whoever they are whether strangers or slaves who have thecharge on behalf of the citizens shall produce to the strangers theportion which falls to them in the first place a twelfth portionof the stranger shall purchase corn for the whole month andother cereals on the first market day and on the tenth day of themonth the one party shall sell and the other buy liquidssufficient to last during the whole month and on the daythere shall be a sale of animals by those who are willing to sell tothe people who want to buy and of implements and other things whichhusbandmen sell such as skins and all kinds of clothing either wovenor made of felt and other goods of the same sort and which strangersare compelled to buy and purchase of others as to the retail trade inthese things whether of barley or wheat set apart for meal and any other kind of food no one shall sell them to citizens or theirslaves nor shall any one buy of a citizen but let the strangersell them in the market of strangers to artisans and their an exchange of wine and food which is commonly called retailtrade and butchers shall offer for sale parts of dismemberedanimals to the strangers and artisans and their servants let anystranger who likes buy fuel from day to day wholesale from thosewho have the care of it in the country and let him sell to thestrangers as much he pleases and when he pleases as to other goodsand implements which are likely to be wanted they shall sell themin common market at any place which the guardians of the law andthe wardens of the market and city choosing according to theirjudgment shall determine at such places they shall exchange moneyfor goods and goods for money neither party giving credit to theother and he who gives credit must be satisfied whether he obtainhis money not for in such exchanges he will not be protected bylaw but whenever property has been bought or sold greater inquantity or value than is allowed by the law which has determinedwithin what limited a man may increase and diminish his the excess be registered in the books of the guardians of the case of diminution let there be an erasure made and let thesame rule be observed about the registration of the property of themetics any one who likes may come and be a metic on certainconditions a foreigner if he likes and is able to settle may dwellin the land but he must practise an art and not abide more thantwenty years from the time at which he has registered himself andhe shall pay no tax however small except good any other tax for buying and selling but when the twenty yearshave expired he shall take his property with him and depart and ifin the course of these years he should chance to distinguish himselfby any considerable benefit which he confers on the state and hethinks that he can persuade the council and assembly either togrant him delay in leaving the country or to allow him to remainfor the whole of his life let him go and persuade the city andwhatever they assent to at his instance shall take effect for thechildren of the metics being artisans and of fifteen years of the time of their sojourn commence after their fifteenth year andlet them remain for twenty years and then go where they like but anyof them who wishes to remain may do so if he can persuade thecouncil and assembly and if he depart let him erase all theentries which have been made by him in the register kept by themagistrates

 book ix 
 
 next to all the matters which have preceded in the natural orderof legislation will come suits of law of suits those which relateto agriculture have been already described but the more importanthave not been described having mentioned them severally under theirusual names we will proceed to say what punishments are to beinflicted for each offence and who are to be the judges of them 
 cleinias very good 
 athenian stranger there is a sense of disgrace in legislating aswe are about to do for all the details of crime in a state we say is to be well regulated and will be perfectly adapted tothe practice of virtue to assume that in such a state there willarise some one who will be guilty of crimes as heinous as any whichare ever perpetrated in other states and that we must legislate forhim by anticipation and threaten and make laws against him if heshould arise in order to deter him and punish his acts under theidea that he will as i was saying is in a mannerdisgraceful yet seeing that we are not like the ancientlegislators who gave laws to heroes and sons of gods to the popular belief themselves the offspring of the legislating for others who were also the children of divineparents but that we are only men who are legislating for the sonsof men there is no uncharitableness in apprehending that some oneof our citizens may be like a seed which has touched the a heart so hard that it cannot be softened any more thanthose seeds can be softened by fire among our citizens there may bethose who cannot be subdued by all the strength of the laws and fortheir sake though an ungracious task i will proclaim my first lawabout the robbing of temples in case any one should dare to commitsuch a crime i do not expect or imagine that any will ever take the infection but their servants andstrangers and strangers servants may be guilty of many with a view to them especially and yet not without a providenteye to the weakness of human nature generally i will proclaim the lawabout robbers of temples and similar incurable or almost having already agreed that such enactments ought alwaysto have a short prelude we may speak to the criminal whom sometormenting desire by night and by day tempts to go and rob a fewest possible words of admonition and sir wewill say to him the impulse which moves you to rob temples is notan ordinary human malady nor yet a visitation of heaven but amadness which is begotten in a man from ancient and unexpiatedcrimes of his race an this you mustguard with all your might and how you are to guard we will explain toyou when any such thought comes into your mind go and performexpiations go as a suppliant to the temples of the gods who avertevils go to the society of those who are called good men among them tell and yourself try to repeat after them that every manshould honour the noble and the just fly from the company of and turn not back and if your disorder is lightened bythese remedies well and good but if not then acknowledge death tobe nobler than life and depart hence 
 such are the preludes which we sing to all who have thoughts ofunholy and treasonable actions and to him who hearkens to them thelaw has nothing to say but to him who is disobedient when the preludeis over cry with a loud who is taken in the act ofrobbing temples if he be a slave or stranger shall have his evildeed engraven on his face and hands and shall be beaten with asmany stripes as may seem good to the judges and be cast nakedbeyond the borders of the land and if he suffers this punishment hewill probably return to his right mind and be improved for no penaltywhich the law inflicts is designed for evil but always makes himwho suffers either better or not so much worse as he would havebeen but if any citizen be found guilty of any great or unmentionablewrong either in relation to the gods or his parents or the the judge deem him to be incurable remembering that afterreceiving such an excellent education and training from youthupward he has not abstained from the greatest of crimes hispunishment shall be death which to him will be the least of his example will benefit others if he perish ingloriously and becast beyond the borders of the land but let his children andfamily if they avoid the ways of their father have glory and lethonourable mention be made of them as having nobly and manfullyescaped out of evil into good none of them should have their goodsconfiscated to the state for the lots of the citizens ought always tocontinue the same and equal 
 touching the exaction of penalties when a man appears to havedone anything which deserves a fine he shall pay the fine if he haveanything in excess of the lot which is assigned to him but morethan that he shall not pay and to secure exactness let the guardiansof the law refer to the registers and inform the judges of theprecise truth in order that none of the lots may go uncultivatedfor want of money but if any one seems to deserve a greaterpenalty let him undergo a long and public imprisonment and bedishonoured unless some of his friends are willing to be surety forhim and liberate him by assisting him to pay the fine no criminalshall go unpunished not even for a single offence nor if he havefled the country but let the penalty be according to or bonds or blows or degrading places of sitting orstanding or removal to some temple on the borders of the land or lethim pay fines as we said before in cases of death let the judges bethe guardians of the law and a court selected by merit from thelast magistrates but how the causes are to be brought intoto court how the summonses are to be served the like these thingsmay be left to the younger generation of legislators to determine themanner of voting we must determine ourselves 
 let the vote be given openly but before they come to the vote letthe judges sit in order of seniority over against plaintiff anddefendant and let all the citizens who can spare time hear and take aserious interest in listening to such causes first of all theplaintiff shall make one speech and then the defendant shall makeanother and after the speeches have been made the eldest judgeshall begin to examine the parties and proceed to make an adequateenquiry into what has been said and after the oldest has rest shall proceed in order to examine either party as to whathe finds defective in the evidence whether of statement oromission and he who has nothing to ask shall hand over theexamination to another and on so much of what has been said as isto the purpose all the judges shall set their seals and place thewritings on the altar of hestia on the next day they shall meetagain and in like manner put their questions and go through thecause and again set their seals upon the evidence and when they havethree times done this and have had witnesses and evidence shall each of them give a holy vote after promising by hestiathat they will decide justly and truly to the utmost of their so they shall put an end to the suit 
 next after what relates to the gods follows what relates to thedissolution of the by promoting a man to power enslavesthe laws and subjects the city to factions using violence andstirring up sedition contrary to law him we will deem the greatestenemy of the whole state but he who takes no part in suchproceedings and being one of the chief magistrates of the state hasno knowledge of the treason or having knowledge of it by reasonof cowardice does not interfere on behalf of his country such anone we must consider nearly as bad every man who is worth anythingwill inform the magistrates and bring the conspirator to trial formaking a violent and illegal attempt to change the government thejudges of such cases shall be the same as of the robbers of let the whole proceeding be carried on in the same way and thevote of the majority condemn to death but let there be a generalrule that the disgrace and punishment of the father is not to bevisited on the children except in the case of some one whosefather grandfather and have successively undergonethe penalty of death such persons the city shall send away with alltheir possessions to the city and country of their only and wholly their appointed lot and out of the citizenswho have more than one son of not less than ten years of age theyshall select ten whom their father or grandfather by the side shall appoint and let them send to delphi the namesof those who are selected and him whom the god chooses they shallestablish as heir of the house which has failed and may he havebetter fortune than his predecessors 
 cle very good 
 ath once more let there be a third general law respecting thejudges who are to give judgment and the manner of conducting suitsagainst those who are tried on an accusation of treason and asconcerning the remaining or departure of their shallbe one law for all three for the traitor and the robber oftemples and the subverter by violence of the laws of the state for athief whether he steal much or little let there be one law andone punishment for all alike in the first place let him pay doublethe amount of the theft if he be convicted and if he have so muchover and above the he have not he shall be bounduntil he pay the penalty or persuade him has obtained the sentenceagainst him to forgive him but if a person be convicted of a theftagainst the state then if he can persuade the city or if he will payback twice the amount of the theft he shall be set free from hisbonds 
 cle what makes you say stranger that a theft is all the thief may have taken much or little and either fromsacred or secular these are not the only differences then that they are of many kinds ought not thelegislator to adapt himself to them and impose upon them entirelydifferent penalties 
 ath excellent i was running on too fast cleinias and youimpinged upon me and brought me to my senses reminding me of had occurred to mind already that legislation was never yetrightly worked out as i may say in you remember the imagein which i likened the men for whom laws are now made to slaves whoare doctored by slaves for of this you may be very sure that ifone of those empirical physicians who practise medicine withoutscience were to come upon the gentleman physician talking to hisgentleman patient and using the language almost of at the beginning of the disease and discoursing about thewhole nature of the body he would burst into a hearty say what most of those who are called doctors always have attheir fellow he would say you are nothealing the sick man but you are educating him and he does notwant to be made a doctor but to get well 
 cle and would he not be right 
 ath perhaps he would and he might remark upon us that he whodiscourses about laws as we are now doing is giving the citizenseducation and not laws that would be rather a telling observation 
 cle very true 
 ath but we are fortunate 
 cle in what way 
 ath inasmuch as we are not compelled to give laws but we maytake into consideration every form of government and ascertain whatis best and what is most needful and how they may both be carriedinto execution and we may also if we please at this very momentchoose what is best or if we prefer what is most we do 
 cle there is something ridiculous stranger in our proposing suchan alternative as if we were legislators simply bound under somegreat necessity which cannot be deferred to the morrow but we as imay by grace of heaven affirm like gatherers of stones orbeginners of some composite work may gather a heap of out of this at our leisure select what is suitable for ourprojected construction let us then suppose ourselves to be atleisure not of necessity building but rather like men who are partlyproviding materials and partly putting them together and we maytruly say that some of our laws like stones are already fixed intheir places and others lie at hand 
 ath certainly in that case cleinias our view of law will be morein accordance with nature for there is another matter affectinglegislators which i must earnestly entreat you to consider 
 cle what is it 
 ath there are many writings to be found in cities and among themthere are composed by legislators as well as by other persons 
 cle to be sure 
 ath shall we give heed rather to the writings of those the like who either in metre or out of metre have recordedtheir advice about the conduct of life and not to the writings oflegislators or shall we give heed to them above all 
 cle yes to them far above all others 
 ath and ought the legislator alone among writers to withhold hisopinion about the beautiful the good and the just and not toteach what they are and how they are to be pursued by those whointend to be happy 
 cle certainly not 
 ath and is it disgraceful for homer and tyrtaeus and other poets tolay down evil precepts in their writings respecting life and thepursuits of men but not so disgraceful for lycurgus and solon andothers who were legislators as well as writers is it not true that ofall the writings to be found in cities those which relate to you unfold and read them ought to be by far the noblest andthe best and should not other writings either agree with them orif they disagree be deemed ridiculous we should consider whether thelaws of states ought not to have the character of loving and wiseparents rather than of tyrants and masters who command and after writing their decrees on walls go their ways and discoursing of laws we should not take the gentler view of themwhich may or may not be any rate we will show ourreadiness to entertain such a view and be prepared to undergowhatever may be the result and may the result be good and if godbe gracious it will be good 
 cle excellent let us do as you say 
 ath then we will now consider accurately as we proposed whatrelates to robbers of temples and all kinds of thefts and offencesin general and we must not be annoyed if in the course oflegislation we have enacted some things and have not made up ourminds about some others for as yet we are not legislators but we maysoon be let us if you please consider these matters 
 cle by all means 
 ath concerning all things honourable and just let us thenendeavour to ascertain how far we are consistent with ourselves andhow far we are inconsistent and how far the many from whom at anyrate we should profess a desire to differ agree and disagree amongthemselves 
 cle what are the inconsistencies which you observe in us 
 ath i will endeavour to explain if i am not mistaken we are allagreed that justice and just men and things and actions are allfair and if a person were to maintain that just men even whenthey are deformed in body are still perfectly beautiful in respect ofthe excellent justice of their minds no one would say that therewas any inconsistency in this 
 cle they would be quite right 
 ath perhaps but let us consider further that if all thingswhich are just are fair and honourable in the term all we mustinclude just sufferings which are the correlatives of just actions 
 cle and what is the inference 
 ath the inference is that a just action in partaking of the justpartakes also in the same degree of the fair and honourable 
 cle certainly 
 ath and must not a suffering which partakes of the just principlebe admitted to be in the same degree fair and honourable if theargument is consistently carried out 
 cle true 
 ath but then if we admit suffering to be just and yetdishonourable and the term dishonourable is applied to not the just and the honourable disagree 
 cle what do you mean 
 ath a thing not difficult to understand the laws which have beenalready enacted would seem to announce principles directly opposedto what we are saying 
 cle to what 
 ath we had enacted if i am not mistaken that the robber oftemples and he who was the enemy of law and order might justly beput to death and we were proceeding to make divers other enactmentsof a similar nature but we stopped short because we saw that thesesufferings are infinite in number and degree and that they are atonce the most just and also the most dishonourable of all if this be true are not the just and the honourable at one timeall the same and at another time in the most diametrical opposition 
 cle such appears to be the case 
 ath in this discordant and inconsistent fashion does the languageof the many rend asunder the honourable and just 
 cle very true stranger 
 ath then now cleinias let us see how far we ourselves areconsistent about these matters 
 cle consistent in what 
 ath i think that i have clearly stated in the former part of thediscussion but if i did not let me now state 
 cle what 
 ath that all bad men are always involuntarily bad and from thismust proceed to draw a further inference 
 cle what is it 
 ath that the unjust man may be bad but that he is bad againsthis will now that an action which is voluntary should be doneinvoluntarily is a contradiction wherefore he who maintains thatinjustice is involuntary will deem that the unjust does injusticeinvoluntarily i too admit that all men do injustice if any contentious or disputatious person says that men are unjustagainst their will and yet that many do injustice willingly i do notagree with him but then how can i avoid being inconsistent withmyself if you cleinias and you megillus say to all this be as you say how about legislating for the city of we legislate or do you advise certainly wewill i should reply then will you determine for them what arevoluntary and what are involuntary crimes and shall we make thepunishments greater of voluntary errors and crimes and less for theinvoluntary or shall we make the punishment of all to be alike underthe idea that there is no such thing as voluntary crime 
 cle very good stranger and what shall we say in answer to theseobjections 
 ath that is a very fair question in the first place let us 
 cle do what 
 ath let us remember what has been well said by us already that ourideas of justice are in the highest degree confused and this in mind let us proceed to ask ourselves once morewhether we have discovered a way out of the difficulty have we everdetermined in what respect these two classes of actions differ fromone another for in all states and by all legislators kinds of actions have been one voluntary theother involuntary and they have legislated about them shall this new word of ours like an oracle of god be onlyspoken and get away without giving any explanation or verification ofitself how can a word not understood be the basis of before proceeding to legislate then we must prove thatthey are two and what is the difference between them that when weimpose the penalty upon either every one may understand our be able in some way to judge whether the penalty is fitly orunfitly inflicted 
 cle i agree with you stranger for one of two things is we must not say that all unjust acts are involuntary or wemust show the meaning and truth of this statement 
 ath of these two alternatives the one is quite speak what i believe to be the truth would be to me unlawful andunholy but if acts of injustice cannot be divided into voluntaryand involuntary i must endeavour to find some other distinctionbetween them 
 cle very true stranger there cannot be two opinions among us uponthat point 
 ath reflect then there are hurts of various kinds done by thecitizens to one another in the intercourse of life affordingplentiful examples both of the voluntary and involuntary 
 cle certainly 
 ath i would not have any one suppose that all these hurts areinjuries and that these injuries are of two voluntary andthe other involuntary for the involuntary hurts of all men are quiteas many and as great as the voluntary and please to considerwhether i am right or quite wrong in what i am going to say for ideny cleinias and megillus that he who harms another involuntarilydoes him an injury involuntarily nor should i legislate about such anact under the idea that i am legislating for an involuntary i should rather say that such a hurt whether great or small isnot an injury at all and on the other hand if i am right when abenefit is wrongly conferred the author of the benefit may often besaid to injure for i maintain o my friends that the mere givingor taking away of anything is not to be described either as just orunjust but the legislator has to consider whether mankind do goodor harm to one another out of a just principle and intention on thedistinction between injustice and hurt he must fix his eye and whenthere is hurt he must as far as he can make the hurt good by save that which is ruined and raise up that which is make that which is dead or wounded whole and when compensationhas been given for injustice the law must always seek to win over thedoers and sufferers of the several hurts from feelings of enmity tothose of friendship 
 cle very good 
 ath then as to unjust hurts and gains also supposing theinjustice to bring gain of these we may heal as many as arecapable of being healed regarding them as diseases of the soul andthe cure of injustice will take the following direction 
 cle what direction 
 ath when any one commits any injustice small or great the lawwill admonish and compel him either never at all to do the like never voluntarily or at any rate in a far less degree and he mustin addition pay for the hurt whether the end is to be attained byword or action with pleasure or pain by giving or taking awayprivileges by means of fines or gifts or in whatsoever way the lawshall proceed to make a man hate injustice and love or not hate thenature of the is quite the noblest work of law but if thelegislator sees any one who is incurable for him he will appoint alaw and a penalty he knows quite well that to such men themselvesthere is no profit in the continuance of their lives and that theywould do a double good to the rest of mankind if they would take theirdeparture inasmuch as they would be an example to other men not tooffend and they would relieve the city of bad citizens in suchcases and in such cases only the legislator ought to inflict deathas the punishment of offences 
 cle what you have said appears to me to be very reasonable butwill you favour me by stating a little more clearly the differencebetween hurt and injustice and the various complications of thevoluntary and involuntary which enter into them 
 ath i will endeavour to do as you the much would be generally said and allowed that one element in hernature is passion which may be described either as a state or apart of her and is hard to be striven against and contended with andby irrational force overturns many things 
 cle very true 
 ath and pleasure is not the same with passion but has anopposite power working her will by persuasion and by the force ofdeceit in all things 
 cle quite true 
 ath a man may truly say that ignorance is a third cause ofcrimes ignorance however may be conveniently divided by thelegislator into two sorts there is simple ignorance which is thesource of lighter offences and double ignorance which is accompaniedby a conceit of wisdom and he who is under the influence of thelatter fancies that he knows all about matters of which he knowsnothing this second kind of ignorance when possessed of power andstrength will be held by the legislator to be the source of great andmonstrous times but when attended with weakness will only resultin the errors of children and old men and these he will treat aserrors and will make laws accordingly for those who commit will be the mildest and most merciful of all laws 
 cle you are perfectly right 
 ath we all of us remark of one man that he is superior topleasure and passion and of another that he is inferior to this is true 
 cle certainly 
 ath but no one was ever yet heard to say that one of us is superiorand another inferior to ignorance 
 cle very true 
 ath we are speaking of motives which incite men to the fulfilmentof their will although an individual may be often drawn by them inopposite directions at the same time 
 cle yes often 
 ath and now i can define to you clearly and without i mean by the just and unjust according to my notion anger and fear and pleasure and pain and jealousies anddesires tyrannize over the soul whether they do any harm or all this injustice but when the opinion of the best in whateverpart of human nature states or individuals may suppose that todwell has dominion in the soul and orders the life of every man evenif it be sometimes mistaken yet what is done in accordance principle in individuals which obeys this rule and is best forthe whole life of man is to be called just although the hurt done bymistake is thought by many to be involuntary injustice leaving thequestion of names about which we are not going to quarrel and havingalready delineated three sources of error we may begin by recallingthem somewhat more vividly to our of them was of thepainful sort which we denominate anger and fear 
 cle quite right 
 ath there was a second consisting of pleasures and desires and athird of hopes which aimed at true opinion about the best the latterbeing subdivided into three we now get five sources of actions andfor these five we will make laws of two kinds 
 cle what are the two kinds 
 ath there is one kind of actions done by violence and in thelight of day and another kind of actions which are done in darknessand with secret deceit or sometimes both with violence and laws concerning these last ought to have a character of severity 
 cle naturally 
 ath and now let us return from this digression and complete thework of legislation laws have been already enacted by us concerningthe robbers of the gods and concerning traitors and alsoconcerning those who corrupt the laws for the purpose of subvertingthe government a man may very likely commit some of these in a state of madness or when affected by disease or under theinfluence of extreme old age or in a fit of childish no better than a child and if this be made evident to thejudges elected to try the cause on the appeal of the criminal orhis advocate and he be judged to have been in this state when hecommitted the offence he shall simply pay for the hurt which he mayhave done to another but he shall be exempt from other he have slain some one and have on his hands the stain ofblood and in that case he shall go to another land and country andthere dwell for a year and if he return before the expiration ofthe time which the law appoints or even set his foot at all on hisnative land he shall be bound by the guardians of the law in thepublic prison for two years and then go free 
 having begun to speak of homicide let us endeavour to lay down lawsconcerning every different kind of homicides and first of violent and involuntary homicides if any one in anathletic contest and at the public games involuntarily kills afriend and he dies either at the time or afterwards of the blowswhich he has received or if the like misfortune happens to any one inwar or military exercises or mimic contests of which themagistrates enjoin the practice whether with or without arms when hehas been purified according to the law brought from delphi relating tothese matters he shall be innocent and so in the case of their patient dies against their will they shall be held guiltlessby the law and if one slay another with his own hand butunintentionally whether he be unarmed or have some instrument or dartin his hand or if he kill him by administering food or drink or bythe application of fire or cold or by suffocating him whether hedo the deed by his own hand or by the agency of others he shall bedeemed the agent and shall suffer one of the he kill the slave of another in the belief that he ishis own he shall bear the master of the dead man harmless fromloss or shall pay a penalty of twice the value of the dead man whichthe judges shall assess but purifications must be used greater andmore numerous than for those who committed homicide at the are to be the interpreters whom the god appoints shall beauthorized to declare and if a man kills his own slave when he hasbeen purified according to laws he shall be quit of the if a man kills a freeman unintentionally he shall undergo thesame purification as he did who killed the slave but let him notforget also a tale of olden time which is to this whohas suffered a violent end when newly dead if he has had the soul ofa freeman in life is angry with the author of his death and beinghimself full of fear and panic by reason of his violent end when hesees his murderer walking about in his own accustomed haunts he isstricken with terror and becomes disordered and this disorder of by the guilty recollection of is communicated by him withoverwhelming force to the murderer and his deeds wherefore also themurderer must go out of the way of his victim for the entire period ofa year and not himself be found in any spot which was familiar to himthroughout the country and if the dead man be a stranger thehomicide shall be kept from the country of the stranger during alike period if any one voluntarily obeys this law the next of kin tothe deceased seeing all that has happened shall take pity on make peace with him and show him all gentleness but if any oneis disobedient either ventures to go to any of the temples andsacrifice unpurified or will not continue in exile during theappointed time the next of kin to the deceased shall proceedagainst him for murder and if he be convicted every part of hispunishment shall be doubled 
 and if the next of kin do not proceed against the perpetrator of thecrime then the pollution shall be deemed to fall upon his murdered man will fix the guilt upon his kinsman and he whohas a mind to proceed against him may compel him to be absent from hiscountry during five years according to law if a strangerunintentionally kill a stranger who is dwelling in the city he wholikes shall prosecute the cause according to the same rules if hebe a metic let him be absent for a year or if he be an entirestranger in addition to the purification whether he have slain astranger or a metic or a citizen he shall be banished for life fromthe country which is in possession of our laws and if he returncontrary to law let the guardians of the law punish him with let them hand over his property if he have any to him who isnext of kin to the sufferer and if he be wrecked and driven on thecoast against his will he shall take up his abode on the his feet in the sea and watching for an opportunity ofsailing but if he be brought by land and is not his own the magistrate whom he first comes across in the city release himand send him unharmed over the border 
 if any one slays a freeman with his own hand and the deed be done inpassion in the case of such actions we must begin by making adistinction for a deed is done from passion either when men without intention to kill cause the death of another by blows andthe like on a momentary impulse and are sorry for the deedimmediately afterwards or again when after having been insulted indeed or word men pursue revenge and kill a person intentionally andare not sorry for the act and therefore we must assume that thesehomicides are of two kinds both of them arising from passion whichmay be justly said to be in a mean between the voluntary andinvoluntary at the same time they are neither of them anythingmore than a likeness or shadow of either he who treasures up hisanger and avenges himself not immediately and at the moment butwith insidious design and after an interval is like the he who does not treasure up his anger and takes vengeance onthe instant and without malice prepense approaches to theinvoluntary and yet even he is not altogether involuntary but onlythe image or shadow of the involuntary wherefore about homicidescommitted in hot blood there is a difficulty in determining whetherin legislating we shall reckon them as voluntary or as partlyinvoluntary the best and truest view is to regard them respectivelyas likenesses only of the voluntary and involuntary and todistinguish them accordingly as they are done with or withoutpremeditation and we should make the penalties heavier for thosewho commit homicide with angry premeditation and lighter for thosewho do not premeditate but smite upon the instant for that whichis like a greater evil should be punished more severely and thatwhich is like a less evil should be punished less severely this shallbe the rule of our laws 
 cle certainly 
 ath let us any one slays a free man with his ownhand and the deed be done in a moment of anger and withoutpremeditation let the offender suffer in other respects as theinvoluntary homicide would have suffered and also undergo an exile oftwo years that he may learn to school his passions but he whoslays another from passion yet with premeditation shall in otherrespects suffer as the former and to this shall be added an exileof three instead of two punishment is to be longer becausehis passion is greater the manner of their return shall be on thiswise and here the law has difficulty in determining exactly forin some cases the murderer who is judged by the law to be the worsemay really be the less cruel and he who is judged the less cruelmay be really the worse and may have executed the murder in a moresavage manner whereas the other may have been gentler but in generalthe degrees of guilt will be such as we have described them of allthese things the guardians of the law must take ahomicide of either kind has completed his term of exile the guardiansshall send twelve judges to the borders of the land these duringthe interval shall have informed themselves of the actions of thecriminals and they shall judge respecting their pardon and the homicides shall abide by their judgment but if after theyhave returned home any one of them in a moment of anger repeats thedeed let him be an exile and return no more or if he returns lethim suffer as the stranger was to suffer in a similar case he whokills his own slave shall undergo a purification but if he killsthe slave of another in anger he shall pay twice the amount of theloss to his owner and if any homicide is disobedient to the without purification pollutes the agora or the games or thetemples he who pleases may bring to trial the next of kin to the deadman for permitting him and the murderer with him and may compelthe one to exact and the other to suffer a double amount of finesand purifications and the accuser shall himself receive the fine inaccordance with the law if a slave in a fit of passion kills hismaster the kindred of the deceased man may do with the only they do not spare his life whatever they please andthey will be pure or if he kills a freeman who is not his owner shall give up the slave to the relatives of the they shall be under an obligation to put him to death but thismay be done in any manner which they please 
 and if which is a rare occurrence but does sometimes happen afather or a mother in a moment of passion slays a son or daughter byblows or some other violence the slayer shall undergo the samepurification as in other cases and be exiled during three when the exile returns the wife shall separate from the the husband from the wife and they shall never afterwards begetchildren together or live under the same roof or partake of the samesacred rites with those whom they have deprived of a child or of abrother and he who is impious and disobedient in such a case shall bebrought to trial for impiety by any one who pleases if in a fit ofanger a husband kills his wedded wife or the wife her husband theslayer shall undergo the same purification and the term of exileshall be three years and when he who has committed any such crimereturns let him have no communication in sacred rites with hischildren neither let him sit at the same table with them and thefather or son who disobeys shall be liable to be brought to trialfor impiety by any one who pleases if a brother or a sister in afit of passion kills a brother or a sister they shall undergopurification and exile as was the case with parents who killedtheir offspring they shall not come under the same roof or sharein the sacred rites of those whom they have deprived of theirbrethren or of their children 
 and he who is disobedient shall be justly liable to the lawconcerning impiety which relates to these matters if any one is soviolent in his passion against his parents that in the madness of hisanger he dares to kill one of them if the murdered person beforedying freely forgives the murderer let him undergo the purificationwhich is assigned to those who have been guilty of involuntaryhomicide and do as they do and he shall be pure but if he be notacquitted the perpetrator of such a deed shall be amenable to shall be amenable to the extreme punishments for assault andimpiety and robbing of temples for he has robbed his parent of if a man could be slain more than once most justly would he whoin a fit of passion has slain father or mother undergo many can he whom alone of all men even in defence of his life andwhen about to suffer death at the hands of his parents no law willallow to kill his father or his mother who are the authors of hisbeing and whom the legislator will command to endure any extremityrather than do can he i say lawfully receive any otherpunishment let death then be the appointed punishment of him who in afit of passion slays his father or his mother but if brother killsbrother in a civil broil or under other like circumstances if theother has begun and he only defends himself let him be free fromguilt as he would be if he had slain an enemy and the same rule willapply if a citizen kill a citizen or a stranger a stranger or if astranger kill a citizen or a citizen a stranger in lethim be free from guilt in like manner and so in the case of a slavewho has killed a slave but if a slave have killed a freeman let him be subject to the same law as he who haskilled a father and let the law about the remission of penalties inthe case of parricide apply equally to every other remission wheneverany sufferer of his own accord remits the guilt of homicide toanother under the idea that his act was involuntary let theperpetrator of the deed undergo a purification and remain in exile fora year according to law 
 enough has been said of murders violent and involuntary andcommitted in passion we have now to speak of voluntary crimes donewith injustice of every kind and with premeditation through theinfluence of pleasures and desires and jealousies 
 cle very good 
 ath let us first speak as far as we are able of their variouskinds the greatest cause of them is lust which gets the mastery ofthe soul maddened by desire and this is most commonly found toexist where the passion reigns which is strongest and most prevalentamong mass of mankind i mean where the power of wealth breeds endlessdesires of acquisition originating in naturaldisposition and a miserable want of education of this want ofeducation the false praise of wealth which is bruited about bothamong hellenes and barbarians is the cause they deem that to be thefirst of goods which in reality is only the third and in this waythey wrong both posterity and themselves for nothing can be noblerand better than that the truth about wealth should be spoken in that riches are for the sake of the body as the bodyis for the sake of the soul they are good and wealth is intendedby nature to be for the sake of them and is therefore inferior tothem both and third in order of excellence this argument teachesus that he who would be happy ought not to seek to be rich orrather he should seek to be rich justly and temperately and thenthere would be no murders in states requiring to be purged away byother murders but now as i said at first avarice is the chiefestcause and source of the worst trials for voluntary homicide asecond cause is ambition this creates jealousies which aretroublesome companions above all to the jealous man himself and in aless degree to the chiefs of the state and a third cause iscowardly and unjust fear which has been the occasion of many a man is doing or has done something which he desires that no oneshould know him to be doing or to have done he will take the lifeof those who are likely to inform of such things if he have noother means of getting rid of them let this be said as a preludeconcerning crimes of violence in general and i must not omit tomention a tradition which is firmly believed by many and has beenreceived by them from those who are learned in the mysteries they saythat such deeds will be punished in the world below and also thatwhen the perpetrators return to this world they will pay the naturalpenalty which is due to the sufferer and end their lives in likemanner by the hand of another if he who is about to commit murderbelieves this and is made by the mere prelude to dread such apenalty there is no need to proceed with the proclamation of the if he will not listen let the following law be declared andregistered against him 
 whoever shall wrongfully and of design slay with his own hand any ofhis kinsmen shall in the first place be deprived of legal he shall not pollute the temples or the agora or the any other place of meeting whether he is forbidden of men ornot for the law which represents the whole state forbids him andalways is and will be in the attitude of forbidding him and if acousin or nearer relative of the deceased whether on the male orfemale side does not prosecute the homicide when he ought and havehim proclaimed an outlaw he shall in the first place be involved inthe pollution and incur the hatred of the gods even as the curseof the law stirs up the voices of men against him and in the secondplace he shall be liable to be prosecuted by any one who is willing toinflict retribution on behalf of the dead and he who would avenge amurder shall observe all the precautionary ceremonies of lavation andany others which the god commands in cases of this kind let himhave proclamation made and then go forth and compel the perpetratorto suffer the execution of justice according to the law now thelegislator may easily show that these things must be accomplished byprayers and sacrifices to certain gods who are concerned with theprevention of murders in states but who these gods are and whatshould be the true manner of instituting such trials with due regardto religion the guardians of the law aided by the the prophets and the god shall determine and when they havedetermined let them carry on the prosecution at law the cause shallhave the same judges who are appointed to decide in the case ofthose who plunder temples let him who is convicted be punished withdeath and let him not be buried in the country of the murdered this would be shameless as well as impious but if he fly and willnot stand his trial let him fly for ever or if he set foot anywhereon any part of the murdered country let any relation of thedeceased or any other citizen who may first happen to meet withhim kill him with impunity or bind and deliver him to those amongthe judges of the case who are magistrates that they may put him todeath and let the prosecutor demand surety of him whom he sureties sufficient in the opinion of the magistrates who trythe cause shall be provided by him and they shall undertake toproduce him at the trial but if he be unwilling or unable toprovide sureties then the magistrates shall take him and keep himin bonds and produce him at the day of trial 
 if a man do not commit a murder with his own hand but contrives thedeath of another and is the author of the deed in intention anddesign and he continues to dwell in the city having his soul notpure of the guilt of murder let him be tried in the same in what relates to the sureties and also if he be foundguilty his body after execution may have burial in his native in all other respects his case shall be as the former and whethera stranger shall kill a citizen or a citizen a stranger or a slave aslave there shall be no difference as touching murder by ownhand or by contrivance except in the matter of sureties and has been said shall be required of the actual murderer only andhe who brings the accusation shall bind them over at the time if aslave be convicted of slaying a freeman voluntarily either by his ownhand or by contrivance let the public executioner take him in thedirection of the sepulchre to a place whence he can see the tomb ofthe dead man and inflict upon him as many stripes as the person whocaught him orders and if he survive let him put him to death and ifany one kills a slave who has done no wrong because he is afraid thathe may inform of some base and evil deeds of his own or for anysimilar reason in such a case let him pay the penalty of murder ashe would have done if he had slain a citizen there are things aboutwhich it is terrible and unpleasant to legislate but impossible notto legislate if for example there should be murders of perpetrated by the hands of kinsmen or by their and purely malicious which most often happen and states and may perhaps occur even in acountry where a man would not expect to find them we must repeat oncemore the tale which we narrated a little while ago in the hope thathe who hears us will be the more disposed to abstain voluntarily onthese grounds from murders which are utterly abominable for the saying or whatever we ought to call it has been plainly set forthby priests of old they have pronounced that the justice whichguards and avenges the blood of kindred follows the law ofretaliation and ordains that he who has done any murderous act shouldof necessity suffer that which he has done he who has slain afather shall himself be slain at some time or other by his mother he shall of necessity take a nature and lose hislife at the hands of his offspring in after ages for where theblood of a family has been polluted there is no other can the pollution be washed out until the homicidal soul which thedeed has given life for life and has propitiated and laid to sleepthe wrath of the whole family these are the retributions of by such punishments men should be deterred but if they are notdeterred and any one should be incited by some fatality to deprivehis father or mother or brethren or children of life voluntarilyand of purpose for him the earthly lawgiver legislates shall be the same proclamations about outlawry andthere shall be the same sureties which have been enacted in the formercases but in his case if he be convicted the servants of the judgesand the magistrates shall slay him at an appointed place without thecity where three ways meet and there expose his body naked andeach of the magistrates on behalf of the whole city shall take a stoneand cast it upon the head of the dead man and so deliver the cityfrom pollution after that they shall bear him to the borders ofthe land and cast him forth unburied according to law and whatshall he suffer who slays him who of all men as they say is hisown best friend i mean the suicide who deprives himself byviolence of his appointed share of life not because the law of thestate requires him nor yet under the compulsion of some painful andinevitable misfortune which has come upon him nor because he hashad to suffer from irremediable and intolerable shame but who fromsloth or want of manliness imposes upon himself an unjust penalty forhim what ceremonies there are to be of purification and burial godknows and about these the next of kin should enquire of theinterpreters and of the laws thereto relating and do according totheir injunctions they who meet their death in this way shall beburied alone and none shall be laid by their side they shall beburied ingloriously in the borders of the twelve portions the land insuch places as are uncultivated and nameless and no column orinscription shall mark the place of their interment and if a beast ofburden or other animal cause the death of any one except in thecase of anything of that kind happening to a competitor in thepublic contests the kinsmen of the deceased shall prosecute theslayer for murder and the wardens of the country such and so manyas the kinsmen appoint shall try the cause and let the beast whencondemned be slain by them and let them cast it beyond the if any lifeless thing deprive a man of life except in the case ofa thunderbolt or other fatal dart sent from the a manis killed by lifeless objects falling upon him or by his fallingupon them the nearest of kin shall appoint the nearest neighbour tobe a judge and thereby acquit himself and the whole family ofguilt and he shall cast forth the guilty thing beyond the has been said about the animals 
 if a man is found dead and his murderer be unknown and after adiligent search cannot be detected there shall be the sameproclamation as in the previous cases and the same interdict on themurderer and having proceeded against him they shall proclaim in theagora by a herald that he who has slain such and such a person andhas been convicted of murder shall not set his foot in the at all in the country of the murdered man and if he appears andis discovered he shall die and be cast forth unburied beyond theborder let this one law then be laid down by us about murder and letcases of this sort be so regarded 
 and now let us say in what cases and under what circumstances themurderer is rightly free from a man catch a thief his house by night to steal and he take and kill him or if heslay a footpad in he shall be guiltless and any one whodoes violence to a free woman or a youth shall be slain with impunityby the injured person or by his or her father or brothers or sons ifa man find his wife suffering violence he may kill the be guiltless in the eye of the law or if a person kill another inwarding off death from his father or mother or children or brethren orwife who are doing no wrong he shall assuredly be guiltless 
 thus much as to the nurture and education of the living soul of which he can and without which if he unfortunately bewithout them he cannot live and also concerning are to be inflicted for violent deaths let thusmuch be enacted of the nurture and education of the body we havespoken before and next in order we have to speak of deeds ofviolence voluntary and involuntary which men do to one we will now distinguish as far as we are able according totheir nature and number and determine what will be the suitablepenalties of each and so assign to them their proper place in theseries of our enactments the poorest legislator will have nodifficulty in determining that wounds and mutilations arising out ofwounds should follow next in order after deaths let wounds be dividedas homicides were those which are involuntary andwhich are given in passion or from fear and those inflictedvoluntarily and with premeditation concerning all this we mustmake some such proclamation as the must havelaws and conform to them or their life would be as bad as that ofthe most savage beast and the reason of this is that no is able to know what is best for human society or able and willing to do what is best in the first is a difficulty in apprehending that the true art or politics isconcerned not with private but with public good for public goodbinds together states but private only distracts them and that boththe public and private good as well of individuals as of states isgreater when the state and not the individual is first the second place although a person knows in the abstract that thisis true yet if he be possessed of absolute and irresponsible will never remain firm in his principles or persist in regardingthe public good as primary in the state and the private good assecondary human nature will be always drawing him into avarice andselfishness avoiding pain and pursuing pleasure without any will bring these to the front obscuring the juster and so working darkness in his soul will at last fill with evilsboth him and the whole city for if a man were born so divinely giftedthat he could naturally apprehend the truth he would have no needof laws to rule over him for there is no law or order which isabove knowledge nor can mind without impiety be deemed thesubject or slave of any man but rather the lord of all i speak ofmind true and free and in harmony with nature but then there isno such mind anywhere or at least not much and therefore we mustchoose law and order which are second best these look at things asthey exist for the most part only and are unable to survey thewhole of them and therefore i have spoken as i have 
 and now we will determine what penalty he ought to pay or suffer whohas hurt or wounded another any one may easily imagine thequestions which have to be asked in all such did he whom or how or when for there are innumerable particulars ofthis sort which greatly vary from one another and to allow courtsof law to determine all these things or not to determine any of alike impossible there is one particular which they must determinein all question of fact and then again that thelegislator should not permit them to determine what punishment is tobe inflicted in any of these cases but should himself decide them small or great is next to impossible 
 cle then what is to be the inference 
 ath the inference is that some things should be left to courtsof law others the legislator must decide for himself 
 cle and what ought the legislator to decide and what ought he toleave to courts of law 
 ath i may reply that in a state in which the courts are bad andmute because the judges conceal their opinions and decide causesclandestinely or what is worse when they are disorderly and in a theatre clapping or hooting in turn this or that saythat then there is a very serious evil which affects the whole is the necessity of having to legislate for such where the necessity exists the legislator should only allowthem to ordain the penalties for the smallest offences if the statefor which he is legislating be of this character he must take mostmatters into his own hands and speak distinctly but when a statehas good courts and the judges are well trained and scrupulouslytested the determination of the penalties or punishments whichshall be inflicted on the guilty may fairly and with advantage be leftto them and we are not to be blamed for not legislating concerningall that large class of matters which judges far worse educated thanours would be able to determine assigning to each offence what is dueboth to the perpetrator and to the sufferer we believe those for whomwe are legislating to be best able to judge and therefore to them thegreater part may be left at the same time as i have often said weshould exhibit to the judges as we have done the outline and form ofthe punishments to be inflicted and then they will not transgress thejust rule that was an excellent practice which we observed which now that we are resuming the work of legislation may withadvantage be repeated by us 
 let the enactment about wounding be in the following has a purpose and intention to slay another who is not hisenemy and whom the law does not permit him to slay and he woundshim but is unable to kill him he who had the intent and haswounded him is not to be deserves no consideration butshould be regarded as a murderer and be tried for murder still havingrespect to the fortune which has in a manner favoured him and tothe providence which in pity to him and to the wounded man saved theone from a fatal blow and the other from an accursed fate a to this deity and in order not to opposehis such a case the law will remit the punishment of only compel the offender to emigrate to a neighbouring city forthe rest of his life where he shall remain in the enjoyment of allhis possessions but if he have injured the wounded man he shall makesuch compensation for the injury as the court deciding the cause shallassess and the same judges shall decide who would have decided if theman had died of his wounds and if a child intentionally wound hisparents or a servant his master death shall be the penalty and if abrother ora sister intentionally wound a brother or a sister and isfound guilty death shall be the penalty and if a husband wound awife or a wife a husband with intent to kill let him or her undergoperpetual exile if they have sons or daughters who are still guardians shall take care of their property and have charge ofthe children as orphans if their sons are grown up they shall beunder no obligation to support the exiled parent but they shallpossess the property themselves and if he who meets with such amisfortune has no children the kindred of the exiled man to thedegree of sons of cousins both on the male and female side shallmeet together and after taking counsel with the guardians of theand the priests shall appoint a th citizen to be the heir ofthe house considering and reasoning that no house of all the belongs to the inhabitant or to the whole family but is the publicand private property of the state now the state should seek to haveits houses as holy and happy as possible and if any one of the housesbe unfortunate and stained with impiety and the owner leave noposterity but dies unmarried or married and childless havingsuffered death as the penalty of murder or some other crimecommitted against the gods or against his of whichdeath is the penalty distinctly laid down in the law or if any of thecitizens be in perpetual exile and also childless that house shallfirst of all be purified and undergo expiation according to law andthen let the kinsmen of the house as we were just now saying and theguardians of the law meet and consider what family there is in thestate which is of the highest repute for virtue and also for goodfortune in which there are a number of sons from that family letthem take one and introduce him to the father and forefathers of thedead man as their son and for the sake of the omen let him becalled so that he may be the continuer of their family the keeper oftheir hearth and the minister of their sacred rites with betterfortune than his father had and when they have made thissupplication they shall make him heir according to law and theoffending person they shall leave nameless and childless andportionless when calamities such as these overtake him 
 now the boundaries of some things do not touch one another butthere is a borderland which comes in between preventing them fromtouching and we were saying that actions done from passion are ofthis nature and come in between the voluntary and involuntary if aperson be convicted of having inflicted wounds in a passion in thefirst place he shall pay twice the amount of the injury if thewound be curable or if incurable four times the amount of theinjury or if the wound be curable and at the same time cause greatand notable disgrace to the wounded person he shall pay fourfold andwhenever any one in wounding another injures not only the also the city and makes him incapable of defending his countryagainst the enemy he besides the other penalties shall pay apenalty for the loss which the state has incurred and the penaltyshall be that in addition to his own times of service he shall serveon behalf of the disabled person and shall take his place in war he refuse he shall be liable to be convicted by law of refusalto serve the compensation for the injury whether to be twofold orthreefold or fourfold shall be fixed by the judges who convict if in like manner a brother wounds a brother the parents andkindred of either sex including the children of cousins whether onthe male or female side shall meet and when they have judged thecause they shall entrust the assessment of damages to the parents asis natural and if the estimate be disputed then the kinsmen on themale side shall make the estimate or if they cannot they shallcommit the matter to the guardians of the law and when similarcharges of wounding are brought by children against their who are more than sixty years of age having children of theirown not adopted shall be required to decide and if any one isconvicted they shall determine whether he or she ought to die orsuffer some other punishment either greater than death or at anyrate not much less a kinsman of the offender shall not be allowed tojudge the cause not even if he be of the age which is prescribed bythe law if a slave in a fit of anger wound a freeman the owner ofthe slave shall give him up to the wounded man who may do as hepleases with him and if be not give him up he shall himself make goodthe injury and if any one says that the slave and the wounded man areconspiring together let him argue the point and if he is cast heshall pay for the wrong three times over but if he gains his freeman who conspired with the slave shall reliable to an actionfor kidnapping and if any one unintentionally wounds another he shallsimply pay for the harm for no legislator is able to controlchance in such a case the judges shall be the same as those who areappointed in the case of children suing their parents and theyshall estimate the amount of the injury 
 all the preceding injuries and every kind of assault are deeds ofviolence and every man woman or child ought to consider that theelder has the precedence of the younger in honour both among the godsand also among men who would live in security and happiness whereforeit is a foul thing and hateful to the gods to see an elder manassaulted by a younger in the city and it is reasonable that ayoung man when struck by an elder should lightly endure his up in store for himself a like honour when he is old letthis be the one shall reverence his elder in word and shall respect any one who is twenty years older than male or female regarding him or her as his father ormother and he shall abstain from laying hands on any one who is of anage to have been his father or his mother out of reverence to thegods who preside over birth similarly he shall keep his hands froma stranger whether he be an old inhabitant or newly arrived he shallnot venture to correct such an one by blows either as the aggressoror in if he thinks that some stranger has struck him outof wantonness or insolence and ought to be punished he shall takehim to the wardens of the city but let him not strike him that thestranger may be kept far away from the possibility of lifting up hishand against a citizen and let the wardens of the city take theoffender and examine him not forgetting their duty to the god ofstrangers and in case the stranger appears to have struck the citizenunjustly let them inflict upon him as many blows with the scourgeas he has himself inflicted and quell his presumption but if he beinnocent they shall threaten and rebuke the man who arrested him andlet them both go if a person strikes another of the same age orsomewhat older than himself who has no children whether he be an oldman who strikes an old man or a young man who strikes a young man letthe person struck defend himself in the natural way without a weaponand with his hands only he who being more than forty years of to fight with another whether he be the aggressor or in selfdefence shall be regarded as rude and will be a disgraceful punishment and therefore suitableto him the obedient nature will readily yield to such the disobedient who heeds not the prelude shall have the lawready for any man smite another who is older than by twenty or by more years in the first place he who is athand not being younger than the combatants nor their equal in separate them or be disgraced according to law but if he bethe equal in age of the person who is struck or younger he shalldefend the person injured as he would a brother or father or stillolder relative further let him who dares to smite an elder betried for assault as i have said and if he be found guilty lethim be imprisoned for a period of not less than a year or if thejudges approve of a longer period their decision shall be if a stranger or metic smite one who is older by twenty years ormore the same law shall hold about the bystanders assisting and hewho is found guilty in such a suit if he be a stranger but notresident shall be imprisoned during a period of two years and ametic who disobeys the laws shall be imprisoned for three the court assign him a longer term and let him who was presentin any of these cases and did not assist according to law be he be of the highest dass by paying a fine of a mina or if hebe of the second class of fifty drachmas or if of the third a fine of thirty drachmas or if he be of the fourth class by afine of twenty drachmas and the generals and taxiarchs andphylarchs and hipparchs shall form the court in such cases 
 laws are partly framed for the sake of good men in order toinstruct them how they thay live on friendly terms with one partly for the sake of those who refuse to be instructed whosespirit cannot be subdued or softened or hindered from plunginginto evil these are the persons who cause the word to be spoken whichi am about to utter for them the legislator legislates ofnecessity and in the hope that there may be no need of his laws hewho shall dare to lay violent hands upon his father or mother orany still older relative having no fear either of the wrath of thegods above or of the punishments that are spoken of in the worldbelow but transgresses in contempt of ancient and universaltraditions as though he were too wise to believe in them requiressome extreme measure of prevention now death is not the worst thatcan happen to men far worse are the punishments which are said topursue them in the world below but although they are most true work on such souls no prevention for if they had any effectthere would be no slayers of mothers or impious hands lifted upagainst parents and therefore the punishments of this world which areinflicted during life ought not in such cases to fall short ifpossible of the terrors of the world below let our enactment then beas a man dare to strike his father or his mother or theirfathers or mothers he being at the time of sound mind then let anyone who is at hand come to the rescue as has been already said andthe metic or stranger who comes to the rescue shall be called to thefirst place in the games but if he do not come he shall suffer thepunishment of perpetual exile he who is not a metic if he comes tothe rescue shall have praise and if he do not come blame and ifa slave come to the rescue let him be made free but if he do notcome the rescue let him receive strokes of the whip by orderof the wardens of the agora if the occurrence take place in theagora or if somewhere in the city beyond the limits of the agora anywarden of the city is in residence shall punish him or if in thecountry then the commanders of the wardens of the country if thosewho are near at the time be inhabitants of the same place whetherthey be youths or men or women let them come to the rescue anddenounce him as the impious one and he who does not come to therescue shall fall under the curse of zeus the god of kindred and ofancestors according to law and if any one is found guilty ofassaulting a parent let him in the first place be for ever banishedfrom the city into the country and let him abstain from thetemples and if he do not abstain the wardens of the country shallpunish him with blows or in any way which they please and if hereturn he shall be put to death and if any freeman eat or drink orhave any other sort of intercourse with him or only meeting himhave voluntarily touched him he shall not enter into any into the agora nor into the city until he is purified for heshould consider that he has become tainted by a curse and if hedisobeys the law and pollutes the city and the temples contrary tolaw and one of the magistrates sees him and does not indict him whenhe gives in his account this omission shall be a most serious charge 
 if a slave strike a freeman whether a stranger or a citizen letany one who is present come to the rescue or pay the penaltyalready mentioned and let the bystanders bind him and deliver him upto the injured person and he receiving him shall put him in inflict on him as many stripes as he pleases but havingpunished him he must surrender him to his master according to law andnot deprive him of his property let the law be as who strikes a freeman not at the command of the owner shall receive bound from the man whom he has stricken andnot release him until the slave has persuaded the man whom he hasstricken that he ought to be released and let there be the samelaws about women in relation to women about men and women in relationto one another

 book ix 
 
 next to all the matters which have preceded in the natural orderof legislation will come suits of law of suits those which relateto agriculture have been already described but the more importanthave not been described having mentioned them severally under theirusual names we will proceed to say what punishments are to beinflicted for each offence and who are to be the judges of them 
 cleinias very good 
 athenian stranger there is a sense of disgrace in legislating aswe are about to do for all the details of crime in a state we say is to be well regulated and will be perfectly adapted tothe practice of virtue to assume that in such a state there willarise some one who will be guilty of crimes as heinous as any whichare ever perpetrated in other states and that we must legislate forhim by anticipation and threaten and make laws against him if heshould arise in order to deter him and punish his acts under theidea that he will as i was saying is in a mannerdisgraceful yet seeing that we are not like the ancientlegislators who gave laws to heroes and sons of gods to the popular belief themselves the offspring of the legislating for others who were also the children of divineparents but that we are only men who are legislating for the sonsof men there is no uncharitableness in apprehending that some oneof our citizens may be like a seed which has touched the a heart so hard that it cannot be softened any more thanthose seeds can be softened by fire among our citizens there may bethose who cannot be subdued by all the strength of the laws and fortheir sake though an ungracious task i will proclaim my first lawabout the robbing of temples in case any one should dare to commitsuch a crime i do not expect or imagine that any will ever take the infection but their servants andstrangers and strangers servants may be guilty of many with a view to them especially and yet not without a providenteye to the weakness of human nature generally i will proclaim the lawabout robbers of temples and similar incurable or almost having already agreed that such enactments ought alwaysto have a short prelude we may speak to the criminal whom sometormenting desire by night and by day tempts to go and rob a fewest possible words of admonition and sir wewill say to him the impulse which moves you to rob temples is notan ordinary human malady nor yet a visitation of heaven but amadness which is begotten in a man from ancient and unexpiatedcrimes of his race an this you mustguard with all your might and how you are to guard we will explain toyou when any such thought comes into your mind go and performexpiations go as a suppliant to the temples of the gods who avertevils go to the society of those who are called good men among them tell and yourself try to repeat after them that every manshould honour the noble and the just fly from the company of and turn not back and if your disorder is lightened bythese remedies well and good but if not then acknowledge death tobe nobler than life and depart hence 
 such are the preludes which we sing to all who have thoughts ofunholy and treasonable actions and to him who hearkens to them thelaw has nothing to say but to him who is disobedient when the preludeis over cry with a loud who is taken in the act ofrobbing temples if he be a slave or stranger shall have his evildeed engraven on his face and hands and shall be beaten with asmany stripes as may seem good to the judges and be cast nakedbeyond the borders of the land and if he suffers this punishment hewill probably return to his right mind and be improved for no penaltywhich the law inflicts is designed for evil but always makes himwho suffers either better or not so much worse as he would havebeen but if any citizen be found guilty of any great or unmentionablewrong either in relation to the gods or his parents or the the judge deem him to be incurable remembering that afterreceiving such an excellent education and training from youthupward he has not abstained from the greatest of crimes hispunishment shall be death which to him will be the least of his example will benefit others if he perish ingloriously and becast beyond the borders of the land but let his children andfamily if they avoid the ways of their father have glory and lethonourable mention be made of them as having nobly and manfullyescaped out of evil into good none of them should have their goodsconfiscated to the state for the lots of the citizens ought always tocontinue the same and equal 
 touching the exaction of penalties when a man appears to havedone anything which deserves a fine he shall pay the fine if he haveanything in excess of the lot which is assigned to him but morethan that he shall not pay and to secure exactness let the guardiansof the law refer to the registers and inform the judges of theprecise truth in order that none of the lots may go uncultivatedfor want of money but if any one seems to deserve a greaterpenalty let him undergo a long and public imprisonment and bedishonoured unless some of his friends are willing to be surety forhim and liberate him by assisting him to pay the fine no criminalshall go unpunished not even for a single offence nor if he havefled the country but let the penalty be according to or bonds or blows or degrading places of sitting orstanding or removal to some temple on the borders of the land or lethim pay fines as we said before in cases of death let the judges bethe guardians of the law and a court selected by merit from thelast magistrates but how the causes are to be brought intoto court how the summonses are to be served the like these thingsmay be left to the younger generation of legislators to determine themanner of voting we must determine ourselves 
 let the vote be given openly but before they come to the vote letthe judges sit in order of seniority over against plaintiff anddefendant and let all the citizens who can spare time hear and take aserious interest in listening to such causes first of all theplaintiff shall make one speech and then the defendant shall makeanother and after the speeches have been made the eldest judgeshall begin to examine the parties and proceed to make an adequateenquiry into what has been said and after the oldest has rest shall proceed in order to examine either party as to whathe finds defective in the evidence whether of statement oromission and he who has nothing to ask shall hand over theexamination to another and on so much of what has been said as isto the purpose all the judges shall set their seals and place thewritings on the altar of hestia on the next day they shall meetagain and in like manner put their questions and go through thecause and again set their seals upon the evidence and when they havethree times done this and have had witnesses and evidence shall each of them give a holy vote after promising by hestiathat they will decide justly and truly to the utmost of their so they shall put an end to the suit 
 next after what relates to the gods follows what relates to thedissolution of the by promoting a man to power enslavesthe laws and subjects the city to factions using violence andstirring up sedition contrary to law him we will deem the greatestenemy of the whole state but he who takes no part in suchproceedings and being one of the chief magistrates of the state hasno knowledge of the treason or having knowledge of it by reasonof cowardice does not interfere on behalf of his country such anone we must consider nearly as bad every man who is worth anythingwill inform the magistrates and bring the conspirator to trial formaking a violent and illegal attempt to change the government thejudges of such cases shall be the same as of the robbers of let the whole proceeding be carried on in the same way and thevote of the majority condemn to death but let there be a generalrule that the disgrace and punishment of the father is not to bevisited on the children except in the case of some one whosefather grandfather and have successively undergonethe penalty of death such persons the city shall send away with alltheir possessions to the city and country of their only and wholly their appointed lot and out of the citizenswho have more than one son of not less than ten years of age theyshall select ten whom their father or grandfather by the side shall appoint and let them send to delphi the namesof those who are selected and him whom the god chooses they shallestablish as heir of the house which has failed and may he havebetter fortune than his predecessors

 ath once more let there be a third general law respecting thejudges who are to give judgment and the manner of conducting suitsagainst those who are tried on an accusation of treason and asconcerning the remaining or departure of their shallbe one law for all three for the traitor and the robber oftemples and the subverter by violence of the laws of the state for athief whether he steal much or little let there be one law andone punishment for all alike in the first place let him pay doublethe amount of the theft if he be convicted and if he have so muchover and above the he have not he shall be bounduntil he pay the penalty or persuade him has obtained the sentenceagainst him to forgive him but if a person be convicted of a theftagainst the state then if he can persuade the city or if he will payback twice the amount of the theft he shall be set free from hisbonds 
 cle what makes you say stranger that a theft is all the thief may have taken much or little and either fromsacred or secular these are not the only differences then that they are of many kinds ought not thelegislator to adapt himself to them and impose upon them entirelydifferent penalties 
 ath excellent i was running on too fast cleinias and youimpinged upon me and brought me to my senses reminding me of had occurred to mind already that legislation was never yetrightly worked out as i may say in you remember the imagein which i likened the men for whom laws are now made to slaves whoare doctored by slaves for of this you may be very sure that ifone of those empirical physicians who practise medicine withoutscience were to come upon the gentleman physician talking to hisgentleman patient and using the language almost of at the beginning of the disease and discoursing about thewhole nature of the body he would burst into a hearty say what most of those who are called doctors always have attheir fellow he would say you are nothealing the sick man but you are educating him and he does notwant to be made a doctor but to get well 
 cle and would he not be right 
 ath perhaps he would and he might remark upon us that he whodiscourses about laws as we are now doing is giving the citizenseducation and not laws that would be rather a telling observation 
 cle very true 
 ath but we are fortunate 
 cle in what way 
 ath inasmuch as we are not compelled to give laws but we maytake into consideration every form of government and ascertain whatis best and what is most needful and how they may both be carriedinto execution and we may also if we please at this very momentchoose what is best or if we prefer what is most we do 
 cle there is something ridiculous stranger in our proposing suchan alternative as if we were legislators simply bound under somegreat necessity which cannot be deferred to the morrow but we as imay by grace of heaven affirm like gatherers of stones orbeginners of some composite work may gather a heap of out of this at our leisure select what is suitable for ourprojected construction let us then suppose ourselves to be atleisure not of necessity building but rather like men who are partlyproviding materials and partly putting them together and we maytruly say that some of our laws like stones are already fixed intheir places and others lie at hand 
 ath certainly in that case cleinias our view of law will be morein accordance with nature for there is another matter affectinglegislators which i must earnestly entreat you to consider 
 cle what is it 
 ath there are many writings to be found in cities and among themthere are composed by legislators as well as by other persons 
 cle to be sure 
 ath shall we give heed rather to the writings of those the like who either in metre or out of metre have recordedtheir advice about the conduct of life and not to the writings oflegislators or shall we give heed to them above all 
 cle yes to them far above all others 
 ath and ought the legislator alone among writers to withhold hisopinion about the beautiful the good and the just and not toteach what they are and how they are to be pursued by those whointend to be happy 
 cle certainly not 
 ath and is it disgraceful for homer and tyrtaeus and other poets tolay down evil precepts in their writings respecting life and thepursuits of men but not so disgraceful for lycurgus and solon andothers who were legislators as well as writers is it not true that ofall the writings to be found in cities those which relate to you unfold and read them ought to be by far the noblest andthe best and should not other writings either agree with them orif they disagree be deemed ridiculous we should consider whether thelaws of states ought not to have the character of loving and wiseparents rather than of tyrants and masters who command and after writing their decrees on walls go their ways and discoursing of laws we should not take the gentler view of themwhich may or may not be any rate we will show ourreadiness to entertain such a view and be prepared to undergowhatever may be the result and may the result be good and if godbe gracious it will be good 
 cle excellent let us do as you say 
 ath then we will now consider accurately as we proposed whatrelates to robbers of temples and all kinds of thefts and offencesin general and we must not be annoyed if in the course oflegislation we have enacted some things and have not made up ourminds about some others for as yet we are not legislators but we maysoon be let us if you please consider these matters 
 cle by all means 
 ath concerning all things honourable and just let us thenendeavour to ascertain how far we are consistent with ourselves andhow far we are inconsistent and how far the many from whom at anyrate we should profess a desire to differ agree and disagree amongthemselves 
 cle what are the inconsistencies which you observe in us 
 ath i will endeavour to explain if i am not mistaken we are allagreed that justice and just men and things and actions are allfair and if a person were to maintain that just men even whenthey are deformed in body are still perfectly beautiful in respect ofthe excellent justice of their minds no one would say that therewas any inconsistency in this 
 cle they would be quite right 
 ath perhaps but let us consider further that if all thingswhich are just are fair and honourable in the term all we mustinclude just sufferings which are the correlatives of just actions 
 cle and what is the inference 
 ath the inference is that a just action in partaking of the justpartakes also in the same degree of the fair and honourable 
 cle certainly 
 ath and must not a suffering which partakes of the just principlebe admitted to be in the same degree fair and honourable if theargument is consistently carried out 
 cle true 
 ath but then if we admit suffering to be just and yetdishonourable and the term dishonourable is applied to not the just and the honourable disagree 
 cle what do you mean 
 ath a thing not difficult to understand the laws which have beenalready enacted would seem to announce principles directly opposedto what we are saying 
 cle to what 
 ath we had enacted if i am not mistaken that the robber oftemples and he who was the enemy of law and order might justly beput to death and we were proceeding to make divers other enactmentsof a similar nature but we stopped short because we saw that thesesufferings are infinite in number and degree and that they are atonce the most just and also the most dishonourable of all if this be true are not the just and the honourable at one timeall the same and at another time in the most diametrical opposition 
 cle such appears to be the case 
 ath in this discordant and inconsistent fashion does the languageof the many rend asunder the honourable and just 
 cle very true stranger 
 ath then now cleinias let us see how far we ourselves areconsistent about these matters 
 cle consistent in what 
 ath i think that i have clearly stated in the former part of thediscussion but if i did not let me now state 
 cle what 
 ath that all bad men are always involuntarily bad and from thismust proceed to draw a further inference 
 cle what is it 
 ath that the unjust man may be bad but that he is bad againsthis will now that an action which is voluntary should be doneinvoluntarily is a contradiction wherefore he who maintains thatinjustice is involuntary will deem that the unjust does injusticeinvoluntarily i too admit that all men do injustice if any contentious or disputatious person says that men are unjustagainst their will and yet that many do injustice willingly i do notagree with him but then how can i avoid being inconsistent withmyself if you cleinias and you megillus say to all this be as you say how about legislating for the city of we legislate or do you advise certainly wewill i should reply then will you determine for them what arevoluntary and what are involuntary crimes and shall we make thepunishments greater of voluntary errors and crimes and less for theinvoluntary or shall we make the punishment of all to be alike underthe idea that there is no such thing as voluntary crime 
 cle very good stranger and what shall we say in answer to theseobjections 
 ath that is a very fair question in the first place let us 
 cle do what 
 ath let us remember what has been well said by us already that ourideas of justice are in the highest degree confused and this in mind let us proceed to ask ourselves once morewhether we have discovered a way out of the difficulty have we everdetermined in what respect these two classes of actions differ fromone another for in all states and by all legislators kinds of actions have been one voluntary theother involuntary and they have legislated about them shall this new word of ours like an oracle of god be onlyspoken and get away without giving any explanation or verification ofitself how can a word not understood be the basis of before proceeding to legislate then we must prove thatthey are two and what is the difference between them that when weimpose the penalty upon either every one may understand our be able in some way to judge whether the penalty is fitly orunfitly inflicted 
 cle i agree with you stranger for one of two things is we must not say that all unjust acts are involuntary or wemust show the meaning and truth of this statement 
 ath of these two alternatives the one is quite speak what i believe to be the truth would be to me unlawful andunholy but if acts of injustice cannot be divided into voluntaryand involuntary i must endeavour to find some other distinctionbetween them 
 cle very true stranger there cannot be two opinions among us uponthat point 
 ath reflect then there are hurts of various kinds done by thecitizens to one another in the intercourse of life affordingplentiful examples both of the voluntary and involuntary 
 cle certainly 
 ath i would not have any one suppose that all these hurts areinjuries and that these injuries are of two voluntary andthe other involuntary for the involuntary hurts of all men are quiteas many and as great as the voluntary and please to considerwhether i am right or quite wrong in what i am going to say for ideny cleinias and megillus that he who harms another involuntarilydoes him an injury involuntarily nor should i legislate about such anact under the idea that i am legislating for an involuntary i should rather say that such a hurt whether great or small isnot an injury at all and on the other hand if i am right when abenefit is wrongly conferred the author of the benefit may often besaid to injure for i maintain o my friends that the mere givingor taking away of anything is not to be described either as just orunjust but the legislator has to consider whether mankind do goodor harm to one another out of a just principle and intention on thedistinction between injustice and hurt he must fix his eye and whenthere is hurt he must as far as he can make the hurt good by save that which is ruined and raise up that which is make that which is dead or wounded whole and when compensationhas been given for injustice the law must always seek to win over thedoers and sufferers of the several hurts from feelings of enmity tothose of friendship 
 cle very good 
 ath then as to unjust hurts and gains also supposing theinjustice to bring gain of these we may heal as many as arecapable of being healed regarding them as diseases of the soul andthe cure of injustice will take the following direction 
 cle what direction 
 ath when any one commits any injustice small or great the lawwill admonish and compel him either never at all to do the like never voluntarily or at any rate in a far less degree and he mustin addition pay for the hurt whether the end is to be attained byword or action with pleasure or pain by giving or taking awayprivileges by means of fines or gifts or in whatsoever way the lawshall proceed to make a man hate injustice and love or not hate thenature of the is quite the noblest work of law but if thelegislator sees any one who is incurable for him he will appoint alaw and a penalty he knows quite well that to such men themselvesthere is no profit in the continuance of their lives and that theywould do a double good to the rest of mankind if they would take theirdeparture inasmuch as they would be an example to other men not tooffend and they would relieve the city of bad citizens in suchcases and in such cases only the legislator ought to inflict deathas the punishment of offences 
 cle what you have said appears to me to be very reasonable butwill you favour me by stating a little more clearly the differencebetween hurt and injustice and the various complications of thevoluntary and involuntary which enter into them 
 ath i will endeavour to do as you the much would be generally said and allowed that one element in hernature is passion which may be described either as a state or apart of her and is hard to be striven against and contended with andby irrational force overturns many things 
 cle very true 
 ath and pleasure is not the same with passion but has anopposite power working her will by persuasion and by the force ofdeceit in all things 
 cle quite true 
 ath a man may truly say that ignorance is a third cause ofcrimes ignorance however may be conveniently divided by thelegislator into two sorts there is simple ignorance which is thesource of lighter offences and double ignorance which is accompaniedby a conceit of wisdom and he who is under the influence of thelatter fancies that he knows all about matters of which he knowsnothing this second kind of ignorance when possessed of power andstrength will be held by the legislator to be the source of great andmonstrous times but when attended with weakness will only resultin the errors of children and old men and these he will treat aserrors and will make laws accordingly for those who commit will be the mildest and most merciful of all laws 
 cle you are perfectly right 
 ath we all of us remark of one man that he is superior topleasure and passion and of another that he is inferior to this is true 
 cle certainly 
 ath but no one was ever yet heard to say that one of us is superiorand another inferior to ignorance 
 cle very true 
 ath we are speaking of motives which incite men to the fulfilmentof their will although an individual may be often drawn by them inopposite directions at the same time 
 cle yes often 
 ath and now i can define to you clearly and without i mean by the just and unjust according to my notion anger and fear and pleasure and pain and jealousies anddesires tyrannize over the soul whether they do any harm or all this injustice but when the opinion of the best in whateverpart of human nature states or individuals may suppose that todwell has dominion in the soul and orders the life of every man evenif it be sometimes mistaken yet what is done in accordance principle in individuals which obeys this rule and is best forthe whole life of man is to be called just although the hurt done bymistake is thought by many to be involuntary injustice leaving thequestion of names about which we are not going to quarrel and havingalready delineated three sources of error we may begin by recallingthem somewhat more vividly to our of them was of thepainful sort which we denominate anger and fear 
 cle quite right 
 ath there was a second consisting of pleasures and desires and athird of hopes which aimed at true opinion about the best the latterbeing subdivided into three we now get five sources of actions andfor these five we will make laws of two kinds 
 cle what are the two kinds 
 ath there is one kind of actions done by violence and in thelight of day and another kind of actions which are done in darknessand with secret deceit or sometimes both with violence and laws concerning these last ought to have a character of severity 
 cle naturally 
 ath and now let us return from this digression and complete thework of legislation laws have been already enacted by us concerningthe robbers of the gods and concerning traitors and alsoconcerning those who corrupt the laws for the purpose of subvertingthe government a man may very likely commit some of these in a state of madness or when affected by disease or under theinfluence of extreme old age or in a fit of childish no better than a child and if this be made evident to thejudges elected to try the cause on the appeal of the criminal orhis advocate and he be judged to have been in this state when hecommitted the offence he shall simply pay for the hurt which he mayhave done to another but he shall be exempt from other he have slain some one and have on his hands the stain ofblood and in that case he shall go to another land and country andthere dwell for a year and if he return before the expiration ofthe time which the law appoints or even set his foot at all on hisnative land he shall be bound by the guardians of the law in thepublic prison for two years and then go free 
 having begun to speak of homicide let us endeavour to lay down lawsconcerning every different kind of homicides and first of violent and involuntary homicides if any one in anathletic contest and at the public games involuntarily kills afriend and he dies either at the time or afterwards of the blowswhich he has received or if the like misfortune happens to any one inwar or military exercises or mimic contests of which themagistrates enjoin the practice whether with or without arms when hehas been purified according to the law brought from delphi relating tothese matters he shall be innocent and so in the case of their patient dies against their will they shall be held guiltlessby the law and if one slay another with his own hand butunintentionally whether he be unarmed or have some instrument or dartin his hand or if he kill him by administering food or drink or bythe application of fire or cold or by suffocating him whether hedo the deed by his own hand or by the agency of others he shall bedeemed the agent and shall suffer one of the he kill the slave of another in the belief that he ishis own he shall bear the master of the dead man harmless fromloss or shall pay a penalty of twice the value of the dead man whichthe judges shall assess but purifications must be used greater andmore numerous than for those who committed homicide at the are to be the interpreters whom the god appoints shall beauthorized to declare and if a man kills his own slave when he hasbeen purified according to laws he shall be quit of the if a man kills a freeman unintentionally he shall undergo thesame purification as he did who killed the slave but let him notforget also a tale of olden time which is to this whohas suffered a violent end when newly dead if he has had the soul ofa freeman in life is angry with the author of his death and beinghimself full of fear and panic by reason of his violent end when hesees his murderer walking about in his own accustomed haunts he isstricken with terror and becomes disordered and this disorder of by the guilty recollection of is communicated by him withoverwhelming force to the murderer and his deeds wherefore also themurderer must go out of the way of his victim for the entire period ofa year and not himself be found in any spot which was familiar to himthroughout the country and if the dead man be a stranger thehomicide shall be kept from the country of the stranger during alike period if any one voluntarily obeys this law the next of kin tothe deceased seeing all that has happened shall take pity on make peace with him and show him all gentleness but if any oneis disobedient either ventures to go to any of the temples andsacrifice unpurified or will not continue in exile during theappointed time the next of kin to the deceased shall proceedagainst him for murder and if he be convicted every part of hispunishment shall be doubled 
 and if the next of kin do not proceed against the perpetrator of thecrime then the pollution shall be deemed to fall upon his murdered man will fix the guilt upon his kinsman and he whohas a mind to proceed against him may compel him to be absent from hiscountry during five years according to law if a strangerunintentionally kill a stranger who is dwelling in the city he wholikes shall prosecute the cause according to the same rules if hebe a metic let him be absent for a year or if he be an entirestranger in addition to the purification whether he have slain astranger or a metic or a citizen he shall be banished for life fromthe country which is in possession of our laws and if he returncontrary to law let the guardians of the law punish him with let them hand over his property if he have any to him who isnext of kin to the sufferer and if he be wrecked and driven on thecoast against his will he shall take up his abode on the his feet in the sea and watching for an opportunity ofsailing but if he be brought by land and is not his own the magistrate whom he first comes across in the city release himand send him unharmed over the border 
 if any one slays a freeman with his own hand and the deed be done inpassion in the case of such actions we must begin by making adistinction for a deed is done from passion either when men without intention to kill cause the death of another by blows andthe like on a momentary impulse and are sorry for the deedimmediately afterwards or again when after having been insulted indeed or word men pursue revenge and kill a person intentionally andare not sorry for the act and therefore we must assume that thesehomicides are of two kinds both of them arising from passion whichmay be justly said to be in a mean between the voluntary andinvoluntary at the same time they are neither of them anythingmore than a likeness or shadow of either he who treasures up hisanger and avenges himself not immediately and at the moment butwith insidious design and after an interval is like the he who does not treasure up his anger and takes vengeance onthe instant and without malice prepense approaches to theinvoluntary and yet even he is not altogether involuntary but onlythe image or shadow of the involuntary wherefore about homicidescommitted in hot blood there is a difficulty in determining whetherin legislating we shall reckon them as voluntary or as partlyinvoluntary the best and truest view is to regard them respectivelyas likenesses only of the voluntary and involuntary and todistinguish them accordingly as they are done with or withoutpremeditation and we should make the penalties heavier for thosewho commit homicide with angry premeditation and lighter for thosewho do not premeditate but smite upon the instant for that whichis like a greater evil should be punished more severely and thatwhich is like a less evil should be punished less severely this shallbe the rule of our laws 
 cle certainly 
 ath let us any one slays a free man with his ownhand and the deed be done in a moment of anger and withoutpremeditation let the offender suffer in other respects as theinvoluntary homicide would have suffered and also undergo an exile oftwo years that he may learn to school his passions but he whoslays another from passion yet with premeditation shall in otherrespects suffer as the former and to this shall be added an exileof three instead of two punishment is to be longer becausehis passion is greater the manner of their return shall be on thiswise and here the law has difficulty in determining exactly forin some cases the murderer who is judged by the law to be the worsemay really be the less cruel and he who is judged the less cruelmay be really the worse and may have executed the murder in a moresavage manner whereas the other may have been gentler but in generalthe degrees of guilt will be such as we have described them of allthese things the guardians of the law must take ahomicide of either kind has completed his term of exile the guardiansshall send twelve judges to the borders of the land these duringthe interval shall have informed themselves of the actions of thecriminals and they shall judge respecting their pardon and the homicides shall abide by their judgment but if after theyhave returned home any one of them in a moment of anger repeats thedeed let him be an exile and return no more or if he returns lethim suffer as the stranger was to suffer in a similar case he whokills his own slave shall undergo a purification but if he killsthe slave of another in anger he shall pay twice the amount of theloss to his owner and if any homicide is disobedient to the without purification pollutes the agora or the games or thetemples he who pleases may bring to trial the next of kin to the deadman for permitting him and the murderer with him and may compelthe one to exact and the other to suffer a double amount of finesand purifications and the accuser shall himself receive the fine inaccordance with the law if a slave in a fit of passion kills hismaster the kindred of the deceased man may do with the only they do not spare his life whatever they please andthey will be pure or if he kills a freeman who is not his owner shall give up the slave to the relatives of the they shall be under an obligation to put him to death but thismay be done in any manner which they please 
 and if which is a rare occurrence but does sometimes happen afather or a mother in a moment of passion slays a son or daughter byblows or some other violence the slayer shall undergo the samepurification as in other cases and be exiled during three when the exile returns the wife shall separate from the the husband from the wife and they shall never afterwards begetchildren together or live under the same roof or partake of the samesacred rites with those whom they have deprived of a child or of abrother and he who is impious and disobedient in such a case shall bebrought to trial for impiety by any one who pleases if in a fit ofanger a husband kills his wedded wife or the wife her husband theslayer shall undergo the same purification and the term of exileshall be three years and when he who has committed any such crimereturns let him have no communication in sacred rites with hischildren neither let him sit at the same table with them and thefather or son who disobeys shall be liable to be brought to trialfor impiety by any one who pleases if a brother or a sister in afit of passion kills a brother or a sister they shall undergopurification and exile as was the case with parents who killedtheir offspring they shall not come under the same roof or sharein the sacred rites of those whom they have deprived of theirbrethren or of their children 
 and he who is disobedient shall be justly liable to the lawconcerning impiety which relates to these matters if any one is soviolent in his passion against his parents that in the madness of hisanger he dares to kill one of them if the murdered person beforedying freely forgives the murderer let him undergo the purificationwhich is assigned to those who have been guilty of involuntaryhomicide and do as they do and he shall be pure but if he be notacquitted the perpetrator of such a deed shall be amenable to shall be amenable to the extreme punishments for assault andimpiety and robbing of temples for he has robbed his parent of if a man could be slain more than once most justly would he whoin a fit of passion has slain father or mother undergo many can he whom alone of all men even in defence of his life andwhen about to suffer death at the hands of his parents no law willallow to kill his father or his mother who are the authors of hisbeing and whom the legislator will command to endure any extremityrather than do can he i say lawfully receive any otherpunishment let death then be the appointed punishment of him who in afit of passion slays his father or his mother but if brother killsbrother in a civil broil or under other like circumstances if theother has begun and he only defends himself let him be free fromguilt as he would be if he had slain an enemy and the same rule willapply if a citizen kill a citizen or a stranger a stranger or if astranger kill a citizen or a citizen a stranger in lethim be free from guilt in like manner and so in the case of a slavewho has killed a slave but if a slave have killed a freeman let him be subject to the same law as he who haskilled a father and let the law about the remission of penalties inthe case of parricide apply equally to every other remission wheneverany sufferer of his own accord remits the guilt of homicide toanother under the idea that his act was involuntary let theperpetrator of the deed undergo a purification and remain in exile fora year according to law 
 enough has been said of murders violent and involuntary andcommitted in passion we have now to speak of voluntary crimes donewith injustice of every kind and with premeditation through theinfluence of pleasures and desires and jealousies 
 cle very good 
 ath let us first speak as far as we are able of their variouskinds the greatest cause of them is lust which gets the mastery ofthe soul maddened by desire and this is most commonly found toexist where the passion reigns which is strongest and most prevalentamong mass of mankind i mean where the power of wealth breeds endlessdesires of acquisition originating in naturaldisposition and a miserable want of education of this want ofeducation the false praise of wealth which is bruited about bothamong hellenes and barbarians is the cause they deem that to be thefirst of goods which in reality is only the third and in this waythey wrong both posterity and themselves for nothing can be noblerand better than that the truth about wealth should be spoken in that riches are for the sake of the body as the bodyis for the sake of the soul they are good and wealth is intendedby nature to be for the sake of them and is therefore inferior tothem both and third in order of excellence this argument teachesus that he who would be happy ought not to seek to be rich orrather he should seek to be rich justly and temperately and thenthere would be no murders in states requiring to be purged away byother murders but now as i said at first avarice is the chiefestcause and source of the worst trials for voluntary homicide asecond cause is ambition this creates jealousies which aretroublesome companions above all to the jealous man himself and in aless degree to the chiefs of the state and a third cause iscowardly and unjust fear which has been the occasion of many a man is doing or has done something which he desires that no oneshould know him to be doing or to have done he will take the lifeof those who are likely to inform of such things if he have noother means of getting rid of them let this be said as a preludeconcerning crimes of violence in general and i must not omit tomention a tradition which is firmly believed by many and has beenreceived by them from those who are learned in the mysteries they saythat such deeds will be punished in the world below and also thatwhen the perpetrators return to this world they will pay the naturalpenalty which is due to the sufferer and end their lives in likemanner by the hand of another if he who is about to commit murderbelieves this and is made by the mere prelude to dread such apenalty there is no need to proceed with the proclamation of the if he will not listen let the following law be declared andregistered against him 
 whoever shall wrongfully and of design slay with his own hand any ofhis kinsmen shall in the first place be deprived of legal he shall not pollute the temples or the agora or the any other place of meeting whether he is forbidden of men ornot for the law which represents the whole state forbids him andalways is and will be in the attitude of forbidding him and if acousin or nearer relative of the deceased whether on the male orfemale side does not prosecute the homicide when he ought and havehim proclaimed an outlaw he shall in the first place be involved inthe pollution and incur the hatred of the gods even as the curseof the law stirs up the voices of men against him and in the secondplace he shall be liable to be prosecuted by any one who is willing toinflict retribution on behalf of the dead and he who would avenge amurder shall observe all the precautionary ceremonies of lavation andany others which the god commands in cases of this kind let himhave proclamation made and then go forth and compel the perpetratorto suffer the execution of justice according to the law now thelegislator may easily show that these things must be accomplished byprayers and sacrifices to certain gods who are concerned with theprevention of murders in states but who these gods are and whatshould be the true manner of instituting such trials with due regardto religion the guardians of the law aided by the the prophets and the god shall determine and when they havedetermined let them carry on the prosecution at law the cause shallhave the same judges who are appointed to decide in the case ofthose who plunder temples let him who is convicted be punished withdeath and let him not be buried in the country of the murdered this would be shameless as well as impious but if he fly and willnot stand his trial let him fly for ever or if he set foot anywhereon any part of the murdered country let any relation of thedeceased or any other citizen who may first happen to meet withhim kill him with impunity or bind and deliver him to those amongthe judges of the case who are magistrates that they may put him todeath and let the prosecutor demand surety of him whom he sureties sufficient in the opinion of the magistrates who trythe cause shall be provided by him and they shall undertake toproduce him at the trial but if he be unwilling or unable toprovide sureties then the magistrates shall take him and keep himin bonds and produce him at the day of trial 
 if a man do not commit a murder with his own hand but contrives thedeath of another and is the author of the deed in intention anddesign and he continues to dwell in the city having his soul notpure of the guilt of murder let him be tried in the same in what relates to the sureties and also if he be foundguilty his body after execution may have burial in his native in all other respects his case shall be as the former and whethera stranger shall kill a citizen or a citizen a stranger or a slave aslave there shall be no difference as touching murder by ownhand or by contrivance except in the matter of sureties and has been said shall be required of the actual murderer only andhe who brings the accusation shall bind them over at the time if aslave be convicted of slaying a freeman voluntarily either by his ownhand or by contrivance let the public executioner take him in thedirection of the sepulchre to a place whence he can see the tomb ofthe dead man and inflict upon him as many stripes as the person whocaught him orders and if he survive let him put him to death and ifany one kills a slave who has done no wrong because he is afraid thathe may inform of some base and evil deeds of his own or for anysimilar reason in such a case let him pay the penalty of murder ashe would have done if he had slain a citizen there are things aboutwhich it is terrible and unpleasant to legislate but impossible notto legislate if for example there should be murders of perpetrated by the hands of kinsmen or by their and purely malicious which most often happen and states and may perhaps occur even in acountry where a man would not expect to find them we must repeat oncemore the tale which we narrated a little while ago in the hope thathe who hears us will be the more disposed to abstain voluntarily onthese grounds from murders which are utterly abominable for the saying or whatever we ought to call it has been plainly set forthby priests of old they have pronounced that the justice whichguards and avenges the blood of kindred follows the law ofretaliation and ordains that he who has done any murderous act shouldof necessity suffer that which he has done he who has slain afather shall himself be slain at some time or other by his mother he shall of necessity take a nature and lose hislife at the hands of his offspring in after ages for where theblood of a family has been polluted there is no other can the pollution be washed out until the homicidal soul which thedeed has given life for life and has propitiated and laid to sleepthe wrath of the whole family these are the retributions of by such punishments men should be deterred but if they are notdeterred and any one should be incited by some fatality to deprivehis father or mother or brethren or children of life voluntarilyand of purpose for him the earthly lawgiver legislates shall be the same proclamations about outlawry andthere shall be the same sureties which have been enacted in the formercases but in his case if he be convicted the servants of the judgesand the magistrates shall slay him at an appointed place without thecity where three ways meet and there expose his body naked andeach of the magistrates on behalf of the whole city shall take a stoneand cast it upon the head of the dead man and so deliver the cityfrom pollution after that they shall bear him to the borders ofthe land and cast him forth unburied according to law and whatshall he suffer who slays him who of all men as they say is hisown best friend i mean the suicide who deprives himself byviolence of his appointed share of life not because the law of thestate requires him nor yet under the compulsion of some painful andinevitable misfortune which has come upon him nor because he hashad to suffer from irremediable and intolerable shame but who fromsloth or want of manliness imposes upon himself an unjust penalty forhim what ceremonies there are to be of purification and burial godknows and about these the next of kin should enquire of theinterpreters and of the laws thereto relating and do according totheir injunctions they who meet their death in this way shall beburied alone and none shall be laid by their side they shall beburied ingloriously in the borders of the twelve portions the land insuch places as are uncultivated and nameless and no column orinscription shall mark the place of their interment and if a beast ofburden or other animal cause the death of any one except in thecase of anything of that kind happening to a competitor in thepublic contests the kinsmen of the deceased shall prosecute theslayer for murder and the wardens of the country such and so manyas the kinsmen appoint shall try the cause and let the beast whencondemned be slain by them and let them cast it beyond the if any lifeless thing deprive a man of life except in the case ofa thunderbolt or other fatal dart sent from the a manis killed by lifeless objects falling upon him or by his fallingupon them the nearest of kin shall appoint the nearest neighbour tobe a judge and thereby acquit himself and the whole family ofguilt and he shall cast forth the guilty thing beyond the has been said about the animals 
 if a man is found dead and his murderer be unknown and after adiligent search cannot be detected there shall be the sameproclamation as in the previous cases and the same interdict on themurderer and having proceeded against him they shall proclaim in theagora by a herald that he who has slain such and such a person andhas been convicted of murder shall not set his foot in the at all in the country of the murdered man and if he appears andis discovered he shall die and be cast forth unburied beyond theborder let this one law then be laid down by us about murder and letcases of this sort be so regarded 
 and now let us say in what cases and under what circumstances themurderer is rightly free from a man catch a thief his house by night to steal and he take and kill him or if heslay a footpad in he shall be guiltless and any one whodoes violence to a free woman or a youth shall be slain with impunityby the injured person or by his or her father or brothers or sons ifa man find his wife suffering violence he may kill the be guiltless in the eye of the law or if a person kill another inwarding off death from his father or mother or children or brethren orwife who are doing no wrong he shall assuredly be guiltless 
 thus much as to the nurture and education of the living soul of which he can and without which if he unfortunately bewithout them he cannot live and also concerning are to be inflicted for violent deaths let thusmuch be enacted of the nurture and education of the body we havespoken before and next in order we have to speak of deeds ofviolence voluntary and involuntary which men do to one we will now distinguish as far as we are able according totheir nature and number and determine what will be the suitablepenalties of each and so assign to them their proper place in theseries of our enactments the poorest legislator will have nodifficulty in determining that wounds and mutilations arising out ofwounds should follow next in order after deaths let wounds be dividedas homicides were those which are involuntary andwhich are given in passion or from fear and those inflictedvoluntarily and with premeditation concerning all this we mustmake some such proclamation as the must havelaws and conform to them or their life would be as bad as that ofthe most savage beast and the reason of this is that no is able to know what is best for human society or able and willing to do what is best in the first is a difficulty in apprehending that the true art or politics isconcerned not with private but with public good for public goodbinds together states but private only distracts them and that boththe public and private good as well of individuals as of states isgreater when the state and not the individual is first the second place although a person knows in the abstract that thisis true yet if he be possessed of absolute and irresponsible will never remain firm in his principles or persist in regardingthe public good as primary in the state and the private good assecondary human nature will be always drawing him into avarice andselfishness avoiding pain and pursuing pleasure without any will bring these to the front obscuring the juster and so working darkness in his soul will at last fill with evilsboth him and the whole city for if a man were born so divinely giftedthat he could naturally apprehend the truth he would have no needof laws to rule over him for there is no law or order which isabove knowledge nor can mind without impiety be deemed thesubject or slave of any man but rather the lord of all i speak ofmind true and free and in harmony with nature but then there isno such mind anywhere or at least not much and therefore we mustchoose law and order which are second best these look at things asthey exist for the most part only and are unable to survey thewhole of them and therefore i have spoken as i have 
 and now we will determine what penalty he ought to pay or suffer whohas hurt or wounded another any one may easily imagine thequestions which have to be asked in all such did he whom or how or when for there are innumerable particulars ofthis sort which greatly vary from one another and to allow courtsof law to determine all these things or not to determine any of alike impossible there is one particular which they must determinein all question of fact and then again that thelegislator should not permit them to determine what punishment is tobe inflicted in any of these cases but should himself decide them small or great is next to impossible 
 cle then what is to be the inference 
 ath the inference is that some things should be left to courtsof law others the legislator must decide for himself 
 cle and what ought the legislator to decide and what ought he toleave to courts of law 
 ath i may reply that in a state in which the courts are bad andmute because the judges conceal their opinions and decide causesclandestinely or what is worse when they are disorderly and in a theatre clapping or hooting in turn this or that saythat then there is a very serious evil which affects the whole is the necessity of having to legislate for such where the necessity exists the legislator should only allowthem to ordain the penalties for the smallest offences if the statefor which he is legislating be of this character he must take mostmatters into his own hands and speak distinctly but when a statehas good courts and the judges are well trained and scrupulouslytested the determination of the penalties or punishments whichshall be inflicted on the guilty may fairly and with advantage be leftto them and we are not to be blamed for not legislating concerningall that large class of matters which judges far worse educated thanours would be able to determine assigning to each offence what is dueboth to the perpetrator and to the sufferer we believe those for whomwe are legislating to be best able to judge and therefore to them thegreater part may be left at the same time as i have often said weshould exhibit to the judges as we have done the outline and form ofthe punishments to be inflicted and then they will not transgress thejust rule that was an excellent practice which we observed which now that we are resuming the work of legislation may withadvantage be repeated by us 
 let the enactment about wounding be in the following has a purpose and intention to slay another who is not hisenemy and whom the law does not permit him to slay and he woundshim but is unable to kill him he who had the intent and haswounded him is not to be deserves no consideration butshould be regarded as a murderer and be tried for murder still havingrespect to the fortune which has in a manner favoured him and tothe providence which in pity to him and to the wounded man saved theone from a fatal blow and the other from an accursed fate a to this deity and in order not to opposehis such a case the law will remit the punishment of only compel the offender to emigrate to a neighbouring city forthe rest of his life where he shall remain in the enjoyment of allhis possessions but if he have injured the wounded man he shall makesuch compensation for the injury as the court deciding the cause shallassess and the same judges shall decide who would have decided if theman had died of his wounds and if a child intentionally wound hisparents or a servant his master death shall be the penalty and if abrother ora sister intentionally wound a brother or a sister and isfound guilty death shall be the penalty and if a husband wound awife or a wife a husband with intent to kill let him or her undergoperpetual exile if they have sons or daughters who are still guardians shall take care of their property and have charge ofthe children as orphans if their sons are grown up they shall beunder no obligation to support the exiled parent but they shallpossess the property themselves and if he who meets with such amisfortune has no children the kindred of the exiled man to thedegree of sons of cousins both on the male and female side shallmeet together and after taking counsel with the guardians of theand the priests shall appoint a th citizen to be the heir ofthe house considering and reasoning that no house of all the belongs to the inhabitant or to the whole family but is the publicand private property of the state now the state should seek to haveits houses as holy and happy as possible and if any one of the housesbe unfortunate and stained with impiety and the owner leave noposterity but dies unmarried or married and childless havingsuffered death as the penalty of murder or some other crimecommitted against the gods or against his of whichdeath is the penalty distinctly laid down in the law or if any of thecitizens be in perpetual exile and also childless that house shallfirst of all be purified and undergo expiation according to law andthen let the kinsmen of the house as we were just now saying and theguardians of the law meet and consider what family there is in thestate which is of the highest repute for virtue and also for goodfortune in which there are a number of sons from that family letthem take one and introduce him to the father and forefathers of thedead man as their son and for the sake of the omen let him becalled so that he may be the continuer of their family the keeper oftheir hearth and the minister of their sacred rites with betterfortune than his father had and when they have made thissupplication they shall make him heir according to law and theoffending person they shall leave nameless and childless andportionless when calamities such as these overtake him 
 now the boundaries of some things do not touch one another butthere is a borderland which comes in between preventing them fromtouching and we were saying that actions done from passion are ofthis nature and come in between the voluntary and involuntary if aperson be convicted of having inflicted wounds in a passion in thefirst place he shall pay twice the amount of the injury if thewound be curable or if incurable four times the amount of theinjury or if the wound be curable and at the same time cause greatand notable disgrace to the wounded person he shall pay fourfold andwhenever any one in wounding another injures not only the also the city and makes him incapable of defending his countryagainst the enemy he besides the other penalties shall pay apenalty for the loss which the state has incurred and the penaltyshall be that in addition to his own times of service he shall serveon behalf of the disabled person and shall take his place in war he refuse he shall be liable to be convicted by law of refusalto serve the compensation for the injury whether to be twofold orthreefold or fourfold shall be fixed by the judges who convict if in like manner a brother wounds a brother the parents andkindred of either sex including the children of cousins whether onthe male or female side shall meet and when they have judged thecause they shall entrust the assessment of damages to the parents asis natural and if the estimate be disputed then the kinsmen on themale side shall make the estimate or if they cannot they shallcommit the matter to the guardians of the law and when similarcharges of wounding are brought by children against their who are more than sixty years of age having children of theirown not adopted shall be required to decide and if any one isconvicted they shall determine whether he or she ought to die orsuffer some other punishment either greater than death or at anyrate not much less a kinsman of the offender shall not be allowed tojudge the cause not even if he be of the age which is prescribed bythe law if a slave in a fit of anger wound a freeman the owner ofthe slave shall give him up to the wounded man who may do as hepleases with him and if be not give him up he shall himself make goodthe injury and if any one says that the slave and the wounded man areconspiring together let him argue the point and if he is cast heshall pay for the wrong three times over but if he gains his freeman who conspired with the slave shall reliable to an actionfor kidnapping and if any one unintentionally wounds another he shallsimply pay for the harm for no legislator is able to controlchance in such a case the judges shall be the same as those who areappointed in the case of children suing their parents and theyshall estimate the amount of the injury 
 all the preceding injuries and every kind of assault are deeds ofviolence and every man woman or child ought to consider that theelder has the precedence of the younger in honour both among the godsand also among men who would live in security and happiness whereforeit is a foul thing and hateful to the gods to see an elder manassaulted by a younger in the city and it is reasonable that ayoung man when struck by an elder should lightly endure his up in store for himself a like honour when he is old letthis be the one shall reverence his elder in word and shall respect any one who is twenty years older than male or female regarding him or her as his father ormother and he shall abstain from laying hands on any one who is of anage to have been his father or his mother out of reverence to thegods who preside over birth similarly he shall keep his hands froma stranger whether he be an old inhabitant or newly arrived he shallnot venture to correct such an one by blows either as the aggressoror in if he thinks that some stranger has struck him outof wantonness or insolence and ought to be punished he shall takehim to the wardens of the city but let him not strike him that thestranger may be kept far away from the possibility of lifting up hishand against a citizen and let the wardens of the city take theoffender and examine him not forgetting their duty to the god ofstrangers and in case the stranger appears to have struck the citizenunjustly let them inflict upon him as many blows with the scourgeas he has himself inflicted and quell his presumption but if he beinnocent they shall threaten and rebuke the man who arrested him andlet them both go if a person strikes another of the same age orsomewhat older than himself who has no children whether he be an oldman who strikes an old man or a young man who strikes a young man letthe person struck defend himself in the natural way without a weaponand with his hands only he who being more than forty years of to fight with another whether he be the aggressor or in selfdefence shall be regarded as rude and will be a disgraceful punishment and therefore suitableto him the obedient nature will readily yield to such the disobedient who heeds not the prelude shall have the lawready for any man smite another who is older than by twenty or by more years in the first place he who is athand not being younger than the combatants nor their equal in separate them or be disgraced according to law but if he bethe equal in age of the person who is struck or younger he shalldefend the person injured as he would a brother or father or stillolder relative further let him who dares to smite an elder betried for assault as i have said and if he be found guilty lethim be imprisoned for a period of not less than a year or if thejudges approve of a longer period their decision shall be if a stranger or metic smite one who is older by twenty years ormore the same law shall hold about the bystanders assisting and hewho is found guilty in such a suit if he be a stranger but notresident shall be imprisoned during a period of two years and ametic who disobeys the laws shall be imprisoned for three the court assign him a longer term and let him who was presentin any of these cases and did not assist according to law be he be of the highest dass by paying a fine of a mina or if hebe of the second class of fifty drachmas or if of the third a fine of thirty drachmas or if he be of the fourth class by afine of twenty drachmas and the generals and taxiarchs andphylarchs and hipparchs shall form the court in such cases 
 laws are partly framed for the sake of good men in order toinstruct them how they thay live on friendly terms with one partly for the sake of those who refuse to be instructed whosespirit cannot be subdued or softened or hindered from plunginginto evil these are the persons who cause the word to be spoken whichi am about to utter for them the legislator legislates ofnecessity and in the hope that there may be no need of his laws hewho shall dare to lay violent hands upon his father or mother orany still older relative having no fear either of the wrath of thegods above or of the punishments that are spoken of in the worldbelow but transgresses in contempt of ancient and universaltraditions as though he were too wise to believe in them requiressome extreme measure of prevention now death is not the worst thatcan happen to men far worse are the punishments which are said topursue them in the world below but although they are most true work on such souls no prevention for if they had any effectthere would be no slayers of mothers or impious hands lifted upagainst parents and therefore the punishments of this world which areinflicted during life ought not in such cases to fall short ifpossible of the terrors of the world below let our enactment then beas a man dare to strike his father or his mother or theirfathers or mothers he being at the time of sound mind then let anyone who is at hand come to the rescue as has been already said andthe metic or stranger who comes to the rescue shall be called to thefirst place in the games but if he do not come he shall suffer thepunishment of perpetual exile he who is not a metic if he comes tothe rescue shall have praise and if he do not come blame and ifa slave come to the rescue let him be made free but if he do notcome the rescue let him receive strokes of the whip by orderof the wardens of the agora if the occurrence take place in theagora or if somewhere in the city beyond the limits of the agora anywarden of the city is in residence shall punish him or if in thecountry then the commanders of the wardens of the country if thosewho are near at the time be inhabitants of the same place whetherthey be youths or men or women let them come to the rescue anddenounce him as the impious one and he who does not come to therescue shall fall under the curse of zeus the god of kindred and ofancestors according to law and if any one is found guilty ofassaulting a parent let him in the first place be for ever banishedfrom the city into the country and let him abstain from thetemples and if he do not abstain the wardens of the country shallpunish him with blows or in any way which they please and if hereturn he shall be put to death and if any freeman eat or drink orhave any other sort of intercourse with him or only meeting himhave voluntarily touched him he shall not enter into any into the agora nor into the city until he is purified for heshould consider that he has become tainted by a curse and if hedisobeys the law and pollutes the city and the temples contrary tolaw and one of the magistrates sees him and does not indict him whenhe gives in his account this omission shall be a most serious charge 
 if a slave strike a freeman whether a stranger or a citizen letany one who is present come to the rescue or pay the penaltyalready mentioned and let the bystanders bind him and deliver him upto the injured person and he receiving him shall put him in inflict on him as many stripes as he pleases but havingpunished him he must surrender him to his master according to law andnot deprive him of his property let the law be as who strikes a freeman not at the command of the owner shall receive bound from the man whom he has stricken andnot release him until the slave has persuaded the man whom he hasstricken that he ought to be released and let there be the samelaws about women in relation to women about men and women in relationto one another

 book x 
 
 and now having spoken of assaults let us sum up all acts ofviolence under a single law which shall be as one shalltake or carry away any of his goods neither shall heuse anything which is his without the consent of theowner for these are the offences which are and have been and willever be the source of all the aforesaid evils the greatest of themare excesses and insolences of youth and are offences against thegreatest when they are done against religion and especially greatwhen in violation of public and holy rites or of the in which tribes and phratries share and in the second degreegreat when they are committed against private rites and in the third degree not to repeat the acts formerly insults are offered to parents the fourth kind of violence iswhen any one regardless of the authority of the rulers takes orcarries away or makes use of anything which belongs to them nothaving their consent and the fifth kind is when the violation ofthe civil rights of an individual demands reparation there shouldbe a common law embracing all these cases for we have already said ingeneral terms what shall be the punishment of sacrilege whetherfraudulent or violent and now we have to determine what is to bethe punishment of those who speak or act insolently toward the first we must give them an admonition which may be in thefollowing one who in obedience to the laws believed thatthere were gods ever intentionally did any unholy act or uttered anyunlawful word but he who did must have supposed one of that they did not is the first secondly that if they did they took no care of man orthirdly that they were easily appeased and turned aside from theirpurpose by sacrifices and prayers 
 cleinias what shall we say or do to these persons 
 athenian stranger my good friend let us first hear the jests whichi suspect that they in their superiority will utter against us 
 cle what jests 
 ath they will make some irreverent speech of this of athens and sparta and cnosus they will reply inthat you speak truly for some of us deny the very existence of thegods while others as you say are of opinion that they do not careabout us and others that they are turned from their course bygifts now we have a right to claim as you yourself allowed in thematter of laws that before you are hard upon us and threaten should argue with us and convince should first attempt toteach and persuade us that there are gods by reasonable evidences andalso that they are too good to be unrighteous or to be turned from their course by gifts for when we hear such thingssaid of them by those who are esteemed to be the best of poets andorators and prophets and priests and by innumerable others thethoughts of most of us are not set upon abstaining from unrighteousacts but upon doing them and atoning for them when lawgivers professthat they are gentle and not stern we think that they should first ofall use persuasion to us and show us the existence of gods if not ina better manner than other men at any rate in a truer and whoknows but that we shall hearken to you if then our request is afair one please to accept our challenge 
 cle but is there any difficulty in proving the existence of thegods 
 ath how would you prove it 
 cle how in the first place the earth and the sun and the starsand the universe and the fair order of the seasons and thedivision of them into years and months furnish proofs of theirexistence and also there is the fact that all hellenes and barbariansbelieve in them 
 ath i fear my sweet friend though i will not say that i muchregard the contempt with which the profane will be likely to assailus for you do not understand the nature of their complaint and youfancy that they rush into impiety only from a love of sensualpleasure 
 cle why stranger what other reason is there 
 ath one which you who live in a different atmosphere would neverguess 
 cle what is it 
 ath a very grievous sort of ignorance which is imagined to be thegreatest wisdom 
 cle what do you mean 
 ath at athens there are tales preserved in writing which the virtueof your state as i am informed refuses to admit they speak of thegods in prose as well as verse and the oldest of them tell of theorigin of the heavens and of the world and not far from the beginningof their story they proceed to narrate the birth of the gods andhow after they were born they behaved to one another whether thesestories have in other ways a good or a bad influence i should notlike to be severe upon them because they are ancient but looking atthem with reference to the duties of children to their parents icannot praise them or think that they are useful or at all the words of the ancients i have nothing more to say and ishould wish to say of them only what is pleasing to the gods but asto our younger generation and their wisdom i cannot let them off whenthey do mischief for do but mark the effect of their words whenyou and i argue for the existence of the gods and produce the stars and earth claiming for them a divine being if wewould listen to the aforesaid philosophers we should say that they areearth and stones only which can have no care at all of human that all religion is a cooking up of words and a 
 cle one such teacher o stranger would be bad enough and youimply that there are many of them which is worse 
 ath well then what shall we say or we assume thatsome one is accusing us among unholy men who are trying to escapefrom the effect of our legislation and that they say of that you should legislate on the supposition that there aregods shall we make a defence of ourselves or shall we leave them andreturn to our laws lest the prelude should become longer than thelaw for the discourse will certainly extend to great length if weare to treat the impiously disposed as they desire partlydemonstrating to them at some length the things of which they demandan explanation partly making them afraid or dissatisfied and thenproceed to the requisite enactments 
 cle yes stranger but then how often have we repeated already thaton the present occasion there is no reason why brevity should bepreferred to length who is at our the saying goes and itwould be paltry and ridiculous to prefer the shorter to the better itis a matter of no small consequence in some way or other to provethat there are gods and that they are good and regard justice morethan men do the demonstration of this would be the best and noblestprelude of all our laws and therefore without impatience andwithout hurry let us unreservedly consider the whole up all the power of persuasion which we possess 
 ath seeing you thus in earnest i would fain offer up a prayer thati may i must proceed at once who can be calm when heis called upon to prove the existence of the gods who can avoidhating and abhorring the men who are and have been the cause of thisargument i speak of those who will not believe the tales which theyhave heard as babes and sucklings from their mothers and by them both in jest and earnest like charms who havealso heard them in the sacrificial prayers and seen sightsaccompanying and sounds delightful to theirparents during the sacrifices showing an intense earnestness on behalfof their children and of themselves and with eager interest talkingto the gods and beseeching them as though they were firmly convincedof their existence who likewise see and hear the prostrations andinvocations which are made by hellenes and barbarians at the risingand setting of the sun and moon in all the vicissitudes of as if they thought that there were no gods but as if therecould be no doubt of their existence and no suspicion of when men knowing all these things despise them onno real grounds as would be admitted by all who have any particleof intelligence and when they force us to say what we are now can any one in gentle terms remonstrate with the like of he has to begin by proving to them the very existence of thegods yet the attempt must be made for it would be unseemly thatone half of mankind should go mad in their lust of pleasure and theother half in their indignation at such persons our address tothese lost and perverted natures should not be spoken in us suppose ourselves to select some one of them and gently reasonwith him smothering our my son we will say to him youare young and the advance of time will make you reverse may of theopinions which you now hold wait awhile and do not attempt tojudge at present of the highest things and that is the highest ofwhich you now think know the gods rightly and to liveaccordingly and in the first place let me indicate to you one pointwhich is of great importance and about which i cannot and your friends are not the first who have held thisopinion about the gods there have always been persons more or lessnumerous who have had the same disorder i have known many of can tell you that no one who had taken up in youth thisopinion that the gods do not exist ever continued in the sameuntil he was old the two other notions certainly do continue insome cases but not in many the notion i mean that the godsexist but take no heed of human things and the other notion thatthey do take heed of them but are easily propitiated withsacrifices and prayers as to the opinion about the gods which maysome day become clear to you i advise you go wait and consider ifit be true or not ask of others and above all of the the meantime take care that you do not offend against the gods forthe duty of the legislator is and always will be to teach you thetruth of these matters 
 cle our address stranger thus far is excellent 
 ath quite true megillus and cleinias but i am afraid that we haveunconsciously lighted on a strange doctrine 
 cle what doctrine do you mean 
 ath the wisest of all doctrines in the opinion of many 
 cle i wish that you would speak plainer 
 ath the doctrine that all things do become have become and willbecome some by nature some by art and some by chance 
 cle is not that true 
 ath well philosophers are probably right at any rate we may aswell follow in their track and examine what is the meaning of themand their disciples 
 cle by all means 
 ath they say that the greatest and fairest things are the work ofnature and of chance the lesser of art which receiving fromnature the greater and primeval creations moulds and fashions allthose lesser works which are generally termed artificial 
 cle how is that 
 ath i will explain my meaning still more clearly they say thatfire and water and earth and air all exist by nature and chance andnone of them by art and that as to the bodies which come next and sun and moon and have been created bymeans of these absolutely inanimate existences the elements areseverally moved by chance and some inherent force according to certainaffinities among hot with cold or of dry with moist or ofsoft with hard and according to all the other accidental admixturesof opposites which have been formed by necessity after this fashionand in this manner the whole heaven has been created and all thatis in the heaven as well as animals and all plants and all theseasons come from these elements not by the action of mind as theysay or of any god or from art but as i was saying by nature andchance only art sprang up afterwards and out of these mortal andof mortal birth and produced in play certain images and verypartial imitations of the truth having an affinity to one as music and painting create and their companion arts andthere are other arts which have a serious purpose and with nature such for example as medicine and gymnastic and they say that politics cooperate with nature butin a less degree and have more of art also that legislation isentirely a work of art and is based on assumptions which are nottrue 
 cle how do you mean 
 ath in the first place my dear friend these people would say thatthe gods exist not by nature but by art and by the laws of are different in different places according to the agreement ofthose who make them and that the honourable is one thing by natureand another thing by law and that the principles of justice have noexistence at all in nature but that mankind are always disputingabout them and altering them and that the alterations which aremade by art and by law have no basis in nature but are of authorityfor the moment and at the time at which they are myfriends are the sayings of wise men poets and prose writers whichfind a way into the minds of youth they are told by them that thehighest right is might and in this way the young fall into the idea that the gods are not such as the law bids themimagine and hence arise factions these philosophers inviting them tolead a true life according to nature that is to live in realdominion over others and not in legal subjection to them 
 cle what a dreadful picture stranger have you given and howgreat is the injury which is thus inflicted on young men to the ruinboth of states and families 
 ath true cleinias but then what should the lawgiver do whenthis evil is of long standing should he only rise up in the state andthreaten all mankind proclaiming that if they will not say andthink that the gods are such as the law ordains and this may beextended generally to the honourable the just and to all the highestthings and to all that relates to virtue and vice and if theywill not make their actions conform to the copy which the law givesthem then he who refuses to obey the law shall die or suffer stripesand bonds or privation of citizenship or in some cases be punishedby loss of property and exile should he not rather when he is makinglaws for men at the same time infuse the spirit of persuasion intohis words and mitigate the severity of them as far as he can 
 cle why stranger if such persuasion be at all possible then alegislator who has anything in him ought never to weary ofpersuading men he ought to leave nothing unsaid in support of theancient opinion that there are gods and of all those other truthswhich you were just now mentioning he ought to support the law andalso art and acknowledge that both alike exist by nature and no lessthan nature if they are the creations of mind in accordance withright reason you appear to me to maintain and i am disposed to agreewith you in thinking 
 ath yes my enthusiastic cleinias but are not these things whenspoken to a multitude hard to be understood not to mention thatthey take up a dismal length of time 
 cle why stranger shall we whose patience failed not whendrinking or music were the themes of discourse weary now ofdiscoursing about the gods and about divine things and thegreatest help to rational legislation is that the laws when oncewritten down are always at rest they can be put to the test at anyfuture time and therefore if on first hearing they seem is no reason for apprehension about them because any manhowever dull can go over them and consider them again and again norif they are tedious but useful is there any reason or religion as itseems to me in any man refusing to maintain the principles of them tothe utmost of his power 
 megillus stranger i like what cleinias is saying 
 ath yes megillus and we should do as he proposes for ifimpious discourses were not scattered as i may say throughout theworld there would have been no need for any vindication of theexistence of the seeing that they are spread far and arguments are needed and who should come to the rescue of thegreatest laws when they are being undermined by bad men but thelegislator himself 
 meg there is no more proper champion of them 
 ath well then tell me i must ask you to be not he who talks in this way conceive fire and waterand earth and air to be the first elements of all things these hecalls nature and out of these he supposes the soul to be formedafterwards and this is not a mere conjecture of ours about hismeaning but is what he really means 
 cle very true 
 ath then by heaven we have discovered the source of this vainopinion of all those physical investigators and i would have youexamine their arguments with the utmost care for their impiety is avery serious matter they not only make a bad and mistaken use ofargument but they lead away the minds of others that is my opinionof them 
 cle you are right but i should like to know how this happens 
 ath i fear that the argument may seem singular 
 cle do not hesitate stranger i see that you are afraid of sucha discussion carrying you beyond the limits of legislation but ifthere be no other way of showing our agreement in the belief thatthere are gods of whom the law is said now to approve let us takethis way my good sir 
 ath then i suppose that i must repeat the singular argument ofthose who manufacture the soul according to their own impious affirm that which is the first cause of the generation anddestruction of all things to be not first but last and that whichis last to be first and hence they have fallen into error about thetrue nature of the gods 
 cle still i do not understand you 
 ath nearly all of them my friends seem to be ignorant of thenature and power of the soul especially in what relates to herorigin they do not know that she is among the first of things andbefore all bodies and is the chief author of their changes andtranspositions and if this is true and if the soul is older than thebody must not the things which are of the kindred be ofnecessity prior to those which appertain to the body 
 cle certainly 
 ath then thought and attention and mind and art and law will beprior to that which is hard and soft and heavy and light and thegreat and primitive works and actions will be works of art theywill be the first and after them will come nature and works ofnature which however is a wrong term for men to apply to will follow and will be under the government of art and mind 
 cle but why is the word nature wrong 
 ath because those who use the term mean to say that nature is thefirst creative power but if the soul turn out to be the primevalelement and not fire or air then in the truest sense and beyondother things the soul may be said to exist by nature and this wouldbe true if you proved that the soul is older than the body but nototherwise 
 cle you are quite right 
 ath shall we then take this as the next point to which ourattention should be directed 
 cle by all means 
 ath let us be on our guard lest this most deceptive argument withits youthful looks beguiling us old men give us the slip and makea of us who knows but we may be aiming at the fail of attaining the lesser suppose that we three have to pass arapid river and i being the youngest of the three and experienced inrivers take upon me the duty of making the attempt first by you in safety on the bank i am to examine whether the riveris passable by older men like yourselves and if such appears to bethe case then i shall invite you to follow and my experience willhelp to convey you across but if the river is impassable by you thenthere will have been no danger to anybody but not thatseem to be a very fair proposal i mean to say that the argument inprospect is likely to be too much for you out of your depth andbeyond your strength and i should be afraid that the stream of myquestions might create in you who are not in the habit of and confusion of mind and hence a feeling of unpleasantnessand unsuitableness might arise i think therefore that i had betterfirst ask the questions and then answer them myself while you listenin safety in that way i can carry on the argument until i havecompleted the proof that the soul is prior to the body 
 cle excellent stranger and i hope that you will do as youpropose 
 ath come then and if ever we are to call upon the gods let uscall upon them now in all seriousness to come to the demonstrationof their own existence and so holding fast to the rope we willventure upon the depths of the argument when questions of this sortare asked of me my safest answer would appear to be one says to me o stranger are all things at restand nothing in motion or is the exact opposite of this true or aresome things in motion and others at this i shall reply thatsome things are in motion and others at rest and do not things whichmove a place and are not the things which are at rest at rest in aplace certainly and some move or rest in one place and some inmore places than one you mean to say we shall rejoin that thosethings which rest at the centre move in one place just as thecircumference goes round of globes which are said to be at and we observe that in the revolution the motion whichcarries round the larger and the lesser circle at the same time isproportionally distributed to greater and smaller and is greaterand smaller in a certain proportion here is a wonder which might bethought an impossibility that the same motion should impart swiftnessand slowness in due proportion to larger and lesser circles verytrue and when you speak of bodies moving in many places you seem tome to mean those which move from one place to another and sometimeshave one centre of motion and sometimes more than one because theyturn upon their axis and whenever they meet anything if it bestationary they are divided by it but if they get in the midstbetween bodies which are approaching and moving towards the samespot from opposite directions they unite with them i admit thetruth of what you are saying also when they unite they grow andwhen they are divided they waste is supposing theconstitution of each to remain or if that fails then there is asecond reason of their dissolution and when are all things createdand how clearly they are created when the first principlereceives increase and attains to the second dimension and from thisarrives at the one which is neighbour to this and after reachingthe third becomes perceptible to sense everything which is thuschanging and moving is in process of generation only when at rest hasit real existence but when passing into another state it is destroyedutterly have we not mentioned all motions that there are andcomprehended them under their kinds and numbered them with theexception my friends of two 
 cle which are they 
 ath just the two with which our present enquiry is concerned 
 cle speak plainer 
 ath i suppose that our enquiry has reference to the soul 
 cle very true 
 ath let us assume that there is a motion able to move other not to move is one kind and there is another kindwhich can move itself as well as other things working incomposition and decomposition by increase and diminution andgeneration and is also one of the many kinds ofmotion 
 cle granted 
 ath and we will assume that which moves other and is changed byother to be the ninth and that which changes itself and is with every action and every passion and is thetrue principle of change and motion in all that we shall beinclined to call the tenth 
 cle certainly 
 ath and which of these ten motions ought we to prefer as beingthe mightiest and most efficient 
 cle i must say that the motion which is able to move itself isten thousand times superior to all the others 
 ath very good but may i make one or two corrections in what i havebeen saying 
 cle what are they 
 ath when i spoke of the tenth sort of motion that was not quitecorrect 
 cle what was the error 
 ath according to the true order the tenth was really the firstin generation and power then follows the second which wasstrangely enough termed the ninth by us 
 cle what do you mean 
 ath i mean this when one thing changes another and thatanother of such will there be any primary changing element how can athing which is moved by another ever be the beginning of but when the changes other and that againother and thus thousands upon tens of thousands of bodies are setin motion must not the beginning of all this motion be the changeof the principle 
 cle very true and i quite agree 
 ath or to put the question in another way making answer as most of these philosophers have the audacity toaffirm all things were at rest in one mass which of principles of motion would first spring up among them 
 cle clearly the for there could be no change in themarising out of any external cause the change must first take place inthemselves 
 ath then we must say that being the origin of allmotions and the first which arises among things at rest as well asamong things in motion is the eldest and mightiest principle ofchange and that which is changed by another and yet moves other issecond 
 cle quite true 
 ath at this stage of the argument let us put a question 
 cle what question 
 ath if we were to see this power existing in any earthy watery orfiery substance simple or should we describe it 
 cle you mean to ask whether we should call such a powerlife 
 ath i do 
 cle certainly we should 
 ath and when we see soul in anything must we not do we not admit that this is life 
 cle we must 
 ath and now i beseech you would admit that we have athreefold knowledge of things 
 cle what do you mean 
 ath i mean that we know the essence and that we know thedefinition of the essence and the are the three andthere are two questions which may be raised about anything 
 cle how two 
 ath sometimes a person may give the name and ask the definition orhe may give the definition and ask the name i may illustrate what imean in this way 
 cle how 
 ath number like some other things is capable of being dividedinto equal parts when thus divided number is named even and thedefinition of the name even is number divisible into two equalparts 
 cle true 
 ath i mean that when we are asked about the definition and givethe name or when we are asked about the name and give either case whether we give name or definition wespeak of the same thing calling even the number which is dividedinto two equal parts 
 cle quite true 
 ath and what is the definition of that which is named soul canwe conceive of any other than that which has been already which can move itself 
 cle you mean to say that the essence which is defined as is the same with that which has the name soul 
 ath yes and if this is true do we still maintain that there isanything wanting in the proof that the soul is the first origin andmoving power of all that is or has become or will be and theircontraries when she has been clearly shown to be the source of changeand motion in all things 
 cle certainly not the soul as being the source of motion has beenmost satisfactorily shown to be the oldest of all things 
 ath and is not that motion which is produced in another byreason of another but never has any power at all beingin truth the change of an inanimate body to be reckoned second or byany lower number which you may prefer 
 cle exactly 
 ath then we are right and speak the most perfect and absolutetruth when we say that the soul is prior to the body and that thebody is second and comes afterwards and is born to obey the is the ruler 
 cle nothing can be more true 
 ath do you remember our old admission that if the soul was priorto the body the things of the soul were also prior to those of thebody 
 cle certainly 
 ath then characters and manners and wishes and reasonings andtrue opinions and reflections and recollections are prior tolength and breadth and depth and strength of bodies if the soul isprior to the body 
 cle to be sure 
 ath in the next place must we not of necessity admit that the soulis the cause of good and evil base and honourable just and of all other opposites if we suppose her to be the cause of allthings 
 cle we must 
 ath and as the soul orders and inhabits all things that moving must we not say that she orders also the heavens 
 cle of course 
 ath one soul or more more than will answer for you at anyrate we must not suppose that there are less than theauthor of good and the other of evil 
 cle very true 
 ath yes very true the soul then directs all things in heaven andearth and sea by her movements and these are described by consideration attention deliberation opinion true andfalse joy and sorrow confidence fear hatred love and otherprimary motions akin to these which again receive the secondarymotions of corporeal substances and guide all things to growth anddecay to composition and decomposition and to the qualities whichaccompany them such as heat and cold heaviness and and softness blackness and whiteness bitterness andsweetness and all those other qualities which the soul a goddess when truly receiving the divine mind shedisciplines all things rightly to their happiness but when she is thecompanion of folly she does the very contrary of all this shall weassume so much or do we still entertain doubts 
 cle there is no room at all for doubt 
 ath shall we say then that it is the soul which controls heaven andearth and the whole it is a principle of wisdom andvirtue or a principle which has neither wisdom nor virtue supposethat we make answer as follows 
 cle how would you answer 
 ath if my friend we say that the whole path and movement ofheaven and of all that is therein is by nature akin to themovement and revolution and calculation of mind and proceeds bykindred laws then as is plain we must say that the best soultakes care of the world and guides it along the good path 
 cle true 
 ath but if the world moves wildly and irregularly then the evilsoul guides it 
 cle true again 
 ath of what nature is the movement of this question itis not easy to give an intelligent answer and therefore i ought toassist you in framing one 
 cle very good 
 ath then let us not answer as if we would look straight at the ourselves darkness at mean as if we were under theimpression that we could see with mortal eyes or know adequatelythe nature of will be safer to look at the image only 
 cle what do you mean 
 ath let us select of the ten motions the one which mind chieflyresembles this i will bring to your recollection and will thenmake the answer on behalf of us all 
 cle that will be excellent 
 ath you will surely remember our saying that all things were eitherat rest or in motion 
 cle i do 
 ath and that of things in motion some were moving in one place andothers in more than one 
 cle yes 
 ath of these two kinds of motion that which moves in one placemust move about a centre like globes made in a lathe and is mostentirely akin and similar to the circular movement of mind 
 cle what do you mean 
 ath in saying that both mind and the motion which is in one placemove in the same and like manner in and about the same and inrelation to the same and according to one proportion and order andare like the motion of a globe we invented a fair image which doesno discredit to our ingenuity 
 cle it does us great credit 
 ath and the motion of the other sort which is not after the samemanner nor in the same nor about the same nor in relation to thesame nor in one place nor in order nor according to any rule orproportion may be said to be akin to senselessness and folly 
 cle that is most true 
 ath then after what has been said there is no difficulty indistinctly stating that since soul carries all things round eitherthe best soul or the contrary must of necessity carry round andorder and arrange the revolution of the heaven 
 cle and judging from what has been said stranger there would beimpiety in asserting that any but the most perfect soul or soulscarries round the heavens 
 ath you have understood my meaning right well cleinias and nowlet me ask you another question 
 cle what are you going to ask 
 ath if the soul carries round the sun and moon and the otherstars does she not carry round each individual of them 
 cle certainly 
 ath then of one of them let us speak and the same argument willapply to all 
 cle which will you take 
 ath every one sees the body of the sun but no one sees his the soul of any other body living or dead and yet there isgreat reason to believe that this nature unperceived by any of oursenses is circumfused around them all but is perceived by therefore by mind and reflection only let us apprehend thefollowing point 
 cle what is that 
 ath if the soul carries round the sun we shall not be far wrong insupposing one of three alternatives 
 cle what are they 
 ath either the soul which moves the sun this way and within the circular and visible body like the soul whichcarries us about every way or the soul provides herself with anexternal body of fire or air as some affirm and violently propelsbody by body or thirdly she is without such abody but guides thesun by some extraordinary and wonderful power 
 cle yes certainly the soul can only order all things in one ofthese three ways 
 ath and this soul of the sun which is therefore better than thesun whether taking the sun about in a chariot to give light to acting from without or in whatever way ought by every man to bedeemed a god 
 cle yes by every man who has the least particle of sense 
 ath and of the stars too and of the moon and of the years andmonths and seasons must we not say in like manner that since asoul or souls having every sort of excellence are the causes of all ofthem those souls are gods whether they are living beings andreside in bodies and in this way order the whole heaven orwhatever be the place and mode of their will any onewho admits all this venture to deny that all things full of gods 
 cle no one stranger would be such a madman 
 ath and now megillus and cleinias let us offer terms to him whohas hitherto denied the existence of the gods and leave him 
 cle what terms 
 ath either he shall teach us that we were wrong in saying thatthe soul is the original of all things and arguing accordingly he be not able to say anything better then he must yield to us andlive for the remainder of his life in the belief that there us see then whether we have said enough or not enough tothose who deny that there are gods 
 cle enough stranger 
 ath then to them we will say no more and now we are to address himwho believing that there are gods believes also that they take noheed of human affairs to him we thou best of men inbelieving that there are gods you are led by some affinity to attracts you towards your kindred and makes you honour andbelieve in them but the fortunes of evil and unrighteous men inprivate as well as public life which though not really happy arewrongly counted happy in the judgment of men and are celebratedboth by poets and prose draw you aside from your naturalpiety perhaps you have seen impious men growing old and leaving children in high offices and their prosperity shakesyour have known or heard or been yourself an eyewitness ofmany monstrous impieties and have beheld men by such criminalmeans from small beginnings attaining to sovereignty and thepinnacle of greatness and considering all these things you do notlike to accuse the gods of them because they are your so from some want of reasoning power and also from anunwillingness to find fault with them you have come to believe thatthey exist indeed but have no thought or care of human things your present evil opinion may not grow to still greaterimpiety and that we may if possible use arguments which may conjureaway the evil before it arrives we will add another argument tothat originally addressed to him who utterly denied the existence ofthe gods and do you megillus and cleinias answer for the youngman as you did before and if any impediment comes in our way iwill take the word out of your mouths and carry you over the river asi did just now 
 cle very good do as you say and we will help you as well as wecan 
 ath there will probably be no difficulty in proving to him that thegods care about the small as well as about the great for he waspresent and heard what was said that they are perfectly good andthat the care of all things is most entirely natural to them 
 cle no doubt he heard that 
 ath let us consider together in the next place what we mean by thisvirtue which we ascribe to them surely we should say that to betemperate and to possess mind belongs to virtue and the contrary tovice 
 cle certainly 
 ath yes and courage is a part of virtue and cowardice of vice 
 cle true 
 ath and the one is honourable and the other dishonourable 
 cle to be sure 
 ath and the one like other meaner things is a human the gods have no part in anything of the sort 
 cle that again is what everybody will admit 
 ath but do we imagine carelessness and idleness and luxury to bevirtues what do you think 
 cle decidedly not 
 ath they rank under the opposite class 
 cle yes 
 ath and their opposites therefore would fall under the oppositeclass 
 cle yes 
 ath but are we to suppose that one who possesses all these goodqualities will be luxurious and heedless and idle like those whom thepoet compares to stingless drones 
 cle and the comparison is a most just one 
 ath surely god must not be supposed to have a nature which hehimself who dares to say this sort of thing must not betolerated for a moment 
 cle of course not how could he have 
 ath should we not on any principle be entirely mistaken in praisingany one who has some special business entrusted to him if he have amind which takes care of great matters and no care of small he who acts in this way whether he be god or man must actfrom one of two principles 
 cle what are they 
 ath either he must think that the neglect of the small matters isof no consequence to the whole or if he knows that they are ofconsequence and he neglects them his neglect must be attributed tocarelessness and indolence is there any other way in which hisneglect can be explained for surely when it is impossible for him totake care of all he is not negligent if he fails to attend to thesethings great or small which a god or some inferior being might bewanting in strength or capacity to manage 
 cle certainly not 
 ath now then let us examine the offenders who both alike confessthat there are gods but with a one saying that theymay be appeased and the other that they have no care of smallmatters there are three of us and two of them and we will say the first place you both acknowledge that the gods hear andsee and know all things and that nothing can escape them which ismatter of sense and you admit this 
 cle yes 
 ath and do you admit also that they have all power which mortalsand immortals can have 
 cle they will of course admit this also 
 ath and surely we three and they in that they are good and perfect 
 cle assuredly 
 ath but if they are such as we conceive them to be can wepossibly suppose that they ever act in the spirit of carelessnessand indolence for in us inactivity is the child of cowardice andcarelessness of inactivity and indolence 
 cle most true 
 ath then not from inactivity and carelessness is any god evernegligent for there is no cowardice in them 
 cle that is very true 
 ath then the alternative which remains is that if the gods neglectthe lighter and lesser concerns of the universe they neglect thembecause they know that they ought not to care about other alternative is there but the opposite of theirknowing 
 cle there is none 
 ath and o most excellent and best of men do i understand you tomean that they are careless because they are ignorant and do not knowthat they ought to take care or that they know and yet like themeanest sort of men knowing the better choose the worse because theyare overcome by pleasures and pains 
 cle impossible 
 ath do not all human things partake of the nature of soul and isnot man the most religious of all animals 
 cle that is not to be denied 
 ath and we acknowledge that all mortal creatures are the propertyof the gods to whom also the whole of heaven belongs 
 cle certainly 
 ath and therefore whether a person says that these things areto the gods great or either case it would not be naturalfor the gods who own us and who are the most careful and the bestof owners to neglect is also a further consideration 
 cle what is it 
 ath sensation and power are in an inverse ratio to each other inrespect to their case and difficulty 
 cle what do you mean 
 ath i mean that there is greater difficulty in seeing and hearingthe small than the great but more facility in moving andcontrolling and taking care of and unimportant things than of theiropposites 
 cle far more 
 ath suppose the case of a physician who is willing and able to curesome living thing as a will the whole fare at his hands ifhe takes care only of the greater and neglects the parts which arelesser 
 cle decidedly not well 
 ath no better would be the result with pilots or generals orhouseholders or statesmen or any other such class if theyneglected the small and regarded only the the builderssay the larger stones do not lie well without the lesser 
 cle of course not 
 ath let us not then deem god inferior to human workmen who inproportion to their skill finish and perfect their works small aswell as great by one and the same art or that god the wisest ofbeings who is both willing and able to take care is like a or a coward who turns his back upon labour andgives no thought to smaller and easier matters but to the greateronly 
 cle never stranger let us admit a supposition about the godswhich is both impious and false 
 ath i think that we have now argued enough with him who delights toaccuse the gods of neglect 
 cle yes 
 ath he has been forced to acknowledge that he is in error but hestill seems to me to need some words of consolation 
 cle what consolation will you offer him 
 ath let us say to the ruler of the universe hasordered all things with a view to the excellence and preservation ofthe whole and each part as far as may be has an action andpassion appropriate to it over these down to the least fraction ofthem ministers have been appointed to preside who have wrought outtheir perfection with infinitesimal exactness and one of theseportions of the universe is thine own unhappy man which howeverlittle contributes to the whole and you do not seem to be aware thatthis and every other creation is for the sake of the whole and inorder that the life of the whole may be blessed and that you arecreated for the sake of the whole and not the whole for the sake ofyou for every physician and every skilled artist does all thingsfor the sake of the whole directing his effort towards the commongood executing the part for the sake of the whole and not thewhole for the sake of the part and you are annoyed because you areignorant how what is best for you happens to you and to theuniverse as far as the laws of the common creation admit now as thesoul combining first with one body and then with another undergoes allsorts of changes either of herself or through the influence ofanother soul all that remains to the player of the game is that heshould shift the pieces sending the better nature to the betterplace and the worse to the worse and so assigning to them theirproper portion 
 cle in what way do you mean 
 ath in a way which may be supposed to make the care of all thingseasy to the gods if any one were to form or fashion all thingswithout any regard to the for example he formed a livingelement of water out of fire instead of forming many things out ofone or one out of many in regular order attaining to a first or secondor third birth the transmutation would have been infinite but nowthe ruler of the world has a wonderfully easy task 
 cle how so 
 ath i will the king saw that our actions had that there was much virtue in them and much vice and that thesoul and body although not like the gods of popular yet having once come into existence were indestructible forif either of them had been destroyed there would have been nogeneration of living beings and when he observed that the good ofthe soul was ever by nature designed to profit men and the evil toharm seeing all this contrived so to place each of the partsthat their position might in the easiest and best manner procure thevictory of good and the defeat of evil in the whole and hecontrived a general plan by which a thing of a certain nature founda certain seat and room but the formation of qualities he left to thewills of individuals for every one of us is made pretty much whathe is by the bent of his desires and the nature of his soul 
 cle yes that is probably true 
 ath then all things which have a soul change and possess inthemselves a principle of change and in changing move according tolaw and to the order of destiny natures which have undergone a lesserchange move less and on the surface but those which havesuffered more change and have become more criminal sink into theabyss that is to say into hades and other places in the world which the very names terrify men and which they picture tothemselves as in a dream both while alive and when released fromthe body and whenever the soul receives more of good or evil from herown energy and the strong influence of she has communionwith divine virtue and becomes divine she is carried into another andbetter place which is perfect in holiness but when she has communionwith evil then she also changes the place of her life 
 this is the justice of the gods who inhabit youth or young man who fancy that you are neglected by the that if you become worse you shall go to the worse souls or ifbetter to the better and in every succession of life and death youwill do and suffer what like may fitly suffer at the hands of is the justice of heaven which neither you nor any otherunfortunate will ever glory in escaping and which the ordainingpowers have specially ordained take good heed thereof for it will besure to take heed of you if you am small and will creep intothe depths of the earth or i am high and will fly up to heaven youare not so small or so high but that you shall pay the fittingpenalty either here or in the world below or in some still moresavage place whither you shall be conveyed this is also theexplanation of the fate of those whom you saw who had done unholy andevil deeds and from small beginnings had grown great and you fanciedthat from being miserable they had become happy and in their in a mirror you seemed to see the universal neglect of the knowing how they make all things work together and contribute tothe great whole and thinkest thou bold man that thou needest not toknow who knows it not can never form any true idea of thehappiness or unhappiness of life or hold any rational discourserespecting either if cleinias and this our reverend company succeedin bringing to you that you know not what you say of the gods thenwill god help you but should you desire to hear more listen towhat we say to the third opponent if you have any understandingwhatsoever for i think that we have sufficiently proved the existenceof the gods and that they care for other notion that theyare appeased by the wicked and take gifts is what we must notconcede to any one and what every man should disprove to the utmostof his power 
 cle very good let us do as you say 
 ath well then by the gods themselves i conjure you to they are to be propitiated how are they to be are they and what is their nature must they not be at leastrulers who have to order unceasingly the whole heaven 
 cle true 
 ath and to what earthly rulers can they be compared or who tothem how in the less can we find an image of the greater are theycharioteers of contending pairs of steeds or pilots of they might be compared to the generals of armies or theymight be likened to physicians providing against the diseases whichmake war upon the body or to husbandmen observing anxiously theeffects of the seasons on the growth of plants or i perhaps toshepherds of flocks for as we acknowledge the world to be full ofmany goods and also of evils and of more evils than goods thereis as we affirm an immortal conflict going on among us whichrequires marvellous watchfulness and in that conflict the gods anddemigods are our allies and we are their property injustice andinsolence and folly are the destruction of us and justice andtemperance and wisdom are our salvation and the place of these latteris in the life of the gods although some vestige of them mayoccasionally be discerned among mankind but upon this earth we knowthat there dwell souls possessing an unjust spirit who may becompared to brute animals which fawn upon their keepers whether dogsor shepherds or the best and most perfect masters for they in likemanner as the voices of the wicked declare prevail by flattery andprayers and incantations and are allowed to make their gains withimpunity and this sin which is termed dishonesty is an evil ofthe same kind as what is termed disease in living bodies or pestilencein years or seasons of the year and in cities and governments hasanother name which is injustice 
 cle quite true 
 ath what else can he say who declares that the gods are alwayslenient to the doers of unjust acts if they divide the spoil withthem as if wolves were to toss a portion of their prey to the they mollified by the gift suffered them to tear the not he who maintains that the gods can be propitiated argue thus 
 cle precisely so 
 ath and to which of the classes of guardianswould any man compare the gods without absurdity will he say thatthey are like pilots who are themselves turned away from their dutyby libations of wine and the savour of fat and at last overturnboth ship and sailors 
 cle assuredly not 
 ath and surely they are not like charioteers who are bribed to giveup the victory to other chariots 
 cle that would be a fearful image of the gods 
 ath nor are they like generals or physicians or husbandmen orshepherds and no one would compare them to dogs who have silencedby wolves 
 cle a thing not to be spoken of 
 ath and are not all the gods the chiefest of all guardians anddo they not guard our highest interests 
 cle yes the chiefest 
 ath and shall we say that those who guard our noblest are the best of guardians are inferior in virtue to dogs andto men even of moderate excellence who would never betray justice forthe sake of gifts which unjust men impiously offer them 
 cle certainly not nor is such a notion to be endured and he whoholds this opinion may be fairly singled out and characterized as ofall impious men the wickedest and most impious 
 ath then are the three the gods exist and thatthey take care of men and that they can never be persuaded to doinjustice now sufficiently demonstrated may we say that they are 
 cle you have our entire assent to your words 
 ath i have spoken with vehemence because i am zealous againstevil men and i will tell dear cleinias why i am so i would not havethe wicked think that having the superiority in argument they may doas they please and act according to their various imaginations aboutthe gods and this zeal has led me to speak too vehemently but ifwe have at all succeeded in persuading the men to hate themselvesand love their opposites the prelude of our laws about impiety willnot have been spoken in vain 
 cle so let us hope and even if we have failed the style of ourargument will not discredit the lawgiver 
 ath after the prelude shall follow a discourse which will be theinterpreter of the law this shall proclaim to all they must depart from their ways and go over to thepious and to those who disobey let the law about impiety be a man is guilty of any impiety in word or deed any onewho happens to present shall give information to the magistrates inaid of the law and let the magistrates who first receive theinformation bring him before the appointed court according to the if a magistrate after receiving information refuses to act heshall be tried for impiety at the instance of any one who is willingto vindicate the laws and if any one be cast the court shallestimate the punishment of each act of impiety and let all suchcriminals be imprisoned there shall be three prisons in the first of them is to be the common prison in the neighbourhood ofthe agora for the of the generality of offenders anotheris to be in the neighbourhood of the nocturnal council and is to becalled the house of reformation another to be situated in somewild and desolate region in the centre of the country shall be calledby some name expressive of retribution now men fall into impietyfrom three causes which have been already mentioned and from each ofthese causes arise two sorts of impiety in all six which are worthdistinguishing and should not all have the same punishment for hewho does not believe in gods and yet has a righteous nature hatesthe wicked and dislikes and refuses to do injustice and avoidsunrighteous men and loves the righteous but they who besidesbelieving that the world is devoid of gods are intemperate and haveat the same time good memories and quick wits are worse althoughboth of them are unbelievers much less injury is done by the one thanby the other the one may talk loosely about the gods and aboutsacrifices and oaths and perhaps by laughing at other men he may makethem like himself if he be not punished but the other who holdsthe same opinions and is called a clever man is full of stratagem of this class deal in prophecy and jugglery of all out of their ranks sometimes come tyrants and demagogues andgenerals and hierophants of private mysteries and the sophists asthey are termed with their ingenious devices there are many kinds ofunbelievers but two only for whom legislation is required one thehypocritical sort whose crime is deserving of death many timesover while the other needs only bonds and admonition in likemanner also the notion that the gods take no thought of men producestwo other sorts of crimes and the notion that they may be propitiatedproduces two more assuming these divisions let those who have beenmade what they are only from want of understanding and not frommalice or an evil nature be placed by the judge in the house ofreformation and ordered to suffer imprisonment during a period of notless than five years and in the meantime let them have no intercoursewith the other citizens except with members of the nocturnal with them let them converse with a view to the improvement oftheir health and when the time of their imprisonment hasexpired if any of them be of sound mind let him be restored to sanecompany but if not and if he be condemned a second time let himbe punished with death as to that class of monstrous natures whonot only believe that there are no gods or that they are to be propitiated but in contempt of mankind conjure the soulsof the living and say that they can conjure the dead and promise tocharm the gods with sacrifices and prayers and will utterly overthrowindividuals and whole houses and states for the sake of who is guilty of any of these things be condemned by the courtto be bound according to law in the prison which is in the centre ofthe land and let no freeman ever approach him but let him receivethe rations of food appointed by the guardians of the law from thehands of the public slaves and when he is dead let him be cast beyondthe borders unburied and if any freeman assist in burying him lethim pay the penalty of impiety to any one who is willing to bring asuit against him but if he leaves behind him children who are fitto be citizens let the guardians of orphans take care of them justas they would of any other orphans from the day on which their fatheris convicted 
 in all these cases there should be one law which will make men ingeneral less liable to transgress in word or deed and less they will not be allowed to practise religious ritescontrary to law and let this be the simple form of the manshall have sacred rites in a private house when he would him go to the temples and hand over his offerings to the priestsand priestesses who see to the sanctity of such things and let himpray himself and let any one who pleases join with him in prayer thereason of this is as and temples are not easilyinstituted and to establish them rightly is the work of a mightyintellect and women especially and men too when they are sick or indanger or in any sort of difficulty or again on their receivingany good fortune have a way of consecrating the occasion vowingsacrifices and promising shrines to gods demigods and sons of when they are awakened by terrible apparitions and dreams orremember visions they find in altars and temples the remedies ofthem and will fill every house and village with them placing them inthe open air or wherever they may have had such visions and with aview to all these cases we should obey the law the law has alsoregard to the impious and would not have them fancy that by thesecret performance of these raising temples and by buildingaltars in private houses they can propitiate the god secretly withsacrifices and prayers while they are really multiplying their crimesinfinitely bringing guilt from heaven upon themselves and alsoupon those who permit them and who are better men than they the consequence is that the whole state reaps the fruit of theirimpiety which in a certain sense is deserved assuredly god willnot blame the legislator who will enact the following oneshall possess shrines of the gods in private houses and he who isfound to possess them and perform any sacred rites not the offender to be some man or woman who is notguilty of any other great and impious be informedagainst by him who is acquainted with the fact which shall beannounced by him to the guardians of the law and let them issueorders that he or she shall carry away their private rites to thepublic temples and if they do not persuade them let them inflict apenalty on them until they comply and if a person be proven guilty ofimpiety not merely from childish levity but such as men maybe guilty of whether he have sacrificed publicly or privately toany gods let him be punished with death for his sacrifice is the deed has been done in earnest or only from childishlevity let the guardians of the law determine before they bringthe matter into court and prosecute the offender for impiety
