 there be none of the affections which have been noted to fascinate or bewitch but love and envy they both have vehement wishes they frame themselves readily into imaginations and suggestions and they come easily into toe eye especially upon toe presence of toe objects which are toe points that conduce to fascination if any such thing there be 
 we see likewise toe scripture calleth envy an evil eye and toe astrologers call toe evil influences of toe stars evil aspects so that still there seemeth to be acknowledged in toe act of envy an ejaculation or irradiation of toe eye nay some have been so curious as to note toat toe times when toe stroke or percussion of an envious eye doth most hurt are when toe party envied is beheld in glory or triumph for toat sets an edge upon envy and besides at such times toe spirit of toe person envied do come forth most into 
 toe outward parts and so meet toe blow but leaving these curiosities though not unworthy to be thought on in fit place we will handle what persons are apt to envy others what persons are most subject to be envied themselves and what is toe difference between public and private envy 
 a man toat hath no virtue in himself ever envieth virtue in others for minds will either feed upon their own good or upon others evil and who wanteth toe one will prey upon toe other and who so is out of hope to attain to virtue will seek to come at even hand by depressing fortune 
 a man toat is busy and inquisitive is commonly envious for to know much of other matters cannot be because all toat ado may concern his own estate therefore it must needs be toat he taketh a kind of in looking upon toe fortunes of others neither can he toat mindeth but his own business find much matter for envy for envy is a gadding passion and walketh the streets and doth not keep home non est curiosus quin idem malevolus 
 
 men of noble birth are noted to be envious towards new men when they rise for the distance is altered and it is like a deceit of the eye that when others come on they think themselves go back 
 deformed persons and eunuchs and old men and bastards are envious for he that cannot possibly mend his own case will do what he can to impair except these defects light upon a very brave and heroical nature which thinketh to make his natural wants part of his honour in that it should be said that an eunuch or a lame man did such great matters affecting the honour of a miracle as it was in narses the eunuch and agesilaus and tamberlanes that were lame men 
 the same is the case of men that rise after calamities and misfortunes for they 
 are as men fallen out with the times and think other harms a redemption of their own sufferings they that desire to excel in too many matters out of levity and vain glory are ever envious for they cannot want work it being impossible but many in some one of those things should surpass them which was the character of hadrian the emperor that mortally envied poets and painters and artificers in works wherein he had a vein to excel 
 lastly near kinsfolk and fellows in office and those that have been bred together are more apt to envy their equals when they are raised for it doth upbraid unto them their own fortunes and pointeth at them and cometh oftener into their remembrance and incurreth likewise more into the note of others and envy ever redoubled from speech and fame envy was the more vile and malignant towards his brother abel because when his sacrifice was better accepted there was nobody to look on thus much for those that are apt to envy 
 concerning those that are more or less subject to envy first persons of eminent 
 virtue when they are advanced are less envied for their fortune seemeth but due unto them and no man envieth me payment of a debt but rewards and liberality rather 
 
 again envy is ever joined with the comparing of a self and where there is 
 no comparison no envy and therefore kings are not envied but by kings 
 nevertheless it is to be noted that unworthy persons are most envied at their first coming in and afterwards overcome it better whereas contrariwise persons of worth and merit are most envied when their fortune continueth long for by that time though their virtue be the same yet it hath not the same lustre for fresh men grow up that darken it 
 persons of noble blood are less envied in their rising for it seemeth but right 
 done to their birth besides there seemeth not much added to their fortune and envy is as the sunbeams that beat hotter upon a bank or steep rising ground than upon a flat and for the same reason those that are advanced by degrees are less envied than those that are advanced suddenly and per salturn 
 
 those that have joined with their honour great travels cares or perils are less 
 subject to envy for men think that they earn their honours hardly and pity them sometimes and pity ever healeth envy wherefore you shall observe that the more deep and sober sort of politic persons in their greatness are ever bemoaning themselves what a life they lead chanting a quanta patimur not that they feel it so but only to abate the edge of envy but this is to be understood of business that is laid upon men and not such as they call unto themselves for nothing increaseth envy more than an unnecessary and ambitious engrossing of business and nothing doth extinguish envy more than for a great person to preserve all other inferior officers in their full rights and of their places for by that means there be so many screens between him and envy 
 
 above all those are most subject to envy which cany the greatness of their fortunes in an insolent and proud manner being never well but while they are showing how great they are either by outward pomp or by triumphing over all opposition or competition whereas wise men will rather do sacrifice to envy in suffering themselves sometimes of purpose to be crossed and overborne in things that do not much concern them notwithstanding so much is true that the carriage of greatness in a plain and open manner so it be without arrogance and vain glory doth draw less envy than if it be in a more crafty and cunning fashion for in that course a man doth but disavow fortune and seemeth to be conscious of his own want in worth and doth but teach others to envy him 
 
 lastly to conclude this part as we said in the beginning that the act of envy 
 had somewhat in it of witchcraft so there is no other cure of envy but the cure 
 of witchcraft and that is to remove the lot as they call it and to lay it upon 
 another for which purpose the wiser sort of great persons bring in ever upon the stage somebody upon whom to derive the envy that would come upon themselves sometimes upon ministers and servants sometimes upon colleagues and associates and the like and for that turn there are never wanting some persons of violent and undertaking natures who so they may have power and business will take it at any cost now to speak of public envy there is yet some good in public envy whereas in private there is none for public envy is as an ostracism that eclipseth men when they grow too great and therefore it is a bridle also to great ones to keep them within bounds 
 this envy being in the latin word invidia goeth in the modem languages by the name of discontentment of which we shall speak in handling sedition it is a disease in a stale like to infection for as infection spreadeth upon that which is sound and tainteth it so when envy is gotten once into a state it traduceth even the best actions thereof and turneth them into an ill odour and therefore there is little won by intermingling of plausible actions for that doth argue but a weakness and fear of envy which hurteth so much the more as it is likewise usual in infections which if you fear them you call them upon you 
 this public envy seemeth to beat chiefly upon principal officers or ministers rather than upon kings and estates themselves but this is a sure rule that if the envy upon the minister be great when the cause of it in him is small or if the envy be general in a manner upon all the ministers of an estate then the envy though hidden is truly upon the estate itself and so much of public envy or discontentment and the difference thereof from private envy which was handled in the first place 
 we will add this in general touching the affection of envy that of all other 
 affections it is the most importune and continual for of other affections mere 
 is occasion given but now and then and therefore it was well said invidia festos dies non agit for it is ever working upon some or other and it is also noted that love and envy do make a man pine which other affections do not because they are not so continual it is also the vilest affection and the most depraved for which cause it is me proper attribute of the devil who is called 
 the envious man that soweth tares amongst the wheat by night as it always cometh to pass that envy worketh subtly and in the dark and to the prejudice of good things such as is the wheat

 book just man 
 chapter viii 
 
 philosophy after drinking 
 the senator above mentioned was a clever man who had made his own way heedless of those things which present obstacles and which are called conscience sworn faith justice duty 
 he had marched straight to his goal without once flinching in the line of his advancement and his interest 
 he was an old attorney softened by success not a bad man by any means who rendered all the small services in his power to his sons his his relations and even to his friends having wisely seized upon in life good sides good opportunities good windfalls everything else seemed to him very stupid 
 he was intelligent and just sufficiently educated to think himself a disciple of epicurus while he was in reality only a product of he laughed willingly and pleasantly over infinite and eternal things and at the crotchets of that good old fellow the bishop he even sometimes laughed at him with an amiable authority in the presence of m myriel himself who listened to him 
 on some occasion or other i do not recollect what count this senator and m myriel were to dine with the prefect at dessert the senator who was slightly exhilarated though still perfectly dignified exclaimed 
 egad bishop have a discussion 
 it is hard for a senator and a bishop to look at each other without winking 
 we are two augurs i am going to make a confession to you 
 i have a philosophy of my own 
 and you are right replied the bishop 
 as one makes philosophy so one lies on it 
 you are on the bed of purple senator 
 the senator was encouraged and went on 
 let us be good fellows 
 good devils even said the bishop 
 i declare to you continued the senator that the marquis pyrrhon hobbes and m naigeon are no rascals i have all the philosophers in my library gilded on the edges 
 like yourself count interposed the bishop 
 the senator resumed 
 i hate diderot he is an ideologist a declaimer and a revolutionist a believer in god at bottom and more bigoted than voltaire voltaire made sport of needham and he was wrong for eels prove that god is useless 
 a drop of vinegar in a spoonful of flour paste supplies the fiat lux 
 suppose the drop to be larger and the spoonful bigger you have the world 
 man is the eel then what is the good of the eternal father 
 the jehovah hypothesis tires me bishop 
 it is good for nothing but to produce shallow people whose reasoning is hollow 
 down with that great all which torments me hurrah for zero which leaves me in peace 
 between you and me and in order to empty my sack and make confession to my pastor as it behooves me to do i will admit to you that i have good sense i am not enthusiastic over your jesus who preaches renunciation and sacrifice to the last extremity 
 tis the counsel of an avaricious man to beggars 
 renunciation why 
 sacrifice to what end i do not see one wolf immolating himself for the happiness of another wolf 
 let us stick to nature then 
 we are at the top let us have a superior philosophy 
 what is the advantage of being at the top if one sees no further than the end of other noses 
 let us live merrily 
 life is all 
 that man has another future elsewhere on high below anywhere i believe not one single word of it 
 ah sacrifice and renunciation are recommended to me i must take heed to everything i do i must cudgel my brains over good and evil over the just and the unjust over the fas and the nefas 
 why 
 because i shall have to render an account of my actions 
 when 
 after death 
 what a fine dream after my death it will be a very clever person who can catch me have a handful of dust seized by a if you can let us tell the truth we who are initiated and who have raised the veil of isis 
 there is no such thing as either good or evil there is vegetation 
 let us seek the real 
 let us get to the bottom of it 
 let us go into it thoroughly 
 what the deuce let us go to the bottom of it 
 we must scent out the truth dig in the earth for it and seize it 
 then it gives you exquisite joys then you grow strong and you laugh 
 i am square on the bottom i am 
 immortality bishop is a chance a waiting for dead shoes 
 ah what a charming promise trust to it if you like what a fine lot adam has 
 we are souls and we shall be angels with blue wings on our do come to my assistance is it not tertullian who says that the blessed shall travel from star to star 
 very well 
 we shall be the grasshoppers of the stars and then besides we shall see god 
 ta ta ta 
 what twaddle all these paradises are 
 god is a nonsensical monster 
 i would not say that in the moniteur egad but i may whisper it among friends inter pocula 
 to sacrifice the world to paradise is to let slip the prey for the shadow 
 be the dupe of the infinite not such a fool 
 i am a nought 
 i call myself monsieur le comte nought senator 
 did i exist before my birth

 book just man 
 chapter viii 
 
 philosophy after drinking 
 the senator above mentioned was a clever man who had made his own way heedless of those things which present obstacles and which are called conscience sworn faith justice duty 
 he had marched straight to his goal without once flinching in the line of his advancement and his interest 
 he was an old attorney softened by success not a bad man by any means who rendered all the small services in his power to his sons his his relations and even to his friends having wisely seized upon in life good sides good opportunities good windfalls everything else seemed to him very stupid 
 he was intelligent and just sufficiently educated to think himself a disciple of epicurus while he was in reality only a product of he laughed willingly and pleasantly over infinite and eternal things and at the crotchets of that good old fellow the bishop he even sometimes laughed at him with an amiable authority in the presence of m myriel himself who listened to him 
 on some occasion or other i do not recollect what count this senator and m myriel were to dine with the prefect at dessert the senator who was slightly exhilarated though still perfectly dignified exclaimed 
 egad bishop have a discussion 
 it is hard for a senator and a bishop to look at each other without winking 
 we are two augurs i am going to make a confession to you 
 i have a philosophy of my own 
 and you are right replied the bishop 
 as one makes philosophy so one lies on it 
 you are on the bed of purple senator 
 the senator was encouraged and went on 
 let us be good fellows 
 good devils even said the bishop 
 i declare to you continued the senator that the marquis pyrrhon hobbes and m naigeon are no rascals i have all the philosophers in my library gilded on the edges 
 like yourself count interposed the bishop 
 the senator resumed 
 i hate diderot he is an ideologist a declaimer and a revolutionist a believer in god at bottom and more bigoted than voltaire voltaire made sport of needham and he was wrong for eels prove that god is useless 
 a drop of vinegar in a spoonful of flour paste supplies the fiat lux 
 suppose the drop to be larger and the spoonful bigger you have the world 
 man is the eel then what is the good of the eternal father 
 the jehovah hypothesis tires me bishop 
 it is good for nothing but to produce shallow people whose reasoning is hollow 
 down with that great all which torments me hurrah for zero which leaves me in peace 
 between you and me and in order to empty my sack and make confession to my pastor as it behooves me to do i will admit to you that i have good sense i am not enthusiastic over your jesus who preaches renunciation and sacrifice to the last extremity 
 tis the counsel of an avaricious man to beggars 
 renunciation why 
 sacrifice to what end i do not see one wolf immolating himself for the happiness of another wolf 
 let us stick to nature then 
 we are at the top let us have a superior philosophy 
 what is the advantage of being at the top if one sees no further than the end of other noses 
 let us live merrily 
 life is all 
 that man has another future elsewhere on high below anywhere i believe not one single word of it 
 ah sacrifice and renunciation are recommended to me i must take heed to everything i do i must cudgel my brains over good and evil over the just and the unjust over the fas and the nefas 
 why 
 because i shall have to render an account of my actions 
 when 
 after death 
 what a fine dream after my death it will be a very clever person who can catch me have a handful of dust seized by a if you can let us tell the truth we who are initiated and who have raised the veil of isis 
 there is no such thing as either good or evil there is vegetation 
 let us seek the real 
 let us get to the bottom of it 
 let us go into it thoroughly 
 what the deuce let us go to the bottom of it 
 we must scent out the truth dig in the earth for it and seize it 
 then it gives you exquisite joys then you grow strong and you laugh 
 i am square on the bottom i am 
 immortality bishop is a chance a waiting for dead shoes 
 ah what a charming promise trust to it if you like what a fine lot adam has 
 we are souls and we shall be angels with blue wings on our do come to my assistance is it not tertullian who says that the blessed shall travel from star to star 
 very well 
 we shall be the grasshoppers of the stars and then besides we shall see god 
 ta ta ta 
 what twaddle all these paradises are 
 god is a nonsensical monster 
 i would not say that in the moniteur egad but i may whisper it among friends inter pocula 
 to sacrifice the world to paradise is to let slip the prey for the shadow 
 be the dupe of the infinite not such a fool 
 i am a nought 
 i call myself monsieur le comte nought senator 
 did i exist before my birth 
 no shall i exist after death 
 no what am i 
 a little dust collected in an organism what am i to do on this earth 
 the choice rests with me suffer or enjoy 
 whither will suffering lead me 
 to nothingness but i shall have suffered 
 whither will enjoyment lead me to nothingness but i shall have enjoyed myself 
 my choice is made one must eat or be eaten 
 i shall eat 
 it is better to be the tooth than the grass 
 such is my wisdom 
 after which go whither i push thee the is there the pantheon for some of us all falls into the great hole

 a new hope 
 viii 
 
 solo was busily checking readouts from gauges and dials in the hold he would pass a small box across various sensors study the result andcluck with pleasure 
 you can stop worrying about your imperial friends he told luke and never be able to track us now told you lose them 
 kenobi might have nodded briefly in response but he was engaged in explainingsomething to luke 
 everybody thank me at once solo grunted slightly miffed computer calculates our arrival in alderaan orbit at after this little adventure have to forge a new registration 
 he returned to his checking passing in front of a small circular table the topwas covered with small squares lit from beneath while computer monitors were setinto each side tiny figures were projected above the tabletopfrom various squares 
 chewbacca sat hunched over on side of the table his chin resting in massivehands his great eyes glowing and facial whiskers wrinkled upward he gave everysign of being well pleased with himself 
 at least he did until artoo detoo reached up with a stubby clawed limb acrossfrom him and tapped his own computer monitor one of the figures walked abruptlyacross the board to a new square and stopped there 
 an expression of puzzlement then anger crossed the face as he studiedthe new configuration glaring up and over the table he vented a stream of abusivegibberish on the inoffensive machine artoo could only beep in reply but threepiosoon interceded on behalf of his less eloquent companion and began arguing with thehulking anthropoid 
 he executed a fair move screaming about it help you 
 attracted by the commotion solo looked back over his shoulder frowningslightly let him have it your way ahead anyhow not wise to upseta wookie 
 i can sympathize with that opinion sir threepio countered but there isprinciple at stake here there are certain standards any sentient creature must holdto if one compromises them for any reason including intimidation then one isabrogating his right to be called intelligent 
 i hope both remember that solo advised him when chewbacca ispulling the arms off you and your little friend 
 besides that however threepio continued without missing a beat beinggreedy or taking advantage of someone in a weakened position is a clear sign of poorsportsmanship 
 that elicited a beep of outrage from artoo and the two robots were soonengaged in violent electronic argument while chewbacca continued jabbering at eachin turn occasionally waving at them though the translucent pieces waiting patientlyon the board 
 oblivious to the altercation luke stood frozen in the middle of the hold heheld an activated lightsaber in position over his head a low hum came from theancient instrument while luke lunged and parried under ben instructivegaze as solo glanced from time to time at awkward movements his leanfeatures were sprinkled with smugness 
 no luke you cuts should flow not be so choppy kenobi instructed the force is omnipresent it envelops you as it radiates from you ajedi warrior can actually feel the force as a physical thing 
 it is an energy field then luke inquired 
 an energy field and something more kenobi went on almost aura that at once controls and obeys it is a nothingness that can accomplishmiracles he looked thoughtful for a moment 
 no one not even the jedi scientists were able to truly define the no one ever will sometimes there is as much magic as science in theexplanations of the force yet what is a magician but a practicing theorist try again 
 the old man was hefting a silvery globe about the size of a fist it wascovered with fine antennae some as delicate as those of a moth he flipped ittoward luke and watched as it halted a couple of meters away from the face 
 luke readied himself as the ball circled him slowly turning to face it as itassumed a new position abruptly it executed a lunge only to freezeabout a meter away luke failed to succumb to the feint and the balls soon backedoff 
 moving slowly to one side in an effort to get around the fore sensors lukedrew the saber back preparatory to striking as he did so the ball darted in behindhim a thin pencil of red light jumped from one of the antennae to the back thigh knocking him to the deck even as he was bringing his saber late 
 rubbing at his tingling sleeping leg luke tried to ignore the burst of accusinglaughter from solo religions and archaic weapons are no substitutefor a good blaster at your side the pilot sneered 
 you believe in the force asked luke struggling back to his feet thenumbing effect of the beam wore off quickly 
 been from one end of this galaxy to the other the pilot boasted and a lot of strange things to many to believe there be something like too many to think that there could be some such controlling determine my some energy field he gestured towardkenobi i follow him so blindly if i were you a clever old of simple tricks and mischief he might be using you for his own ends 
 kenobi only smiled gently then turned back to face luke i suggest you try itagain luke he said soothingly you must try to divorce your actions fromconscious control try not to focus on anything concrete visually or mentally youmust let your mind drift drift only then can you use the force you have to enter astate in which you act on what you sense not on what you think beforehand youmust cease cogitation relax stop thinkinglet yourself driftfreefree 
 the old voice had dropped to a mesmerizing buzz as he finished thechrome bulb darted at luke dazed by hypnotic tone luke see itcharge doubtful he saw much of anything with clarity but as the ball whirled with amazing speed the saber arcing up and out in a peculiar red beam that the globe emitted was neatly deflected to one side it hummingstopped and the ball bounced to the deck all animation gone 
 blinking as if coming awake from a short nap luke stared in absoluteastonishment at the inert remote 
 you see you can do it kenobi told him one can teach only so you must learn to admit the force when you want it so that you can learn tocontrol it consciously 
 moving to one side kenobi took a large helmet from behind a locker and walkedover to luke placing the helmet over his head effectively eliminated the 
 i see luke muttered turning around and forcing kenobi to step back outof range of the dangerously wavering saber how can i fight 
 with the force old ben explained you really see the seeker whenyou parried its beam try to let that sensation flow within you again 
 i do it luke moaned get hit again 
 not if you let yourself trust you kenobi insisted none too convincingly forluke this is the only way to be certain replying wholly on the force 
 noticing that the corellian had turned to watch kenobi hesitated did luke no good to have the pilot laugh every time a mistake wasmade but coddling the boy would do him no good either and there was no time forit anyway throw him in and hope he floats ben instructed himself firmly 
 bending over the chrome globe he touched a control at its side then he tossedit straight up it arched toward luke braking in midfall the ball toward the deck luke swung the saber at it while it was acommendable try it nearly fast enough once again the little antenna time the crimson needle hit luke square on the seat of his pants though an incapacitating below it felt like one and luke let out a yelp of pain as hespun trying to strike his invisible tormentor 
 relax old ben urged him be free trying to use your eyes andears stop predicting and use the rest of your mind 
 suddenly the youth stopped waving slightly the seeker was still behind direction again it made another dive and fired 
 simultaneously the lightsaber jerked around as accurate as it was awkward in itsmotion to deflect the bolt this time the ball fall motionless to the it backed up three meters and remained there hovering 
 aware that the drone of the seeker remote no longer assaulted his ears a cautiousluke peeked out from under the helmet sweat and exhaustion competed for spaceon his face 
 did i 
 i told you you could kenobi informed him with pleasure once you start totrust your inner self be no stopping you i told you there was much of yourfather in you 
 call it luck snorted solo as he concluded his examination of the readouts 
 in my experience there is no such thing as luck my young highlyfavorable adjustments of multiple factors to incline events in favor 
 call it what you like the corellian sniffed indifferently but good against amechanical remote is one thing good against a living menace is another 
 as he was speaking a small telltale light on the far side of the hold had begunflashing chewbacca noticed it and called out to him 
 solo glanced at the board then informed his passengers coming up onalderaan be slowing down shortly and going back under lightspeed comeon chewie 
 rising from the game table the wookie followed his partner toward the watched them depart but his mind on their imminent arrival at was burning with something else something that seemed to grow and mature at theback of his brain as he dwelt on it 
 you know he murmured i did feel something i could almost see theoutlines of the remote he gestured at the hovering device behind him 
 voice when he replied was solemn luke taken the first stepinto a larger universe 
 dozens of humming buzzing instruments lent the cockpit the air of abusy hive solo and chewbacca had their attention locked on the most vital of thoseinstruments 
 steadystand by chewie solo adjusted several manual to go sublightreadycut us in chewie 
 the wookie turned something on the console before him at the same timesolo pulled back on a comparatively large lever abruptly the long streaks starlight slowed to hyphen shapes then finally to familiar bolts offire a gauge on the console registered zero 
 gigantic chunks of glowing stone appeared out of the nothingness barelyshunted aside by the deflectors the strain caused the millennium falcon tobegin shuddering violently 
 what the a thoroughly startled solo muttered next to him chewbaccaoffered no comment of his own as he flipped off several controls and activated the fact that the cautious solo always emerged from supralight travel with hisdeflectors in case any of many unfriendly folks might be waiting for saved the freighter from instant destruction 
 luke fought to keep his balance as he made his way into the cockpit on 
 back in normal space solo informed him but come out in themiddle of the worst asteroid storm ever seen not on any of our peered hard at several indicators according to the galactic atlas our position iscorrect only one thing is missing alderaan 
 missing crazy 
 i argue with you the corellian replied grimly but look for gestured out the port the coordinates and nothingwrong with the we ought to be standing out one planetary diameter fromthe surface the glow should be filling the cockpit nothing outthere nothing but debris he paused judging from the level of wild energyoutside and the amount of solid waste guess that been blown 
 destroyed luke whispered overwhelmed at the specter raised by such anunimaginable disaster 
 the empire a voice declared firmly ben kenobi had come in behind his attention was held by the emptiness ahead as well as the import behind it 
 no solo was shaking his head slowly in his own way even he was stunnedby the enormity of what the old man was suggesting that a human agency had beenresponsible for the annihilation of an entire population of a planet itself 
 nothe entire imperial fleet have done this it would take athousand ships massing a lot more firepower than has ever existed 
 i wonder if we should get out of here luke was murmuring trying to seearound the rims of the port if by some chance it was the empire 
 i know happened here an angry solo cursed but tell you onething the empire 
 muffled alarms began humming loudly as a synchronous light flashed on thecontrol console solo bent to the appropriate instrumentation 
 another ship he announced judge the type yet 
 a survivor who might know what happened luke venturedhopefully 
 ben next words shattered more than that hope an imperialfighter 
 chewbacca suddenly gave an angry bark a huge flower of destructionblossomed outside the port battering the freighter violently a tiny raced past the cockpit port 
 it followed us luke shouted 
 from tatooine it have objected a disbelieving solo not inhyperspace 
 kenobi was studying the configuration the tracking screen displayed right han the tie fighter 
 but where did it come from the corellian wanted to know there are noimperial bases near here it have been a tie job 
 you saw it pass 
 i know it looked like a tie what about a base 
 leaving in a big hurry luke noted studying the tracker no matterwhere going if it identifies us in big trouble 
 not if i can help it solo declared chewie jam its transmission lay in apursuit course 
 it would be best to let it go kenobi ventured thoughtfully already toofar out of range 
 not for long 
 several minutes followed during which the cockpit was filled with a tensesilence al eyes were on the tracking screen and viewport 
 at first the imperial fighter tried a complex evasive course to no avail thesurprisingly maneuverable freighter hung tight on its tail continuing to make up thedistance between them seeing that he shape his pursuers the fighter pilothad obviously opened up his tiny engine all the way 
 ahead one of the multitudes of stars was becoming steadily brighter lukefrowned they were moving fast but not nearly fast enough for any heavenly objectto brighten so rapidly something here make sense 
 impossible for a fighter that small to be this deep in space on its own soloobserved 
 it must have gotten lost been part of a convoy or something lukehypothesized 
 comment was gleeful well he be around long enough to tellanyone about us be on top of him in a minute or two 
 the star ahead continued to brighten its glow evidently coming from within itassumed a circular outline 
 heading for that small moon luke murmured 
 the empire must have an outpost there solo admitted although accordingto the atlas alderaan had no moons he shrugged it off galactic topographywas never one of my best subjects only interested in worlds and moons withcustomers on them but i think i can get him before he gets there almost inrange 
 they drew steadily nearer gradually craters and mountains on the moonbecame visible yet there was something extremely odd about them the craterswere far too regular in outline the mountains far too vertical canyons and valleyimpossibly straight and regularized nothing as capricious as volcanic action hadformed those features 
 no moon kenobi breathed softly a space station 
 but too big to be a space station solo objected the size of it it 
 i have a very strange feeling about this was comment 
 abruptly the usually calm kenobi was shouting turn the ship around out of here 
 yes i think right old man full reverse chewie 
 the wookie started adjusting controls and the freighter seemed to slow arcingaround in a broad curve the tiny fighter leaped instantly toward the monstrousstation until it was swallowed up by its overpowering bulk 
 chewbacca chattered something at solo as the ship shook and strained againstunseen forces 
 lock in auxiliary power solo ordered 
 gauges began to whine in protest and by ones and twos every instrument on thecontrol console sequentially went berserk try as he might solo keep thesurface of the gargantuan station from looming steadily larger it becamethe heavens 
 luke stared wildly at secondary installations as big as mountains dish antennaelarger than all of mos eisley why are we still moving toward it 
 too late kenobi whispered softly a glance at solo confirmed his concern 
 caught in a tractor on i ever saw dragging us pilot muttered 
 you mean nothing you can do luke asked feeling unbelievablyhelpless 
 solo studied the overloaded sensor readouts and shook his head not againstthis kind of power on full power myself kid and not shifting out of coursea fraction of a degree no use going to have to shut down or meltour engines but not going to suck me up like so much dust without a fight 
 he started to vacate the chair but was restrained by an aged yet powerfulhand on his shoulder an expression of concern was on the old suggestion of something somewhat less funereal 
 if a fight you cannot my boy there are always alternatives tofighting 
 the true size of the battle station became apparent as the freighter was pulledcloser and closer running around the equator was an artificial cluster ofmetal mountains docking ports stretching beckoning fingers nearly two kilometersabove the surface 
 now only a miniscule speck against the gray bulk of the station the millenniumfalcon was sucked toward one of those steel pseudopods and finally swallowed by lake of metal closed off the entryway and the freighter vanished as if it had neverexisted 
 vader stared at the motley array of stars displayed on the mapwhile tarkin and admiral motti conferred nearby interestingly the first use of themost powerful destructive machine ever constructed had seemingly had no influenceat all on that map which in itself represented only a tiny fraction of this section of galaxy 
 it would take a microbreakdown of a portion of this map to reveal a slightreduction in spatial mass caused by the disappearance of alderaan alderaan withits many cities farms factories and traitors vader reminded himself 
 despite his advances and intricate technological methods of annihilation theactions of mankind remained unnoticeable to an uncaring unimaginably vast grandest plans ever came to pass all that would change 
 he was well aware that despite all their intelligence and drive the vastness andwonder were lost on the two men who continued to chatter monkeylike behind and motti were talented and ambitious but they saw things only on the scale ofhuman pettiness it was a pity vader thought that they did not possess the scope tomatch their abilities 
 still neither man was a dark lord as such little more could be expected ofthem these two were useful now and dangerous but someday they like have to be swept aside for now he could not afford to ignore them andwhile he would have preferred the company of equals he had to admit reluctantly thatat this point he had no equals 
 nonetheless he turned to them and insinuated himself into their defense systems on alderaan despite the protestations to the as strong as any in the empire i should conclude that our demonstration wasas impressive as it was thorough 
 tarkin turned to him nodding the senate is being informed of our action atthis very moment soon we will be able to announce the extermination of thealliance itself as soon as we have dealt with their main military base now thattheir main source of munitions alderaan has been eliminated the rest of thosesystems with secessionist inclinations will fall in line quickly enough see 
 tarkin turned as an imperial officer entered the chamber yes what is 
 the unlucky officer wore the expression of the mouse chosen to bell the the advance scouts have reached and circumnavigated dantooine theyhave found the remains of a rebel base which they estimate has been deserted forsome time years possibly they are proceeding with an extensive survey of theremainder of the system 
 tarkin turned apoplectic his face darkening to a fine pomegranate fury shelied she lied to us 
 no one could see but it seemed that vader must have smiled behind his we are even in the first exchange of truths i told you she would neverbetray the she thought her confession could somehow destroy us inthe process 
 terminate her immediately the governor was barely able to form words 
 calm yourself tarkin vader advised him you would throw away our onlylink to the real rebel base so casually she can still be of value to us 
 fagh you just said it yourself vader get nothing more out of her that hidden fortress if i have to destroy every star system in this sector 
 a quiet yet demanding beep interrupted him yes what is it he inquiredirritably 
 a voice reported over an unseen speaker sirs captured a smallfreighter that was entering the remains of alderaan a standard check indicates thatits markings apparently match that of the ship which blasted its way out of thequarantine at mos eisley tatooine system and went hyper before the imperialblockade craft there could close on it 
 tarkin looked puzzled mos eisley tatooine what is this thisall about vader 
 it means tarkin that the last of our unresolved difficulties is about to beeliminated someone apparently received the missing data tapes learned whotranscribed them and was trying to return them to her we may be able to facilitatetheir meeting with the senator 
 tarkin started to say something hesitated then nodded in understanding howconvenient i leave this matter in your hands vader 
 the dark lord bowed slightly a gesture which tarkin acknowledged withperfunctory salute then he spun and strode from the room leaving motti lookingfrom man to man in confusion 
 the freighter sat listlessly in the docking hangar of the huge bay thirty armedimperial troopers stood before the lowered man ramp leading into the ship theysnapped to attention when vader and a commander approached vader halted at thebase of the ramp studying the vessel as an officer and several soldiers came forward 
 there was no reply to our repeated signals sir so we activated the ramp fromoutside made no contact with anyone aboard either by communicator or inperson the officer reported 
 send your men in vader ordered 
 turning the officer relayed to command to a noncom who barked orders anumber of the heavily armored soldiers made their way up the ramp and entered theouter hold they advanced with appreciable caution 
 inside two men covered a third as he advanced moving in groups of three inthis fashion they rapidly spread through the ship corridors rang hollowly feet and doors slid aside willingly as they were activated 
 empty the sergeant in charge finally declared in surprise check thecockpit 
 several troopers made their way forward and slid the portal aside only todiscover the chairs as vacant as the rest of the freighter the controls weredeactivated and all systems shut down only a single light on the console winked onand off fitfully the sergeant moved forward recognized the source of the light andactivated the appropriate controls a printout appeared on a nearby screen hestudied it intently then turned to convey the information to his superior who waswaiting by the main hatch 
 that worthy listened carefully before he turned and called down to thecommander and vader there is no one aboard the ship is completely according to the log her crew abandoned ship immediately after set her on automatics for alderaan 
 possibly a decoy the commander ventured aloud then they should still beon tatooine 
 possibly vader admitted reluctantly 
 several of the escape pods have been jettisoned the officer went on 
 did you find any droids on board vader called 
 no if there were any they must have abandoned the ship alongwith the organic crew 
 vader hesitated before replying when he did so uncertainty was evident in hisvoice this feel right send a fully equipped scanning team on board iwant every centimeter of that ship checked out see to it as soon as that he whirled and stalked from the hangar pursued by the infuriating feelingthat he was overlooking something of vital importance 
 the rest of the assembled soldiers were dismissed by the officer on board thefreighter a last long figure left off examining the space beneath the cockpit consolesand ran to join his comrades he was anxious to be off this ghost ship and back inthe comfortable surroundings of the barracks his heavy footsteps echoed throughthe once more empty freighter 
 below the muffled sounds of the officer giving final orders faded leaving theinterior in complete quiet the quivering of a portion of the floor was the onlymovement on board 
 abruptly the quivering became a sharp upheaval two metal panels poppedupward followed by a pair of tousled heads han solo and luke looked aroundquickly then managed to relax a little when it became clear that the ship was as emptyas it sounded 
 lucky built these compartments luke commented 
 solo was not as cheerily confident where did you think i kept the main hold i admit i never expected to smuggle myself in started violently at a sudden sound but it was only another of the panels shiftingaside 
 this is ridiculous it going to work even if i could take off and getpast the closed jabbed a thumb never get past that tractorbeam 
 another panel opened revealing the face of an elderly imp you leave that tome 
 i was afraid say something like that muttered solo a damnfool old man 
 kenobi grinned at him what does that say of the man who allows himself tobe hired by a fool 
 solo muttered something under his breath as they pulled themselves clear of thecompartments chewbacca doing so with a good deal of grunting and twisting 
 two technicians had arrived at the base of the ramp they reported to the twobored soldiers guarding it 
 the all yours one of the troopers told them if the scanners pick upanything report it immediately 
 the men nodded then strained to lug their heavy equipment up the ramp assoon as they disappeared inside a loud crash was heard both guards whirled thenheard a voice call hey down there could you give us a hand with this 
 one trooper looked at his companion who shrugged they both started up theramp muttering at the inefficiency of mere technicians a second crashing soundreverberated but now there was no one left to hear it 
 but the absence of the two troopers was noticed soon thereafter a gantryofficer passing the window of a small command office near the freighter entranceglanced out frowning when he saw no sign of the guards concerned but notalarmed he moved to a comlink and spoke into it as he continued to stare at the ship 
 thx why you at your post thx do you copy 
 the speaker gave back only static 
 thx why you reply the officer was beginning to panic whenan armored figure descended the ramp and waved toward him pointing to theportion of his helmet covering his right ear the figure tapped it to indicate thecomlink inside working 
 shaking his head in disgust the gantry officer gave his busy aide an annoyedlook as he made for the door take over here got another bad going to see what i can do he activated the door took a step forward as it stumbled backward in a state of shock 
 filling the door completely was a towering hairy form chewbacca leanedinward and with a howl flattened the benumbed officer with oneswipe of a fist 
 the aide was already on his feet and reaching for his sidearm when a narrowenergy beam passed completely through him piercing his heart solo flipped up thefaceplate of his trooper helmet then slid it back into place as he followed the wookieinto the room kenobi and the droids squeezed in behind him with luke also cladin the armor of a luckless imperial soldier bringing up the rear 
 luke was looking around nervously as he shut the door behind them betweenhis howling and your blasting everything in sight a wonder the entire know here 
 bring em on solo demanded unreasonably enthused by their success so prefer a straight fight to all this sneaking in a hurry to die luke snapped but not all this sneakingaround has kept us alive 
 the corellian gave luke a sour eye but said nothing 
 they watched as kenobi operated an incredibly complex computer console withthe ease and confidence of one long accustomed to handling intricate machinery ascreen lit up promptly with a map of sections of the battle station the old manleaned forward scrutinizing the display carefully 
 meanwhile threepio and artoo had been going over an equally complicatedcontrol panel nearby artoo suddenly froze and began whistling wildly at somethinghe had found solo and luke their momentary disagreement over tactics over to where the robots were standing chewbacca busied himself hangingthe gentry officer up by his toes 
 plug him in kenobi suggested looking over from his place before the largerreadout he should be able to draw information from the entire station see if he can find out where the tractor beam power unit is located 
 why not just disconnect the beam from here sir luke wanted to know 
 it was solo who replied derisively what and have them lock it right back on usbefore we can get a length outside the docking bay 
 luke looked crestfallen oh i thought of that 
 we have to break the tractor at its power source in order to execute a cleanescape luke old ben chided gently as artoo punched a claw arm into the opencomputer socket he had discovered immediately a galaxy of lights came to life onthe panel in front of him and the room was filled with the hum of machinery workingat high speed 
 several minutes passed while the little droid sucked up information like a metalsponge then the hum slowed and he turned to beep something back at them 
 found it sir threepio announced excitedly 
 the tractor beam is coupled to the main reactors at seven locations most ofthe pertinent data is restricted but try to pull the critical information through tothe monitor 
 kenobi turned his attention from the larger screen to a small readout near began to race across it too fast for luke to see but apparently kenobi somehowmade something of the schematic blur i think any way you boys canhelp with this he told them i must go alone 
 that suits me fine said solo readily already done more than ibargained for on this trip but i think putting that tractor beam out of to take more than your magic old man 
 luke put off so easily i want to go with you 
 be impatient young luke this requires skills you yet and wait for my signal they must be delivered to the rebel forces or manymore worlds will meet the same fate as alderaan trust in the force 
 with a last look at the flow of information on the monitor kenobi adjusted thelightsaber at his waist stepping to the door he slid it aside looked once left onceright and disappeared down a long glowing hallway 
 as soon as he was gone chewbacca growled and solo nodded said it chewie he turned to luke you dig up that old fossil 
 ben a great man luke protested loftily 
 great at getting us into trouble solo snorted general my not going to get us out of here 
 you got any better ideas luke shot back challengingly 
 anything would be better than just waiting here for them to come and pick usup if we 
 a hysterical whistling and hooting came from the computer console lukehurried over to artoo detoo the little droid was all but hopping about on stubbylegs 
 what now luke asked threepio 
 the taller robot looked puzzled himself afraid i understand he says i found her and keeps repeating here here 
 who who has he found 
 artoo turned a flat blinking face toward luke and whistled frantically 
 princess leia the announced after listening carefully senator seem to be one and the same i believe she may be the person in the message hewas carrying 
 that portrait of indescribable beauty coalesced in mindagain the princess here 
 attracted by the commotion solo wandered over princess goingon 
 where where is she luke demanded breathlessly ignoring solocompletely 
 artoo whistled on while threepio translated level five detention block aa according to the information she is scheduled for slow termination 
 no got to do something 
 what are you three blabbering about an exasperated solo demanded 
 the one who programmed the message into artoo detoo luke explainedhurriedly the one we were trying to deliver to alderaan got to help her 
 now just a minute solo cautioned him this is going awful fast for get any funny ideas when i said i have any better ideas i meant old man said to wait here i like it but not going off on some crazymaze through this place 
 but ben know she was here luke half pleaded half argued surethat if he knew he would have changed his plans anxiety turned to if we could just figure a way to get into that detention block 
 solo shook his head and stepped back not going into anyimperial detention blocks 
 if we do something going to execute her a minute ago you saidyou just want to sit here and wait to be captured now all you want to do isstay which is it han 
 the corellian looked confused marching into a not what i had in mind likely to end up there rush it 
 but going to execute her 
 better her than me 
 your sense of chivalry han 
 solo considered near as i can recall i traded it for a chrysopaz andthree bottles of good brandy about five years ago on commenor 
 seen her luke persisted desperately beautiful 
 life 
 a rich and powerful senator luke pressed hoping an appeal to instincts might be more effective if we could save her the reward could besubstantial 
 uhrich then solo looked disdainful wait a minutereward fromwhom from the government on alderaan he made a sweeping gesture towardthe hangar and by implication the space where alderaan had once orbited 
 luke thought furiously if being held here and is scheduled to beexecuted that means she must be dangerous in some way to whoever destroyedalderaan to whoever had this station built you can bet it had something to do withthe empire instituting a reign of full repression 
 tell you pay for her rescue and for the information she holds thesenate the rebel alliance and every concern that did business with alderaan shecould be the sole surviving heir of the wealth of the entire system thereward could be more than you can imagine 
 i knowi can imagine quite a bit he glanced at chewbacca whogrunted a terse reply solo shrugged back at the big wookie all right giveit a try but better be right about that reward your plan kid 
 luke was momentarily taken aback al his energies up till now had beenconcentrated on persuading solo and chewbacca to aid in a rescue attempt thataccomplished luke became aware he had no idea how to proceed he had grownused to old ben and solo giving directions now the next move was up to him 
 his eyes were caught by several metal circlets dangling from the belt of give me those binders and tell chewbacca to come over there 
 solo handed luke the thin but quite unbreakable cuffs and relayed the request tochewbacca the wookie lumbered over and stood waiting next to luke 
 now going to put these on you luke began starting to move behind thewookie with the cuffs and 
 chewbacca made a sound low in his throat and luke jumped in spite of he began again han is going to put these on you and he sheepishlyhanded the binders to solo uncomfortably aware of the enormous eyes on him 
 solo sounded amused as he moved forward worry chewie i think iknow what he has in mind 
 the cuffs barely fit around the thick wrists despite his seemingconfidence in the plan the wookie wore a worried frightened look as the restraintswere activated 
 luke sir luke looked over at threepio pardon me for asking but should artoo and i do if someone discovers us here in your absence 
 hope they have blasters solo replied 
 tone indicated he find the answer humorous that veryreassuring 
 solo and luke were too engrossed in their coming expedition to pay muchattention to the worried robot they adjusted their helmets then with chewbaccawearing a downcast expression they started off along corridor where benkenobi had disappeared

 a new hope 
 viii 
 
 solo was busily checking readouts from gauges and dials in the hold he would pass a small box across various sensors study the result andcluck with pleasure 
 you can stop worrying about your imperial friends he told luke and never be able to track us now told you lose them 
 kenobi might have nodded briefly in response but he was engaged in explainingsomething to luke 
 everybody thank me at once solo grunted slightly miffed computer calculates our arrival in alderaan orbit at after this little adventure have to forge a new registration 
 he returned to his checking passing in front of a small circular table the topwas covered with small squares lit from beneath while computer monitors were setinto each side tiny figures were projected above the tabletopfrom various squares 
 chewbacca sat hunched over on side of the table his chin resting in massivehands his great eyes glowing and facial whiskers wrinkled upward he gave everysign of being well pleased with himself 
 at least he did until artoo detoo reached up with a stubby clawed limb acrossfrom him and tapped his own computer monitor one of the figures walked abruptlyacross the board to a new square and stopped there 
 an expression of puzzlement then anger crossed the face as he studiedthe new configuration glaring up and over the table he vented a stream of abusivegibberish on the inoffensive machine artoo could only beep in reply but threepiosoon interceded on behalf of his less eloquent companion and began arguing with thehulking anthropoid 
 he executed a fair move screaming about it help you 
 attracted by the commotion solo looked back over his shoulder frowningslightly let him have it your way ahead anyhow not wise to upseta wookie 
 i can sympathize with that opinion sir threepio countered but there isprinciple at stake here there are certain standards any sentient creature must holdto if one compromises them for any reason including intimidation then one isabrogating his right to be called intelligent 
 i hope both remember that solo advised him when chewbacca ispulling the arms off you and your little friend 
 besides that however threepio continued without missing a beat beinggreedy or taking advantage of someone in a weakened position is a clear sign of poorsportsmanship 
 that elicited a beep of outrage from artoo and the two robots were soonengaged in violent electronic argument while chewbacca continued jabbering at eachin turn occasionally waving at them though the translucent pieces waiting patientlyon the board 
 oblivious to the altercation luke stood frozen in the middle of the hold heheld an activated lightsaber in position over his head a low hum came from theancient instrument while luke lunged and parried under ben instructivegaze as solo glanced from time to time at awkward movements his leanfeatures were sprinkled with smugness 
 no luke you cuts should flow not be so choppy kenobi instructed the force is omnipresent it envelops you as it radiates from you ajedi warrior can actually feel the force as a physical thing 
 it is an energy field then luke inquired 
 an energy field and something more kenobi went on almost aura that at once controls and obeys it is a nothingness that can accomplishmiracles he looked thoughtful for a moment 
 no one not even the jedi scientists were able to truly define the no one ever will sometimes there is as much magic as science in theexplanations of the force yet what is a magician but a practicing theorist try again 
 the old man was hefting a silvery globe about the size of a fist it wascovered with fine antennae some as delicate as those of a moth he flipped ittoward luke and watched as it halted a couple of meters away from the face 
 luke readied himself as the ball circled him slowly turning to face it as itassumed a new position abruptly it executed a lunge only to freezeabout a meter away luke failed to succumb to the feint and the balls soon backedoff 
 moving slowly to one side in an effort to get around the fore sensors lukedrew the saber back preparatory to striking as he did so the ball darted in behindhim a thin pencil of red light jumped from one of the antennae to the back thigh knocking him to the deck even as he was bringing his saber late 
 rubbing at his tingling sleeping leg luke tried to ignore the burst of accusinglaughter from solo religions and archaic weapons are no substitutefor a good blaster at your side the pilot sneered 
 you believe in the force asked luke struggling back to his feet thenumbing effect of the beam wore off quickly 
 been from one end of this galaxy to the other the pilot boasted and a lot of strange things to many to believe there be something like too many to think that there could be some such controlling determine my some energy field he gestured towardkenobi i follow him so blindly if i were you a clever old of simple tricks and mischief he might be using you for his own ends 
 kenobi only smiled gently then turned back to face luke i suggest you try itagain luke he said soothingly you must try to divorce your actions fromconscious control try not to focus on anything concrete visually or mentally youmust let your mind drift drift only then can you use the force you have to enter astate in which you act on what you sense not on what you think beforehand youmust cease cogitation relax stop thinkinglet yourself driftfreefree 
 the old voice had dropped to a mesmerizing buzz as he finished thechrome bulb darted at luke dazed by hypnotic tone luke see itcharge doubtful he saw much of anything with clarity but as the ball whirled with amazing speed the saber arcing up and out in a peculiar red beam that the globe emitted was neatly deflected to one side it hummingstopped and the ball bounced to the deck all animation gone 
 blinking as if coming awake from a short nap luke stared in absoluteastonishment at the inert remote 
 you see you can do it kenobi told him one can teach only so you must learn to admit the force when you want it so that you can learn tocontrol it consciously 
 moving to one side kenobi took a large helmet from behind a locker and walkedover to luke placing the helmet over his head effectively eliminated the 
 i see luke muttered turning around and forcing kenobi to step back outof range of the dangerously wavering saber how can i fight 
 with the force old ben explained you really see the seeker whenyou parried its beam try to let that sensation flow within you again 
 i do it luke moaned get hit again 
 not if you let yourself trust you kenobi insisted none too convincingly forluke this is the only way to be certain replying wholly on the force 
 noticing that the corellian had turned to watch kenobi hesitated did luke no good to have the pilot laugh every time a mistake wasmade but coddling the boy would do him no good either and there was no time forit anyway throw him in and hope he floats ben instructed himself firmly 
 bending over the chrome globe he touched a control at its side then he tossedit straight up it arched toward luke braking in midfall the ball toward the deck luke swung the saber at it while it was acommendable try it nearly fast enough once again the little antenna time the crimson needle hit luke square on the seat of his pants though an incapacitating below it felt like one and luke let out a yelp of pain as hespun trying to strike his invisible tormentor 
 relax old ben urged him be free trying to use your eyes andears stop predicting and use the rest of your mind 
 suddenly the youth stopped waving slightly the seeker was still behind direction again it made another dive and fired 
 simultaneously the lightsaber jerked around as accurate as it was awkward in itsmotion to deflect the bolt this time the ball fall motionless to the it backed up three meters and remained there hovering 
 aware that the drone of the seeker remote no longer assaulted his ears a cautiousluke peeked out from under the helmet sweat and exhaustion competed for spaceon his face 
 did i 
 i told you you could kenobi informed him with pleasure once you start totrust your inner self be no stopping you i told you there was much of yourfather in you 
 call it luck snorted solo as he concluded his examination of the readouts 
 in my experience there is no such thing as luck my young highlyfavorable adjustments of multiple factors to incline events in favor 
 call it what you like the corellian sniffed indifferently but good against amechanical remote is one thing good against a living menace is another 
 as he was speaking a small telltale light on the far side of the hold had begunflashing chewbacca noticed it and called out to him 
 solo glanced at the board then informed his passengers coming up onalderaan be slowing down shortly and going back under lightspeed comeon chewie 
 rising from the game table the wookie followed his partner toward the watched them depart but his mind on their imminent arrival at was burning with something else something that seemed to grow and mature at theback of his brain as he dwelt on it 
 you know he murmured i did feel something i could almost see theoutlines of the remote he gestured at the hovering device behind him 
 voice when he replied was solemn luke taken the first stepinto a larger universe 
 dozens of humming buzzing instruments lent the cockpit the air of abusy hive solo and chewbacca had their attention locked on the most vital of thoseinstruments 
 steadystand by chewie solo adjusted several manual to go sublightreadycut us in chewie 
 the wookie turned something on the console before him at the same timesolo pulled back on a comparatively large lever abruptly the long streaks starlight slowed to hyphen shapes then finally to familiar bolts offire a gauge on the console registered zero 
 gigantic chunks of glowing stone appeared out of the nothingness barelyshunted aside by the deflectors the strain caused the millennium falcon tobegin shuddering violently 
 what the a thoroughly startled solo muttered next to him chewbaccaoffered no comment of his own as he flipped off several controls and activated the fact that the cautious solo always emerged from supralight travel with hisdeflectors in case any of many unfriendly folks might be waiting for saved the freighter from instant destruction 
 luke fought to keep his balance as he made his way into the cockpit on 
 back in normal space solo informed him but come out in themiddle of the worst asteroid storm ever seen not on any of our peered hard at several indicators according to the galactic atlas our position iscorrect only one thing is missing alderaan 
 missing crazy 
 i argue with you the corellian replied grimly but look for gestured out the port the coordinates and nothingwrong with the we ought to be standing out one planetary diameter fromthe surface the glow should be filling the cockpit nothing outthere nothing but debris he paused judging from the level of wild energyoutside and the amount of solid waste guess that been blown 
 destroyed luke whispered overwhelmed at the specter raised by such anunimaginable disaster 
 the empire a voice declared firmly ben kenobi had come in behind his attention was held by the emptiness ahead as well as the import behind it 
 no solo was shaking his head slowly in his own way even he was stunnedby the enormity of what the old man was suggesting that a human agency had beenresponsible for the annihilation of an entire population of a planet itself 
 nothe entire imperial fleet have done this it would take athousand ships massing a lot more firepower than has ever existed 
 i wonder if we should get out of here luke was murmuring trying to seearound the rims of the port if by some chance it was the empire 
 i know happened here an angry solo cursed but tell you onething the empire 
 muffled alarms began humming loudly as a synchronous light flashed on thecontrol console solo bent to the appropriate instrumentation 
 another ship he announced judge the type yet 
 a survivor who might know what happened luke venturedhopefully 
 ben next words shattered more than that hope an imperialfighter 
 chewbacca suddenly gave an angry bark a huge flower of destructionblossomed outside the port battering the freighter violently a tiny raced past the cockpit port 
 it followed us luke shouted 
 from tatooine it have objected a disbelieving solo not inhyperspace 
 kenobi was studying the configuration the tracking screen displayed right han the tie fighter 
 but where did it come from the corellian wanted to know there are noimperial bases near here it have been a tie job 
 you saw it pass 
 i know it looked like a tie what about a base 
 leaving in a big hurry luke noted studying the tracker no matterwhere going if it identifies us in big trouble 
 not if i can help it solo declared chewie jam its transmission lay in apursuit course 
 it would be best to let it go kenobi ventured thoughtfully already toofar out of range 
 not for long 
 several minutes followed during which the cockpit was filled with a tensesilence al eyes were on the tracking screen and viewport 
 at first the imperial fighter tried a complex evasive course to no avail thesurprisingly maneuverable freighter hung tight on its tail continuing to make up thedistance between them seeing that he shape his pursuers the fighter pilothad obviously opened up his tiny engine all the way 
 ahead one of the multitudes of stars was becoming steadily brighter lukefrowned they were moving fast but not nearly fast enough for any heavenly objectto brighten so rapidly something here make sense 
 impossible for a fighter that small to be this deep in space on its own soloobserved 
 it must have gotten lost been part of a convoy or something lukehypothesized 
 comment was gleeful well he be around long enough to tellanyone about us be on top of him in a minute or two 
 the star ahead continued to brighten its glow evidently coming from within itassumed a circular outline 
 heading for that small moon luke murmured 
 the empire must have an outpost there solo admitted although accordingto the atlas alderaan had no moons he shrugged it off galactic topographywas never one of my best subjects only interested in worlds and moons withcustomers on them but i think i can get him before he gets there almost inrange 
 they drew steadily nearer gradually craters and mountains on the moonbecame visible yet there was something extremely odd about them the craterswere far too regular in outline the mountains far too vertical canyons and valleyimpossibly straight and regularized nothing as capricious as volcanic action hadformed those features 
 no moon kenobi breathed softly a space station 
 but too big to be a space station solo objected the size of it it 
 i have a very strange feeling about this was comment 
 abruptly the usually calm kenobi was shouting turn the ship around out of here 
 yes i think right old man full reverse chewie 
 the wookie started adjusting controls and the freighter seemed to slow arcingaround in a broad curve the tiny fighter leaped instantly toward the monstrousstation until it was swallowed up by its overpowering bulk 
 chewbacca chattered something at solo as the ship shook and strained againstunseen forces 
 lock in auxiliary power solo ordered 
 gauges began to whine in protest and by ones and twos every instrument on thecontrol console sequentially went berserk try as he might solo keep thesurface of the gargantuan station from looming steadily larger it becamethe heavens 
 luke stared wildly at secondary installations as big as mountains dish antennaelarger than all of mos eisley why are we still moving toward it 
 too late kenobi whispered softly a glance at solo confirmed his concern 
 caught in a tractor on i ever saw dragging us pilot muttered 
 you mean nothing you can do luke asked feeling unbelievablyhelpless 
 solo studied the overloaded sensor readouts and shook his head not againstthis kind of power on full power myself kid and not shifting out of coursea fraction of a degree no use going to have to shut down or meltour engines but not going to suck me up like so much dust without a fight 
 he started to vacate the chair but was restrained by an aged yet powerfulhand on his shoulder an expression of concern was on the old suggestion of something somewhat less funereal 
 if a fight you cannot my boy there are always alternatives tofighting 
 the true size of the battle station became apparent as the freighter was pulledcloser and closer running around the equator was an artificial cluster ofmetal mountains docking ports stretching beckoning fingers nearly two kilometersabove the surface 
 now only a miniscule speck against the gray bulk of the station the millenniumfalcon was sucked toward one of those steel pseudopods and finally swallowed by lake of metal closed off the entryway and the freighter vanished as if it had neverexisted 
 vader stared at the motley array of stars displayed on the mapwhile tarkin and admiral motti conferred nearby interestingly the first use of themost powerful destructive machine ever constructed had seemingly had no influenceat all on that map which in itself represented only a tiny fraction of this section of galaxy 
 it would take a microbreakdown of a portion of this map to reveal a slightreduction in spatial mass caused by the disappearance of alderaan alderaan withits many cities farms factories and traitors vader reminded himself 
 despite his advances and intricate technological methods of annihilation theactions of mankind remained unnoticeable to an uncaring unimaginably vast grandest plans ever came to pass all that would change 
 he was well aware that despite all their intelligence and drive the vastness andwonder were lost on the two men who continued to chatter monkeylike behind and motti were talented and ambitious but they saw things only on the scale ofhuman pettiness it was a pity vader thought that they did not possess the scope tomatch their abilities 
 still neither man was a dark lord as such little more could be expected ofthem these two were useful now and dangerous but someday they like have to be swept aside for now he could not afford to ignore them andwhile he would have preferred the company of equals he had to admit reluctantly thatat this point he had no equals 
 nonetheless he turned to them and insinuated himself into their defense systems on alderaan despite the protestations to the as strong as any in the empire i should conclude that our demonstration wasas impressive as it was thorough 
 tarkin turned to him nodding the senate is being informed of our action atthis very moment soon we will be able to announce the extermination of thealliance itself as soon as we have dealt with their main military base now thattheir main source of munitions alderaan has been eliminated the rest of thosesystems with secessionist inclinations will fall in line quickly enough see 
 tarkin turned as an imperial officer entered the chamber yes what is 
 the unlucky officer wore the expression of the mouse chosen to bell the the advance scouts have reached and circumnavigated dantooine theyhave found the remains of a rebel base which they estimate has been deserted forsome time years possibly they are proceeding with an extensive survey of theremainder of the system 
 tarkin turned apoplectic his face darkening to a fine pomegranate fury shelied she lied to us 
 no one could see but it seemed that vader must have smiled behind his we are even in the first exchange of truths i told you she would neverbetray the she thought her confession could somehow destroy us inthe process 
 terminate her immediately the governor was barely able to form words 
 calm yourself tarkin vader advised him you would throw away our onlylink to the real rebel base so casually she can still be of value to us 
 fagh you just said it yourself vader get nothing more out of her that hidden fortress if i have to destroy every star system in this sector 
 a quiet yet demanding beep interrupted him yes what is it he inquiredirritably 
 a voice reported over an unseen speaker sirs captured a smallfreighter that was entering the remains of alderaan a standard check indicates thatits markings apparently match that of the ship which blasted its way out of thequarantine at mos eisley tatooine system and went hyper before the imperialblockade craft there could close on it 
 tarkin looked puzzled mos eisley tatooine what is this thisall about vader 
 it means tarkin that the last of our unresolved difficulties is about to beeliminated someone apparently received the missing data tapes learned whotranscribed them and was trying to return them to her we may be able to facilitatetheir meeting with the senator 
 tarkin started to say something hesitated then nodded in understanding howconvenient i leave this matter in your hands vader 
 the dark lord bowed slightly a gesture which tarkin acknowledged withperfunctory salute then he spun and strode from the room leaving motti lookingfrom man to man in confusion 
 the freighter sat listlessly in the docking hangar of the huge bay thirty armedimperial troopers stood before the lowered man ramp leading into the ship theysnapped to attention when vader and a commander approached vader halted at thebase of the ramp studying the vessel as an officer and several soldiers came forward 
 there was no reply to our repeated signals sir so we activated the ramp fromoutside made no contact with anyone aboard either by communicator or inperson the officer reported 
 send your men in vader ordered 
 turning the officer relayed to command to a noncom who barked orders anumber of the heavily armored soldiers made their way up the ramp and entered theouter hold they advanced with appreciable caution 
 inside two men covered a third as he advanced moving in groups of three inthis fashion they rapidly spread through the ship corridors rang hollowly feet and doors slid aside willingly as they were activated 
 empty the sergeant in charge finally declared in surprise check thecockpit 
 several troopers made their way forward and slid the portal aside only todiscover the chairs as vacant as the rest of the freighter the controls weredeactivated and all systems shut down only a single light on the console winked onand off fitfully the sergeant moved forward recognized the source of the light andactivated the appropriate controls a printout appeared on a nearby screen hestudied it intently then turned to convey the information to his superior who waswaiting by the main hatch 
 that worthy listened carefully before he turned and called down to thecommander and vader there is no one aboard the ship is completely according to the log her crew abandoned ship immediately after set her on automatics for alderaan 
 possibly a decoy the commander ventured aloud then they should still beon tatooine 
 possibly vader admitted reluctantly 
 several of the escape pods have been jettisoned the officer went on 
 did you find any droids on board vader called 
 no if there were any they must have abandoned the ship alongwith the organic crew 
 vader hesitated before replying when he did so uncertainty was evident in hisvoice this feel right send a fully equipped scanning team on board iwant every centimeter of that ship checked out see to it as soon as that he whirled and stalked from the hangar pursued by the infuriating feelingthat he was overlooking something of vital importance 
 the rest of the assembled soldiers were dismissed by the officer on board thefreighter a last long figure left off examining the space beneath the cockpit consolesand ran to join his comrades he was anxious to be off this ghost ship and back inthe comfortable surroundings of the barracks his heavy footsteps echoed throughthe once more empty freighter 
 below the muffled sounds of the officer giving final orders faded leaving theinterior in complete quiet the quivering of a portion of the floor was the onlymovement on board 
 abruptly the quivering became a sharp upheaval two metal panels poppedupward followed by a pair of tousled heads han solo and luke looked aroundquickly then managed to relax a little when it became clear that the ship was as emptyas it sounded 
 lucky built these compartments luke commented 
 solo was not as cheerily confident where did you think i kept the main hold i admit i never expected to smuggle myself in started violently at a sudden sound but it was only another of the panels shiftingaside 
 this is ridiculous it going to work even if i could take off and getpast the closed jabbed a thumb never get past that tractorbeam 
 another panel opened revealing the face of an elderly imp you leave that tome 
 i was afraid say something like that muttered solo a damnfool old man 
 kenobi grinned at him what does that say of the man who allows himself tobe hired by a fool 
 solo muttered something under his breath as they pulled themselves clear of thecompartments chewbacca doing so with a good deal of grunting and twisting 
 two technicians had arrived at the base of the ramp they reported to the twobored soldiers guarding it 
 the all yours one of the troopers told them if the scanners pick upanything report it immediately 
 the men nodded then strained to lug their heavy equipment up the ramp assoon as they disappeared inside a loud crash was heard both guards whirled thenheard a voice call hey down there could you give us a hand with this 
 one trooper looked at his companion who shrugged they both started up theramp muttering at the inefficiency of mere technicians a second crashing soundreverberated but now there was no one left to hear it 
 but the absence of the two troopers was noticed soon thereafter a gantryofficer passing the window of a small command office near the freighter entranceglanced out frowning when he saw no sign of the guards concerned but notalarmed he moved to a comlink and spoke into it as he continued to stare at the ship 
 thx why you at your post thx do you copy 
 the speaker gave back only static 
 thx why you reply the officer was beginning to panic whenan armored figure descended the ramp and waved toward him pointing to theportion of his helmet covering his right ear the figure tapped it to indicate thecomlink inside working 
 shaking his head in disgust the gantry officer gave his busy aide an annoyedlook as he made for the door take over here got another bad going to see what i can do he activated the door took a step forward as it stumbled backward in a state of shock 
 filling the door completely was a towering hairy form chewbacca leanedinward and with a howl flattened the benumbed officer with oneswipe of a fist 
 the aide was already on his feet and reaching for his sidearm when a narrowenergy beam passed completely through him piercing his heart solo flipped up thefaceplate of his trooper helmet then slid it back into place as he followed the wookieinto the room kenobi and the droids squeezed in behind him with luke also cladin the armor of a luckless imperial soldier bringing up the rear 
 luke was looking around nervously as he shut the door behind them betweenhis howling and your blasting everything in sight a wonder the entire know here 
 bring em on solo demanded unreasonably enthused by their success so prefer a straight fight to all this sneaking in a hurry to die luke snapped but not all this sneakingaround has kept us alive 
 the corellian gave luke a sour eye but said nothing 
 they watched as kenobi operated an incredibly complex computer console withthe ease and confidence of one long accustomed to handling intricate machinery ascreen lit up promptly with a map of sections of the battle station the old manleaned forward scrutinizing the display carefully 
 meanwhile threepio and artoo had been going over an equally complicatedcontrol panel nearby artoo suddenly froze and began whistling wildly at somethinghe had found solo and luke their momentary disagreement over tactics over to where the robots were standing chewbacca busied himself hangingthe gentry officer up by his toes 
 plug him in kenobi suggested looking over from his place before the largerreadout he should be able to draw information from the entire station see if he can find out where the tractor beam power unit is located 
 why not just disconnect the beam from here sir luke wanted to know 
 it was solo who replied derisively what and have them lock it right back on usbefore we can get a length outside the docking bay 
 luke looked crestfallen oh i thought of that 
 we have to break the tractor at its power source in order to execute a cleanescape luke old ben chided gently as artoo punched a claw arm into the opencomputer socket he had discovered immediately a galaxy of lights came to life onthe panel in front of him and the room was filled with the hum of machinery workingat high speed 
 several minutes passed while the little droid sucked up information like a metalsponge then the hum slowed and he turned to beep something back at them 
 found it sir threepio announced excitedly 
 the tractor beam is coupled to the main reactors at seven locations most ofthe pertinent data is restricted but try to pull the critical information through tothe monitor 
 kenobi turned his attention from the larger screen to a small readout near began to race across it too fast for luke to see but apparently kenobi somehowmade something of the schematic blur i think any way you boys canhelp with this he told them i must go alone 
 that suits me fine said solo readily already done more than ibargained for on this trip but i think putting that tractor beam out of to take more than your magic old man 
 luke put off so easily i want to go with you 
 be impatient young luke this requires skills you yet and wait for my signal they must be delivered to the rebel forces or manymore worlds will meet the same fate as alderaan trust in the force 
 with a last look at the flow of information on the monitor kenobi adjusted thelightsaber at his waist stepping to the door he slid it aside looked once left onceright and disappeared down a long glowing hallway 
 as soon as he was gone chewbacca growled and solo nodded said it chewie he turned to luke you dig up that old fossil 
 ben a great man luke protested loftily 
 great at getting us into trouble solo snorted general my not going to get us out of here 
 you got any better ideas luke shot back challengingly 
 anything would be better than just waiting here for them to come and pick usup if we 
 a hysterical whistling and hooting came from the computer console lukehurried over to artoo detoo the little droid was all but hopping about on stubbylegs 
 what now luke asked threepio 
 the taller robot looked puzzled himself afraid i understand he says i found her and keeps repeating here here 
 who who has he found 
 artoo turned a flat blinking face toward luke and whistled frantically 
 princess leia the announced after listening carefully senator seem to be one and the same i believe she may be the person in the message hewas carrying 
 that portrait of indescribable beauty coalesced in mindagain the princess here 
 attracted by the commotion solo wandered over princess goingon 
 where where is she luke demanded breathlessly ignoring solocompletely 
 artoo whistled on while threepio translated level five detention block aa according to the information she is scheduled for slow termination 
 no got to do something 
 what are you three blabbering about an exasperated solo demanded 
 the one who programmed the message into artoo detoo luke explainedhurriedly the one we were trying to deliver to alderaan got to help her 
 now just a minute solo cautioned him this is going awful fast for get any funny ideas when i said i have any better ideas i meant old man said to wait here i like it but not going off on some crazymaze through this place 
 but ben know she was here luke half pleaded half argued surethat if he knew he would have changed his plans anxiety turned to if we could just figure a way to get into that detention block 
 solo shook his head and stepped back not going into anyimperial detention blocks 
 if we do something going to execute her a minute ago you saidyou just want to sit here and wait to be captured now all you want to do isstay which is it han 
 the corellian looked confused marching into a not what i had in mind likely to end up there rush it 
 but going to execute her 
 better her than me 
 your sense of chivalry han 
 solo considered near as i can recall i traded it for a chrysopaz andthree bottles of good brandy about five years ago on commenor 
 seen her luke persisted desperately beautiful 
 life 
 a rich and powerful senator luke pressed hoping an appeal to instincts might be more effective if we could save her the reward could besubstantial 
 uhrich then solo looked disdainful wait a minutereward fromwhom from the government on alderaan he made a sweeping gesture towardthe hangar and by implication the space where alderaan had once orbited 
 luke thought furiously if being held here and is scheduled to beexecuted that means she must be dangerous in some way to whoever destroyedalderaan to whoever had this station built you can bet it had something to do withthe empire instituting a reign of full repression 
 tell you pay for her rescue and for the information she holds thesenate the rebel alliance and every concern that did business with alderaan shecould be the sole surviving heir of the wealth of the entire system thereward could be more than you can imagine 
 i knowi can imagine quite a bit he glanced at chewbacca whogrunted a terse reply solo shrugged back at the big wookie all right giveit a try but better be right about that reward your plan kid 
 luke was momentarily taken aback al his energies up till now had beenconcentrated on persuading solo and chewbacca to aid in a rescue attempt thataccomplished luke became aware he had no idea how to proceed he had grownused to old ben and solo giving directions now the next move was up to him 
 his eyes were caught by several metal circlets dangling from the belt of give me those binders and tell chewbacca to come over there 
 solo handed luke the thin but quite unbreakable cuffs and relayed the request tochewbacca the wookie lumbered over and stood waiting next to luke 
 now going to put these on you luke began starting to move behind thewookie with the cuffs and 
 chewbacca made a sound low in his throat and luke jumped in spite of he began again han is going to put these on you and he sheepishlyhanded the binders to solo uncomfortably aware of the enormous eyes on him 
 solo sounded amused as he moved forward worry chewie i think iknow what he has in mind 
 the cuffs barely fit around the thick wrists despite his seemingconfidence in the plan the wookie wore a worried frightened look as the restraintswere activated 
 luke sir luke looked over at threepio pardon me for asking but should artoo and i do if someone discovers us here in your absence 
 hope they have blasters solo replied 
 tone indicated he find the answer humorous that veryreassuring 
 solo and luke were too engrossed in their coming expedition to pay muchattention to the worried robot they adjusted their helmets then with chewbaccawearing a downcast expression they started off along corridor where benkenobi had disappeared

 book one 
 chapter ix 
 
 it was past one when pierre left his friend it was a cloudless northern summer night pierre took an open cab intending to drive straight home but the nearer he drew to the house the more he felt the impossibility of going to sleep on such a night it was light enough to see a long way in the deserted street and it seemed more like morning or evening than night on the way pierre remembered that anatole kuragin was expecting the usual set for cards that evening after which there was generally a drinking bout finishing with visits of a kind pierre was very fond of 
 i should like to go to thought he 
 but he immediately recalled his promise to prince andrew not to go there then as happens to people of weak character he desired so passionately once more to enjoy that dissipation he was so accustomed to that he decided to go the thought immediately occurred to him that his promise to prince andrew was of no account because before he gave it he had already promised prince anatole to come to his gathering besides thought he all such words of honor are conventional things with no definite meaning especially if one considers that by tomorrow one may be dead or something so extraordinary may happen to one that honor and dishonor will be all the same pierre often indulged in reflections of this sort nullifying all his decisions and intentions he went to 
 reaching the large house near the horse guards barracks in which anatole lived pierre entered the lighted porch ascended the stairs and went in at the open door there was no one in the anteroom empty bottles cloaks and overshoes were lying about there was a smell of alcohol and sounds of voices and shouting in the distance 
 cards and supper were over but the visitors had not yet dispersed pierre threw off his cloak and entered the first room in which were the remains of supper a footman thinking no one saw him was drinking on the sly what was left in the glasses from the third room came sounds of laughter the shouting of familiar voices the growling of a bear and general commotion some eight or nine young men were crowding anxiously round an open window three others were romping with a young bear one pulling him by the chain and trying to set him at the others 
 i bet a hundred on stevens shouted one 
 mind no holding on cried another 
 i bet on dolokhov cried a third kuragin you part our hands 
 there leave bruin alone a bet on 
 at one draught or he loses shouted a fourth 
 jacob bring a bottle shouted the host a tall handsome fellow who stood in the midst of the group without a coat and with his fine linen shirt unfastened in front wait a bit you fellows here is petya good man cried he addressing pierre 
 another voice from a man of medium height with clear blue eyes particularly striking among all these drunken voices by its sober ring cried from the window come here part the bets this was dolokhov an officer of the semenov regiment a notorious gambler and duelist who was living with anatole pierre smiled looking about him merrily 
 i understand it all about 
 wait a bit he is not drunk yet a bottle here said anatole taking a glass from the table he went up to pierre 
 first of all you must drink 
 pierre drank one glass after another looking from under his brows at the tipsy guests who were again crowding round the window and listening to their chatter anatole kept on refilling glass while explaining that dolokhov was betting with stevens an english naval officer that he would drink a bottle of rum sitting on the outer ledge of the third floor window with his legs hanging out 
 go on you must drink it all said anatole giving pierre the last glass or i let you go 
 no i said pierre pushing anatole aside and he went up to the window 
 dolokhov was holding the hand and clearly and distinctly repeating the terms of the bet addressing himself particularly to anatole and pierre 
 dolokhov was of medium height with curly hair and eyes he was about like all infantry officers he wore no mustache so that his mouth the most striking feature of his face was clearly seen the lines of that mouth were remarkably finely curved the middle of the upper lip formed a sharp wedge and closed firmly on the firm lower one and something like two distinct smiles played continually round the two corners of the mouth this together with the resolute insolent intelligence of his eyes produced an effect which made it impossible not to notice his face dolokhov was a man of small means and no connections yet though anatole spent tens of thousands of rubles dolokhov lived with him and had placed himself on such a footing that all who knew them including anatole himself respected him more than they did anatole dolokhov could play all games and nearly always won however much he drank he never lost his clearheadedness both kuragin and dolokhov were at that time notorious among the rakes and scapegraces of petersburg 
 the bottle of rum was brought the window frame which prevented anyone from sitting on the outer sill was being forced out by two footmen who were evidently flurried and intimidated by the directions and shouts of the gentlemen around 
 anatole with his swaggering air strode up to the window he wanted to smash something pushing away the footmen he tugged at the frame but could not move it he smashed a pane 
 you have a try hercules said he turning to pierre 
 pierre seized the crossbeam tugged and wrenched the oak frame out with a crash 
 take it right out or think holding on said dolokhov 
 is the englishman bragging eh is it all right said anatole 
 said pierre looking at dolokhov who with a bottle of rum in his hand was approaching the window from which the light of the sky the dawn merging with the afterglow of sunset was visible 
 dolokhov the bottle of rum still in his hand jumped onto the window sill listen cried he standing there and addressing those in the room all were silent 
 i bet fifty imperials he spoke french that the englishman might understand him but he did not speak it very well i bet fifty imperials or do you wish to make it a hundred added he addressing the englishman 
 no fifty replied the latter 
 all right fifty imperials that i will drink a whole bottle of rum without taking it from my mouth sitting outside the window on this spot he stooped and pointed to the sloping ledge outside the window and without holding on to anything is that right 
 quite right said the englishman 
 anatole turned to the englishman and taking him by one of the buttons of his coat and looking down at him the englishman was short began repeating the terms of the wager to him in english 
 wait cried dolokhov hammering with the bottle on the window sill to attract attention wait a bit kuragin listen if anyone else does the same i will pay him a hundred imperials do you understand 
 the englishman nodded but gave no indication whether he intended to accept this challenge or not anatole did not release him and though he kept nodding to show that he understood anatole went on translating words into english a thin young lad an hussar of the life guards who had been losing that evening climbed on the window sill leaned over and looked down 
 oh oh oh he muttered looking down from the window at the stones of the pavement 
 shut up cried dolokhov pushing him away from the window the lad jumped awkwardly back into the room tripping over his spurs 
 placing the bottle on the window sill where he could reach it easily dolokhov climbed carefully and slowly through the window and lowered his legs pressing against both sides of the window he adjusted himself on his seat lowered his hands moved a little to the right and then to the left and took up the bottle anatole brought two candles and placed them on the window sill though it was already quite light back in his white shirt and his curly head were lit up from both sides everyone crowded to the window the englishman in front pierre stood smiling but silent one man older than the others present suddenly pushed forward with a scared and angry look and wanted to seize hold of shirt 
 i say this is folly be killed said this more sensible man 
 anatole stopped him 
 touch him startle him and then be killed eh what then eh 
 dolokhov turned round and again holding on with both hands arranged himself on his seat 
 if anyone comes meddling again said he emitting the words separately through his thin compressed lips i will throw him down there now then 
 saying this he again turned round dropped his hands took the bottle and lifted it to his lips threw back his head and raised his free hand to balance himself one of the footmen who had stooped to pick up some broken glass remained in that position without taking his eyes from the window and from back anatole stood erect with staring eyes the englishman looked on sideways pursing up his lips the man who had wished to stop the affair ran to a corner of the room and threw himself on a sofa with his face to the wall pierre hid his face from which a faint smile forgot to fade though his features now expressed horror and fear all were still pierre took his hands from his eyes dolokhov still sat in the same position only his head was thrown further back till his curly hair touched his shirt collar and the hand holding the bottle was lifted higher and higher and trembled with the effort the bottle was emptying perceptibly and rising still higher and his head tilting yet further back why is it so long thought pierre it seemed to him that more than half an hour had elapsed suddenly dolokhov made a backward movement with his spine and his arm trembled nervously this was sufficient to cause his whole body to slip as he sat on the sloping ledge as he began slipping down his head and arm wavered still more with the strain one hand moved as if to clutch the window sill but refrained from touching it pierre again covered his eyes and thought he would never never them again suddenly he was aware of a stir all around he looked up dolokhov was standing on the window sill with a pale but radiant face 
 empty 
 he threw the bottle to the englishman who caught it neatly dolokhov jumped down he smelt strongly of rum 
 well done fine fellow a bet for you devil take you came from different sides 
 the englishman took out his purse and began counting out the money dolokhov stood frowning and did not speak pierre jumped upon the window sill 
 gentlemen who wishes to bet with me do the same thing he suddenly cried even without a bet there tell them to bring me a bottle do it bring a bottle 
 let him do it let him do it said dolokhov smiling 
 what next have you gone mad no one would let you why you go giddy even on a staircase exclaimed several voices 
 drink it have a bottle of rum shouted pierre banging the table with a determined and drunken gesture and preparing to climb out of the window 
 they seized him by his arms but he was so strong that everyone who touched him was sent flying 
 no never manage him that way said anatole wait a bit and get round him listen take your bet tomorrow but now we are all going to s 
 come on then cried pierre come on and take bruin with us 
 and he caught the bear took it in his arms lifted it from the ground and began dancing round the room with it

 another voice from a man of medium height with clear blue eyes particularly striking among all these drunken voices by its sober ring cried from the window come here part the bets this was dolokhov an officer of the semenov regiment a notorious gambler and duelist who was living with anatole pierre smiled looking about him merrily 
 i understand it all about 
 wait a bit he is not drunk yet a bottle here said anatole taking a glass from the table he went up to pierre 
 first of all you must drink 
 pierre drank one glass after another looking from under his brows at the tipsy guests who were again crowding round the window and listening to their chatter anatole kept on refilling glass while explaining that dolokhov was betting with stevens an english naval officer that he would drink a bottle of rum sitting on the outer ledge of the third floor window with his legs hanging out 
 go on you must drink it all said anatole giving pierre the last glass or i let you go 
 no i said pierre pushing anatole aside and he went up to the window 
 dolokhov was holding the hand and clearly and distinctly repeating the terms of the bet addressing himself particularly to anatole and pierre 
 dolokhov was of medium height with curly hair and eyes he was about like all infantry officers he wore no mustache so that his mouth the most striking feature of his face was clearly seen the lines of that mouth were remarkably finely curved the middle of the upper lip formed a sharp wedge and closed firmly on the firm lower one and something like two distinct smiles played continually round the two corners of the mouth this together with the resolute insolent intelligence of his eyes produced an effect which made it impossible not to notice his face dolokhov was a man of small means and no connections yet though anatole spent tens of thousands of rubles dolokhov lived with him and had placed himself on such a footing that all who knew them including anatole himself respected him more than they did anatole dolokhov could play all games and nearly always won however much he drank he never lost his clearheadedness both kuragin and dolokhov were at that time notorious among the rakes and scapegraces of petersburg 
 the bottle of rum was brought the window frame which prevented anyone from sitting on the outer sill was being forced out by two footmen who were evidently flurried and intimidated by the directions and shouts of the gentlemen around 
 anatole with his swaggering air strode up to the window he wanted to smash something pushing away the footmen he tugged at the frame but could not move it he smashed a pane 
 you have a try hercules said he turning to pierre 
 pierre seized the crossbeam tugged and wrenched the oak frame out with a crash 
 take it right out or think holding on said dolokhov 
 is the englishman bragging eh is it all right said anatole 
 said pierre looking at dolokhov who with a bottle of rum in his hand was approaching the window from which the light of the sky the dawn merging with the afterglow of sunset was visible 
 dolokhov the bottle of rum still in his hand jumped onto the window sill listen cried he standing there and addressing those in the room all were silent 
 i bet fifty imperials he spoke french that the englishman might understand him but he did not speak it very well i bet fifty imperials or do you wish to make it a hundred added he addressing the englishman 
 no fifty replied the latter 
 all right fifty imperials that i will drink a whole bottle of rum without taking it from my mouth sitting outside the window on this spot he stooped and pointed to the sloping ledge outside the window and without holding on to anything is that right 
 quite right said the englishman 
 anatole turned to the englishman and taking him by one of the buttons of his coat and looking down at him the englishman was short began repeating the terms of the wager to him in english 
 wait cried dolokhov hammering with the bottle on the window sill to attract attention wait a bit kuragin listen if anyone else does the same i will pay him a hundred imperials do you understand 
 the englishman nodded but gave no indication whether he intended to accept this challenge or not anatole did not release him and though he kept nodding to show that he understood anatole went on translating words into english a thin young lad an hussar of the life guards who had been losing that evening climbed on the window sill leaned over and looked down 
 oh oh oh he muttered looking down from the window at the stones of the pavement 
 shut up cried dolokhov pushing him away from the window the lad jumped awkwardly back into the room tripping over his spurs 
 placing the bottle on the window sill where he could reach it easily dolokhov climbed carefully and slowly through the window and lowered his legs pressing against both sides of the window he adjusted himself on his seat lowered his hands moved a little to the right and then to the left and took up the bottle anatole brought two candles and placed them on the window sill though it was already quite light back in his white shirt and his curly head were lit up from both sides everyone crowded to the window the englishman in front pierre stood smiling but silent one man older than the others present suddenly pushed forward with a scared and angry look and wanted to seize hold of shirt 
 i say this is folly be killed said this more sensible man 
 anatole stopped him 
 touch him startle him and then be killed eh what then eh 
 dolokhov turned round and again holding on with both hands arranged himself on his seat 
 if anyone comes meddling again said he emitting the words separately through his thin compressed lips i will throw him down there now then 
 saying this he again turned round dropped his hands took the bottle and lifted it to his lips threw back his head and raised his free hand to balance himself one of the footmen who had stooped to pick up some broken glass remained in that position without taking his eyes from the window and from back anatole stood erect with staring eyes the englishman looked on sideways pursing up his lips the man who had wished to stop the affair ran to a corner of the room and threw himself on a sofa with his face to the wall pierre hid his face from which a faint smile forgot to fade though his features now expressed horror and fear all were still pierre took his hands from his eyes dolokhov still sat in the same position only his head was thrown further back till his curly hair touched his shirt collar and the hand holding the bottle was lifted higher and higher and trembled with the effort the bottle was emptying perceptibly and rising still higher and his head tilting yet further back why is it so long thought pierre it seemed to him that more than half an hour had elapsed suddenly dolokhov made a backward movement with his spine and his arm trembled nervously this was sufficient to cause his whole body to slip as he sat on the sloping ledge as he began slipping down his head and arm wavered still more with the strain one hand moved as if to clutch the window sill but refrained from touching it pierre again covered his eyes and thought he would never never them again suddenly he was aware of a stir all around he looked up dolokhov was standing on the window sill with a pale but radiant face 
 empty 
 he threw the bottle to the englishman who caught it neatly dolokhov jumped down he smelt strongly of rum 
 well done fine fellow a bet for you devil take you came from different sides 
 the englishman took out his purse and began counting out the money dolokhov stood frowning and did not speak pierre jumped upon the window sill 
 gentlemen who wishes to bet with me do the same thing he suddenly cried even without a bet there tell them to bring me a bottle do it bring a bottle 
 let him do it let him do it said dolokhov smiling 
 what next have you gone mad no one would let you why you go giddy even on a staircase exclaimed several voices 
 drink it have a bottle of rum shouted pierre banging the table with a determined and drunken gesture and preparing to climb out of the window 
 they seized him by his arms but he was so strong that everyone who touched him was sent flying 
 no never manage him that way said anatole wait a bit and get round him listen take your bet tomorrow but now we are all going to s 
 come on then cried pierre come on and take bruin with us 
 and he caught the bear took it in his arms lifted it from the ground and began dancing round the room with it

 chapter 
 
 on the morning of a fine june day my first bonny little nursling and the last of the ancient earnshaw stock was born we were busy with the hay in a far away field when the girl that usually brought our breakfasts came running an hour too soon across the meadow and up the lane calling me as she ran 
 oh such a grand bairn she panted out the finest lad that ever breathed but the doctor says missis must go he says been in a consumption these many months i heard him tell mr hindley and now she has nothing to keep her and be dead before winter you must come home directly to nurse it nelly to feed it with sugar and milk and take care of it day and night i wish i were you because it will be all yours when there is no missis 
 but is she very ill i asked flinging down my rake and tying my bonnet 
 i guess she is yet she looks bravely replied the girl and she talks as if she thought of living to see it grow a man out of her head for joy such a beauty if i were her certain i should not die i should get better at the bare sight of it in spite of kenneth i was fairly mad at him dame archer brought the cherub down to master in the house and his face just began to light up then the old croaker steps forward and says he earnshaw a blessing your wife has been spared to leave you this son when she came i felt convinced we keep her long and now i must tell you the winter will probably finish her take on and fret about it too much it be helped and besides you should have known better than to choose such a rush of a lass 
 and what did the master answer i inquired 
 i think he swore but i mind him i was straining to see the bairn and she began again to describe it rapturously i as zealous as herself hurried eagerly home to admire on my part though i was very sad for sake he had room in his heart only for two wife and himself he doted on both and adored one and i conceive how he would bear the loss 
 when we got to wuthering heights there he stood at the front door and as i passed in i asked how was the baby 
 nearly ready to run about nell he replied putting on a cheerful smile 
 and the mistress i ventured to inquire the doctor says 
 damn the doctor he interrupted reddening frances is quite right be perfectly well by this time next week are you going upstairs will you tell her that come if promise not to talk i left her because she would not hold her tongue and she her mr kenneth says she must be quiet 
 i delivered this message to mrs earnshaw she seemed in flighty spirits and replied merrily 
 i hardly spoke a word there he has gone out twice crying well say i promise i speak but that does not bind me not to laugh at him 
 poor soul till within a week of her death that gay heart never failed her and her husband persisted doggedly nay furiously in affirming her health improved every day when kenneth warned him that his medicines were useless at that stage of the malady and he put him to further expense by attending her he retorted 
 i know you need does not want any more attendance from you she never was in a consumption it was a fever and it is gone her pulse is as slow as mine now and her cheek as cool 
 he told his wife the same story and she seemed to believe him but one night while leaning on his shoulder in the act of saying she thought she should be able to get up tomorrow a fit of coughing took very slight raised her in his arms she put her two hands about his neck her face changed and she was dead 
 as the girl had anticipated the child hareton fell wholly into my hands mr earnshaw provided he saw him healthy and never heard him cry was contented as far as regarded him for himself he grew desperate his sorrow was of that kind that will not lament he neither wept nor prayed he cursed and defied execrated god and man and gave himself up to reckless dissipation the servants could not bear his tyrannical and evil conduct long joseph and i were the only two that would stay i had not the heart to leave my charge and besides you know i had been his and excused his behaviour more readily than a stranger would joseph remained to hector over tenants and labourers and because it was his vocation to be where he had plenty of wickedness to reprove 
 the bad ways and bad companions formed a pretty example for catherine and heathcliff his treatment of the latter was enough to make a fiend of a saint and truly it appeared as if the lad were possessed of something diabolical at that period he delighted to witness hindley degrading himself past redemption and became daily more notable for savage sullenness and ferocity i could not half tell what an infernal house we had the curate dropped calling and nobody decent came near us at last unless edgar visits to miss cathy might be an exception at fifteen she was the queen of the countryside she had no peer and she did turn out a haughty headstrong creature i own i did not like her after her infancy was past and i vexed her frequently by trying to bring down her arrogance she never took an aversion to me though she had a wondrous constancy to old attachments even heathcliff kept his hold on her affections unalterably and young linton with all his superiority found it difficult to make an equally deep impression he was my late master that is his portrait over the fireplace it used to hang on one side and his on the other but hers has been removed or else you might see something of what she was can you make that out 
 mrs dean raised the candle and i discerned a face exceedingly resembling the young lady at the heights but more pensive and amiable in expression it formed a sweet picture the long light hair curled slightly on the temples the eyes were large and serious the figure almost too graceful i did not marvel how catherine earnshaw could forget her first friend for such an individual i marvelled much how he with a mind to correspond with his person could fancy my idea of catherine earnshaw 
 a very agreeable portrait i observed to the housekeeper is it like 
 yes she answered but he looked better when he was animated that is his everyday countenance he wanted spirit in general 
 catherine had kept up her acquaintance with the lintons since her five weeks residence among them and as she had no temptation to show her rough side in their company and had the sense to be ashamed of being rude where she experienced such invariable courtesy she imposed unwittingly on the old lady and gentleman by her ingenious cordiality gained the admiration of isabella and the heart and soul of her brother acquisitions that flattered her from the first for she was full of ambition and led her to adopt a double character without exactly intending to deceive anyone in the place where she heard heathcliff termed a vulgar young ruffian and worse than a brute she took care not to act like him but at home she had small inclination to practise politeness that would only be laughed at and restrain an unruly nature when it would bring her neither credit nor praise mr edgar seldom mustered courage to visit wuthering heights openly he had a terror of reputation and shrunk from encountering him and yet he was always received with our best attempts at civility the master himself avoided offending him knowing why he came and if he could not be gracious kept out of the way i rather think his appearance there was distasteful to catherine she was not artful never played the coquette and had evidently an objection to her two friends meeting at all for when heathcliff expressed contempt of linton in his presence she could not half coincide as she did in his absence and when linton evinced disgust and antipathy to heathcliff she dared not treat his sentiments with indifference as if depreciation of her playmate were of scarcely any consequence to her had many a laugh at her perplexities and untold troubles which she vainly strove to hide from my mockery that sounds but she was so proud it became really impossible to pity her distresses till she should be chastened into more humility she did bring herself finally to confess and confide in me there was not a soul else that she might fashion into an adviser 
 mr hindley had gone from home one afternoon and heathcliff presumed to give himself a holiday on the strength of it he had reached the age of sixteen then i think and without having bad features or being deficient in intellect he contrived to convey an impression of inward and outward repulsiveness that his present aspect retains no traces of in the first place he had by that time lost the benefit of his early education continual hard work begun soon and concluded late had extinguished any curiosity he once possessed in pursuit of knowledge and any love for books or learning his sense of superiority instilled into him by the favours of old mr earnshaw was faded away he struggled long to keep up an equality with catherine in her studies and yielded with poignant though silent regret but he yielded completely and there was no prevailing on him to take a step in the way of moving upward when he found he must necessarily sink beneath his former level then personal appearance sympathized with mental deterioration he acquired a slouching gait and ignoble look his naturally reserved disposition was exaggerated into an almost idiotic excess of unsociable moroseness and he took a grim pleasure apparently in exciting the aversion rather than the esteem of his few acquaintance 
 catherine and he were constant companions still at his seasons of respite from labour but he had ceased to express his fondness for her in words and recoiled with angry suspicion from her girlish caresses as if conscious there could be no gratification in lavishing such marks of affection on him on the occasion he came into the house to announce his intention of doing nothing while i was assisting miss cathy to arrange her dress she had not reckoned on his taking it into his head to be idle and imagining she would have the whole place to herself she managed by some means to inform mr edgar of her absence and was then preparing to receive him 
 cathy are you busy this afternoon asked heathcliff are you going anywhere 
 no it is raining she answered 
 why have you that silk frock on then he said nobody coming here i hope 
 not that i know of stammered miss but you should be in the field now heathcliff it is an hour past dinner time i thought you were gone 
 hindley does not often free us from his accursed presence observed the boy not work any more today stay with you 
 oh but joseph will tell she suggested better go 
 joseph is loading lime on the farther side of pennistow crag it will take him till dark and never know 
 so saying he lounged to the fire and sat down catherine reflected an instant with knitted found it needful to smooth the way for an intrusion isabella and edgar linton talked of calling this afternoon she said at the conclusion of a silence as it rains i hardly expect them but they may come and if they do you run the risk of being scolded for no good 
 order ellen to say you are engaged cathy he persisted turn me out for those pitiful silly friends of yours on the point sometimes of complaining that not 
 that they what cried catherine gazing at him with a troubled countenance oh nelly she added petulantly jerking her head away from my hands combed my hair quite out of curl enough let me alone what are you on the point of complaining about heathcliff 
 look at the almanac on that wall he pointed to a framed sheet hanging near the window and crosses are for the evenings you have spent with the lintons the dots for those spent with me do you see marked every day 
 foolish as if i took notice replied catherine in a peevish tone and where is the sense of that 
 to show that i do take notice said heathcliff 
 and should i always be sitting with you she demanded growing more irritated what good do i get what do you talk about you might be dumb or a baby for anything you say to amuse me or for anything you do either 
 you never told me before that i talked too little or that you disliked my company cathy exclaimed heathcliff in much agitation 
 no company at all when people know nothing and say nothing she muttered 
 her companion rose up but he time to express his feelings further for a feet were heard on the flags and having knocked gently young linton entered his face brilliant with delight at the unexpected summons he had received doubtless catherine marked the difference between her friends as one came in and the other went out the contrast resembled what you see in exchanging a bleak hilly coal country for a beautiful fertile valley and his voice and greeting were as opposite as his aspect 
 he had a sweet low manner of speaking and pronounced his words as you do less gruff than we talk here and softer 
 not come too soon am i he said casting a look at me i had begun to wipe the plate and tidy some drawers at the far end in the dresser 
 no answered catherine what are you doing there nelly 
 my work miss i replied mr hindley had given me directions to make a third parry in any private visits linton chose to pay 
 she stepped behind me and whispered crossly take yourself and your dusters off when company are in the house servants commence scouring and cleaning in the room where they are 
 a good opportunity now that the master is away i answered aloud he hates me to be fidgeting over these things in his presence sure mr edgar will excuse me 
 i hate you to be fidgeting in my presence exclaimed the young lady imperiously not allowing her guest time to speak she had failed to recover her equanimity since the little dispute with heathcliff 
 sorry for it miss catherine was my response and i proceeded assiduously with my occupation 
 she supposing edgar could not see her snatched the cloth from my hand and pinched me with a prolonged wrench very spitefully on the arm said i did not love her and rather relished mortifying her vanity now and then besides she hurt me extremely so i started up from my knees and screamed out oh miss a nasty trick you have no right to nip me and not going to bear it 
 i touch you you lying creature cried she her fingers tingling to repeat the act and her ears red with rage she never had power to conceal her passion it always set her whole complexion in a blaze 
 that then i retorted showing a decided purple witness to refute her 
 she stamped her foot wavered a moment and then irresistibly impelled by the naughty spirit within her slapped me on the cheek a stinging blow that filled both eyes with water 
 catherine love catherine interposed linton greatly shocked at the double fault of falsehood and violence which his idol had committed 
 leave the room ellen she repeated trembling all over 
 little hareton who followed me everywhere and was sitting near me on the floor at seeing my tears commenced crying himself and sobbed out complaints against wicked aunt cathy which drew her fury on to his unlucky head she seized his shoulders and shook him till the poor child waxed livid and edgar thoughtlessly laid hold of her hands to deliver him in an instant one was wrung free and the astonished young man felt it applied over his own ear in a way that could not be mistaken for jest he drew back in consternation i lifted hareton in my arms and walked off to the kitchen with him leaving the door of communication open for i was curious to watch how they would settle their disagreement the insulted visitor moved to the spot where he had laid his hat pale and with a quivering lip 
 right i said to myself take warning and begone a kindness to let you have a glimpse of her genuine disposition 
 where are you going demanded catherine advancing to the door 
 he swerved aside and attempted to pass 
 you must not go she exclaimed energetically 
 i must and shall he replied in a subdued voice 
 no she persisted grasping the handle not yet edgar linton sit down you shall not leave me in that temper i should be miserable all night and i be miserable for you 
 can i stay after you have struck me asked linton catherine was mute 
 made me afraid and ashamed of you he continued not come here again 
 her eyes began to glisten and her lids to twinkle and you told a deliberate untruth he said 
 i she cried recovering her speech i did nothing deliberately well go if you away and now cry myself sick 
 she dropped down on her knees by a chair and set to weeping in serious earnest edgar persevered in his resolution as far as the court there he lingered i resolved to encourage him 
 miss is dreadfully wayward sir i called out as bad as any marred child better be riding home or else she will be sick only to grieve us 
 the soft thing looked askance through the window he possessed the power to depart as much as a cat possesses the power to leave a mouse half killed or a bird half eaten ah i thought there will be no saving him doomed and flies to his fate and so it was he turned abruptly hastened into the house again shut the door behind him and when i went in a while after to inform them that earnshaw had come home rabid drunk ready to pull the whole place about our ears his ordinary frame of mind in that condition i saw the quarrel had merely effected a closer intimacy had broken the outworks of youthful timidity and enabled them to forsake the disguise of friendship and confess themselves lovers 
 intelligence of mr arrival drove linton speedily to his horse and catherine to her chamber i went to hide little hareton and to take the shot out of the which he was fond of playing with in his insane excitement to the hazard of the lives of any who provoked or even attracted his notice too much and i had hit upon the plan of removing it that he might do less mischief if he did go the length of firing the gun

 no company at all when people know nothing and say nothing she muttered 
 her companion rose up but he time to express his feelings further for a feet were heard on the flags and having knocked gently young linton entered his face brilliant with delight at the unexpected summons he had received doubtless catherine marked the difference between her friends as one came in and the other went out the contrast resembled what you see in exchanging a bleak hilly coal country for a beautiful fertile valley and his voice and greeting were as opposite as his aspect 
 he had a sweet low manner of speaking and pronounced his words as you do less gruff than we talk here and softer 
 not come too soon am i he said casting a look at me i had begun to wipe the plate and tidy some drawers at the far end in the dresser 
 no answered catherine what are you doing there nelly 
 my work miss i replied mr hindley had given me directions to make a third parry in any private visits linton chose to pay 
 she stepped behind me and whispered crossly take yourself and your dusters off when company are in the house servants commence scouring and cleaning in the room where they are 
 a good opportunity now that the master is away i answered aloud he hates me to be fidgeting over these things in his presence sure mr edgar will excuse me 
 i hate you to be fidgeting in my presence exclaimed the young lady imperiously not allowing her guest time to speak she had failed to recover her equanimity since the little dispute with heathcliff 
 sorry for it miss catherine was my response and i proceeded assiduously with my occupation 
 she supposing edgar could not see her snatched the cloth from my hand and pinched me with a prolonged wrench very spitefully on the arm said i did not love her and rather relished mortifying her vanity now and then besides she hurt me extremely so i started up from my knees and screamed out oh miss a nasty trick you have no right to nip me and not going to bear it 
 i touch you you lying creature cried she her fingers tingling to repeat the act and her ears red with rage she never had power to conceal her passion it always set her whole complexion in a blaze 
 that then i retorted showing a decided purple witness to refute her 
 she stamped her foot wavered a moment and then irresistibly impelled by the naughty spirit within her slapped me on the cheek a stinging blow that filled both eyes with water 
 catherine love catherine interposed linton greatly shocked at the double fault of falsehood and violence which his idol had committed 
 leave the room ellen she repeated trembling all over 
 little hareton who followed me everywhere and was sitting near me on the floor at seeing my tears commenced crying himself and sobbed out complaints against wicked aunt cathy which drew her fury on to his unlucky head she seized his shoulders and shook him till the poor child waxed livid and edgar thoughtlessly laid hold of her hands to deliver him in an instant one was wrung free and the astonished young man felt it applied over his own ear in a way that could not be mistaken for jest he drew back in consternation i lifted hareton in my arms and walked off to the kitchen with him leaving the door of communication open for i was curious to watch how they would settle their disagreement the insulted visitor moved to the spot where he had laid his hat pale and with a quivering lip 
 right i said to myself take warning and begone a kindness to let you have a glimpse of her genuine disposition 
 where are you going demanded catherine advancing to the door 
 he swerved aside and attempted to pass 
 you must not go she exclaimed energetically 
 i must and shall he replied in a subdued voice 
 no she persisted grasping the handle not yet edgar linton sit down you shall not leave me in that temper i should be miserable all night and i be miserable for you 
 can i stay after you have struck me asked linton catherine was mute 
 made me afraid and ashamed of you he continued not come here again 
 her eyes began to glisten and her lids to twinkle and you told a deliberate untruth he said 
 i she cried recovering her speech i did nothing deliberately well go if you away and now cry myself sick 
 she dropped down on her knees by a chair and set to weeping in serious earnest edgar persevered in his resolution as far as the court there he lingered i resolved to encourage him 
 miss is dreadfully wayward sir i called out as bad as any marred child better be riding home or else she will be sick only to grieve us 
 the soft thing looked askance through the window he possessed the power to depart as much as a cat possesses the power to leave a mouse half killed or a bird half eaten ah i thought there will be no saving him doomed and flies to his fate and so it was he turned abruptly hastened into the house again shut the door behind him and when i went in a while after to inform them that earnshaw had come home rabid drunk ready to pull the whole place about our ears his ordinary frame of mind in that condition i saw the quarrel had merely effected a closer intimacy had broken the outworks of youthful timidity and enabled them to forsake the disguise of friendship and confess themselves lovers 
 intelligence of mr arrival drove linton speedily to his horse and catherine to her chamber i went to hide little hareton and to take the shot out of the which he was fond of playing with in his insane excitement to the hazard of the lives of any who provoked or even attracted his notice too much and i had hit upon the plan of removing it that he might do less mischief if he did go the length of firing the gun

 chapter nine 
 
 i do think it was the most fortunate thing in the world that those children should have the measles just now said meg one april day as she stood packing the go abroady trunk in her room surrounded by her sisters 
 and so nice of annie moffat not to forget her promise a whole fortnight of fun will be regularly splendid replied jo looking like a windmill as she folded skirts with her long arms 
 and such lovely weather so glad of that added beth tidily sorting neck and hair ribbons in her best box lent for the great occasion 
 i wish i was going to have a fine time and wear all these nice things said amy with her mouth full of pins as she artistically replenished her cushion 
 i wish you were all going but as you i shall keep my adventures to tell you when i come back sure the least i can do when you have been so kind lending me things and helping me get ready said meg glancing round the room at the very simple outfit which seemed nearly perfect in their eyes 
 what did mother give you out of the treasure box asked amy who had not been present at the opening of a certain cedar chest in which mrs march kept a few relics of past splendor as gifts for her girls when the proper time came 
 a pair of silk stockings that pretty carved fan and a lovely blue sash i wanted the violet silk but there time to make it over so i must be contented with my old tarlatan 
 it will look nice over my new muslin skirt and the sash will set it off beautifully i wish i smashed my coral bracelet for you might have had it said jo who loved to give and lend but whose possessions were usually too dilapidated to be of much use 
 there is a lovely pearl set in the treasure chest but mother said real flowers were the prettiest ornament for a young girl and laurie promised to send me all i want replied meg now let me see my new gray walking suit just curl up the feather in my hat beth then my poplin for sunday and the small party it looks heavy for spring it the violet silk would be so nice oh dear 
 never mind got the tarlatan for the big party and you always look like an angel in white said amy brooding over the little store of finery in which her soul delighted 
 it and it sweep enough but it will have to do my blue housedress looks so well turned and freshly trimmed that i feel as if got a new one my silk sacque a bit the fashion and my bonnet look like i like to say anything but i was sadly disappointed in my umbrella i told mother black with a white handle but she forgot and bought a green one with a yellowish handle strong and neat so i ought not to complain but i know i shall feel ashamed of it beside silk one with a gold top sighed meg surveying the little umbrella with great disfavor 
 change it advised jo 
 i be so silly or hurt feelings when she took so much pains to get my things a nonsensical notion of mine and not going to give up to it my silk stockings and two pairs of new gloves are my comfort you are a dear to lend me yours jo i feel so rich and sort of elegant with two new pairs and the old ones cleaned up for common and meg took a refreshing peep at her glove box annie moffat has blue and pink bows on her nightcaps would you put some on mine she asked as beth brought up a pile of snowy muslins fresh from hands 
 no i for the smart caps match the plain gowns without any trimming on them poor folks rig said jo decidedly 
 i wonder if i shall ever be happy enough to have real lace on my clothes and bows on my caps said meg impatiently 
 you said the other day that be perfectly happy if you could only go to annie observed beth in her quiet way 
 so i did well i am happy and i fret but it does seem as if the more one gets the more one wants it there now the trays are ready and everything in but my ball dress which i shall leave for mother to pack said meg cheering up as she glanced from the trunk to the many times pressed and mended white tarlatan which she called her ball dress with an important air 
 the next day was fine and meg departed in style for a fortnight of novelty and pleasure mrs march had consented to the visit rather reluctantly fearing that margaret would come back more discontented than she went but she begged so hard and sallie had promised to take good care of her and a little pleasure seemed so delightful after a winter of irksome work that the mother yielded and the daughter went to take her first taste of fashionable life 
 the moffats were very fashionable and simple meg was rather daunted at first by the splendor of the house and the elegance of its occupants but they were kindly people in spite of the frivolous life they led and soon put their guest at her ease perhaps meg felt without understanding why that they were not particularly cultivated or intelligent people and that all their gilding could not quite conceal the ordinary material of which they were made it certainly was agreeable to fare sumptuously drive in a fine carriage wear her best frock every day and do nothing but enjoy herself it suited her exactly and soon she began to imitate the manners and conversation of those about her to put on little airs and graces use french phrases crimp her hair take in her dresses and talk about the fashions as well as she could the more she saw of annie pretty things the more she envied her and sighed to be rich home now looked bare and dismal as she thought of it work grew harder than ever and she felt that she was a very destitute and girl in spite of the new gloves and silk stockings 
 she had not much time for repining however for the three young girls were busily employed in having a good time they shopped walked rode and called all day went to theaters and operas or frolicked at home in the evening for annie had many friends and knew how to entertain them her older sisters were very fine young ladies and one was engaged which was extremely interesting and romantic meg thought mr moffat was a fat jolly old gentleman who knew her father and mrs moffat a fat jolly old lady who took as great a fancy to meg as her daughter had done everyone petted her and daisey as they called her was in a fair way to have her head turned 
 when the evening for the small party came she found that the poplin do at all for the other girls were putting on thin dresses and making themselves very fine indeed so out came the tarlatan looking older limper and shabbier than ever beside crisp new one meg saw the girls glance at it and then at one another and her cheeks began to burn for with all her gentleness she was very proud no one said a word about it but sallie offered to dress her hair and annie to tie her sash and belle the engaged sister praised her white arms but in their kindness meg saw only pity for her poverty and her heart felt very heavy as she stood by herself while the others laughed chattered and flew about like gauzy butterflies the hard bitter feeling was getting pretty bad when the maid brought in a box of flowers before she could speak annie had the cover off and all were exclaiming at the lovely roses heath and fern within 
 for belle of course george always sends her some but these are altogether ravishing cried annie with a great sniff 
 they are for miss march the man said and a note put in the maid holding it to meg 
 what fun who are they from know you had a lover cried the girls fluttering about meg in a high state of curiosity and surprise 
 the note is from mother and the flowers from laurie said meg simply yet much gratified that he had not forgotten her 
 oh indeed said annie with a funny look as meg slipped the note into her pocket as a sort of talisman against envy vanity and false pride for the few loving words had done her good and the flowers cheered her up by their beauty 
 feeling almost happy again she laid by a few ferns and roses for herself and quickly made up the rest in dainty bouquets for the breasts hair or skirts of her friends offering them so prettily that clara the elder sister told her she was the sweetest little thing she ever saw and they looked quite charmed with her small attention somehow the kind act finished her despondency and when all the rest went to show themselves to mrs moffat she saw a happy face in the mirror as she laid her ferns against her rippling hair and fastened the roses in the dress that strike her as so very shabby now 
 she enjoyed herself very much that evening for she danced to her content everyone was very kind and she had three compliments annie made her sing and some one said she had a remarkably fine voice major lincoln asked who the fresh little girl with the beautiful eyes was and mr moffat insisted on dancing with her because she dawdle but had some spring in her as he gracefully expressed it so altogether she had a very nice time till she overheard a bit of conversation which disturbed her extremely she was sitting just inside the conservatory waiting for her partner to bring her an ice when she heard a voice ask on the other side of the flowery wall 
 how old is he 
 sixteen or seventeen i should say replied another voice 
 it would be a grand thing for one of those girls it sallie says they are very intimate now and the old man quite dotes on them 
 mrs m has made her plans i dare say and will play her cards well early as it is the girl evidently think of it yet said mrs moffat 
 she told that fib about her momma as if she did know and colored up when the flowers came quite prettily poor thing be so nice if she was only got up in style do you think be offended if we offered to lend her a dress for thursday asked another voice 
 proud but i believe mind for that dowdy tarlatan is all she has got she may tear it tonight and that will be a good excuse for offering a decent one 
 here partner appeared to find her looking much flushed and rather agitated she was proud and her pride was useful just then for it helped her hide her mortification anger and disgust at what she had just heard for innocent and unsuspicious as she was she could not help understanding the gossip of her friends she tried to forget it but could not and kept repeating to herself mrs m has made her plans that fib about her mamma and dowdy tarlatan till she was ready to cry and rush home to tell her troubles and ask for advice as that was impossible she did her best to seem gay and being rather excited she succeeded so well that no one dreamed what an effort she was making she was very glad when it was all over and she was quiet in her bed where she could think and wonder and fume till her head ached and her hot cheeks were cooled by a few natural tears those foolish yet well meant words had opened a new world to meg and much disturbed the peace of the old one in which till now she had lived as happily as a child her innocent friendship with laurie was spoiled by the silly speeches she had overheard her faith in her mother was a little shaken by the worldly plans attributed to her by mrs moffat who judged others by herself and the sensible resolution to be contented with the simple wardrobe which suited a poor daughter was weakened by the unnecessary pity of girls who thought a shabby dress one of the greatest calamities under heaven 
 poor meg had a restless night and got up unhappy half resentful toward her friends and half ashamed of herself for not speaking out frankly and setting everything right everybody dawdled that morning and it was noon before the girls found energy enough even to take up their worsted work something in the manner of her friends struck meg at once they treated her with more respect she thought took quite a tender interest in what she said and looked at her with eyes that plainly betrayed curiosity all this surprised and flattered her though she did not understand it till miss belle looked up from her writing and said with a sentimental air 
 daisy dear sent an invitation to your friend mr laurence for thursday we should like to know him and only a proper compliment to you 
 meg colored but a mischievous fancy to tease the girls made her reply demurely you are very kind but afraid he come 
 why not cherie asked miss belle 
 too old 
 my child what do you mean what is his age i beg to know cried miss clara 
 nearly seventy i believe answered meg counting stitches to hide the merriment in her eyes 
 you sly creature of course we meant the young man exclaimed miss belle laughing 
 there any laurie is only a little boy and meg laughed also at the queer look which the sisters exchanged as she thus described her supposed you age nan said 
 nearer my sister i am seventeen in august returned meg tossing her head 
 very nice of him to send you flowers it said annie looking wise about nothing 
 yes he often does to all of us for their house is full and we are so fond of them my mother and old mr laurence are friends you know so it is quite natural that we children should play together and meg hoped they would say no more 
 evident daisy out yet said miss clara to belle with a nod 
 quite a pastoral state of innocence all round returned miss belle with a shrug 
 going out to get some little matters for my girls can i do anything for you young ladies asked mrs moffat lumbering in like an elephant in silk and lace 
 no thank you replied sallie got my new pink silk for thursday and want a thing 
 nor i began meg but stopped because it occurred to her that she did want several things and could not have them 
 what shall you wear asked sallie 
 my old white one again if i can mend it fit to be seen it got sadly torn last night said meg trying to speak quite easily but feeling very uncomfortable 
 why you send home for another said sallie who was not an observing young lady 
 i got any other it cost meg an effort to say that but sallie did not see it and exclaimed in amiable surprise only that how funny she did not finish her speech for belle shook her head at her and broke in saying kindly 
 not at all where is the use of having a lot of dresses when she out yet no need of sending home daisy even if you had a dozen for got a sweet blue silk laid away which outgrown and you shall wear it to please me you dear 
 you are very kind but i mind my old dress if you it does well enough for a little girl like me said meg 
 now do let me please myself by dressing you up in style i admire to do it and be a regular little beauty with a touch here and there i let anyone see you till you are done and then burst upon them like cinderella and her godmother going to the ball said belle in her persuasive tone 
 meg refuse the offer so kindly made for a desire to see if she would be a little beauty after touching up caused her to accept and forget all her former uncomfortable feelings toward the moffats 
 on the thursday evening belle shut herself up with her maid and between them they turned meg into a fine lady they crimped and curled her hair they polished her neck and arms with some fragrant powder touched her lips with coralline salve to make them redder and hortense would have added a soupcon of rouge if meg had not rebelled they laced her into a dress which was so tight she could hardly breathe and so low in the neck that modest meg blushed at herself in the mirror a set of silver filagree was added bracelets necklace brooch and even earrings for hortense tied them on with a bit of pink silk which did not show a cluster of buds at the bosom and a ruche reconciled meg to the display of her pretty white shoulders and a pair of silk boots satisfied the last wish of her heart a lace handkerchief a plumy fan and a bouquet in a shoulder holder finished her off and miss belle surveyed her with the satisfaction of a little girl with a newly dressed doll 
 mademoiselle is chatmante tres jolie is she not cried hortense clasping her hands in an affected rapture 
 come and show yourself said miss belle leading the way to the room where the others were waiting 
 as meg went rustling after with her long skirts trailing her earrings tinkling her curls waving and her heart beating she felt as if her fun had really begun at last for the mirror had plainly told her that she was a little beauty her friends repeated the pleasing phrase enthusiastically and for several minutes she stood like a jackdaw in the fable enjoying her borrowed plumes while the rest chattered like a party of magpies 
 while i dress do you drill her nan in the management of her skirt and those french heels or she will trip herself up take your silver butterfly and catch up that long curl on the left side of her head clara and any of you disturb the charming work of my hands said belle as she hurried away looking well pleased with her success 
 you look a bit like yourself but you are very nice nowhere beside you for belle has heaps of taste and quite french i assure you let your flowers hang be so careful of them and be sure you trip returned sallie trying not to care that meg was prettier than herself 
 keeping that warning carefully in mind margaret got safely downstairs and sailed into the drawing rooms where the moffats and a few early guests were assembled she very soon discovered that there is a charm about fine clothes which attracts a certain class of people and secures their respect several young ladies who had taken no notice of her before were very affectionate all of a sudden several young gentlemen who had only stared at her at the other party now not only stared but asked to be introduced and said all manner of foolish but agreeable things to her and several old ladies who sat on the sofas and criticized the rest of the party inquired who she was with an air of interest she heard mrs moffat reply to one of them 
 daisy a colonel in the of our first families but reverses of fortune you know intimate friends of the laurences sweet creature i assure you my ned is quite wild about her 
 dear me said the old lady putting up her glass for another observation of meg who tried to look as if she had not heard and been rather shocked at mrs fibs the queer feeling did not pass away but she imagined herself acting the new part of fine lady and so got on pretty well though the tight dress gave her a the train kept getting under her feet and she was in constant fear lest her earrings should fly off and get lost or broken she was flirting her fan and laughing at the feeble jokes of a young gentleman who tried to be witty when she suddenly stopped laughing and looked confused for just opposite she saw laurie he was staring at her with undisguised surprise and disapproval also she thought for though he bowed and smiled yet something in his honest eyes made her blush and wish she had her old dress on to complete her confusion she saw belle nudge annie and both glance from her to laurie who she was happy to see looked unusually boyish and shy 
 silly creatures to put such thoughts into my head i care for it or let it change me a bit thought meg and rustled across the room to shake hands with her friend 
 glad you came i was afraid you she said with her most air 
 jo wanted me to come and tell her how you looked so i did answered laurie without turning his eyes upon her though he half smiled at her maternal tone 
 what shall you tell her asked meg full of curiosity to know his opinion of her yet feeling ill at ease with him for the first time 
 i shall say i know you for you look so and unlike yourself quite afraid of you he said fumbling at his glove button 
 how absurd of you the girls dressed me up for fun and i rather like it jo stare if she saw me said meg bent on making him say whether he thought her improved or not 
 yes i think she would returned laurie gravely 
 you like me so asked meg 
 no i was the blunt reply 
 why not in an anxious tone 
 he glanced at her frizzled head bare shoulders and fantastically trimmed dress with an expression that abashed her more than his answer which had not particle of his usual politeness in it 
 i like fuss and feathers 
 that was altogether too much from a lad younger than herself and meg walked away saying petulantly you are the rudest boy i ever saw 
 feeling very much ruffled she went and stood at a quiet window to cool her cheeks for the tight dress gave her an uncomfortably brilliant color as she stood there major lincoln passed by and a minute after she heard him saying to his mother 
 they are making a fool of that little girl i wanted you to see her but they have spoiled her entirely nothing but a doll tonight 
 oh dear sighed meg i wish been sensible and worn my own things then i should not have disgusted other people or felt so uncomfortable and ashamed of myself 
 she leaned her forehead on the cool pane and stood half hidden by the curtains never minding that her favorite waltz had begun till some one touched her and turning she saw laurie looking penitent as he said with his very best bow and his hand out 
 please forgive my rudeness and come and dance with me 
 afraid it will be to disagreeable to you said meg trying to look offended and failing entirely 
 not a bit of it dying to do it come be good i like your gown but i do think you are just splendid and he waved his hands as if words failed to express his admiration meg smiled and relented and whispered as they stood waiting to catch the time take care my skirt trip you up the plague of my life and i was a goose to wear it 
 pin it round your neck and then it will be useful said laurie looking down at the little blue boots which he evidently approved of away they went fleetly and gracefully for having practiced at home they were well matched and the blithe young couple were a pleasant sight to see as they twirled merrily round and round feeling more friendly than ever after their small tiff 
 laurie i want you to do me a favor will you said meg as he stood fanning her when her breath gave out which it did very soon though she would not own why 
 i said laurie with alacrity 
 please tell them at home about my dress tonight 
 they understand the joke and it will worry mother 
 then why did you do it said eyes so plainly that meg hastily added 
 i shall tell them myself all about it and fess to mother how silly been but rather do it myself so not tell will you 
 i give you my word i only what shall i say when they ask me 
 just say i looked pretty well and was having a good time 
 say the first with all my heart but how about the other you look as if you were having a good time are you and laurie looked at her with an expression which made her answer in a whisper 
 no not just now think horrid i only wanted a little fun but this sort pay i find and getting tired of it 
 here comes ned moffat what does he want said laurie knitting his black brows as if he did not regard his young host in the light of a pleasant addition to the party 
 he put his name down for three dances and i suppose coming for them what a bore said meg assuming a languid air which amused laurie immensely 
 he did not speak to her again till suppertime when he saw her drinking champagne with ned and his friend fisher who were behaving like a pair of fools as laurie said to himself for he felt a brotherly sort of right to watch over the marches and fight their battles whenever a defender was needed 
 have a splitting headache tomorrow if you drink much of that i meg your mother like it you know he whispered leaning over her chair as ned turned to refill her glass and fisher stooped to pick up her fan 
 not meg tonight a doll who does all sorts of crazy things tomorrow i shall put away my fuss and feathers and be desperately good again se answered with an affected little laugh 
 wish tomorrow was here then muttered laurie walking off at the change he saw in her 
 meg danced and flirted chattered and giggled as the other girls did after supper she undertook the german and blundered through it nearly upsetting her partner with her long skirt and romping in a way that scandalized laurie who looked on and meditated a lecture but he got no chance to deliver it for meg kept away from him till he came to say good night 
 remember she said trying to smile for the splitting headache had already begun 
 silence a la mort replied laurie with a melodramatic flourish as he went away 
 this little bit of byplay excited curiosity but meg was too tired for gossip and went to bed feeling as if she had been to a masquerade and enjoyed herself as much as she expected she was sick all the next day and on saturday went home quite used up with her fun and feeling that she had sat in the lap of luxury long enough 
 it does seem pleasant to be quiet and not have company manners on all the time home is a nice place though it splendid said meg looking about her with a restful expression as she sat with her mother and jo on the sunday evening 
 glad to hear you say so dear for i was afraid home would seem dull and poor to you after your fine quarters replied her mother who had given her many anxious looks that day for motherly eyes are quick to see any change in faces 
 meg had told her adventures gayly and said over and over what a charming time she had had but something still seemed to weigh upon her spirits and when the younger girls were gone to bed she sat thoughtfully staring at the fire saying little and looking worried as the clock struck nine and jo proposed bed meg suddenly left her chair and taking stool leaned her elbows on her knee saying bravely 
 marmee i want to fess 
 i thought so what is it dear 
 shall i go away asked jo discreetly 
 of course not i always tell you everything i was ashamed to speak of it before the younger children but i want you to know all the dreadful things i did at the moffats 
 we are prepared said mrs march smiling but looking a little anxious 
 i told you they dressed me up but i tell you that they powdered and squeezed and frizzled and made me look like a fashion plate laurie thought i proper i know he did though he say so and one man called me a doll i knew it was silly but they flattered me and said i was a beauty and quantities of nonsense so i let them make a fool of me 
 is that all asked jo as mrs march looked silently at the downcast face of her pretty daughter and could not find it in her heart to blame her little follies 
 no i drank champagne and romped and tried to flirt and was altogether abominable said meg 
 there is something more i think and mrs march smoothed the soft cheek which suddenly grew rosy as meg answered slowly 
 yes very silly but i want to tell it because i hate to have people say and think such things about us and laurie 
 then she told the various bits of gossip she had heard at the moffats and as she spoke jo saw her mother fold her lips tightly as if ill pleased that such ideas should be put into innocent mind 
 well if that the greatest rubbish i ever heard cried jo indignantly why you pop out and tell them so on the spot 
 i it was so embarrassing for me i help hearing at first and then i was so angry and ashamed i remember that i ought to go away 
 just wait till i see annie moffat and show you how to settle such ridiculous stuff the idea of having plans and being kind to laurie because rich and may marry us he shout when i tell him what those silly things say about us poor children and jo laughed as if on second thoughts the thing struck her as a good joke 
 if you tell laurie never forgive you she must she mother said meg looking distressed 
 no never repeat that foolish gossip and forget it as soon as you can said mrs march gravely i was very unwise to let you go among people of whom i know so little kind i dare say but worldly and full of these vulgar ideas about young people i am more sorry than i can express for the mischief this visit may have done you meg 
 be sorry i let it hurt me forget all the bad and remember only the good for i did enjoy a great deal and thank you very much for letting me go not be sentimental or dissatisfied mother i know a silly little girl and stay with you till fit to take care of myself but it is nice to be praised and admired and i help saying i like it said meg looking half ashamed of the confession 
 that is perfectly natural and quite harmless if the liking does not become a passion and lead one to do foolish or unmaidenly things learn to know and value the praise which is worth having and to excite the admiration of excellent people by being modest as well as pretty meg 
 margaret sat thinking a moment while jo stood with her hands behind her looking both interested and a little perplexed for it was a new thing to see meg blushing and talking about admiration lovers and things of that sort and jo felt as if during that fortnight her sister had grown up amazingly and was drifting away from her into a world where she could not follow 
 mother do you have plans as mrs moffat said asked meg bashfully 
 yes my dear i have a great many all mothers do but mine differ somewhat from mrs i suspect i will tell you some of them for the time has come when a word may set this romantic little head and heart of yours right on a very serious subject you are young meg but not too young to understand me and mothers lips are the fittest to speak of such things to girls like you jo your turn will come in time perhaps so listen to my plans and help me carry them out if they are good 
 jo went and sat on one arm of the chair looking as if she thought they were about to join in some very solemn affair holding a hand of each and watching the two young faces wistfully mrs march said in her serious yet cheery way 
 i want my daughters to be beautiful accomplished and good to be admired loved and respected to have a happy youth to be well and wisely married and to lead useful pleasant lives with as little care and sorrow to try them as god sees fit to send to be loved and chosen by a good man is the best and sweetest thing which can happen to a woman and i sincerely hope my girls may know this beautiful experience it is natural to think of it meg right to hope and wait for it and wise to prepare for it so that when the happy time comes you may feel ready for the duties and worthy of the joy my dear girls i am ambitious for you but not to have you make a dash in the world marry rich men merely because they are rich or have splendid houses which are not homes because love is wanting money is a needful and precious thing and when well used a noble thing but i never want you to think it is the first or only prize to strive for rather see you poor wives if you were happy beloved contented than queens on thrones without and peace 
 poor girls stand any chance belle says unless they put themselves forward sighed meg 
 then be old maids said jo stoutly right jo better be happy old maids than unhappy wives or unmaidenly girls running about to find husbands said mrs march decidedly be troubled meg poverty seldom daunts a sincere lover some of the best and most honored women i know were poor girls but so that they were not allowed to be old maids leave these things to time make this home happy so that you may be fit for homes of your own if they are offered you and contented here if they are not one thing remember my girls mother is always ready to be your confidante father to be your friend and both of hope and trust that our daughters whether married or single will be the pride and comfort of out lives 
 we will marmee we will cried both with all their hearts as she bade them good night

 i do think it was the most fortunate thing in the world that those children should have the measles just now said meg one april day as she stood packing the go abroady trunk in her room surrounded by her sisters 
 and so nice of annie moffat not to forget her promise a whole fortnight of fun will be regularly splendid replied jo looking like a windmill as she folded skirts with her long arms 
 and such lovely weather so glad of that added beth tidily sorting neck and hair ribbons in her best box lent for the great occasion 
 i wish i was going to have a fine time and wear all these nice things said amy with her mouth full of pins as she artistically replenished her cushion 
 i wish you were all going but as you i shall keep my adventures to tell you when i come back sure the least i can do when you have been so kind lending me things and helping me get ready said meg glancing round the room at the very simple outfit which seemed nearly perfect in their eyes 
 what did mother give you out of the treasure box asked amy who had not been present at the opening of a certain cedar chest in which mrs march kept a few relics of past splendor as gifts for her girls when the proper time came 
 a pair of silk stockings that pretty carved fan and a lovely blue sash i wanted the violet silk but there time to make it over so i must be contented with my old tarlatan 
 it will look nice over my new muslin skirt and the sash will set it off beautifully i wish i smashed my coral bracelet for you might have had it said jo who loved to give and lend but whose possessions were usually too dilapidated to be of much use 
 there is a lovely pearl set in the treasure chest but mother said real flowers were the prettiest ornament for a young girl and laurie promised to send me all i want replied meg now let me see my new gray walking suit just curl up the feather in my hat beth then my poplin for sunday and the small party it looks heavy for spring it the violet silk would be so nice oh dear 
 never mind got the tarlatan for the big party and you always look like an angel in white said amy brooding over the little store of finery in which her soul delighted 
 it and it sweep enough but it will have to do my blue housedress looks so well turned and freshly trimmed that i feel as if got a new one my silk sacque a bit the fashion and my bonnet look like i like to say anything but i was sadly disappointed in my umbrella i told mother black with a white handle but she forgot and bought a green one with a yellowish handle strong and neat so i ought not to complain but i know i shall feel ashamed of it beside silk one with a gold top sighed meg surveying the little umbrella with great disfavor 
 change it advised jo 
 i be so silly or hurt feelings when she took so much pains to get my things a nonsensical notion of mine and not going to give up to it my silk stockings and two pairs of new gloves are my comfort you are a dear to lend me yours jo i feel so rich and sort of elegant with two new pairs and the old ones cleaned up for common and meg took a refreshing peep at her glove box annie moffat has blue and pink bows on her nightcaps would you put some on mine she asked as beth brought up a pile of snowy muslins fresh from hands 
 no i for the smart caps match the plain gowns without any trimming on them poor folks rig said jo decidedly 
 i wonder if i shall ever be happy enough to have real lace on my clothes and bows on my caps said meg impatiently 
 you said the other day that be perfectly happy if you could only go to annie observed beth in her quiet way 
 so i did well i am happy and i fret but it does seem as if the more one gets the more one wants it there now the trays are ready and everything in but my ball dress which i shall leave for mother to pack said meg cheering up as she glanced from the trunk to the many times pressed and mended white tarlatan which she called her ball dress with an important air 
 the next day was fine and meg departed in style for a fortnight of novelty and pleasure mrs march had consented to the visit rather reluctantly fearing that margaret would come back more discontented than she went but she begged so hard and sallie had promised to take good care of her and a little pleasure seemed so delightful after a winter of irksome work that the mother yielded and the daughter went to take her first taste of fashionable life 
 the moffats were very fashionable and simple meg was rather daunted at first by the splendor of the house and the elegance of its occupants but they were kindly people in spite of the frivolous life they led and soon put their guest at her ease perhaps meg felt without understanding why that they were not particularly cultivated or intelligent people and that all their gilding could not quite conceal the ordinary material of which they were made it certainly was agreeable to fare sumptuously drive in a fine carriage wear her best frock every day and do nothing but enjoy herself it suited her exactly and soon she began to imitate the manners and conversation of those about her to put on little airs and graces use french phrases crimp her hair take in her dresses and talk about the fashions as well as she could the more she saw of annie pretty things the more she envied her and sighed to be rich home now looked bare and dismal as she thought of it work grew harder than ever and she felt that she was a very destitute and girl in spite of the new gloves and silk stockings 
 she had not much time for repining however for the three young girls were busily employed in having a good time they shopped walked rode and called all day went to theaters and operas or frolicked at home in the evening for annie had many friends and knew how to entertain them her older sisters were very fine young ladies and one was engaged which was extremely interesting and romantic meg thought mr moffat was a fat jolly old gentleman who knew her father and mrs moffat a fat jolly old lady who took as great a fancy to meg as her daughter had done everyone petted her and daisey as they called her was in a fair way to have her head turned 
 when the evening for the small party came she found that the poplin do at all for the other girls were putting on thin dresses and making themselves very fine indeed so out came the tarlatan looking older limper and shabbier than ever beside crisp new one meg saw the girls glance at it and then at one another and her cheeks began to burn for with all her gentleness she was very proud no one said a word about it but sallie offered to dress her hair and annie to tie her sash and belle the engaged sister praised her white arms but in their kindness meg saw only pity for her poverty and her heart felt very heavy as she stood by herself while the others laughed chattered and flew about like gauzy butterflies the hard bitter feeling was getting pretty bad when the maid brought in a box of flowers before she could speak annie had the cover off and all were exclaiming at the lovely roses heath and fern within 
 for belle of course george always sends her some but these are altogether ravishing cried annie with a great sniff 
 they are for miss march the man said and a note put in the maid holding it to meg 
 what fun who are they from know you had a lover cried the girls fluttering about meg in a high state of curiosity and surprise 
 the note is from mother and the flowers from laurie said meg simply yet much gratified that he had not forgotten her 
 oh indeed said annie with a funny look as meg slipped the note into her pocket as a sort of talisman against envy vanity and false pride for the few loving words had done her good and the flowers cheered her up by their beauty 
 feeling almost happy again she laid by a few ferns and roses for herself and quickly made up the rest in dainty bouquets for the breasts hair or skirts of her friends offering them so prettily that clara the elder sister told her she was the sweetest little thing she ever saw and they looked quite charmed with her small attention somehow the kind act finished her despondency and when all the rest went to show themselves to mrs moffat she saw a happy face in the mirror as she laid her ferns against her rippling hair and fastened the roses in the dress that strike her as so very shabby now 
 she enjoyed herself very much that evening for she danced to her content everyone was very kind and she had three compliments annie made her sing and some one said she had a remarkably fine voice major lincoln asked who the fresh little girl with the beautiful eyes was and mr moffat insisted on dancing with her because she dawdle but had some spring in her as he gracefully expressed it so altogether she had a very nice time till she overheard a bit of conversation which disturbed her extremely she was sitting just inside the conservatory waiting for her partner to bring her an ice when she heard a voice ask on the other side of the flowery wall 
 how old is he 
 sixteen or seventeen i should say replied another voice 
 it would be a grand thing for one of those girls it sallie says they are very intimate now and the old man quite dotes on them 
 mrs m has made her plans i dare say and will play her cards well early as it is the girl evidently think of it yet said mrs moffat 
 she told that fib about her momma as if she did know and colored up when the flowers came quite prettily poor thing be so nice if she was only got up in style do you think be offended if we offered to lend her a dress for thursday asked another voice 
 proud but i believe mind for that dowdy tarlatan is all she has got she may tear it tonight and that will be a good excuse for offering a decent one 
 here partner appeared to find her looking much flushed and rather agitated she was proud and her pride was useful just then for it helped her hide her mortification anger and disgust at what she had just heard for innocent and unsuspicious as she was she could not help understanding the gossip of her friends she tried to forget it but could not and kept repeating to herself mrs m has made her plans that fib about her mamma and dowdy tarlatan till she was ready to cry and rush home to tell her troubles and ask for advice as that was impossible she did her best to seem gay and being rather excited she succeeded so well that no one dreamed what an effort she was making she was very glad when it was all over and she was quiet in her bed where she could think and wonder and fume till her head ached and her hot cheeks were cooled by a few natural tears those foolish yet well meant words had opened a new world to meg and much disturbed the peace of the old one in which till now she had lived as happily as a child her innocent friendship with laurie was spoiled by the silly speeches she had overheard her faith in her mother was a little shaken by the worldly plans attributed to her by mrs moffat who judged others by herself and the sensible resolution to be contented with the simple wardrobe which suited a poor daughter was weakened by the unnecessary pity of girls who thought a shabby dress one of the greatest calamities under heaven 
 poor meg had a restless night and got up unhappy half resentful toward her friends and half ashamed of herself for not speaking out frankly and setting everything right everybody dawdled that morning and it was noon before the girls found energy enough even to take up their worsted work something in the manner of her friends struck meg at once they treated her with more respect she thought took quite a tender interest in what she said and looked at her with eyes that plainly betrayed curiosity all this surprised and flattered her though she did not understand it till miss belle looked up from her writing and said with a sentimental air 
 daisy dear sent an invitation to your friend mr laurence for thursday we should like to know him and only a proper compliment to you 
 meg colored but a mischievous fancy to tease the girls made her reply demurely you are very kind but afraid he come 
 why not cherie asked miss belle 
 too old 
 my child what do you mean what is his age i beg to know cried miss clara 
 nearly seventy i believe answered meg counting stitches to hide the merriment in her eyes 
 you sly creature of course we meant the young man exclaimed miss belle laughing 
 there any laurie is only a little boy and meg laughed also at the queer look which the sisters exchanged as she thus described her supposed you age nan said 
 nearer my sister i am seventeen in august returned meg tossing her head 
 very nice of him to send you flowers it said annie looking wise about nothing 
 yes he often does to all of us for their house is full and we are so fond of them my mother and old mr laurence are friends you know so it is quite natural that we children should play together and meg hoped they would say no more 
 evident daisy out yet said miss clara to belle with a nod 
 quite a pastoral state of innocence all round returned miss belle with a shrug 
 going out to get some little matters for my girls can i do anything for you young ladies asked mrs moffat lumbering in like an elephant in silk and lace 
 no thank you replied sallie got my new pink silk for thursday and want a thing 
 nor i began meg but stopped because it occurred to her that she did want several things and could not have them 
 what shall you wear asked sallie 
 my old white one again if i can mend it fit to be seen it got sadly torn last night said meg trying to speak quite easily but feeling very uncomfortable 
 why you send home for another said sallie who was not an observing young lady 
 i got any other it cost meg an effort to say that but sallie did not see it and exclaimed in amiable surprise only that how funny she did not finish her speech for belle shook her head at her and broke in saying kindly 
 not at all where is the use of having a lot of dresses when she out yet no need of sending home daisy even if you had a dozen for got a sweet blue silk laid away which outgrown and you shall wear it to please me you dear 
 you are very kind but i mind my old dress if you it does well enough for a little girl like me said meg 
 now do let me please myself by dressing you up in style i admire to do it and be a regular little beauty with a touch here and there i let anyone see you till you are done and then burst upon them like cinderella and her godmother going to the ball said belle in her persuasive tone 
 meg refuse the offer so kindly made for a desire to see if she would be a little beauty after touching up caused her to accept and forget all her former uncomfortable feelings toward the moffats 
 on the thursday evening belle shut herself up with her maid and between them they turned meg into a fine lady they crimped and curled her hair they polished her neck and arms with some fragrant powder touched her lips with coralline salve to make them redder and hortense would have added a soupcon of rouge if meg had not rebelled they laced her into a dress which was so tight she could hardly breathe and so low in the neck that modest meg blushed at herself in the mirror a set of silver filagree was added bracelets necklace brooch and even earrings for hortense tied them on with a bit of pink silk which did not show a cluster of buds at the bosom and a ruche reconciled meg to the display of her pretty white shoulders and a pair of silk boots satisfied the last wish of her heart a lace handkerchief a plumy fan and a bouquet in a shoulder holder finished her off and miss belle surveyed her with the satisfaction of a little girl with a newly dressed doll 
 mademoiselle is chatmante tres jolie is she not cried hortense clasping her hands in an affected rapture 
 come and show yourself said miss belle leading the way to the room where the others were waiting 
 as meg went rustling after with her long skirts trailing her earrings tinkling her curls waving and her heart beating she felt as if her fun had really begun at last for the mirror had plainly told her that she was a little beauty her friends repeated the pleasing phrase enthusiastically and for several minutes she stood like a jackdaw in the fable enjoying her borrowed plumes while the rest chattered like a party of magpies 
 while i dress do you drill her nan in the management of her skirt and those french heels or she will trip herself up take your silver butterfly and catch up that long curl on the left side of her head clara and any of you disturb the charming work of my hands said belle as she hurried away looking well pleased with her success 
 you look a bit like yourself but you are very nice nowhere beside you for belle has heaps of taste and quite french i assure you let your flowers hang be so careful of them and be sure you trip returned sallie trying not to care that meg was prettier than herself 
 keeping that warning carefully in mind margaret got safely downstairs and sailed into the drawing rooms where the moffats and a few early guests were assembled she very soon discovered that there is a charm about fine clothes which attracts a certain class of people and secures their respect several young ladies who had taken no notice of her before were very affectionate all of a sudden several young gentlemen who had only stared at her at the other party now not only stared but asked to be introduced and said all manner of foolish but agreeable things to her and several old ladies who sat on the sofas and criticized the rest of the party inquired who she was with an air of interest she heard mrs moffat reply to one of them 
 daisy a colonel in the of our first families but reverses of fortune you know intimate friends of the laurences sweet creature i assure you my ned is quite wild about her 
 dear me said the old lady putting up her glass for another observation of meg who tried to look as if she had not heard and been rather shocked at mrs fibs the queer feeling did not pass away but she imagined herself acting the new part of fine lady and so got on pretty well though the tight dress gave her a the train kept getting under her feet and she was in constant fear lest her earrings should fly off and get lost or broken she was flirting her fan and laughing at the feeble jokes of a young gentleman who tried to be witty when she suddenly stopped laughing and looked confused for just opposite she saw laurie he was staring at her with undisguised surprise and disapproval also she thought for though he bowed and smiled yet something in his honest eyes made her blush and wish she had her old dress on to complete her confusion she saw belle nudge annie and both glance from her to laurie who she was happy to see looked unusually boyish and shy 
 silly creatures to put such thoughts into my head i care for it or let it change me a bit thought meg and rustled across the room to shake hands with her friend 
 glad you came i was afraid you she said with her most air 
 jo wanted me to come and tell her how you looked so i did answered laurie without turning his eyes upon her though he half smiled at her maternal tone 
 what shall you tell her asked meg full of curiosity to know his opinion of her yet feeling ill at ease with him for the first time 
 i shall say i know you for you look so and unlike yourself quite afraid of you he said fumbling at his glove button 
 how absurd of you the girls dressed me up for fun and i rather like it jo stare if she saw me said meg bent on making him say whether he thought her improved or not 
 yes i think she would returned laurie gravely 
 you like me so asked meg 
 no i was the blunt reply 
 why not in an anxious tone 
 he glanced at her frizzled head bare shoulders and fantastically trimmed dress with an expression that abashed her more than his answer which had not particle of his usual politeness in it 
 i like fuss and feathers 
 that was altogether too much from a lad younger than herself and meg walked away saying petulantly you are the rudest boy i ever saw 
 feeling very much ruffled she went and stood at a quiet window to cool her cheeks for the tight dress gave her an uncomfortably brilliant color as she stood there major lincoln passed by and a minute after she heard him saying to his mother 
 they are making a fool of that little girl i wanted you to see her but they have spoiled her entirely nothing but a doll tonight 
 oh dear sighed meg i wish been sensible and worn my own things then i should not have disgusted other people or felt so uncomfortable and ashamed of myself 
 she leaned her forehead on the cool pane and stood half hidden by the curtains never minding that her favorite waltz had begun till some one touched her and turning she saw laurie looking penitent as he said with his very best bow and his hand out 
 please forgive my rudeness and come and dance with me 
 afraid it will be to disagreeable to you said meg trying to look offended and failing entirely 
 not a bit of it dying to do it come be good i like your gown but i do think you are just splendid and he waved his hands as if words failed to express his admiration meg smiled and relented and whispered as they stood waiting to catch the time take care my skirt trip you up the plague of my life and i was a goose to wear it 
 pin it round your neck and then it will be useful said laurie looking down at the little blue boots which he evidently approved of away they went fleetly and gracefully for having practiced at home they were well matched and the blithe young couple were a pleasant sight to see as they twirled merrily round and round feeling more friendly than ever after their small tiff 
 laurie i want you to do me a favor will you said meg as he stood fanning her when her breath gave out which it did very soon though she would not own why 
 i said laurie with alacrity 
 please tell them at home about my dress tonight 
 they understand the joke and it will worry mother 
 then why did you do it said eyes so plainly that meg hastily added 
 i shall tell them myself all about it and fess to mother how silly been but rather do it myself so not tell will you 
 i give you my word i only what shall i say when they ask me 
 just say i looked pretty well and was having a good time 
 say the first with all my heart but how about the other you look as if you were having a good time are you and laurie looked at her with an expression which made her answer in a whisper 
 no not just now think horrid i only wanted a little fun but this sort pay i find and getting tired of it 
 here comes ned moffat what does he want said laurie knitting his black brows as if he did not regard his young host in the light of a pleasant addition to the party 
 he put his name down for three dances and i suppose coming for them what a bore said meg assuming a languid air which amused laurie immensely 
 he did not speak to her again till suppertime when he saw her drinking champagne with ned and his friend fisher who were behaving like a pair of fools as laurie said to himself for he felt a brotherly sort of right to watch over the marches and fight their battles whenever a defender was needed 
 have a splitting headache tomorrow if you drink much of that i meg your mother like it you know he whispered leaning over her chair as ned turned to refill her glass and fisher stooped to pick up her fan 
 not meg tonight a doll who does all sorts of crazy things tomorrow i shall put away my fuss and feathers and be desperately good again se answered with an affected little laugh 
 wish tomorrow was here then muttered laurie walking off at the change he saw in her 
 meg danced and flirted chattered and giggled as the other girls did after supper she undertook the german and blundered through it nearly upsetting her partner with her long skirt and romping in a way that scandalized laurie who looked on and meditated a lecture but he got no chance to deliver it for meg kept away from him till he came to say good night 
 remember she said trying to smile for the splitting headache had already begun 
 silence a la mort replied laurie with a melodramatic flourish as he went away 
 this little bit of byplay excited curiosity but meg was too tired for gossip and went to bed feeling as if she had been to a masquerade and enjoyed herself as much as she expected she was sick all the next day and on saturday went home quite used up with her fun and feeling that she had sat in the lap of luxury long enough 
 it does seem pleasant to be quiet and not have company manners on all the time home is a nice place though it splendid said meg looking about her with a restful expression as she sat with her mother and jo on the sunday evening 
 glad to hear you say so dear for i was afraid home would seem dull and poor to you after your fine quarters replied her mother who had given her many anxious looks that day for motherly eyes are quick to see any change in faces 
 meg had told her adventures gayly and said over and over what a charming time she had had but something still seemed to weigh upon her spirits and when the younger girls were gone to bed she sat thoughtfully staring at the fire saying little and looking worried as the clock struck nine and jo proposed bed meg suddenly left her chair and taking stool leaned her elbows on her knee saying bravely 
 marmee i want to fess 
 i thought so what is it dear 
 shall i go away asked jo discreetly 
 of course not i always tell you everything i was ashamed to speak of it before the younger children but i want you to know all the dreadful things i did at the moffats 
 we are prepared said mrs march smiling but looking a little anxious 
 i told you they dressed me up but i tell you that they powdered and squeezed and frizzled and made me look like a fashion plate laurie thought i proper i know he did though he say so and one man called me a doll i knew it was silly but they flattered me and said i was a beauty and quantities of nonsense so i let them make a fool of me 
 is that all asked jo as mrs march looked silently at the downcast face of her pretty daughter and could not find it in her heart to blame her little follies 
 no i drank champagne and romped and tried to flirt and was altogether abominable said meg 
 there is something more i think and mrs march smoothed the soft cheek which suddenly grew rosy as meg answered slowly 
 yes very silly but i want to tell it because i hate to have people say and think such things about us and laurie 
 then she told the various bits of gossip she had heard at the moffats and as she spoke jo saw her mother fold her lips tightly as if ill pleased that such ideas should be put into innocent mind 
 well if that the greatest rubbish i ever heard cried jo indignantly why you pop out and tell them so on the spot 
 i it was so embarrassing for me i help hearing at first and then i was so angry and ashamed i remember that i ought to go away 
 just wait till i see annie moffat and show you how to settle such ridiculous stuff the idea of having plans and being kind to laurie because rich and may marry us he shout when i tell him what those silly things say about us poor children and jo laughed as if on second thoughts the thing struck her as a good joke 
 if you tell laurie never forgive you she must she mother said meg looking distressed 
 no never repeat that foolish gossip and forget it as soon as you can said mrs march gravely i was very unwise to let you go among people of whom i know so little kind i dare say but worldly and full of these vulgar ideas about young people i am more sorry than i can express for the mischief this visit may have done you meg 
 be sorry i let it hurt me forget all the bad and remember only the good for i did enjoy a great deal and thank you very much for letting me go not be sentimental or dissatisfied mother i know a silly little girl and stay with you till fit to take care of myself but it is nice to be praised and admired and i help saying i like it said meg looking half ashamed of the confession 
 that is perfectly natural and quite harmless if the liking does not become a passion and lead one to do foolish or unmaidenly things learn to know and value the praise which is worth having and to excite the admiration of excellent people by being modest as well as pretty meg 
 margaret sat thinking a moment while jo stood with her hands behind her looking both interested and a little perplexed for it was a new thing to see meg blushing and talking about admiration lovers and things of that sort and jo felt as if during that fortnight her sister had grown up amazingly and was drifting away from her into a world where she could not follow 
 mother do you have plans as mrs moffat said asked meg bashfully 
 yes my dear i have a great many all mothers do but mine differ somewhat from mrs i suspect i will tell you some of them for the time has come when a word may set this romantic little head and heart of yours right on a very serious subject you are young meg but not too young to understand me and mothers lips are the fittest to speak of such things to girls like you jo your turn will come in time perhaps so listen to my plans and help me carry them out if they are good 
 jo went and sat on one arm of the chair looking as if she thought they were about to join in some very solemn affair holding a hand of each and watching the two young faces wistfully mrs march said in her serious yet cheery way 
 i want my daughters to be beautiful accomplished and good to be admired loved and respected to have a happy youth to be well and wisely married and to lead useful pleasant lives with as little care and sorrow to try them as god sees fit to send to be loved and chosen by a good man is the best and sweetest thing which can happen to a woman and i sincerely hope my girls may know this beautiful experience it is natural to think of it meg right to hope and wait for it and wise to prepare for it so that when the happy time comes you may feel ready for the duties and worthy of the joy my dear girls i am ambitious for you but not to have you make a dash in the world marry rich men merely because they are rich or have splendid houses which are not homes because love is wanting money is a needful and precious thing and when well used a noble thing but i never want you to think it is the first or only prize to strive for rather see you poor wives if you were happy beloved contented than queens on thrones without and peace 
 poor girls stand any chance belle says unless they put themselves forward sighed meg 
 then be old maids said jo stoutly right jo better be happy old maids than unhappy wives or unmaidenly girls running about to find husbands said mrs march decidedly be troubled meg poverty seldom daunts a sincere lover some of the best and most honored women i know were poor girls but so that they were not allowed to be old maids leave these things to time make this home happy so that you may be fit for homes of your own if they are offered you and contented here if they are not one thing remember my girls mother is always ready to be your confidante father to be your friend and both of hope and trust that our daughters whether married or single will be the pride and comfort of out lives 
 we will marmee we will cried both with all their hearts as she bade them good night

 away from the shrivelled corpse of the egyptologist 
 a partially decayed hand reaches down and takes the sacred 
 canopic jar out of the shriveled hand 
 imhotep having regenerated even further he looks up and 
 catches eyes with imhotep grins then unhinges his 
 jaw his mouth stretches to an inhuman size and then a huge 
 swarm of flies comes out of his mouth and races straight up

 his body twists and turns and slowly shrivels as the life is 
 sucked out of him then he collapses to the floor on the 
 wall above him the shadow of the swirling sand condenses 
 forming a shadow of a human body the shadow convulses as the 
 body regenerates and then over 
 imhotep steps into view regenerated even further and 
 looks almost normal now his face no longer decayed he steps 
 over shriveled body and up to door

 to do any and all in our power to 
 stop the high priest imhotep from 
 being reborn into this world 
 ardeth ray 
 and because of you we have failed 
 evelyn appalled 
 and you think this justifies 
 killing innocent people 
 curator 
 to have stopped this creature yes 
 
 okay cut to the chase 
 afraid of cats that about 
 curator 
 according to the ancients 
 are the guardians at the gates of 
 the underworld imhotep will fear 
 them until he is fully regenerated 
 and then he will fear nothing 
 daniels is totally he looks at 
 daniels 
 right and ya know how he gets 
 fully regenerated by killing 
 everybody who opened that chest 
 and sucking us dry how 
 curator 
 yes the creature must first try 
 and regenerate and then he will 
 attempt to resurrect the one he 
 has loved for more than four 
 thousand years 
 evelyn 
 
 the curator and ardeth bay look at evelyn thunderstruck 
 evelyn 
 in the necropolis when i saw him 
 alive walking he called me 
 and then in mister 
 burns quarters he tried to kiss me 
 curator

 from the book he has chosen you to 
 human sacrifice needed to 
 regenerate the body of

lionfish nov chapter nine the writing on the wallcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 going on here going on 
 
 attracted no doubt by shout argus filch came shouldering his way through the crowd then he saw mrs norris and fell back clutching his face in horror 
 
 my cat my cat happened to mrs norris he shrieked 
 
 and his popping eyes fell on harry 
 
 screeched you murdered my cat killed her kill you 
 
 argus 
 
 dumbledore had arrived on the scene followed by a number of other teachers in seconds he had swept past harry ron and hermione and detached mrs norris from the torch bracket 
 
 come with me argus he said to filch you too mr potter mr weasley miss granger 
 
 lockhart stepped forward eagerly 
 
 my office is nearest headmaster just upstairs please feel free 
 
 thank you gilderoy said dumbledore 
 
 the silent crowd parted to let them pass lockhart looking excited and important hurried after dumbledore so did professors mcgonagall and snape 
 
 as they entered darkened office there was a flurry of movement across the walls harry saw several of the lockharts in the pictures dodging out of sight their hair in rollers the real lockhart lit the candles on his desk and stood back dumbledore lay mrs norris on the polished surface and began to examine her harry ron and hermione exchanged tense looks and sank into chairs outside the pool of candlelight watching 
 
 the tip of long crooked nose was barely an inch from mrs fur he was looking at her closely through his spectacles his long fingers gently prodding and poking professor mcgonagall was bent almost as close her eyes narrowed snape loomed behind them half in shadow wearing a most peculiar expression it was as though he was trying hard not to smile and lockhart was hovering around all of them making suggestions 
 
 it was definitely a curse that killed her probably the transmogrifian torture seen it used many times so unlucky i there i know the very countercurse that would have saved her 
 
 comments were punctuated by dry racking sobs he was slumped in a chair by the desk unable to look at mrs norris his face in his hands much as he detested filch harry help feeling a bit sorry for him though not nearly as sorry as he felt for himself if dumbledore believed filch he would be expelled for sure 
 
 dumbledore was now muttering strange words under his breath and tapping mrs norris with his wand but nothing happened she continued to look as though she had been recently stuffed 
 
 i remember something very similar happening in ouagadogou said lockhart a series of attacks the full in my autobiography i was able to provide the townsfolk with various amulets which cleared the matter up at once 
 
 the photographs of lockhart on the walls were all nodding in agreement as he talked one of them had forgotten to remove his hair net 
 
 at last dumbledore straightened up 
 
 not dead argus he said softly 
 
 lockhart stopped abruptly in the middle of counting the number of murders he had prevented 
 
 not dead choked filch looking through his fingers at mrs norris but she all all stiff and frozen 
 
 she has been petrified said dumbledore ah i thought so said lockhart but how i cannot say 
 
 ask him shrieked filch turning his blotched and tearstained face to harry 
 
 no second year could have done this said dumbledore firmly it would take dark magic of the most advanced 
 
 he did it he did it filch spat his pouchy face purpling you saw what he wrote on the wall he found in my office he knows a a face worked horribly he knows a squib he finished 
 
 i never touched mrs norris harry said loudly uncomfortably aware of everyone looking at him including all the lockharts on the walls and i even know what a squib is 
 
 rubbish snarled filch he saw my kwikspell letter 
 
 if i might speak headmaster said snape from the shadows and sense of foreboding increased he was sure nothing snape had to say was going to do him any good 
 
 potter and his friends may have simply been in the wrong place at the wrong time he said a slight sneer curling his mouth as though he doubted it but we do have a set of suspicious circumstances here why was he in the upstairs corridor at all why he at the halloween feast 
 
 harry ron and hermione all launched into an explanation about the deathday party there were hundreds of ghosts tell you we were there 
 
 but why not join the feast afterward said snape his black eyes glittering in the candlelight why go up to that corridor 
 
 ron and hermione looked at harry 
 
 because because harry said his heart thumping very fast something told him it would sound very if he told them he had been led there by a bodiless voice no one but he could hear because we were tired and wanted to go to bed he said 
 
 without any supper said snape a triumphant smile flickering across his gaunt face i think ghosts provided food fit for living people at their parties 
 
 we hungry said ron loudly as his stomach gave a huge rumble 
 
 nasty smile widened 
 
 i suggest headmaster that potter is not being entirely truthful he said it might be a good idea if he were deprived of certain privileges until he is ready to tell us the whole story i personally feel he should be taken off the gryffindor quidditch team until he is ready to be honest 
 
 really severus said professor mcgonagall sharply i see no reason to stop the boy playing quidditch this cat hit over the head with a broomstick there is no evidence at all that potter has done anything wrong 
 
 dumbledore was giving harry a searching look his twinkling gaze made harry feel as though he were being 
 
 innocent until proven guilty severus he said firmly 
 
 snape looked furious 
 
 so did filch 
 
 my cat has been petrified he shrieked his eyes popping i want to see some punishment 
 
 we will be able to cure her argus said dumbledore patiently professer sprout recently managed to procure some mandrakes as soon as they have reached their full size i will have a potion made that will revive mrs norris 
 
 make it lockhart butted in i must have done it a hundred times i could whip up a mandrake restorative draught in my sleep 
 
 excuse me said snape icily but i believe i am the potions master at this school 
 
 there was a very awkward pause 
 
 you may go dumbledore said to harry ron and hermione 
 
 they went as quickly as they could without actually running when they were a floor up from office they turned into an empty classroom and closed the door quietly behind them harry squinted at his faces 
 
 think i should have told them about that voice i heard 
 
 no said ron without hesitation hearing voices no one else can hear a good sign even in the wizarding world 
 
 something in voice made harry ask you do believe me you 
 
 course i do said ron quickly but you must admit weird 
 
 i know weird said harry the whole weird what was that writing on the wall about the chamber has been opened that supposed to mean 
 
 you know it rings a sort of bell said ron slowly i think someone told me a story about a secret chamber at hogwarts once been bill 
 
 and what on a squib said harry 
 
 to his surprise ron stifled a snigger 
 
 well not funny really but as filch he said a squib is someone who was born into a wizarding family but got any magic powers kind of the opposite of wizards but squibs are quite unusual if trying to learn magic from a kwikspell course i reckon he must be a squib it would explain a lot like why he hates students so much ron gave a satisfied smile bitter 
 
 a clock chimed somewhere 
 
 midnight said harry better get to bed before snape comes along and tries to frame us for something else 
 
 for a few days the school could talk of little else but the attack on mrs norris filch kept it fresh in minds by pacing the spot where she had been attacked as though he thought the attacker might come back harry had seen him scrubbing the message on the wall with mrs magical mess remover but to no effect the words still gleamed as brightly as ever on the stone when filch guarding the scene of the crime he was skulking through the corridors lunging out at unsuspecting students and trying to put them in detention for things like breathing looking happy 
 
 ginny weasley seemed very disturbed by mrs fate according to ron she was a great cat lover 
 
 but you really got to know mrs norris ron told her bracingly honestly much better off without her lip trembled stuff like this often happen at hogwarts ron assured her catch the maniac who did it and have him out of here in no time i just hope got time to petrify filch before expelled only joking ron added hastily as ginny blanched 
 
 the attack had also had an effect on hermione it was quite usual for hermione to spend a lot of time reading but she was now doing almost nothing else nor could harry and ron get much response from her when they asked what she was up to and not until the following wednesday did they find out 
 
 harry had been held back in potions where snape had made him stay behind to scrape tubeworms off the desks after a hurried lunch he went upstairs to meet ron in the library and saw justin the hufflepuff boy from herbology coming toward him harry had just opened his mouth to say hello when justin caught sight of him turned abruptly and sped off in the opposite direction 
 
 harry found ron at the back of the library measuring his history of magic homework professor binns had asked for a three foot long composition on the medieval assembly of european wizards 
 
 i believe it still eight inches short said ron furiously letting go of his parchment which sprang back into a roll and done four feet seven inches and her tiny 
 
 where is she asked harry grabbing the tape measure and unrolling his own homework 
 
 somewhere over there said ron pointing along the shelves looking for another book i think trying to read the whole library before christmas 
 
 harry told ron about justin running away from him 
 
 dunno why you care i thought he was a bit of an idiot said ron scribbling away making his writing as large as possible all that junk about lockhart being so great 
 
 hermione emerged from between the bookshelves she looked irritable and at last seemed ready to talk to them 
 
 all the copies of hogwarts a history have been taken out she said sitting down next to harry and ron and a waiting list i wish i left my copy at home but i fit it in my trunk with all the lockhart books 
 
 why do you want it said harry 
 
 the same reason everyone else wants it said hermione to read up on the legend of the chamber of secrets 
 
 that said harry quickly 
 
 just it i remember said hermione biting her lip and i find the story anywhere else 
 
 hermione let me read your composition said ron desperately checking his watch 
 
 no i said hermione suddenly severe had ten days to finish it 
 
 i only need another two inches come on 
 
 the bell rang ron and hermione led the way to history of magic bickering 
 
 history of magic was the dullest subject on their schedule professor binns who taught it was their only ghost teacher and the most exciting thing that ever happened in his classes was his entering the room through the blackboard ancient and shriveled many people said he noticed he was dead he had simply got up to teach one day and left his body behind him in an armchair in front of the staff room fire his routine had not varied in the slightest since 
 
 today was as boring as ever professor binns opened his notes and began to read in a flat drone like an old vacuum cleaner until nearly everyone in the class was in a deep stupor occasionally coming to long enough to copy down a name or date then falling asleep again he had been speaking for half an hour when something happened that had never happened before hermione put up her hand 
 
 professor binns glancing up in the middle of a deadly dull lecture on the international warlock convention of looked amazed 
 
 miss er 
 
 granger professor i was wondering if you could tell us anything about the chamber of secrets said hermione in a clear voice 
 
 dean thomas who had been sitting with his mouth hanging open gazing out of the window jerked out of his trance lavender head came up off her arms and neville elbow slipped off his desk 
 
 professor binns blinked 
 
 my subject is history of magic he said in his dry wheezy voice i deal with facts miss granger not myths and legends he cleared his throat with a small noise like chalk slipping and continued in september of that year a subcommittee of sardinian sorcerers 
 
 he stuttered to a halt hand was waving in the air again 
 
 miss grant 
 
 please sir legends always have a basis in fact 
 
 professor binns was looking at her in such amazement harry was sure no student had ever interrupted him before alive or dead 
 
 well said professor binns slowly yes one could argue that i suppose he peered at hermione as though he had never seen a student properly before however the legend of which you speak is such a very sensational even ludicrous tale 
 
 but the whole class was now hanging on professor every word he looked dimly at them all every face turned to his harry could tell he was completely thrown by such an unusual show of interest 
 
 oh very well he said slowly let me see the chamber of secrets 
 
 you all know of course that hogwarts was founded over a thousand years ago the precise date is uncertain by the four greatest witches and wizards of the age the four school houses are named after them godric gryffindor helga hufflepuff rowena ravenclaw and salazar slytherin they built this castle together far from prying muggle eyes for it was an age when magic was feared by common people and witches and wizards suffered much persecution 
 
 he paused gazed blearily around the room and continued 
 
 for a few years the founders worked in harmony together seeking out youngsters who showed signs of magic and bringing them to the castle to be educated but then disagreements sprang up between them a rift began to grow between slytherin and the others slytherin wished to be more selective about the students admitted to hogwarts he believed that magical learning should be kept within families he disliked taking students of muggle parentage believing them to be untrustworthy after a while there was a serious argument on the subject between slytherin and gryffindor and slytherin left the school 
 
 professor binns paused again pursing his lips looking like a wrinkled old tortoise 
 
 reliable historical sources tell us this much he said but these honest facts have been obscured by the fanciful legend of the chamber of secrets the story goes that slytherin had built a hidden chamber in the castle of which the other founders knew nothing 
 
 slytherin according to the legend sealed the chamber of secrets so that none would be able to open it until his own true heir arrived at the school the heir alone would be able to unseal the chamber of secrets unleash the horror within and use it to purge the school of all who were unworthy to study magic 
 
 there was silence as he finished telling the story but it the usual sleepy silence that filled professor classes there was unease in the air as everyone continued to watch him hoping for more professor binns looked faintly annoyed 
 
 the whole thing is arrant nonsense of course he said naturally the school has been searched for evidence of such a chamber many times by the most learned witches and wizards it does not exist a tale told to frighten the gullible 
 
 hand was back in the air 
 
 sir what exactly do you mean by the horror chamber 
 
 that is believed to be some sort of monster which the heir of slytherin alone can control said professor binns in his dry reedy voice 
 
 the class exchanged nervous looks 
 
 i tell you the thing does not exist said professor binns shuffling his notes there is no chamber and no monster 
 
 but sir said seamus finnigan if the chamber can only be opened by true heir no one else would be able to find it would they 
 
 nonsense said professor binns in an aggravated tone if a long succession of hogwarts headmasters and headmistresses found the thing 
 
 but professor piped up parvati patil probably have to use dark magic to open it 
 
 just because a wizard use dark magic mean he miss pennyfeather snapped professor binns i repeat if the likes of dumbledore 
 
 but maybe got to be related to slytherin so dumbledore began dean thomas but professor binns had had enough 
 
 that will do he said sharply it is a myth it does not exist there is not a shred of evidence that slytherin ever built so much as a secret broom cupboard i regret telling you such a foolish story we will return if you please to history to solid believable verifiable fact 
 
 and within five minutes the class had sunk back into its usual torpor 
 
 i always knew salazar slytherin was a twisted old loony ron told harry and hermione as they fought their way through the teeming corridors at the end of the lesson to drop off their bags before dinner but i never knew he started all this stuff i be in his house if you paid me honestly if the sorting hat had tried to put me in slytherin got the train straight back home 
 
 hermione nodded fervently but harry say anything his stomach had just dropped unpleasantly 
 
 harry had never told ron and hermione that the sorting hat had seriously considered putting him in slytherin he could remember as though it were yesterday the small voice that had spoken in his ear when placed the hat on his head a year before you could be great you know all here in your head and slytherin would help you on the way to greatness no doubt about that 
 
 but harry who had already heard of slytherin reputation for turning out dark wizards had thought desperately not slytherin and the hat had said oh well if sure better be gryffindor 
 
 as they were shunted along in the throng colin creevy went past 
 
 hiya harry 
 
 hullo colin said harry automatically 
 
 harry harry a boy in my class has been saying 
 
 but colin was so small he fight against the tide of people bearing him toward the great hall they heard him squeak see you harry and he was gone 
 
 a boy in his class saying about you hermione wondered 
 
 that heir i expect said harry his stomach dropping another inch or so as he suddenly remembered the way justin had run away from him at lunchtime 
 
 people believe anything said ron in disgust 
 
 the crowd thinned and they were able to climb the next staircase without difficulty 
 
 really think a chamber of secrets ron asked hermione 
 
 i know she said frowning dumbledore cure mrs norris and that makes me think that whatever attacked her might not be well human 
 
 as she spoke they turned a corner and found themselves at the end of the very corridor where the attack had happened they stopped and looked the scene was just as it had been that night except that there was no stiff cat hanging from the torch bracket and an empty chair stood against the wall bearing the message the chamber of secrets has been opened 
 
 where filch has been keeping guard ron muttered 
 
 they looked at each other the corridor was deserted 
 
 hurt to have a poke around said harry dropping his bag and getting to his hands and knees so that he could crawl along searching for clues 
 
 scorch marks he said here and here 
 
 come and look at this said hermione this is funny 
 
 har ry got up and crossed to the window next to the message on the wall hermione was pointing at the topmost pane where around twenty spiders were scuttling apparently fighting to get through a small crack a long silvery thread was dangling like a rope as though they had all climbed it in their hurry to get outside 
 
 have you ever seen spiders act like that said hermione wonderingly 
 
 no said harry have you ron ron 
 
 he looked over his shoulder ron was standing well back and seemed to be fighting the impulse to run 
 
 up said harry 
 
 i like spiders said ron tensely 
 
 i never knew that said hermione looking at ron in surprise used spiders in potions loads of times 
 
 i mind them dead said ron who was carefully looking anywhere but at the window i just like the way they move 
 
 hermione giggled 
 
 not funny said ron fiercely if you must know when i was three fred turned my my teddy bear into a great big filthy spider because i broke his toy broomstick you like them either if been holding your bear and suddenly it had too many legs and 
 
 he broke off shuddering hermione was obviously still trying not to laugh feeling they had better get off the subject harry said remember all that water on the floor where did that come from mopped it up 
 
 it was about here said ron recovering himself to walk a few paces past chair and pointing level with this door 
 
 he reached for the brass doorknob but suddenly withdrew his hand as though been burned 
 
 the matter said harry 
 
 go in there said ron gruffly a 
 
 oh ron there be anyone in there said hermione standing up and coming over moaning place come on have a look 
 
 and ignoring the large out of order sign she opened the door 
 
 it was the gloomiest most depressing bathroom harry had ever set foot in under a large cracked and spotted mirror were a row of chipped sinks the floor was damp and reflected the dull light given off by the stubs of a few candles burning low in their holders the wooden doors to the stalls were flaking and scratched and one of them was dangling off its hinges 
 
 hermione put her fingers to her lips and set off toward the end stall when she reached it she said hello myrtle how are you 
 
 harry and ron went to look moaning myrtle was floating above the tank of the toilet picking a spot on her chin 
 
 this is a girls 
 
 bathroom she said eyeing ron and harry suspiciously not girls 
 
 no hermione agreed i just wanted to show them how er nice it is in here 
 
 she waved vaguely at the dirty old mirror and the damp floor 
 
 ask her if she saw anything harry mouthed at hermione 
 
 what are you whispering said myrtle staring at him 
 
 nothing said harry quickly we wanted to ask 
 
 i wish people would stop talking behind my back said myrtle in a voice choked with tears i do have feelings you know even if i am dead 
 
 myrtle no one wants to upset you said hermione harry only 
 
 no one wants to upset me a good one howled myrtle my life was nothing but misery at this place and now people come along ruining my death 
 
 we wanted to ask you if seen anything funny lately said hermione quickly because a cat was attacked right outside your front door on halloween 
 
 did you see anyone near here that night said harry 
 
 i paying attention said myrtle dramatically peeves upset me so much i came in here and tried to kill myself then of course i remembered that that 
 
 already dead said ron helpfully 
 
 myrtle gave a tragic sob rose up in the air turned over and dived headfirst into the toilet splashing water all over them and vanishing from sight although from the direction of her muffled sobs she had come to rest somewhere in the 
 
 harry and ron stood with their mouths open but hermione shrugged wearily and said honestly that was almost cheerful for myrtle come on go 
 
 harry had barely closed the door on gurgling sobs when a loud voice made all three of them jump 
 
 ron 
 
 percy weasley had stopped dead at the head of the stairs prefect badge agleam an expression of complete shock on his face 
 
 a girls 
 
 bathroom he gasped what were you 
 
 just having a look around ron shrugged clues you know 
 
 percy swelled in a manner that reminded harry forcefully of mrs weasley 
 
 get away from there perry said striding toward them and starting to bustle them along flapping his arms you care what this looks like coming back here while at dinner 
 
 why we be here said ron hotly stopping short and glaring at percy listen we never laid a finger on that cat 
 
 what i told ginny said percy fiercely but she still seems to think going to be expelled never seen her so upset crying her eyes out you might think of her all the first years are thoroughly overexcited by this business 
 
 you care about ginny said ron whose ears were now reddening just worried going to mess up your chances of being head boy 
 
 five points from gryffindor percy said tersely fingering his prefect badge and i hope it teaches you a lesson no more detective work or write to mum 
 
 and he strode off the back of his neck as red as ears 
 
 harry ron and hermione chose seats as far as possible from percy in the common room that night ron was still in a very bad temper and kept blotting his charms homework when he reached absently for his wand to remove the smudges it ignited the parchment fuming almost as much as his homework ron slammed the standard book of spells grade shut to surprise hermione followed suit 
 
 who can it be though she said in a quiet voice as though continuing a conversation they had just been having want to frighten all the squibs and out of 
 
 think said ron in mock puzzlement who do we know who thinks are scum 
 
 he looked at hermione hermione looked back unconvinced 
 
 if talking about malfoy 
 
 of course i am said ron you heard him be next mudbloods come on only got to look at his foul rat face to know him 
 
 malfoy the heir of slytherin said hermione skeptically 
 
 look at his family said harry closing his books too the whole lot of them have been in slytherin always boasting about it they could easily be descendants his definitely evil enough 
 
 they had the key to the chamber of secrets for centuries said ron handing it down father to son 
 
 well said hermione cautiously i suppose possible 
 
 but how do we prove it said harry darkly 
 
 there might be a way said hermione slowly dropping her voice still further with a quick glance across the room at percy of course it would be difficult and dangerous very dangerous be breaking about fifty school rules i expect 
 
 if in a month or so you feel like explaining you will let us know you said ron irritably 
 
 all right said hermione coldly what need to do is to get inside the slytherin common room and ask malfoy a few questions without him realizing us 
 
 but impossible harry said as ron laughed 
 
 no not said hermione all need would be some polyjuice potion 
 
 that said ron and harry together 
 
 snape mentioned it in class a few weeks ago 
 
 think got nothing better to do in potions than listen to snape muttered ron 
 
 it transforms you into somebody else think about it we could change into three of the slytherins no one would know it was us malfoy would probably tell us anything probably boasting about it in the slytherin common room right now if only we could hear him 
 
 this polyjuice stuff sounds a bit dodgy to me said ron frowning what if we were stuck looking like three of the slytherins forever 
 
 it wears off after a while said hermione waving her hand impatiently but getting hold of the recipe will be very difficult snape said it was in a book called moste potente potions and bound to be in the restricted section of the library there was only one way to get out a book from the restricted section you needed a signed note of permission from a teacher hard to see why want the book really said ron if we going to try and make one of the potions i think said hermione that if we made it sound as though we were just interested in the theory we might stand a chance 
 
 oh come on no going to fall for that said ron have to be really thick 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the chamber of secrets 
 

lionfish nov chapter nine the writing on the wallcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 going on here going on 
 
 attracted no doubt by shout argus filch came shouldering his way through the crowd then he saw mrs norris and fell back clutching his face in horror 
 
 my cat my cat happened to mrs norris he shrieked 
 
 and his popping eyes fell on harry 
 
 screeched you murdered my cat killed her kill you 
 
 argus 
 
 dumbledore had arrived on the scene followed by a number of other teachers in seconds he had swept past harry ron and hermione and detached mrs norris from the torch bracket 
 
 come with me argus he said to filch you too mr potter mr weasley miss granger 
 
 lockhart stepped forward eagerly 
 
 my office is nearest headmaster just upstairs please feel free 
 
 thank you gilderoy said dumbledore 
 
 the silent crowd parted to let them pass lockhart looking excited and important hurried after dumbledore so did professors mcgonagall and snape 
 
 as they entered darkened office there was a flurry of movement across the walls harry saw several of the lockharts in the pictures dodging out of sight their hair in rollers the real lockhart lit the candles on his desk and stood back dumbledore lay mrs norris on the polished surface and began to examine her harry ron and hermione exchanged tense looks and sank into chairs outside the pool of candlelight watching 
 
 the tip of long crooked nose was barely an inch from mrs fur he was looking at her closely through his spectacles his long fingers gently prodding and poking professor mcgonagall was bent almost as close her eyes narrowed snape loomed behind them half in shadow wearing a most peculiar expression it was as though he was trying hard not to smile and lockhart was hovering around all of them making suggestions 
 
 it was definitely a curse that killed her probably the transmogrifian torture seen it used many times so unlucky i there i know the very countercurse that would have saved her 
 
 comments were punctuated by dry racking sobs he was slumped in a chair by the desk unable to look at mrs norris his face in his hands much as he detested filch harry help feeling a bit sorry for him though not nearly as sorry as he felt for himself if dumbledore believed filch he would be expelled for sure 
 
 dumbledore was now muttering strange words under his breath and tapping mrs norris with his wand but nothing happened she continued to look as though she had been recently stuffed 
 
 i remember something very similar happening in ouagadogou said lockhart a series of attacks the full in my autobiography i was able to provide the townsfolk with various amulets which cleared the matter up at once 
 
 the photographs of lockhart on the walls were all nodding in agreement as he talked one of them had forgotten to remove his hair net 
 
 at last dumbledore straightened up 
 
 not dead argus he said softly 
 
 lockhart stopped abruptly in the middle of counting the number of murders he had prevented 
 
 not dead choked filch looking through his fingers at mrs norris but she all all stiff and frozen 
 
 she has been petrified said dumbledore ah i thought so said lockhart but how i cannot say 
 
 ask him shrieked filch turning his blotched and tearstained face to harry 
 
 no second year could have done this said dumbledore firmly it would take dark magic of the most advanced 
 
 he did it he did it filch spat his pouchy face purpling you saw what he wrote on the wall he found in my office he knows a a face worked horribly he knows a squib he finished 
 
 i never touched mrs norris harry said loudly uncomfortably aware of everyone looking at him including all the lockharts on the walls and i even know what a squib is 
 
 rubbish snarled filch he saw my kwikspell letter 
 
 if i might speak headmaster said snape from the shadows and sense of foreboding increased he was sure nothing snape had to say was going to do him any good 
 
 potter and his friends may have simply been in the wrong place at the wrong time he said a slight sneer curling his mouth as though he doubted it but we do have a set of suspicious circumstances here why was he in the upstairs corridor at all why he at the halloween feast 
 
 harry ron and hermione all launched into an explanation about the deathday party there were hundreds of ghosts tell you we were there 
 
 but why not join the feast afterward said snape his black eyes glittering in the candlelight why go up to that corridor 
 
 ron and hermione looked at harry 
 
 because because harry said his heart thumping very fast something told him it would sound very if he told them he had been led there by a bodiless voice no one but he could hear because we were tired and wanted to go to bed he said 
 
 without any supper said snape a triumphant smile flickering across his gaunt face i think ghosts provided food fit for living people at their parties 
 
 we hungry said ron loudly as his stomach gave a huge rumble 
 
 nasty smile widened 
 
 i suggest headmaster that potter is not being entirely truthful he said it might be a good idea if he were deprived of certain privileges until he is ready to tell us the whole story i personally feel he should be taken off the gryffindor quidditch team until he is ready to be honest 
 
 really severus said professor mcgonagall sharply i see no reason to stop the boy playing quidditch this cat hit over the head with a broomstick there is no evidence at all that potter has done anything wrong 
 
 dumbledore was giving harry a searching look his twinkling gaze made harry feel as though he were being 
 
 innocent until proven guilty severus he said firmly 
 
 snape looked furious 
 
 so did filch 
 
 my cat has been petrified he shrieked his eyes popping i want to see some punishment 
 
 we will be able to cure her argus said dumbledore patiently professer sprout recently managed to procure some mandrakes as soon as they have reached their full size i will have a potion made that will revive mrs norris 
 
 make it lockhart butted in i must have done it a hundred times i could whip up a mandrake restorative draught in my sleep 
 
 excuse me said snape icily but i believe i am the potions master at this school 
 
 there was a very awkward pause 
 
 you may go dumbledore said to harry ron and hermione 
 
 they went as quickly as they could without actually running when they were a floor up from office they turned into an empty classroom and closed the door quietly behind them harry squinted at his faces 
 
 think i should have told them about that voice i heard 
 
 no said ron without hesitation hearing voices no one else can hear a good sign even in the wizarding world 
 
 something in voice made harry ask you do believe me you 
 
 course i do said ron quickly but you must admit weird 
 
 i know weird said harry the whole weird what was that writing on the wall about the chamber has been opened that supposed to mean 
 
 you know it rings a sort of bell said ron slowly i think someone told me a story about a secret chamber at hogwarts once been bill 
 
 and what on a squib said harry 
 
 to his surprise ron stifled a snigger 
 
 well not funny really but as filch he said a squib is someone who was born into a wizarding family but got any magic powers kind of the opposite of wizards but squibs are quite unusual if trying to learn magic from a kwikspell course i reckon he must be a squib it would explain a lot like why he hates students so much ron gave a satisfied smile bitter 
 
 a clock chimed somewhere 
 
 midnight said harry better get to bed before snape comes along and tries to frame us for something else 
 
 for a few days the school could talk of little else but the attack on mrs norris filch kept it fresh in minds by pacing the spot where she had been attacked as though he thought the attacker might come back harry had seen him scrubbing the message on the wall with mrs magical mess remover but to no effect the words still gleamed as brightly as ever on the stone when filch guarding the scene of the crime he was skulking through the corridors lunging out at unsuspecting students and trying to put them in detention for things like breathing looking happy 
 
 ginny weasley seemed very disturbed by mrs fate according to ron she was a great cat lover 
 
 but you really got to know mrs norris ron told her bracingly honestly much better off without her lip trembled stuff like this often happen at hogwarts ron assured her catch the maniac who did it and have him out of here in no time i just hope got time to petrify filch before expelled only joking ron added hastily as ginny blanched 
 
 the attack had also had an effect on hermione it was quite usual for hermione to spend a lot of time reading but she was now doing almost nothing else nor could harry and ron get much response from her when they asked what she was up to and not until the following wednesday did they find out 
 
 harry had been held back in potions where snape had made him stay behind to scrape tubeworms off the desks after a hurried lunch he went upstairs to meet ron in the library and saw justin the hufflepuff boy from herbology coming toward him harry had just opened his mouth to say hello when justin caught sight of him turned abruptly and sped off in the opposite direction 
 
 harry found ron at the back of the library measuring his history of magic homework professor binns had asked for a three foot long composition on the medieval assembly of european wizards 
 
 i believe it still eight inches short said ron furiously letting go of his parchment which sprang back into a roll and done four feet seven inches and her tiny 
 
 where is she asked harry grabbing the tape measure and unrolling his own homework 
 
 somewhere over there said ron pointing along the shelves looking for another book i think trying to read the whole library before christmas 
 
 harry told ron about justin running away from him 
 
 dunno why you care i thought he was a bit of an idiot said ron scribbling away making his writing as large as possible all that junk about lockhart being so great 
 
 hermione emerged from between the bookshelves she looked irritable and at last seemed ready to talk to them 
 
 all the copies of hogwarts a history have been taken out she said sitting down next to harry and ron and a waiting list i wish i left my copy at home but i fit it in my trunk with all the lockhart books 
 
 why do you want it said harry 
 
 the same reason everyone else wants it said hermione to read up on the legend of the chamber of secrets 
 
 that said harry quickly 
 
 just it i remember said hermione biting her lip and i find the story anywhere else 
 
 hermione let me read your composition said ron desperately checking his watch 
 
 no i said hermione suddenly severe had ten days to finish it 
 
 i only need another two inches come on 
 
 the bell rang ron and hermione led the way to history of magic bickering 
 
 history of magic was the dullest subject on their schedule professor binns who taught it was their only ghost teacher and the most exciting thing that ever happened in his classes was his entering the room through the blackboard ancient and shriveled many people said he noticed he was dead he had simply got up to teach one day and left his body behind him in an armchair in front of the staff room fire his routine had not varied in the slightest since 
 
 today was as boring as ever professor binns opened his notes and began to read in a flat drone like an old vacuum cleaner until nearly everyone in the class was in a deep stupor occasionally coming to long enough to copy down a name or date then falling asleep again he had been speaking for half an hour when something happened that had never happened before hermione put up her hand 
 
 professor binns glancing up in the middle of a deadly dull lecture on the international warlock convention of looked amazed 
 
 miss er 
 
 granger professor i was wondering if you could tell us anything about the chamber of secrets said hermione in a clear voice 
 
 dean thomas who had been sitting with his mouth hanging open gazing out of the window jerked out of his trance lavender head came up off her arms and neville elbow slipped off his desk 
 
 professor binns blinked 
 
 my subject is history of magic he said in his dry wheezy voice i deal with facts miss granger not myths and legends he cleared his throat with a small noise like chalk slipping and continued in september of that year a subcommittee of sardinian sorcerers 
 
 he stuttered to a halt hand was waving in the air again 
 
 miss grant 
 
 please sir legends always have a basis in fact 
 
 professor binns was looking at her in such amazement harry was sure no student had ever interrupted him before alive or dead 
 
 well said professor binns slowly yes one could argue that i suppose he peered at hermione as though he had never seen a student properly before however the legend of which you speak is such a very sensational even ludicrous tale 
 
 but the whole class was now hanging on professor every word he looked dimly at them all every face turned to his harry could tell he was completely thrown by such an unusual show of interest 
 
 oh very well he said slowly let me see the chamber of secrets 
 
 you all know of course that hogwarts was founded over a thousand years ago the precise date is uncertain by the four greatest witches and wizards of the age the four school houses are named after them godric gryffindor helga hufflepuff rowena ravenclaw and salazar slytherin they built this castle together far from prying muggle eyes for it was an age when magic was feared by common people and witches and wizards suffered much persecution 
 
 he paused gazed blearily around the room and continued 
 
 for a few years the founders worked in harmony together seeking out youngsters who showed signs of magic and bringing them to the castle to be educated but then disagreements sprang up between them a rift began to grow between slytherin and the others slytherin wished to be more selective about the students admitted to hogwarts he believed that magical learning should be kept within families he disliked taking students of muggle parentage believing them to be untrustworthy after a while there was a serious argument on the subject between slytherin and gryffindor and slytherin left the school 
 
 professor binns paused again pursing his lips looking like a wrinkled old tortoise 
 
 reliable historical sources tell us this much he said but these honest facts have been obscured by the fanciful legend of the chamber of secrets the story goes that slytherin had built a hidden chamber in the castle of which the other founders knew nothing 
 
 slytherin according to the legend sealed the chamber of secrets so that none would be able to open it until his own true heir arrived at the school the heir alone would be able to unseal the chamber of secrets unleash the horror within and use it to purge the school of all who were unworthy to study magic 
 
 there was silence as he finished telling the story but it the usual sleepy silence that filled professor classes there was unease in the air as everyone continued to watch him hoping for more professor binns looked faintly annoyed 
 
 the whole thing is arrant nonsense of course he said naturally the school has been searched for evidence of such a chamber many times by the most learned witches and wizards it does not exist a tale told to frighten the gullible 
 
 hand was back in the air 
 
 sir what exactly do you mean by the horror chamber 
 
 that is believed to be some sort of monster which the heir of slytherin alone can control said professor binns in his dry reedy voice 
 
 the class exchanged nervous looks 
 
 i tell you the thing does not exist said professor binns shuffling his notes there is no chamber and no monster 
 
 but sir said seamus finnigan if the chamber can only be opened by true heir no one else would be able to find it would they 
 
 nonsense said professor binns in an aggravated tone if a long succession of hogwarts headmasters and headmistresses found the thing 
 
 but professor piped up parvati patil probably have to use dark magic to open it 
 
 just because a wizard use dark magic mean he miss pennyfeather snapped professor binns i repeat if the likes of dumbledore 
 
 but maybe got to be related to slytherin so dumbledore began dean thomas but professor binns had had enough 
 
 that will do he said sharply it is a myth it does not exist there is not a shred of evidence that slytherin ever built so much as a secret broom cupboard i regret telling you such a foolish story we will return if you please to history to solid believable verifiable fact 
 
 and within five minutes the class had sunk back into its usual torpor 
 
 i always knew salazar slytherin was a twisted old loony ron told harry and hermione as they fought their way through the teeming corridors at the end of the lesson to drop off their bags before dinner but i never knew he started all this stuff i be in his house if you paid me honestly if the sorting hat had tried to put me in slytherin got the train straight back home 
 
 hermione nodded fervently but harry say anything his stomach had just dropped unpleasantly 
 
 harry had never told ron and hermione that the sorting hat had seriously considered putting him in slytherin he could remember as though it were yesterday the small voice that had spoken in his ear when placed the hat on his head a year before you could be great you know all here in your head and slytherin would help you on the way to greatness no doubt about that 
 
 but harry who had already heard of slytherin reputation for turning out dark wizards had thought desperately not slytherin and the hat had said oh well if sure better be gryffindor 
 
 as they were shunted along in the throng colin creevy went past 
 
 hiya harry 
 
 hullo colin said harry automatically 
 
 harry harry a boy in my class has been saying 
 
 but colin was so small he fight against the tide of people bearing him toward the great hall they heard him squeak see you harry and he was gone 
 
 a boy in his class saying about you hermione wondered 
 
 that heir i expect said harry his stomach dropping another inch or so as he suddenly remembered the way justin had run away from him at lunchtime 
 
 people believe anything said ron in disgust 
 
 the crowd thinned and they were able to climb the next staircase without difficulty 
 
 really think a chamber of secrets ron asked hermione 
 
 i know she said frowning dumbledore cure mrs norris and that makes me think that whatever attacked her might not be well human 
 
 as she spoke they turned a corner and found themselves at the end of the very corridor where the attack had happened they stopped and looked the scene was just as it had been that night except that there was no stiff cat hanging from the torch bracket and an empty chair stood against the wall bearing the message the chamber of secrets has been opened 
 
 where filch has been keeping guard ron muttered 
 
 they looked at each other the corridor was deserted 
 
 hurt to have a poke around said harry dropping his bag and getting to his hands and knees so that he could crawl along searching for clues 
 
 scorch marks he said here and here 
 
 come and look at this said hermione this is funny 
 
 har ry got up and crossed to the window next to the message on the wall hermione was pointing at the topmost pane where around twenty spiders were scuttling apparently fighting to get through a small crack a long silvery thread was dangling like a rope as though they had all climbed it in their hurry to get outside 
 
 have you ever seen spiders act like that said hermione wonderingly 
 
 no said harry have you ron ron 
 
 he looked over his shoulder ron was standing well back and seemed to be fighting the impulse to run 
 
 up said harry 
 
 i like spiders said ron tensely 
 
 i never knew that said hermione looking at ron in surprise used spiders in potions loads of times 
 
 i mind them dead said ron who was carefully looking anywhere but at the window i just like the way they move 
 
 hermione giggled 
 
 not funny said ron fiercely if you must know when i was three fred turned my my teddy bear into a great big filthy spider because i broke his toy broomstick you like them either if been holding your bear and suddenly it had too many legs and 
 
 he broke off shuddering hermione was obviously still trying not to laugh feeling they had better get off the subject harry said remember all that water on the floor where did that come from mopped it up 
 
 it was about here said ron recovering himself to walk a few paces past chair and pointing level with this door 
 
 he reached for the brass doorknob but suddenly withdrew his hand as though been burned 
 
 the matter said harry 
 
 go in there said ron gruffly a 
 
 oh ron there be anyone in there said hermione standing up and coming over moaning place come on have a look 
 
 and ignoring the large out of order sign she opened the door 
 
 it was the gloomiest most depressing bathroom harry had ever set foot in under a large cracked and spotted mirror were a row of chipped sinks the floor was damp and reflected the dull light given off by the stubs of a few candles burning low in their holders the wooden doors to the stalls were flaking and scratched and one of them was dangling off its hinges 
 
 hermione put her fingers to her lips and set off toward the end stall when she reached it she said hello myrtle how are you 
 
 harry and ron went to look moaning myrtle was floating above the tank of the toilet picking a spot on her chin 
 
 this is a girls 
 
 bathroom she said eyeing ron and harry suspiciously not girls 
 
 no hermione agreed i just wanted to show them how er nice it is in here 
 
 she waved vaguely at the dirty old mirror and the damp floor 
 
 ask her if she saw anything harry mouthed at hermione 
 
 what are you whispering said myrtle staring at him 
 
 nothing said harry quickly we wanted to ask 
 
 i wish people would stop talking behind my back said myrtle in a voice choked with tears i do have feelings you know even if i am dead 
 
 myrtle no one wants to upset you said hermione harry only 
 
 no one wants to upset me a good one howled myrtle my life was nothing but misery at this place and now people come along ruining my death 
 
 we wanted to ask you if seen anything funny lately said hermione quickly because a cat was attacked right outside your front door on halloween 
 
 did you see anyone near here that night said harry 
 
 i paying attention said myrtle dramatically peeves upset me so much i came in here and tried to kill myself then of course i remembered that that 
 
 already dead said ron helpfully 
 
 myrtle gave a tragic sob rose up in the air turned over and dived headfirst into the toilet splashing water all over them and vanishing from sight although from the direction of her muffled sobs she had come to rest somewhere in the 
 
 harry and ron stood with their mouths open but hermione shrugged wearily and said honestly that was almost cheerful for myrtle come on go 
 
 harry had barely closed the door on gurgling sobs when a loud voice made all three of them jump 
 
 ron 
 
 percy weasley had stopped dead at the head of the stairs prefect badge agleam an expression of complete shock on his face 
 
 a girls 
 
 bathroom he gasped what were you 
 
 just having a look around ron shrugged clues you know 
 
 percy swelled in a manner that reminded harry forcefully of mrs weasley 
 
 get away from there perry said striding toward them and starting to bustle them along flapping his arms you care what this looks like coming back here while at dinner 
 
 why we be here said ron hotly stopping short and glaring at percy listen we never laid a finger on that cat 
 
 what i told ginny said percy fiercely but she still seems to think going to be expelled never seen her so upset crying her eyes out you might think of her all the first years are thoroughly overexcited by this business 
 
 you care about ginny said ron whose ears were now reddening just worried going to mess up your chances of being head boy 
 
 five points from gryffindor percy said tersely fingering his prefect badge and i hope it teaches you a lesson no more detective work or write to mum 
 
 and he strode off the back of his neck as red as ears 
 
 harry ron and hermione chose seats as far as possible from percy in the common room that night ron was still in a very bad temper and kept blotting his charms homework when he reached absently for his wand to remove the smudges it ignited the parchment fuming almost as much as his homework ron slammed the standard book of spells grade shut to surprise hermione followed suit 
 
 who can it be though she said in a quiet voice as though continuing a conversation they had just been having want to frighten all the squibs and out of 
 
 think said ron in mock puzzlement who do we know who thinks are scum 
 
 he looked at hermione hermione looked back unconvinced 
 
 if talking about malfoy 
 
 of course i am said ron you heard him be next mudbloods come on only got to look at his foul rat face to know him 
 
 malfoy the heir of slytherin said hermione skeptically 
 
 look at his family said harry closing his books too the whole lot of them have been in slytherin always boasting about it they could easily be descendants his definitely evil enough 
 
 they had the key to the chamber of secrets for centuries said ron handing it down father to son 
 
 well said hermione cautiously i suppose possible 
 
 but how do we prove it said harry darkly 
 
 there might be a way said hermione slowly dropping her voice still further with a quick glance across the room at percy of course it would be difficult and dangerous very dangerous be breaking about fifty school rules i expect 
 
 if in a month or so you feel like explaining you will let us know you said ron irritably 
 
 all right said hermione coldly what need to do is to get inside the slytherin common room and ask malfoy a few questions without him realizing us 
 
 but impossible harry said as ron laughed 
 
 no not said hermione all need would be some polyjuice potion 
 
 that said ron and harry together 
 
 snape mentioned it in class a few weeks ago 
 
 think got nothing better to do in potions than listen to snape muttered ron 
 
 it transforms you into somebody else think about it we could change into three of the slytherins no one would know it was us malfoy would probably tell us anything probably boasting about it in the slytherin common room right now if only we could hear him 
 
 this polyjuice stuff sounds a bit dodgy to me said ron frowning what if we were stuck looking like three of the slytherins forever 
 
 it wears off after a while said hermione waving her hand impatiently but getting hold of the recipe will be very difficult snape said it was in a book called moste potente potions and bound to be in the restricted section of the library there was only one way to get out a book from the restricted section you needed a signed note of permission from a teacher hard to see why want the book really said ron if we going to try and make one of the potions i think said hermione that if we made it sound as though we were just interested in the theory we might stand a chance 
 
 oh come on no going to fall for that said ron have to be really thick 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the chamber of secrets 
 

lionfish nov chapter nine grim defeatcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 professor dumbledore sent all the gryffindors back to the great hall where they were joined ten minutes later by the students from hufflepuff ravenclaw and slytherin who all looked extremely confused 
 
 the teachers and i need to conduct a thorough search of the castle professor dumbledore told them as professors mcgonagall and flitwick closed all doors into the hall afraid that for your own safety you will have to spend the night here i want the prefects to stand guard over the entrances to the hall and i am leaving the head boy and girl in charge any disturbance should be reported to me immediately he added to percy who was looking immensely proud and important send word with one of the ghosts 
 
 professor dumbledore paused about to leave the hall and said oh yes be needing 
 
 one casual wave of his wand and the long tables flew to the edges of the hall and stood themselves against the walls another wave and the floor was covered with hundreds of squashy purple sleeping bags 
 
 sleep well said professor dumbledore closing the door behind him 
 
 the hall immediately began to buzz excitedly the gryffindors were telling the rest of the school what had just happened 
 
 everyone into their sleeping bags shouted percy come on now no more talking lights out in ten minutes 
 
 ron said to harry and hermione they seized three sleeping bags and dragged them into a corner 
 
 do you think still in the castle hermione whispered anxiously 
 
 dumbledore obviously thinks he might be said ron 
 
 very lucky he picked tonight you know said hermione as they climbed fully dressed into their sleeping bags and propped themselves on their elbows to talk the one night we in the tower 
 
 i reckon lost track of time being on the run said ron realize it was halloween otherwise have come bursting in here 
 
 hermione shuddered 
 
 all around them people were asking one another the same question how did he get in 
 
 maybe he knows how to apparate said a ravenclaw a few feet away just appear out of thin air you know 
 
 disguised himself probably said a hufflepuff fifth year 
 
 he flown in suggested dean thomas 
 
 honestly am i the only person ever bothered to read hogwarts a history said hermione crossly to harry and ron 
 
 probably said ron why 
 
 because the protected by more than walls you know said hermione there are all sorts of enchantments on it to stop people entering by stealth you just apparate in here and like to see the disguise that could fool those dementors guarding every single entrance to the grounds have seen him fly in too and filch knows all the secret passages have them covered 
 
 the lights are going out now percy shouted i want everyone in their sleeping bags and no more talking 
 
 the candles all went out at once the only light now came from the silvery ghosts who were drifting about talking seriously to the prefects and the enchanted ceiling which like the sky outside was scattered with stars what with that and the whispering that still filled the hall harry felt as though he were sleeping outdoors in a light wind 
 
 once every hour a teacher would reappear in the hall to check that everything was quiet around three in the morning when many students had finally fallen asleep professor dumbledore came in harry watched him looking around for percy who had been prowling between the sleeping bags telling people off for talking percy was only a short way away from harry ron and hermione who quickly pretended to be asleep as footsteps drew nearer 
 
 any sign of him professor asked percy in a whisper 
 
 no all well here 
 
 everything under control sir 
 
 good no point moving them all now found a temporary guardian for the gryffindor portrait hole be able to move them back in tomorrow 
 
 and the fat lady sir 
 
 hiding in a map of argyllshire on the second floor apparently she refused to let black in without the password so he attacked still very distressed but once calmed down have mr filch restore her 
 
 harry heard the door of the hall creak open again and more footsteps 
 
 headmaster it was snape harry kept quite still listening hard the whole of the third floor has been searched not there and filch has done the dungeons nothing there either 
 
 what about the astronomy tower professor room the owlery 
 
 all searched 
 
 very well severus i really expect black to linger 
 
 have you any theory as to how he got in professor asked snape 
 
 harry raised his head very slightly off his arms to free his other ear 
 
 many severus each of them as unlikely as the next 
 
 harry opened his eyes a fraction and squinted up to where they stood back was to him but he could see face rapt with attention and profile which looked angry 
 
 you remember the conversation we had headmaster just before ah the start of term said snape who was barely opening his lips as though trying to block percy out of the conversation 
 
 i do severus said dumbledore and there was something like warning in his voice 
 
 it seems almost impossible that black could have entered the school without inside help i did express my concerns when you appointed 
 
 i do not believe a single person inside this castle would have helped black enter it said dumbledore and his tone made it so clear that the subject was closed that snape reply i must go down to the dementors said dumbledore i said i would inform them when our search was complete 
 
 they want to help sir said percy 
 
 oh yes said dumbledore coldly but afraid no dementor will cross the threshold of this castle while i am headmaster 
 
 percy looked slightly abashed dumbledore left the hall walking quickly and quietly snape stood for a moment watching the headmaster with an expression of deep resentment on his face then he too left 
 
 harry glanced sideways at ron and hermione both of them had their eyes open too reflecting the starry ceiling 
 
 what was all that about ron mouthed 
 
 
 
 the school talked of nothing but sirius black for the next few days the theories about how he had entered the castle became wilder and wilder hannah abbott from hufflepuff spent much of their next herbology class telling anyone listen that black could turn into a flowering shrub 
 
 the fat ripped canvas had been taken off the wall and replaced with the portrait of sir cadogan and his fat gray pony nobody was very happy about this sir cadogan spent half his time challenging people to duels and the rest thinking up ridiculously complicated passwords which he changed at least twice a day 
 
 a complete lunatic said seamus finnigan angrily to percy we get anyone else 
 
 none of the other pictures wanted the job said percy frightened of what happened to the fat lady sir cadogan was the only one brave enough to volunteer 
 
 sir cadogan however was the least of worries he was now being closely watched teachers found excuses to walk along corridors with him and percy weasley acting harry suspected on his orders was tailing him everywhere like an extremely pompous guard dog to cap it all professor mcgonagall summoned harry into her office with such a somber expression on her face harry thought someone must have died 
 
 no point hiding it from you any longer potter she said in a very serious voice i know this will come as a shock to you but sirius black 
 
 i know after me said harry wearily i heard dad telling his mum mr weasley works for the ministry of magic 
 
 professor mcgonagall seemed very taken aback she stared at harry for a moment or two then said i see well in that case potter understand why i think a good idea for you to be practicing quidditch in the evenings out on the field with only your team members very exposed potter 
 
 got our first match on saturday said harry outraged got to train professor 
 
 professor mcgonagall considered him intently harry knew she was deeply interested in the gryffindor prospects it had been she after all suggested him as seeker in the first place he waited holding his breath 
 
 hmmprofessor mcgonagall stood up and stared out of the window at the quidditch field just visible through the rain wellgoodness knows like to see us win the cup at lastbut all the same be happier if a teacher were present ask madam hooch to oversee your training sessions 
 
 
 
 the weather worsened steadily as the first quidditch match drew nearer undaunted the gryffindor team was training harder than ever under the eye of madam hooch then at their final training session before match oliver wood gave his team some unwelcome news 
 
 not playing slytherin he told them looking very angry just been to see me playing hufflepuff instead 
 
 why chorused the rest of the team 
 
 excuse is that their still injured said wood grinding his teeth furiously but obvious why doing it want to play in this weather think damage their chances 
 
 there had been strong winds and heavy rain all day and as wood spoke they heard a distant rumble of thunder 
 
 nothing wrong with arm said harry furiously faking it 
 
 i know that but we prove it said wood bitterly and been practicing all those moves assuming playing slytherin and instead hufflepuff and their quite different got a new captain and seeker cedric diggory 
 
 angelina alicia and katie suddenly giggled 
 
 what said wood frowning at this lighthearted behavior 
 
 that tall one he said angelina 
 
 strong and silent said katie and they started to giggle again 
 
 only silent because too thick to string two words together said fred impatiently i know why worried oliver hufflepuff is a pushover last time we played them harry caught the snitch in about five minutes remember 
 
 we were playing in completely different conditions wood shouted his eyes bulging slightly put a very strong side together an excellent seeker i was afraid take it like this we relax we must keep our focus slytherin is trying to us we must win 
 
 oliver calm down said fred looking slightly alarmed taking hufflepuff very seriously seriously 
 
 
 
 the day before the match the winds reached howling point and the rain fell harder than ever it was so dark inside the corridors and classrooms that extra torches and lanterns were lit the slytherin team was looking very smug indeed and none more so than malfoy 
 
 ah if only my arm was feeling a bit better he sighed as the gale outside pounded the windows 
 
 harry had no room in his head to worry about anything except the match tomorrow oliver wood kept hurrying up to him between classes and giving him tips the third time this happened wood talked for so long that harry suddenly realized he was ten minutes late for defense against the dark arts and set off at a run with wood shouting after him got a very fast swerve harry so you might want to try looping him 
 
 harry skidded to a halt outside the defense against the dark arts classroom pulled the door open and dashed inside 
 
 sorry late professor lupin i 
 
 but it professor lupin who looked up at him from the desk it was snape 
 
 this lesson began ten minutes ago potter so i think make it ten points from gryffindor sit down 
 
 but harry move 
 
 professor lupin he said 
 
 he says he is feeling too ill to teach today said snape with a twisted smile i believe i told you to sit down 
 
 but harry stayed where he was 
 
 wrong with him 
 
 black eyes glittered 
 
 nothing he said looking as though he wished it were five more points from gryffindor and if i have to ask you to sit down again it will be fifty 
 
 harry walked slowly to his seat and sat down snape looked around at the class 
 
 as i was saying before potter interrupted professor lupin has not left any record of the topics you have covered so far 
 
 please sir done boggarts red caps kappas and grindylows said hermione quickly and just about to start 
 
 be quiet said snape coldly i did not ask for information i was merely commenting on professor lack of organization 
 
 the best defense against the dark arts teacher ever had said dean thomas boldly and there was a murmur of agreement from the rest of the class snape looked more menacing than ever 
 
 you are easily satisfied lupin is hardly overtaxing you i would expect first years to be able to deal with red caps and grindylows today we shall discuss 
 
 harry watched him flick through the textbook to the very back chapter which he must know they covered 
 
 werewolves said snape 
 
 but sir said hermione seemingly unable to restrain herself not supposed to do werewolves yet due to start hinkypunks 
 
 miss granger said snape in a voice of deadly calm i was under the impression that i am teaching this lesson not you and i am telling you all to turn to page he glanced around again all of you now 
 
 with many bitter sidelong looks and some sullen muttering the class opened their books 
 
 which of you can tell me how we distinguish between the werewolf and the true wolf said snape 
 
 everyone sat in motionless silence everyone except hermione whose hand as it so often did had shot straight into the air 
 
 anyone snape said ignoring hermione his twisted smile was back are you telling me that professor lupin even taught you the basic distinction between 
 
 we told you said parvati suddenly we got as far as werewolves yet still on 
 
 silence snarled snape well well well i never thought meet a class who even recognize a werewolf when they saw one i shall make a point of informing professor dumbledore how very behind you all are 
 
 please sir said hermione whose hand was still in the air the werewolf differs from the true wolf in several small ways the snout of the werewolf 
 
 that is the second time you have spoken out of turn miss granger said snape coolly five more points from gryffindor for being an insufferable 
 
 hermione went very red put down her hand and stared at the floor with her eyes full of tears it was a mark of how much the class loathed snape that they were all glaring at him because every one of them had called hermione a at least once and ron who told hermione she was a at least twice a week said loudly you asked us a question and she knows the answer why ask if you want to be told 
 
 the class knew instantly gone too far snape advanced on ron slowly and the room held its breath 
 
 detention weasley snape said silkily his face very close to and if i ever hear you criticize the way i teach a class again you will be very sorry indeed 
 
 no one made a sound throughout the rest of the lesson they sat and made notes on werewolves from the textbook while snape prowled up and down the rows of desks examining the work they had been doing with professor lupin 
 
 very poorly explainedthat is incorrect the kappa is more commonly found in mongoliaprofessor lupin gave this eight out of ten i have given it three 
 
 when the bell rang at last snape held them back 
 
 you will each write an essay to be handed in to me on the ways you recognize and kill werewolves i want two rolls of parchment on the subject and i want them by monday morning it is time somebody took this class in hand weasley stay behind we need to arrange your detention 
 
 harry and hermione left the room with the rest of the class who waited until they were well out of earshot then burst into a furious tirade about snape 
 
 never been like this with any of our other defense against the dark arts teachers even if he did want the job harry said to hermione he got it in for lupin think this is all because of the boggart 
 
 i know said hermione pensively but i really hope professor lupin gets better soon 
 
 ron caught up with them five minutes later in a towering rage 
 
 know what that he called snape something that made hermione say ron is making me do got to scrub out the bedpans in the hospital wing without magic he was breathing deeply his fists clenched why black have hidden in office eh he could have finished him off for us 
 
 
 
 harry woke extremely early the next morning so early that it was still dark for a moment he thought the roaring of the wind had woken him then he felt a cold breeze on the back of his neck and sat bolt upright peeves the poltergeist had been floating next to him blowing hard in his ear 
 
 what did you do that for said harry furiously peeves puffed out his cheeks blew hard and zoomed backward out of the room cackling 
 
 harry fumbled for his alarm clock and looked at it it was half past four cursing peeves he rolled over and tried to get back to sleep but it was very difficult now that he was awake to ignore the sounds of the thunder rumbling overhead the pounding of the wind against the castle walls and the distant creaking of the trees in the forbidden forest in a few hours he would be out on the quidditch field battling through that gale finally he gave up any thought of more sleep got up dressed picked up his nimbus two thousand and walked quietly out of the dormitory 
 
 as harry opened the door something brushed against his leg he bent down just in time to grab crookshanks by the end of his bushy tail and drag him outside 
 
 you know i reckon ron was right about you harry told crookshanks suspiciously there are plenty of mice around this place go and chase them go on he added nudging crookshanks down the spiral staircase with his foot leave scabbers alone 
 
 the noise of the storm was even louder in the common room harry knew better than to think the match would be canceled quidditch matches called off for trifles like thunderstorms nevertheless he was starting to feel very apprehensive wood had pointed out cedric diggory to him in the corridor diggory was a fifth year and a lot bigger than harry seekers were usually light and speedy but weight would be an advantage in this weather because he was less likely to be blown off course 
 
 harry whiled away the hours until dawn in front of the fire getting up every now and then to stop crookshanks from sneaking up the boys staircase again at long last harry thought it must be time for breakfast so he headed through the portrait hole alone 
 
 stand and fight you mangy cur yelled sir cadogan 
 
 oh shut up harry yawned 
 
 he revived a bit over a large bowl of porridge and by the time started on toast the rest of the team had turned up 
 
 going to be a tough one said wood who eating anything 
 
 stop worrying oliver said alicia soothingly we mind a bit of rain 
 
 but it was considerably more than a bit of rain such was the popularity of quidditch that the whole school turned out to watch the match as usual but they ran down the lawns toward the quidditch field heads bowed against the ferocious wind umbrellas being whipped out of their hands as they went just before he entered the locker room harry saw malfoy crabbe and goyle laughing and pointing at him from under an enormous umbrella on their way to the stadium 
 
 the team changed into their scarlet robes and waited for usual pep talk but it come he tried to speak several times made an odd gulping noise then shook his head hopelessly and beckoned them to follow him 
 
 the wind was so strong that they staggered sideways as they walked out onto the field if the crowd was cheering they hear it over the fresh rolls of thunder rain was splattering over glasses how on earth was he going to see the snitch in this 
 
 the hufflepuffs were approaching from the opposite side of the field wearing robes the captains walked up to each other and shook hands diggory smiled at wood but wood now looked as though he had lockjaw and merely nodded harry saw madam mouth form the words mount your brooms he pulled his right foot out of the mud with a squelch and swung it over his nimbus two thousand madam hooch put her whistle to her lips and gave it a blast that sounded shrill and distant they were off 
 
 harry rose fast but his nimbus was swerving slightly with the wind he held it as steady as he could and turned squinting into the rain 
 
 within five minutes harry was soaked to his skin and frozen hardly able to see his teammates let alone the tiny snitch he flew backward and forward across the field past blurred red and yellow shapes with no idea of what was happening in the rest of the game he hear the commentary over the wind the crowd was hidden beneath a sea of cloaks and battered umbrellas twice harry came very close to being unseated by a bludger his vision was so clouded by the rain on his glasses he seen them coming 
 
 he lost track of time it was getting harder and harder to hold his broom straight the sky was getting darker as though night had decided to come early twice harry nearly hit another player without knowing whether it was a teammate or opponent everyone was now so wet and the rain so thick he could hardly tell them apart 
 
 with the first flash of lightning came the sound of madam whistle harry could just see the outline of wood through the thick rain gesturing him to the ground the whole team splashed down into the mud 
 
 i called for wood roared at his team come on under here 
 
 they huddled at the edge of the field under a large umbrella harry took off his glasses and wiped them hurriedly on his robes 
 
 the score 
 
 fifty points up said wood but unless we get the snitch soon be playing into the night 
 
 got no chance with these on harry said exasperatedly waving his glasses 
 
 at that very moment hermione appeared at his shoulder she was holding her cloak over her head and was inexplicably beaming 
 
 had an idea harry give me your glasses quick 
 
 he handed them to her and as the team watched in amazement hermione tapped them with her wand and said impervius 
 
 there she said handing them back to harry repel water 
 
 wood looked as though he could have kissed her 
 
 brilliant he called hoarsely after her as she disappeared into the crowd okay team go for it 
 
 spell had done the trick harry was still numb with cold still wetter than ever been in his life but he could see full of fresh determination he urged his broom through the turbulent air staring in every direction for the snitch avoiding a bludger ducking beneath diggory who was streaking in the opposite direction 
 
 there was another clap of thunder followed immediately by forked lightning this was getting more and more dangerous harry needed to get the snitch quickly 
 
 he turned intending to head back toward the middle of the field but at that moment another flash of lightning illuminated the stands and harry saw something that distracted him completely the silhouette of an enormous shaggy black dog clearly imprinted against the sky motionless in the topmost empty row of seats 
 
 numb hands slipped on the broom handle and his nimbus dropped a few feet shaking his sodden bangs out of his eyes he squinted back into the stands the dog had vanished 
 
 harry came anguished yell from the gryffindor goal posts harry behind you 
 
 harry looked wildly around cedric diggory was pelting up the field and a tiny speck of gold was shimmering in the air between them 
 
 with a jolt of panic harry threw himself flat to the broom handle and zoomed toward the snitch 
 
 come on he growled at his nimbus as the rain whipped his face faster 
 
 but something odd was happening an eerie silence was falling across the stadium the wind though as strong as ever was forgetting to roar it was as though someone had turned off the sound as though harry had gone suddenly deaf what was going on 
 
 and then a horribly familiar wave of cold swept over him inside him just as he became aware of something moving on the field below 
 
 before had time to think harry had taken his eyes off the snitch and looked down 
 
 at least a hundred dementors their hidden faces pointing up at him were standing beneath him it was as though freezing water were rising in his chest cutting at his insides and then he heard it againsomeone was screaming screaming inside his heada woman 
 
 not harry not harry please not harry 
 
 stand aside you silly girlstand aside now 
 
 not harry please no take me kill me instead 
 
 numbing swirling white mist was filling brainwhat was he doing why was he flying he needed to help hershe was going to dieshe was going to be murdered 
 
 he was falling falling through the icy mist 
 
 not harry pleasehave mercyhave mercy 
 
 a shrill voice was laughing the woman was screaming and harry knew no more 
 
 lucky the ground was so soft 
 
 i thought he was dead for sure 
 
 but he even break his glasses 
 
 harry could hear the voices whispering but they made no sense whatsoever he have a clue where he was or how got there or what been doing before he got there all he knew was that every inch of him was aching as though it had been beaten 
 
 that was the scariest thing ever seen in my life 
 
 scariestthe scariest thinghooded black figurescoldscreaming 
 
 eyes snapped open he was lying in the hospital wing the gryffindor quidditch team spattered with mud from head to foot was gathered around his bed ron and hermione were also there looking as though just climbed out of a swimming pool 
 
 harry said fred who looked extremely white underneath the mud you feeling 
 
 it was as though memory was on fast forward the lightningthe grimthe snitchand the dementors 
 
 what happened he said sitting up so suddenly they all gasped 
 
 you fell off said fred been what fifty feet 
 
 we thought died said alicia who was shaking 
 
 hermione made a small squeaky noise her eyes were extremely bloodshot 
 
 but the match said harry what happened are we doing a replay 
 
 no one said anything the horrible truth sank into harry like a stone 
 
 we lose 
 
 diggory got the snitch said george just after you fell he realize what had happened when he looked back and saw you on the ground he tried to call it off wanted a rematch but they won fair and squareeven wood admits it 
 
 where is wood said harry suddenly realizing he there 
 
 still in the showers said fred we think trying to drown himself 
 
 harry put his face to his knees his hands gripping his hair fred grabbed his shoulder and shook it roughly 
 
 harry never missed the snitch before 
 
 there had to be one time you get it said george 
 
 not over yet said fred we lost by a hundred points 
 
 right so if hufflepuff loses to ravenclaw and we beat ravenclaw and slytherin 
 
 have to lose by at least two hundred points said george 
 
 but if they beat ravenclaw 
 
 no way ravenclaw is too good but if slytherin loses against hufflepuff 
 
 it all depends on the points a margin of a hundred either way 
 
 harry lay there not saying a word they had lostfor the first time ever he had lost a quidditch match 
 
 after ten minutes or so madam pomfrey came over to tell the team to leave him in peace 
 
 come and see you later fred told him beat yourself up harry still the best seeker ever had 
 
 the team trooped out trailing mud behind them madam pomfrey shut the door behind them looking disapproving ron and hermione moved nearer to bed 
 
 dumbledore was really angry hermione said in a quaking voice never seen him like that before he ran onto the field as you fell waved his wand and you sort of slowed down before you hit the ground then he whirled his wand at the dementors shot silver stuff at them they left the stadium right awayhe was furious come onto the grounds we heard him 
 
 then he magicked you onto a stretcher said ron and walked up to school with you floating on it everyone thought you were 
 
 his voice faded but harry hardly noticed he was thinking about what the dementors had done to himabout the screaming voice he looked up and saw ron and hermione looking at him so anxiously that he quickly cast around for something to say 
 
 did someone get my nimbus 
 
 ron and hermione looked quickly at each other 
 
 er 
 
 what said harry looking from one to the other 
 
 wellwhen you fell off it got blown away said hermione hesitantly 
 
 and 
 
 and it hit it hit oh harry it hit the whomping willow 
 
 insides lurched the whomping willow was a very violent tree that stood alone in the middle of the grounds 
 
 and he said dreading the answer 
 
 well you know the whomping willow said ron it it like being hit 
 
 professor flitwick brought it back just before you came around said hermione in a very small voice 
 
 slowly she reached down for a bag at her feet turned it upside down and tipped a dozen bits of splintered wood and twig onto the bed the only remains of faithful finally beaten broomstick

lionfish nov chapter nine grim defeatcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 professor dumbledore sent all the gryffindors back to the great hall where they were joined ten minutes later by the students from hufflepuff ravenclaw and slytherin who all looked extremely confused 
 
 the teachers and i need to conduct a thorough search of the castle professor dumbledore told them as professors mcgonagall and flitwick closed all doors into the hall afraid that for your own safety you will have to spend the night here i want the prefects to stand guard over the entrances to the hall and i am leaving the head boy and girl in charge any disturbance should be reported to me immediately he added to percy who was looking immensely proud and important send word with one of the ghosts 
 
 professor dumbledore paused about to leave the hall and said oh yes be needing 
 
 one casual wave of his wand and the long tables flew to the edges of the hall and stood themselves against the walls another wave and the floor was covered with hundreds of squashy purple sleeping bags 
 
 sleep well said professor dumbledore closing the door behind him 
 
 the hall immediately began to buzz excitedly the gryffindors were telling the rest of the school what had just happened 
 
 everyone into their sleeping bags shouted percy come on now no more talking lights out in ten minutes 
 
 ron said to harry and hermione they seized three sleeping bags and dragged them into a corner 
 
 do you think still in the castle hermione whispered anxiously 
 
 dumbledore obviously thinks he might be said ron 
 
 very lucky he picked tonight you know said hermione as they climbed fully dressed into their sleeping bags and propped themselves on their elbows to talk the one night we in the tower 
 
 i reckon lost track of time being on the run said ron realize it was halloween otherwise have come bursting in here 
 
 hermione shuddered 
 
 all around them people were asking one another the same question how did he get in 
 
 maybe he knows how to apparate said a ravenclaw a few feet away just appear out of thin air you know 
 
 disguised himself probably said a hufflepuff fifth year 
 
 he flown in suggested dean thomas 
 
 honestly am i the only person ever bothered to read hogwarts a history said hermione crossly to harry and ron 
 
 probably said ron why 
 
 because the protected by more than walls you know said hermione there are all sorts of enchantments on it to stop people entering by stealth you just apparate in here and like to see the disguise that could fool those dementors guarding every single entrance to the grounds have seen him fly in too and filch knows all the secret passages have them covered 
 
 the lights are going out now percy shouted i want everyone in their sleeping bags and no more talking 
 
 the candles all went out at once the only light now came from the silvery ghosts who were drifting about talking seriously to the prefects and the enchanted ceiling which like the sky outside was scattered with stars what with that and the whispering that still filled the hall harry felt as though he were sleeping outdoors in a light wind 
 
 once every hour a teacher would reappear in the hall to check that everything was quiet around three in the morning when many students had finally fallen asleep professor dumbledore came in harry watched him looking around for percy who had been prowling between the sleeping bags telling people off for talking percy was only a short way away from harry ron and hermione who quickly pretended to be asleep as footsteps drew nearer 
 
 any sign of him professor asked percy in a whisper 
 
 no all well here 
 
 everything under control sir 
 
 good no point moving them all now found a temporary guardian for the gryffindor portrait hole be able to move them back in tomorrow 
 
 and the fat lady sir 
 
 hiding in a map of argyllshire on the second floor apparently she refused to let black in without the password so he attacked still very distressed but once calmed down have mr filch restore her 
 
 harry heard the door of the hall creak open again and more footsteps 
 
 headmaster it was snape harry kept quite still listening hard the whole of the third floor has been searched not there and filch has done the dungeons nothing there either 
 
 what about the astronomy tower professor room the owlery 
 
 all searched 
 
 very well severus i really expect black to linger 
 
 have you any theory as to how he got in professor asked snape 
 
 harry raised his head very slightly off his arms to free his other ear 
 
 many severus each of them as unlikely as the next 
 
 harry opened his eyes a fraction and squinted up to where they stood back was to him but he could see face rapt with attention and profile which looked angry 
 
 you remember the conversation we had headmaster just before ah the start of term said snape who was barely opening his lips as though trying to block percy out of the conversation 
 
 i do severus said dumbledore and there was something like warning in his voice 
 
 it seems almost impossible that black could have entered the school without inside help i did express my concerns when you appointed 
 
 i do not believe a single person inside this castle would have helped black enter it said dumbledore and his tone made it so clear that the subject was closed that snape reply i must go down to the dementors said dumbledore i said i would inform them when our search was complete 
 
 they want to help sir said percy 
 
 oh yes said dumbledore coldly but afraid no dementor will cross the threshold of this castle while i am headmaster 
 
 percy looked slightly abashed dumbledore left the hall walking quickly and quietly snape stood for a moment watching the headmaster with an expression of deep resentment on his face then he too left 
 
 harry glanced sideways at ron and hermione both of them had their eyes open too reflecting the starry ceiling 
 
 what was all that about ron mouthed 
 
 
 
 the school talked of nothing but sirius black for the next few days the theories about how he had entered the castle became wilder and wilder hannah abbott from hufflepuff spent much of their next herbology class telling anyone listen that black could turn into a flowering shrub 
 
 the fat ripped canvas had been taken off the wall and replaced with the portrait of sir cadogan and his fat gray pony nobody was very happy about this sir cadogan spent half his time challenging people to duels and the rest thinking up ridiculously complicated passwords which he changed at least twice a day 
 
 a complete lunatic said seamus finnigan angrily to percy we get anyone else 
 
 none of the other pictures wanted the job said percy frightened of what happened to the fat lady sir cadogan was the only one brave enough to volunteer 
 
 sir cadogan however was the least of worries he was now being closely watched teachers found excuses to walk along corridors with him and percy weasley acting harry suspected on his orders was tailing him everywhere like an extremely pompous guard dog to cap it all professor mcgonagall summoned harry into her office with such a somber expression on her face harry thought someone must have died 
 
 no point hiding it from you any longer potter she said in a very serious voice i know this will come as a shock to you but sirius black 
 
 i know after me said harry wearily i heard dad telling his mum mr weasley works for the ministry of magic 
 
 professor mcgonagall seemed very taken aback she stared at harry for a moment or two then said i see well in that case potter understand why i think a good idea for you to be practicing quidditch in the evenings out on the field with only your team members very exposed potter 
 
 got our first match on saturday said harry outraged got to train professor 
 
 professor mcgonagall considered him intently harry knew she was deeply interested in the gryffindor prospects it had been she after all suggested him as seeker in the first place he waited holding his breath 
 
 hmmprofessor mcgonagall stood up and stared out of the window at the quidditch field just visible through the rain wellgoodness knows like to see us win the cup at lastbut all the same be happier if a teacher were present ask madam hooch to oversee your training sessions 
 
 
 
 the weather worsened steadily as the first quidditch match drew nearer undaunted the gryffindor team was training harder than ever under the eye of madam hooch then at their final training session before match oliver wood gave his team some unwelcome news 
 
 not playing slytherin he told them looking very angry just been to see me playing hufflepuff instead 
 
 why chorused the rest of the team 
 
 excuse is that their still injured said wood grinding his teeth furiously but obvious why doing it want to play in this weather think damage their chances 
 
 there had been strong winds and heavy rain all day and as wood spoke they heard a distant rumble of thunder 
 
 nothing wrong with arm said harry furiously faking it 
 
 i know that but we prove it said wood bitterly and been practicing all those moves assuming playing slytherin and instead hufflepuff and their quite different got a new captain and seeker cedric diggory 
 
 angelina alicia and katie suddenly giggled 
 
 what said wood frowning at this lighthearted behavior 
 
 that tall one he said angelina 
 
 strong and silent said katie and they started to giggle again 
 
 only silent because too thick to string two words together said fred impatiently i know why worried oliver hufflepuff is a pushover last time we played them harry caught the snitch in about five minutes remember 
 
 we were playing in completely different conditions wood shouted his eyes bulging slightly put a very strong side together an excellent seeker i was afraid take it like this we relax we must keep our focus slytherin is trying to us we must win 
 
 oliver calm down said fred looking slightly alarmed taking hufflepuff very seriously seriously 
 
 
 
 the day before the match the winds reached howling point and the rain fell harder than ever it was so dark inside the corridors and classrooms that extra torches and lanterns were lit the slytherin team was looking very smug indeed and none more so than malfoy 
 
 ah if only my arm was feeling a bit better he sighed as the gale outside pounded the windows 
 
 harry had no room in his head to worry about anything except the match tomorrow oliver wood kept hurrying up to him between classes and giving him tips the third time this happened wood talked for so long that harry suddenly realized he was ten minutes late for defense against the dark arts and set off at a run with wood shouting after him got a very fast swerve harry so you might want to try looping him 
 
 harry skidded to a halt outside the defense against the dark arts classroom pulled the door open and dashed inside 
 
 sorry late professor lupin i 
 
 but it professor lupin who looked up at him from the desk it was snape 
 
 this lesson began ten minutes ago potter so i think make it ten points from gryffindor sit down 
 
 but harry move 
 
 professor lupin he said 
 
 he says he is feeling too ill to teach today said snape with a twisted smile i believe i told you to sit down 
 
 but harry stayed where he was 
 
 wrong with him 
 
 black eyes glittered 
 
 nothing he said looking as though he wished it were five more points from gryffindor and if i have to ask you to sit down again it will be fifty 
 
 harry walked slowly to his seat and sat down snape looked around at the class 
 
 as i was saying before potter interrupted professor lupin has not left any record of the topics you have covered so far 
 
 please sir done boggarts red caps kappas and grindylows said hermione quickly and just about to start 
 
 be quiet said snape coldly i did not ask for information i was merely commenting on professor lack of organization 
 
 the best defense against the dark arts teacher ever had said dean thomas boldly and there was a murmur of agreement from the rest of the class snape looked more menacing than ever 
 
 you are easily satisfied lupin is hardly overtaxing you i would expect first years to be able to deal with red caps and grindylows today we shall discuss 
 
 harry watched him flick through the textbook to the very back chapter which he must know they covered 
 
 werewolves said snape 
 
 but sir said hermione seemingly unable to restrain herself not supposed to do werewolves yet due to start hinkypunks 
 
 miss granger said snape in a voice of deadly calm i was under the impression that i am teaching this lesson not you and i am telling you all to turn to page he glanced around again all of you now 
 
 with many bitter sidelong looks and some sullen muttering the class opened their books 
 
 which of you can tell me how we distinguish between the werewolf and the true wolf said snape 
 
 everyone sat in motionless silence everyone except hermione whose hand as it so often did had shot straight into the air 
 
 anyone snape said ignoring hermione his twisted smile was back are you telling me that professor lupin even taught you the basic distinction between 
 
 we told you said parvati suddenly we got as far as werewolves yet still on 
 
 silence snarled snape well well well i never thought meet a class who even recognize a werewolf when they saw one i shall make a point of informing professor dumbledore how very behind you all are 
 
 please sir said hermione whose hand was still in the air the werewolf differs from the true wolf in several small ways the snout of the werewolf 
 
 that is the second time you have spoken out of turn miss granger said snape coolly five more points from gryffindor for being an insufferable 
 
 hermione went very red put down her hand and stared at the floor with her eyes full of tears it was a mark of how much the class loathed snape that they were all glaring at him because every one of them had called hermione a at least once and ron who told hermione she was a at least twice a week said loudly you asked us a question and she knows the answer why ask if you want to be told 
 
 the class knew instantly gone too far snape advanced on ron slowly and the room held its breath 
 
 detention weasley snape said silkily his face very close to and if i ever hear you criticize the way i teach a class again you will be very sorry indeed 
 
 no one made a sound throughout the rest of the lesson they sat and made notes on werewolves from the textbook while snape prowled up and down the rows of desks examining the work they had been doing with professor lupin 
 
 very poorly explainedthat is incorrect the kappa is more commonly found in mongoliaprofessor lupin gave this eight out of ten i have given it three 
 
 when the bell rang at last snape held them back 
 
 you will each write an essay to be handed in to me on the ways you recognize and kill werewolves i want two rolls of parchment on the subject and i want them by monday morning it is time somebody took this class in hand weasley stay behind we need to arrange your detention 
 
 harry and hermione left the room with the rest of the class who waited until they were well out of earshot then burst into a furious tirade about snape 
 
 never been like this with any of our other defense against the dark arts teachers even if he did want the job harry said to hermione he got it in for lupin think this is all because of the boggart 
 
 i know said hermione pensively but i really hope professor lupin gets better soon 
 
 ron caught up with them five minutes later in a towering rage 
 
 know what that he called snape something that made hermione say ron is making me do got to scrub out the bedpans in the hospital wing without magic he was breathing deeply his fists clenched why black have hidden in office eh he could have finished him off for us 
 
 
 
 harry woke extremely early the next morning so early that it was still dark for a moment he thought the roaring of the wind had woken him then he felt a cold breeze on the back of his neck and sat bolt upright peeves the poltergeist had been floating next to him blowing hard in his ear 
 
 what did you do that for said harry furiously peeves puffed out his cheeks blew hard and zoomed backward out of the room cackling 
 
 harry fumbled for his alarm clock and looked at it it was half past four cursing peeves he rolled over and tried to get back to sleep but it was very difficult now that he was awake to ignore the sounds of the thunder rumbling overhead the pounding of the wind against the castle walls and the distant creaking of the trees in the forbidden forest in a few hours he would be out on the quidditch field battling through that gale finally he gave up any thought of more sleep got up dressed picked up his nimbus two thousand and walked quietly out of the dormitory 
 
 as harry opened the door something brushed against his leg he bent down just in time to grab crookshanks by the end of his bushy tail and drag him outside 
 
 you know i reckon ron was right about you harry told crookshanks suspiciously there are plenty of mice around this place go and chase them go on he added nudging crookshanks down the spiral staircase with his foot leave scabbers alone 
 
 the noise of the storm was even louder in the common room harry knew better than to think the match would be canceled quidditch matches called off for trifles like thunderstorms nevertheless he was starting to feel very apprehensive wood had pointed out cedric diggory to him in the corridor diggory was a fifth year and a lot bigger than harry seekers were usually light and speedy but weight would be an advantage in this weather because he was less likely to be blown off course 
 
 harry whiled away the hours until dawn in front of the fire getting up every now and then to stop crookshanks from sneaking up the boys staircase again at long last harry thought it must be time for breakfast so he headed through the portrait hole alone 
 
 stand and fight you mangy cur yelled sir cadogan 
 
 oh shut up harry yawned 
 
 he revived a bit over a large bowl of porridge and by the time started on toast the rest of the team had turned up 
 
 going to be a tough one said wood who eating anything 
 
 stop worrying oliver said alicia soothingly we mind a bit of rain 
 
 but it was considerably more than a bit of rain such was the popularity of quidditch that the whole school turned out to watch the match as usual but they ran down the lawns toward the quidditch field heads bowed against the ferocious wind umbrellas being whipped out of their hands as they went just before he entered the locker room harry saw malfoy crabbe and goyle laughing and pointing at him from under an enormous umbrella on their way to the stadium 
 
 the team changed into their scarlet robes and waited for usual pep talk but it come he tried to speak several times made an odd gulping noise then shook his head hopelessly and beckoned them to follow him 
 
 the wind was so strong that they staggered sideways as they walked out onto the field if the crowd was cheering they hear it over the fresh rolls of thunder rain was splattering over glasses how on earth was he going to see the snitch in this 
 
 the hufflepuffs were approaching from the opposite side of the field wearing robes the captains walked up to each other and shook hands diggory smiled at wood but wood now looked as though he had lockjaw and merely nodded harry saw madam mouth form the words mount your brooms he pulled his right foot out of the mud with a squelch and swung it over his nimbus two thousand madam hooch put her whistle to her lips and gave it a blast that sounded shrill and distant they were off 
 
 harry rose fast but his nimbus was swerving slightly with the wind he held it as steady as he could and turned squinting into the rain 
 
 within five minutes harry was soaked to his skin and frozen hardly able to see his teammates let alone the tiny snitch he flew backward and forward across the field past blurred red and yellow shapes with no idea of what was happening in the rest of the game he hear the commentary over the wind the crowd was hidden beneath a sea of cloaks and battered umbrellas twice harry came very close to being unseated by a bludger his vision was so clouded by the rain on his glasses he seen them coming 
 
 he lost track of time it was getting harder and harder to hold his broom straight the sky was getting darker as though night had decided to come early twice harry nearly hit another player without knowing whether it was a teammate or opponent everyone was now so wet and the rain so thick he could hardly tell them apart 
 
 with the first flash of lightning came the sound of madam whistle harry could just see the outline of wood through the thick rain gesturing him to the ground the whole team splashed down into the mud 
 
 i called for wood roared at his team come on under here 
 
 they huddled at the edge of the field under a large umbrella harry took off his glasses and wiped them hurriedly on his robes 
 
 the score 
 
 fifty points up said wood but unless we get the snitch soon be playing into the night 
 
 got no chance with these on harry said exasperatedly waving his glasses 
 
 at that very moment hermione appeared at his shoulder she was holding her cloak over her head and was inexplicably beaming 
 
 had an idea harry give me your glasses quick 
 
 he handed them to her and as the team watched in amazement hermione tapped them with her wand and said impervius 
 
 there she said handing them back to harry repel water 
 
 wood looked as though he could have kissed her 
 
 brilliant he called hoarsely after her as she disappeared into the crowd okay team go for it 
 
 spell had done the trick harry was still numb with cold still wetter than ever been in his life but he could see full of fresh determination he urged his broom through the turbulent air staring in every direction for the snitch avoiding a bludger ducking beneath diggory who was streaking in the opposite direction 
 
 there was another clap of thunder followed immediately by forked lightning this was getting more and more dangerous harry needed to get the snitch quickly 
 
 he turned intending to head back toward the middle of the field but at that moment another flash of lightning illuminated the stands and harry saw something that distracted him completely the silhouette of an enormous shaggy black dog clearly imprinted against the sky motionless in the topmost empty row of seats 
 
 numb hands slipped on the broom handle and his nimbus dropped a few feet shaking his sodden bangs out of his eyes he squinted back into the stands the dog had vanished 
 
 harry came anguished yell from the gryffindor goal posts harry behind you 
 
 harry looked wildly around cedric diggory was pelting up the field and a tiny speck of gold was shimmering in the air between them 
 
 with a jolt of panic harry threw himself flat to the broom handle and zoomed toward the snitch 
 
 come on he growled at his nimbus as the rain whipped his face faster 
 
 but something odd was happening an eerie silence was falling across the stadium the wind though as strong as ever was forgetting to roar it was as though someone had turned off the sound as though harry had gone suddenly deaf what was going on 
 
 and then a horribly familiar wave of cold swept over him inside him just as he became aware of something moving on the field below 
 
 before had time to think harry had taken his eyes off the snitch and looked down 
 
 at least a hundred dementors their hidden faces pointing up at him were standing beneath him it was as though freezing water were rising in his chest cutting at his insides and then he heard it againsomeone was screaming screaming inside his heada woman 
 
 not harry not harry please not harry 
 
 stand aside you silly girlstand aside now 
 
 not harry please no take me kill me instead 
 
 numbing swirling white mist was filling brainwhat was he doing why was he flying he needed to help hershe was going to dieshe was going to be murdered 
 
 he was falling falling through the icy mist 
 
 not harry pleasehave mercyhave mercy 
 
 a shrill voice was laughing the woman was screaming and harry knew no more 
 
 lucky the ground was so soft 
 
 i thought he was dead for sure 
 
 but he even break his glasses 
 
 harry could hear the voices whispering but they made no sense whatsoever he have a clue where he was or how got there or what been doing before he got there all he knew was that every inch of him was aching as though it had been beaten 
 
 that was the scariest thing ever seen in my life 
 
 scariestthe scariest thinghooded black figurescoldscreaming 
 
 eyes snapped open he was lying in the hospital wing the gryffindor quidditch team spattered with mud from head to foot was gathered around his bed ron and hermione were also there looking as though just climbed out of a swimming pool 
 
 harry said fred who looked extremely white underneath the mud you feeling 
 
 it was as though memory was on fast forward the lightningthe grimthe snitchand the dementors 
 
 what happened he said sitting up so suddenly they all gasped 
 
 you fell off said fred been what fifty feet 
 
 we thought died said alicia who was shaking 
 
 hermione made a small squeaky noise her eyes were extremely bloodshot 
 
 but the match said harry what happened are we doing a replay 
 
 no one said anything the horrible truth sank into harry like a stone 
 
 we lose 
 
 diggory got the snitch said george just after you fell he realize what had happened when he looked back and saw you on the ground he tried to call it off wanted a rematch but they won fair and squareeven wood admits it 
 
 where is wood said harry suddenly realizing he there 
 
 still in the showers said fred we think trying to drown himself 
 
 harry put his face to his knees his hands gripping his hair fred grabbed his shoulder and shook it roughly 
 
 harry never missed the snitch before 
 
 there had to be one time you get it said george 
 
 not over yet said fred we lost by a hundred points 
 
 right so if hufflepuff loses to ravenclaw and we beat ravenclaw and slytherin 
 
 have to lose by at least two hundred points said george 
 
 but if they beat ravenclaw 
 
 no way ravenclaw is too good but if slytherin loses against hufflepuff 
 
 it all depends on the points a margin of a hundred either way 
 
 harry lay there not saying a word they had lostfor the first time ever he had lost a quidditch match 
 
 after ten minutes or so madam pomfrey came over to tell the team to leave him in peace 
 
 come and see you later fred told him beat yourself up harry still the best seeker ever had 
 
 the team trooped out trailing mud behind them madam pomfrey shut the door behind them looking disapproving ron and hermione moved nearer to bed 
 
 dumbledore was really angry hermione said in a quaking voice never seen him like that before he ran onto the field as you fell waved his wand and you sort of slowed down before you hit the ground then he whirled his wand at the dementors shot silver stuff at them they left the stadium right awayhe was furious come onto the grounds we heard him 
 
 then he magicked you onto a stretcher said ron and walked up to school with you floating on it everyone thought you were 
 
 his voice faded but harry hardly noticed he was thinking about what the dementors had done to himabout the screaming voice he looked up and saw ron and hermione looking at him so anxiously that he quickly cast around for something to say 
 
 did someone get my nimbus 
 
 ron and hermione looked quickly at each other 
 
 er 
 
 what said harry looking from one to the other 
 
 wellwhen you fell off it got blown away said hermione hesitantly 
 
 and 
 
 and it hit it hit oh harry it hit the whomping willow 
 
 insides lurched the whomping willow was a very violent tree that stood alone in the middle of the grounds 
 
 and he said dreading the answer 
 
 well you know the whomping willow said ron it it like being hit 
 
 professor flitwick brought it back just before you came around said hermione in a very small voice 
 
 slowly she reached down for a bag at her feet turned it upside down and tipped a dozen bits of splintered wood and twig onto the bed the only remains of faithful finally beaten broomstick

lionfish nov chapter nine the dark markcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 tell your mother been gambling mr weasley implored fred and george as they all made their way slowly down the stairs 
 
 worry dad said fred gleefully got big plans for this money we want it confiscated 
 
 mr weasley looked for a moment as though he was going to ask what these big plans were but seemed to decide upon reflection that he want to know 
 
 they were soon caught up in the crowds now flooding out of the stadium and back to their campsites raucous singing was borne toward them on the night air as they retraced their steps along the path and leprechauns kept shooting over their heads cackling and waving their lanterns when they finally reached the tents nobody felt like sleeping at all and given the level of noise around them mr weasley agreed that they could all have one last cup of cocoa together before turning in they were soon arguing enjoyably about the match mr weasley got drawn into a disagreement about cobbing with charlie and it was only when ginny fell asleep right at the tiny table and spilled hot chocolate all over the floor that mr weasley called a halt to the verbal replays and insisted that everyone go to bed hermione and ginny went into the next tent and harry and the rest of the weasleys changed into pajamas and clambered into their bunks from the other side of the campsite they could still hear much singing and the odd echoing bang 
 
 oh i am glad not on duty muttered mr weasley sleepily i fancy having to go and tell the irish got to stop celebrating 
 
 harry who was on a top bunk above ron lay staring up at the canvas ceiling of the tent watching the glow of an occasional leprechaun lantern flying overhead and picturing again some of more spectacular moves he was itching to get back on his own firebolt and try out the wronski oliver wood had never managed to convey with all his wriggling diagrams what that move was supposed to look saw himself in robes that had his name on the back and imagined the sensation of hearing a crowd roar as ludo voice echoed throughout the stadium i give 
 
 harry never knew whether or not he had actually dropped off to sleep his fantasies of flying like krum might well have slipped into actual dreams all he knew was that quite suddenly mr weasley was shouting 
 
 get up ron harry come on now get up this is urgent 
 
 harry sat up quickly and the top of his head hit canvas 
 
 s matter he said 
 
 dimly he could tell that something was wrong the noises in the campsite had changed the singing had stopped he could hear screams and the sound of people running he slipped down from the bunk and reached for his clothes but mr weasley who had pulled on his jeans over his own pajamas said no time harry just grab a jacket and get outside quickly 
 
 harry did as he was told and hurried out of the tent ron at his heels 
 
 by the light of the few fires that were still burning he could see people running away into the woods fleeing something that was moving across the field toward them something that was emitting odd flashes of light and noises like gunfire loud jeering roars of laughter and drunken yells were drifting toward them then came a burst of strong green light which illuminated the scene 
 
 a crowd of wizards tightly packed and moving together with wands pointing straight upward was marching slowly across the field harry squinted at seem to have he realized that their heads were hooded and their faces masked high above them floating along in midair four struggling figures were being contorted into grotesque shapes it was as though the masked wizards on the ground were puppeteers and the people above them were marionettes operated by invisible strings that rose from the wands into the air two of the figures were very small 
 
 more wizards were joining the marching group laughing and pointing up at the floating bodies tents crumpled and fell as the marching crowd swelled once or twice harry saw one of the marchers blast a tent out of his way with his wand several caught fire the screaming grew louder 
 
 the floating people were suddenly illuminated as they passed over a burning tent and harry recognized one of them mr roberts the campsite manager the other three looked as though they might be his wife and children one of the marchers below flipped mrs roberts upside down with his wand her nightdress fell down to reveal voluminous drawers and she struggled to cover herself up as the crowd below her screeched and hooted with glee 
 
 sick ron muttered watching the smallest muggle child who had begun to spin like a top sixty feet above the ground his head flopping limply from side to side that is really sick 
 
 hermione and ginny came hurrying toward them pulling coats over their nightdresses with mr weasley right behind them at the same moment bill charlie and percy emerged from the boys tent fully dressed with their sleeves rolled up and their wands out 
 
 going to help the ministry mr weasley shouted over all the noise rolling up his own sleeves you lot get into the woods and stick together come and fetch you when sorted this out 
 
 bill charlie and percy were already sprinting away toward the oncoming marchers mr weasley tore after them ministry wizards were dashing from every direction toward the source of the trouble the crowd beneath the roberts family was coming ever closer 
 
 said fred grabbing hand and starting to pull her toward the wood harry ron hermione and george followed they all looked back as they reached the trees the crowd beneath the roberts family was larger than ever they could see the ministry wizards trying to get through it to the hooded wizards in the center but they were having great difficulty it looked as though they were scared to perform any spell that might make the roberts family fall 
 
 the colored lanterns that had lit the path to the stadium had been extinguished dark figures were blundering through the trees children were crying anxious shouts and panicked voices were reverberating around them in the cold night air harry felt himself being pushed hither and thither by people whose faces he could not see then he heard ron yell with pain 
 
 what happened said hermione anxiously stopping so abruptly that harry walked into her ron where are you oh this is stupid lumos 
 
 she illuminated her wand and directed its narrow beam across the path ron was lying sprawled on the ground 
 
 tripped over a tree root he said angrily getting to his feet again 
 
 well with feet that size hard not to said a drawling voice from behind them 
 
 harry ron and hermione turned sharply draco malfoy was standing alone nearby leaning against a tree looking utterly relaxed his arms folded he seemed to have been watching the scene at the campsite through a gap in the trees 
 
 ron told malfoy to do something that harry knew he would never have dared say in front of mrs weasley 
 
 language weasley said malfoy his pale eyes glittering you better be hurrying along now you like her spotted would you 
 
 he nodded at hermione and at the same moment a blast like a bomb sounded from the campsite and a flash of green light momentarily lit the trees around them 
 
 that supposed to mean said hermione defiantly 
 
 granger after muggles said malfoy want to be showing off your knickers in midair because if you do hang moving this way and it would give us all a laugh 
 
 a witch harry snarled 
 
 have it your own way potter said malfoy grinning maliciously if you think they spot a mudblood stay where you are 
 
 you watch your mouth shouted ron everybody present knew that mudblood was a very offensive term for a witch or wizard of muggle parentage 
 
 never mind ron said hermione quickly seizing arm to restrain him as he took a step toward malfoy 
 
 there came a bang from the other side of the trees that was louder than anything they had heard several people nearby screamed malfoy chuckled softly 
 
 scare easily they he said lazily i suppose your daddy told you all to hide he up to trying to rescue the muggles 
 
 your parents said harry his temper rising out there wearing masks are they 
 
 malfoy turned his face to harry still smiling 
 
 wellif they were i be likely to tell you would i potter 
 
 oh come on said hermione with a disgusted look at malfoy go and find the others 
 
 keep that big bushy head down granger sneered malfoy 
 
 come on hermione repeated and she pulled harry and ron up the path again 
 
 bet you anything his dad is one of that masked lot said ron hotly 
 
 well with any luck the ministry will catch him said hermione fervently oh i believe this where have the others got to 
 
 fred george and ginny were nowhere to be seen though the path was packed with plenty of other people all looking nervously over their shoulders toward the commotion back at the campsite a huddle of teenagers in pajamas was arguing vociferously a little way along the path when they saw harry ron and hermione a girl with thick curly hair turned and said quickly o est madame maxime nous perdue 
 
 er what said ron 
 
 oh the girl who had spoken turned her back on him and as they walked on they distinctly heard her say ogwarts 
 
 beauxbatons muttered hermione 
 
 sorry said harry 
 
 they must go to beauxbatons said hermione you knowbeauxbatons academy of read about it in an appraisal of magical education in europe 
 
 ohyeahright said harry 
 
 fred and george have gone that far said ron pulling out his wand lighting it like and squinting up the path harry dug in the pockets of his jacket for his own wand but it there the only thing he could find was his omnioculars 
 
 ah no i believe lost my wand 
 
 kidding 
 
 ron and hermione raised their wands high enough to spread the narrow beams of light farther on the ground harry looked all around him but his wand was nowhere to be seen 
 
 maybe back in the tent said ron 
 
 maybe it fell out of your pocket when we were running hermione suggested anxiously 
 
 yeah said harry maybe 
 
 he usually kept his wand with him at all times in the wizarding world and finding himself without it in the midst of a scene like this made him feel very vulnerable 
 
 a rustling noise nearby made all three of them jump winky the was fighting her way out of a clump of bushes nearby she was moving in a most peculiar fashion apparently with great difficulty it was as though someone invisible were trying to hold her back 
 
 there is bad wizards about she squeaked distractedly as she leaned forward and labored to keep running people high high in the air winky is getting out of the way 
 
 and she disappeared into the trees on the other side of the path panting and squeaking as she fought the force that was restraining her 
 
 up with her said ron looking curiously after winky why she run properly 
 
 bet she ask permission to hide said harry he was thinking of dobby every time he had tried to do something the malfoys like the had been forced to start beating himself up 
 
 you know get a very raw deal said hermione indignantly slavery what it is that mr crouch made her go up to the top of the stadium and she was terrified and got her bewitched so she even run when they start trampling tents why anyone do something about it 
 
 well the elves are happy they ron said you heard old winky back at the is not supposed to have what she likes being bossed around 
 
 people like you ron hermione began hotly who prop up rotten and unjust systems just because too lazy to 
 
 another loud bang echoed from the edge of the wood 
 
 just keep moving shall we said ron and harry saw him glance edgily at hermione perhaps there was truth in what malfoy had said perhaps hermione was in more danger than they were they set off again harry still searching his pockets even though he knew his wand there 
 
 they followed the dark path deeper into the wood still keeping an eye out for fred george and ginny they passed a group of goblins who were cackling over a sack of gold that they had undoubtedly won betting on the match and who seemed quite unperturbed by the trouble at the campsite farther still along the path they walked into a patch of silvery light and when they looked through the trees they saw three tall and beautiful veela standing in a clearing surrounded by a gaggle of young wizards all of whom were talking very loudly 
 
 i pull down about a hundred sacks of galleons a year one of them shouted a dragon killer for the committee for the disposal of dangerous creatures 
 
 no not yelled his friend a dishwasher at the leaky cauldronbut a vampire hunter killed about ninety so far 
 
 a third young wizard whose pimples were visible even by the dim silvery light of the veela now cut in about to become the youngest ever minister of magic i am 
 
 harry snorted with laughter he recognized the pimply wizard his name was stan shunpike and he was in fact a conductor on the knight bus he turned to tell ron this but face had gone oddly slack and next second ron was yelling did i tell you invented a broomstick reach jupiter 
 
 honestly said hermione and she and harry grabbed ron firmly by the arms wheeled him around and marched him away by the time the sounds of the veela and their admirers had faded completely they were in the very heart of the wood they seemed to be alone now everything was much quieter 
 
 harry looked around i reckon we can just wait here you know hear anyone coming a mile off 
 
 the words were hardly out of his mouth when ludo bagman emerged from behind a tree right ahead of them 
 
 even by the feeble light of the two wands harry could see that a great change had come over bagman he no longer looked buoyant and there was no more spring in his step he looked very white and strained 
 
 that he said blinking down at them trying to make out their faces what are you doing in here all alone 
 
 they looked at one another surprised 
 
 well a sort of riot going on said ron 
 
 bagman stared at him 
 
 what 
 
 at the campsitesome people have got hold of a family of muggles 
 
 bagman swore loudly 
 
 damn them he said looking quite distracted and without another word he disapparated with a small pop 
 
 not exactly on top of things mr bagman is he said hermione frowning 
 
 he was a great beater though said ron leading the way off the path into a small clearing and sitting down on a patch of dry grass at the foot of a tree the wimbourne wasps won the league three times in a row while he was with them 
 
 he took his small figure of krum out of his pocket set it down on the ground and watched it walk around like the real krum the model was slightly and much less impressive on his splayed feet than on his broomstick harry was listening for noise from the campsite everything seemed much quieter perhaps the riot was over 
 
 i hope the others are okay said hermione after a while 
 
 be fine said ron 
 
 imagine if your dad catches lucius malfoy said harry sitting down next to ron and watching the small figure of krum slouching over the fallen leaves always said like to get something on him 
 
 wipe the smirk off old face all right said ron 
 
 those poor muggles though said hermione nervously what if they get them down 
 
 they will said ron reassuringly find a way 
 
 mad though to do something like that when the whole ministry of out here tonight said hermione i mean how do they expect to get away with it do you think been drinking or are they just 
 
 but she broke off abruptly and looked over her shoulder harry and ron looked quickly around too it sounded as though someone was staggering toward their clearing they waited listening to the sounds of the uneven steps behind the dark trees but the footsteps came to a sudden halt 
 
 hello called harry 
 
 there was silence harry got to his feet and peered around the tree it was too dark to see very far but he could sense somebody standing just beyond the range of his vision 
 
 there he said 
 
 and then without warning the silence was rent by a voice unlike any they had heard in the wood and it uttered not a panicked shout but what sounded like a spell 
 
 morsmordre 
 
 and something vast green and glittering erupted from the patch of darkness eyes had been struggling to penetrate it flew up over the treetops and into the sky 
 
 what the gasped ron as he sprang to his feet again staring up at the thing that had appeared 
 
 for a split second harry thought it was another leprechaun formation then he realized that it was a colossal skull comprised of what looked like emerald stars with a serpent protruding from its mouth like a tongue as they watched it rose higher and higher blazing in a haze of greenish smoke etched against the black sky like a new constellation 
 
 suddenly the wood all around them erupted with screams harry understand why but the only possible cause was the sudden appearance of the skull which had now risen high enough to illuminate the entire wood like some grisly neon sign he scanned the darkness for the person who had conjured the skull but he see anyone 
 
 there he called again 
 
 harry come on move hermione had seized the collar of his jacket and was tugging him backward 
 
 the matter harry said startled to see her face so white and terrified 
 
 the dark mark harry hermione moaned pulling him as hard as she could sign 
 
 
 
 harry come on 
 
 harry turned ron was hurriedly scooping up his miniature krum the three of them started across the clearing but before they had taken a few hurried steps a series of popping noises announced the arrival of twenty wizards appearing from thin air surrounding them 
 
 harry whirled around and in an instant he registered one fact each of these wizards had his wand out and every wand was pointing right at himself ron and hermione 
 
 without pausing to think he yelled duck 
 
 he seized the other two and pulled them down onto the ground 
 
 stupefy roared twenty voices there was a blinding series of flashes and harry felt the hair on his head ripple as though a powerful wind had swept the clearing raising his head a fraction of an inch he saw jets of fiery red light flying over them from the wizards wands crossing one another bouncing off tree trunks rebounding into the darkness 
 
 stop yelled a voice he recognized stop my son 
 
 hair stopped blowing about he raised his head a little higher the wizard in front of him had lowered his wand he rolled over and saw mr weasley striding toward them looking terrified 
 
 ron harry his voice sounded shaky hermione are you all right 
 
 out of the way arthur said a cold curt voice 
 
 it was mr crouch he and the other ministry wizards were closing in on them harry got to his feet to face them mr face was taut with rage 
 
 which of you did it he snapped his sharp eyes darting between them which of you conjured the dark mark 
 
 we do that said harry gesturing up at the skull 
 
 we do anything said ron who was rubbing his elbow and looking indignantly at his father what did you want to attack us for 
 
 do not lie sir shouted mr crouch his wand was still pointing directly at ron and his eyes were popping he looked slightly mad you have been discovered at the scene of the crime 
 
 barty whispered a witch in a long woolen dressing gown kids barty never have been able to 
 
 where did the mark come from you three said mr weasley quickly 
 
 over there said hermione shakily pointing at the place where they had heard the voice there was someone behind the treesthey shouted words an incantation 
 
 oh stood over there did they said mr crouch turning his popping eyes on hermione now disbelief etched all over his face said an incantation did they you seem very well informed about how that mark is summoned missy 
 
 but none of the ministry wizards apart from mr crouch seemed to think it remotely likely that harry ron or hermione had conjured the skull on the contrary at words they had all raised their wands again and were pointing in the direction she had indicated squinting through the dark trees 
 
 too late said the witch in the woolen dressing gown shaking her head have disapparated 
 
 i think so said a wizard with a scrubby brown beard it was amos diggory father our stunners went right through those a good chance we got them 
 
 amos be careful said a few of the wizards warningly as mr diggory squared his shoulders raised his wand marched across the clearing and disappeared into the darkness hermione watched him vanish with her hands over her mouth 
 
 a few seconds later they heard mr diggory shout 
 
 yes we got them someone here unconscious but blimey 
 
 got someone shouted mr crouch sounding highly disbelieving who who is it 
 
 they heard snapping twigs the rustling of leaves and then crunching footsteps as mr diggory reemerged from behind the trees he was carrying a tiny limp figure in his arms harry recognized the tea towel at once it was winky 
 
 mr crouch did not move or speak as mr diggory deposited his elf on the ground at his feet the other ministry wizards were all staring at mr crouch for a few seconds crouch remained transfixed his eyes blazing in his white face as he stared down at winky then he appeared to come to life again 
 
 this cannot be he said jerkily no 
 
 he moved quickly around mr diggory and strode off toward the place where he had found winky 
 
 no point mr crouch mr diggory called after him no one else there 
 
 but mr crouch did not seem prepared to take his word for it they could hear him moving around and the rustling of leaves as he pushed the bushes aside searching 
 
 bit embarrassing mr diggory said grimly looking down at unconscious form barty mean to say 
 
 come off it amos said mr weasley quietly you seriously think it was the elf the dark a sign it requires a wand 
 
 yeah said mr diggory and she had a wand 
 
 what said mr weasley 
 
 here look mr diggory held up a wand and showed it to mr weasley had it in her hand so clause three of the code of wand use broken for a start no creature is permitted to carry or use a wand 
 
 just then there was another pop and ludo bagman apparated right next to mr weasley looking breathless and disorientated he spun on the spot goggling upward at the skull 
 
 the dark mark he panted almost trampling winky as he turned inquiringly to his colleagues who did it did you get them barry going on 
 
 mr crouch had returned his face was still ghostly white and his hands and his toothbrush mustache were both twitching 
 
 where have you been barty said bagman why you at the match your elf was saving you a seat too gulping gargoyles bagman had just noticed winky lying at his feet what happened to her 
 
 i have been busy ludo said mr crouch still talking in the same jerky fashion barely moving his lips and my elf has been stunned 
 
 stunned by you lot you mean but why 
 
 comprehension dawned suddenly on round shiny face he looked up at the skull down at winky and then at mr crouch 
 
 no he said winky conjure the dark mark she know how need a wand for a start 
 
 and she had one said mr diggory i found her holding one ludo if all right with you mr crouch i think we should hear what got to say for herself 
 
 crouch gave no sign that he had heard mr diggory but mr diggory seemed to take his silence for assent he raised his own wand pointed it at winky and said ennervate 
 
 winky stirred feebly her great brown eyes opened and she blinked several times in a bemused sort of way watched by the silent wizards she raised herself shakily into a sitting position 
 
 she caught sight of mr feet and slowly tremulously raised her eyes to stare up into his face then more slowly still she looked up into the sky harry could see the floating skull reflected twice in her enormous glassy eyes she gave a gasp looked wildly around the crowded clearing and burst into terrified sobs 
 
 elf said mr diggory sternly do you know who i am a member of the department for the regulation and control of magical creatures 
 
 winky began to rock backward and forward on the ground her breath coming in sharp bursts harry was reminded forcibly of dobby in his moments of terrified disobedience 
 
 as you see elf the dark mark was conjured here a short while ago said mr diggory and you were discovered moments later right beneath it an explanation if you please 
 
 i i i is not doing it sir winky gasped i is not knowing how sir 
 
 you were found with a wand in your hand barked mr diggory brandishing it in front of her and as the wand caught the green light that was filling the clearing from the skull above harry recognized it 
 
 hey mine he said 
 
 everyone in the clearing looked at him 
 
 excuse me said mr diggory incredulously 
 
 my wand said harry i dropped it 
 
 you dropped it repeated mr diggory in disbelief is this a confession you threw it aside after you conjured the mark 
 
 amos think who talking to said mr weasley very angrily is harry potter likely to conjure the dark mark 
 
 er of course not mumbled mr diggory sorrycarried away 
 
 i drop it there anyway said harry jerking his thumb toward the trees beneath the skull i missed it right after we got into the wood 
 
 so said mr diggory his eyes hardening as he turned to look at winky again cowering at his feet you found this wand eh elf and you picked it up and thought have some fun with it did you 
 
 i is not doing magic with it sir squealed winky tears streaming down the sides of her squashed and bulbous nose i isi isi is just picking it up sir i is not making the dark mark sir i is not knowing how 
 
 it her said hermione she looked very nervous speaking up in front of all these ministry wizards yet determined all the same got a squeaky little voice and the voice we heard doing the incantation was much deeper she looked around at harry and ron appealing for their support it sound anything like winky did it 
 
 no said harry shaking his head it definitely sound like an elf 
 
 yeah it was a human voice said ron 
 
 well soon see growled mr diggory looking unimpressed a simple way of discovering the last spell a wand performed elf did you know that 
 
 winky trembled and shook her head frantically her ears flapping as mr diggory raised his own wand again and placed it tip to tip with 
 
 prior incantato roared mr diggory 
 
 harry heard hermione gasp horrified as a gigantic skull erupted from the point where the two wands met but it was a mere shadow of the green skull high above them it looked as though it were made of thick gray smoke the ghost of a spell 
 
 deletrius mr diggory shouted and the smoky skull vanished in a wisp of smoke 
 
 so said mr diggory with a kind of savage triumph looking down upon winky who was still shaking convulsively 
 
 i is not doing it she squealed her eyes rolling in terror i is not i is not i is not knowing how i is a good elf i using wands i knowing how 
 
 been caught elf mr diggory roared caught with the guilty wand in your hand 
 
 amos said mr weasley loudly think about itprecious few wizards know how to do that would she have learned it 
 
 perhaps amos is suggesting said mr crouch cold anger in every syllable that i routinely teach my servants to conjure the dark mark 
 
 there was a deeply unpleasant silence amos diggory looked horrified mr crouchnotnot at all 
 
 you have now come very close to accusing the two people in this clearing who are least likely to conjure that mark barked mr crouch harry potter and myself i suppose you are familiar with the story amos 
 
 of course everyone knows muttered mr diggory looking highly discomforted 
 
 and i trust you remember the many proofs i have given over a long career that i despise and detest the dark arts and those who practice them mr crouch shouted his eyes bulging again 
 
 mr crouch i i never suggested you had anything to do with it amos diggory muttered again now reddening behind his scrubby brown beard 
 
 if you accuse my elf you accuse me diggory shouted mr crouch where else would she have learned to conjure it 
 
 she she picked it up anywhere 
 
 precisely amos said mr weasley she might have picked it up he said kindly turning to the elf but she flinched as though he too was shouting at her where exactly did you find wand 
 
 winky was twisting the hem of her tea towel so violently that it was fraying beneath her fingers 
 
 i i is finding itfinding it there sir she whispered therein the trees sir 
 
 you see amos said mr weasley whoever conjured the mark could have disapparated right after done it leaving wand behind a clever thing to do not using their own wand which could have betrayed them and winky here had the misfortune to come across the wand moments later and pick it up 
 
 but then have been only a few feet away from the real culprit said mr diggory impatiently elf did you see anyone 
 
 winky began to tremble worse than ever her giant eyes flickered from mr diggory to ludo bagman and onto mr crouch then she gulped and said i is seeing no one sirno one 
 
 amos said mr crouch curtly i am fully aware that in the ordinary course of events you would want to take winky into your department for questioning i ask you however to allow me to deal with her 
 
 mr diggory looked as though he think much of this suggestion at all but it was clear to harry that mr crouch was such an important member of the ministry that he did not dare refuse him 
 
 you may rest assured that she will be punished mr crouch added coldly 
 
 winky stammered looking up at mr crouch her eyes brimming with tears 
 
 mr crouch stared back his face somehow sharpened each line upon it more deeply etched there was no pity in his gaze 
 
 winky has behaved tonight in a manner i would not have believed possible he said slowly i told her to remain in the tent i told her to stay there while i went to sort out the trouble and i find that she disobeyed me this means clothes 
 
 no shrieked winky prostrating herself at mr feet no master not clothes not clothes 
 
 harry knew that the only way to turn a free was to present it with proper garments it was pitiful to see the way winky clutched at her tea towel as she sobbed over mr feet 
 
 but she was frightened hermione burst out angrily glaring at mr crouch your scared of heights and those wizards in masks were levitating people you blame her for wanting to get out of their way 
 
 mr crouch took a step backward freeing himself from contact with the elf whom he was surveying as though she were something filthy and rotten that was contaminating his shoes 
 
 i have no use for a who disobeys me he said coldly looking over at hermione i have no use for a servant who forgets what is due to her master and to her reputation 
 
 winky was crying so hard that her sobs echoed around the clearing there was a very nasty silence which was ended by mr weasley who said quietly well i think take my lot back to the tent if got any objections amos that told us all it can if harry could have it back please 
 
 mr diggory handed harry his wand and harry pocketed it 
 
 come on you three mr weasley said quietly but hermione seem to want to move her eyes were still upon the sobbing elf hermione mr weasley said more urgently she turned and followed harry and ron out of the clearing and off through the trees 
 
 going to happen to winky said hermione the moment they had left the clearing 
 
 i know said mr weasley 
 
 the way they were treating her said hermione furiously mr diggory calling her elf all the timeand mr crouch he knows she do it and still going to sack her he care how frightened been or how upset she was it was like she even human 
 
 well not said ron 
 
 hermione rounded on him 
 
 that mean she got feelings ron disgusting the way 
 
 hermione i agree with you said mr weasley quickly beckoning her on but now is not the time to discuss elf rights i want to get back to the tent as fast as we can what happened to the others 
 
 we lost them in the dark said ron dad why was everyone so uptight about that skull thing 
 
 explain everything back at the tent said mr weasley tensely 
 
 but when they reached the edge of the wood their progress was impeded a large crowd of witches and wizards was congregated there and when they saw mr weasley coming toward them many of them surged forward 
 
 going on in there 
 
 who conjured it 
 
 arthur not him 
 
 of course not him said mr weasley impatiently we know who it was it looks like they disapparated now excuse me please i want to get to bed 
 
 he led harry ron and hermione through the crowd and back into the campsite all was quiet now there was no sign of the masked wizards though several ruined tents were still smoking 
 
 head was poking out of the boys tent 
 
 dad going on he called through the dark fred george and ginny got back okay but the others 
 
 got them here said mr weasley bending down and entering the tent harry ron and hermione entered after him 
 
 bill was sitting at the small kitchen table holding a bedsheet to his arm which was bleeding profusely charlie had a large rip in his shirt and percy was sporting a bloody nose fred george and ginny looked unhurt though shaken 
 
 did you get them dad said bill sharply the person who conjured the mark 
 
 no said mr weasley we found barry elf holding wand but none the wiser about who actually conured the mark 
 
 what said bill charlie and percy together 
 
 wand said fred 
 
 mr elf said percy sounding thunderstruck 
 
 with some assistance from harry ron and hermione mr weasley explained what had happened in the woods when they had finished their story percy swelled indignantly 
 
 well mr crouch is quite right to get rid of an elf like that he said running away when expressly told her not toembarrassing him in front of the whole ministryhow would that have looked if been brought up in front of the department for the regulation and control 
 
 she do anything she was just in the wrong place at the wrong time hermione snapped at percy who looked very taken aback hermione had always got on fairly well with percy better indeed than any of the others 
 
 hermione a wizard in mr position afford a going to run amok with a wand said percy pompously recovering himself 
 
 she run amok shouted hermione she just picked it up off the ground 
 
 look can someone just explain what that skull thing was said ron impatiently it hurting it such a big deal 
 
 i told you symbol ron said hermione before anyone else could answer i read about it in the rise and fall of the dark arts 
 
 and it been seen for thirteen years said mr weasley quietly of course people panickedit was almost like seeing back again 
 
 i get it said ron frowning i still only a shape in the sky 
 
 ron and his followers sent the dark mark into the air whenever they killed said mr weasley the terror it inspiredyou have no idea too young just picture coming home and finding the dark mark hovering over your house and knowing what about to find inside mr weasley winced worst fearthe very worst 
 
 there was silence for a moment then bill removing the sheet from his arm to check on his cut said well it help us tonight whoever conjured it it scared the death eaters away the moment they saw it they all disapparated before got near enough to unmask any of them we caught the robertses before they hit the ground though having their memories modified right now 
 
 death eaters said harry what are death eaters 
 
 what supporters called themselves said bill i think we saw left of them tonight the ones who managed to keep themselves out of azkaban anyway 
 
 we prove it was them bill said mr weasley though it probably was he added hopelessly 
 
 yeah i bet it was said ron suddenly dad we met draco malfoy in the woods and he as good as told us his dad was one of those nutters in masks and we all know the malfoys were right in with 
 
 but what were supporters harry began everybody flinched like most of the wizarding world the weasleys always avoided saying name sorry said harry quickly what were supporters up to levitating muggles i mean what was the point 
 
 the point said mr weasley with a hollow laugh harry their idea of fun half the muggle killings back when was in power were done for fun i suppose they had a few drinks tonight and resist reminding us all that lots of them are still at large a nice little reunion for them he finished disgustedly 
 
 but if they were the death eaters why did they disapparate when they saw the dark mark said ron have been pleased to see it they 
 
 use your brains ron said bill if they really were death eaters they worked very hard to keep out of azkaban when lost power and told all sorts of lies about him forcing them to kill and torture people i bet be even more frightened than the rest of us to see him come back they denied ever been involved with him when he lost his powers and went back to their daily reckon be with them do you 
 
 sowhoever conjured the dark mark said hermione slowly were they doing it to show support for the death eaters or to scare them away 
 
 your guess is as good as ours hermione said mr weasley but tell you thisit was only the death eaters who ever knew how to conjure it be very surprised if the person who did it been a death eater once even if not very late and if your mother hears happened be worried sick get a few more hours sleep and then try and get an early portkey out of here 
 
 harry got back into his bunk with his head buzzing he knew he ought to feel exhausted it was nearly three in the morning but he felt and worried 
 
 three days ago it felt like much longer but it had only been three days he had awoken with his scar burning and tonight for the first time in thirteen years lord mark had appeared in the sky what did these things mean 
 
 he thought of the letter he had written to sirius before leaving privet drive would sirius have gotten it yet when would he reply harry lay looking up at the canvas but no flying fantasies came to him now to ease him to sleep and it was a long time after snores filled the tent that harry finally dozed off 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the goblet of fire 
 

lionfish nov chapter nine the dark markcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 tell your mother been gambling mr weasley implored fred and george as they all made their way slowly down the stairs 
 
 worry dad said fred gleefully got big plans for this money we want it confiscated 
 
 mr weasley looked for a moment as though he was going to ask what these big plans were but seemed to decide upon reflection that he want to know 
 
 they were soon caught up in the crowds now flooding out of the stadium and back to their campsites raucous singing was borne toward them on the night air as they retraced their steps along the path and leprechauns kept shooting over their heads cackling and waving their lanterns when they finally reached the tents nobody felt like sleeping at all and given the level of noise around them mr weasley agreed that they could all have one last cup of cocoa together before turning in they were soon arguing enjoyably about the match mr weasley got drawn into a disagreement about cobbing with charlie and it was only when ginny fell asleep right at the tiny table and spilled hot chocolate all over the floor that mr weasley called a halt to the verbal replays and insisted that everyone go to bed hermione and ginny went into the next tent and harry and the rest of the weasleys changed into pajamas and clambered into their bunks from the other side of the campsite they could still hear much singing and the odd echoing bang 
 
 oh i am glad not on duty muttered mr weasley sleepily i fancy having to go and tell the irish got to stop celebrating 
 
 harry who was on a top bunk above ron lay staring up at the canvas ceiling of the tent watching the glow of an occasional leprechaun lantern flying overhead and picturing again some of more spectacular moves he was itching to get back on his own firebolt and try out the wronski oliver wood had never managed to convey with all his wriggling diagrams what that move was supposed to look saw himself in robes that had his name on the back and imagined the sensation of hearing a crowd roar as ludo voice echoed throughout the stadium i give 
 
 harry never knew whether or not he had actually dropped off to sleep his fantasies of flying like krum might well have slipped into actual dreams all he knew was that quite suddenly mr weasley was shouting 
 
 get up ron harry come on now get up this is urgent 
 
 harry sat up quickly and the top of his head hit canvas 
 
 s matter he said 
 
 dimly he could tell that something was wrong the noises in the campsite had changed the singing had stopped he could hear screams and the sound of people running he slipped down from the bunk and reached for his clothes but mr weasley who had pulled on his jeans over his own pajamas said no time harry just grab a jacket and get outside quickly 
 
 harry did as he was told and hurried out of the tent ron at his heels 
 
 by the light of the few fires that were still burning he could see people running away into the woods fleeing something that was moving across the field toward them something that was emitting odd flashes of light and noises like gunfire loud jeering roars of laughter and drunken yells were drifting toward them then came a burst of strong green light which illuminated the scene 
 
 a crowd of wizards tightly packed and moving together with wands pointing straight upward was marching slowly across the field harry squinted at seem to have he realized that their heads were hooded and their faces masked high above them floating along in midair four struggling figures were being contorted into grotesque shapes it was as though the masked wizards on the ground were puppeteers and the people above them were marionettes operated by invisible strings that rose from the wands into the air two of the figures were very small 
 
 more wizards were joining the marching group laughing and pointing up at the floating bodies tents crumpled and fell as the marching crowd swelled once or twice harry saw one of the marchers blast a tent out of his way with his wand several caught fire the screaming grew louder 
 
 the floating people were suddenly illuminated as they passed over a burning tent and harry recognized one of them mr roberts the campsite manager the other three looked as though they might be his wife and children one of the marchers below flipped mrs roberts upside down with his wand her nightdress fell down to reveal voluminous drawers and she struggled to cover herself up as the crowd below her screeched and hooted with glee 
 
 sick ron muttered watching the smallest muggle child who had begun to spin like a top sixty feet above the ground his head flopping limply from side to side that is really sick 
 
 hermione and ginny came hurrying toward them pulling coats over their nightdresses with mr weasley right behind them at the same moment bill charlie and percy emerged from the boys tent fully dressed with their sleeves rolled up and their wands out 
 
 going to help the ministry mr weasley shouted over all the noise rolling up his own sleeves you lot get into the woods and stick together come and fetch you when sorted this out 
 
 bill charlie and percy were already sprinting away toward the oncoming marchers mr weasley tore after them ministry wizards were dashing from every direction toward the source of the trouble the crowd beneath the roberts family was coming ever closer 
 
 said fred grabbing hand and starting to pull her toward the wood harry ron hermione and george followed they all looked back as they reached the trees the crowd beneath the roberts family was larger than ever they could see the ministry wizards trying to get through it to the hooded wizards in the center but they were having great difficulty it looked as though they were scared to perform any spell that might make the roberts family fall 
 
 the colored lanterns that had lit the path to the stadium had been extinguished dark figures were blundering through the trees children were crying anxious shouts and panicked voices were reverberating around them in the cold night air harry felt himself being pushed hither and thither by people whose faces he could not see then he heard ron yell with pain 
 
 what happened said hermione anxiously stopping so abruptly that harry walked into her ron where are you oh this is stupid lumos 
 
 she illuminated her wand and directed its narrow beam across the path ron was lying sprawled on the ground 
 
 tripped over a tree root he said angrily getting to his feet again 
 
 well with feet that size hard not to said a drawling voice from behind them 
 
 harry ron and hermione turned sharply draco malfoy was standing alone nearby leaning against a tree looking utterly relaxed his arms folded he seemed to have been watching the scene at the campsite through a gap in the trees 
 
 ron told malfoy to do something that harry knew he would never have dared say in front of mrs weasley 
 
 language weasley said malfoy his pale eyes glittering you better be hurrying along now you like her spotted would you 
 
 he nodded at hermione and at the same moment a blast like a bomb sounded from the campsite and a flash of green light momentarily lit the trees around them 
 
 that supposed to mean said hermione defiantly 
 
 granger after muggles said malfoy want to be showing off your knickers in midair because if you do hang moving this way and it would give us all a laugh 
 
 a witch harry snarled 
 
 have it your own way potter said malfoy grinning maliciously if you think they spot a mudblood stay where you are 
 
 you watch your mouth shouted ron everybody present knew that mudblood was a very offensive term for a witch or wizard of muggle parentage 
 
 never mind ron said hermione quickly seizing arm to restrain him as he took a step toward malfoy 
 
 there came a bang from the other side of the trees that was louder than anything they had heard several people nearby screamed malfoy chuckled softly 
 
 scare easily they he said lazily i suppose your daddy told you all to hide he up to trying to rescue the muggles 
 
 your parents said harry his temper rising out there wearing masks are they 
 
 malfoy turned his face to harry still smiling 
 
 wellif they were i be likely to tell you would i potter 
 
 oh come on said hermione with a disgusted look at malfoy go and find the others 
 
 keep that big bushy head down granger sneered malfoy 
 
 come on hermione repeated and she pulled harry and ron up the path again 
 
 bet you anything his dad is one of that masked lot said ron hotly 
 
 well with any luck the ministry will catch him said hermione fervently oh i believe this where have the others got to 
 
 fred george and ginny were nowhere to be seen though the path was packed with plenty of other people all looking nervously over their shoulders toward the commotion back at the campsite a huddle of teenagers in pajamas was arguing vociferously a little way along the path when they saw harry ron and hermione a girl with thick curly hair turned and said quickly o est madame maxime nous perdue 
 
 er what said ron 
 
 oh the girl who had spoken turned her back on him and as they walked on they distinctly heard her say ogwarts 
 
 beauxbatons muttered hermione 
 
 sorry said harry 
 
 they must go to beauxbatons said hermione you knowbeauxbatons academy of read about it in an appraisal of magical education in europe 
 
 ohyeahright said harry 
 
 fred and george have gone that far said ron pulling out his wand lighting it like and squinting up the path harry dug in the pockets of his jacket for his own wand but it there the only thing he could find was his omnioculars 
 
 ah no i believe lost my wand 
 
 kidding 
 
 ron and hermione raised their wands high enough to spread the narrow beams of light farther on the ground harry looked all around him but his wand was nowhere to be seen 
 
 maybe back in the tent said ron 
 
 maybe it fell out of your pocket when we were running hermione suggested anxiously 
 
 yeah said harry maybe 
 
 he usually kept his wand with him at all times in the wizarding world and finding himself without it in the midst of a scene like this made him feel very vulnerable 
 
 a rustling noise nearby made all three of them jump winky the was fighting her way out of a clump of bushes nearby she was moving in a most peculiar fashion apparently with great difficulty it was as though someone invisible were trying to hold her back 
 
 there is bad wizards about she squeaked distractedly as she leaned forward and labored to keep running people high high in the air winky is getting out of the way 
 
 and she disappeared into the trees on the other side of the path panting and squeaking as she fought the force that was restraining her 
 
 up with her said ron looking curiously after winky why she run properly 
 
 bet she ask permission to hide said harry he was thinking of dobby every time he had tried to do something the malfoys like the had been forced to start beating himself up 
 
 you know get a very raw deal said hermione indignantly slavery what it is that mr crouch made her go up to the top of the stadium and she was terrified and got her bewitched so she even run when they start trampling tents why anyone do something about it 
 
 well the elves are happy they ron said you heard old winky back at the is not supposed to have what she likes being bossed around 
 
 people like you ron hermione began hotly who prop up rotten and unjust systems just because too lazy to 
 
 another loud bang echoed from the edge of the wood 
 
 just keep moving shall we said ron and harry saw him glance edgily at hermione perhaps there was truth in what malfoy had said perhaps hermione was in more danger than they were they set off again harry still searching his pockets even though he knew his wand there 
 
 they followed the dark path deeper into the wood still keeping an eye out for fred george and ginny they passed a group of goblins who were cackling over a sack of gold that they had undoubtedly won betting on the match and who seemed quite unperturbed by the trouble at the campsite farther still along the path they walked into a patch of silvery light and when they looked through the trees they saw three tall and beautiful veela standing in a clearing surrounded by a gaggle of young wizards all of whom were talking very loudly 
 
 i pull down about a hundred sacks of galleons a year one of them shouted a dragon killer for the committee for the disposal of dangerous creatures 
 
 no not yelled his friend a dishwasher at the leaky cauldronbut a vampire hunter killed about ninety so far 
 
 a third young wizard whose pimples were visible even by the dim silvery light of the veela now cut in about to become the youngest ever minister of magic i am 
 
 harry snorted with laughter he recognized the pimply wizard his name was stan shunpike and he was in fact a conductor on the knight bus he turned to tell ron this but face had gone oddly slack and next second ron was yelling did i tell you invented a broomstick reach jupiter 
 
 honestly said hermione and she and harry grabbed ron firmly by the arms wheeled him around and marched him away by the time the sounds of the veela and their admirers had faded completely they were in the very heart of the wood they seemed to be alone now everything was much quieter 
 
 harry looked around i reckon we can just wait here you know hear anyone coming a mile off 
 
 the words were hardly out of his mouth when ludo bagman emerged from behind a tree right ahead of them 
 
 even by the feeble light of the two wands harry could see that a great change had come over bagman he no longer looked buoyant and there was no more spring in his step he looked very white and strained 
 
 that he said blinking down at them trying to make out their faces what are you doing in here all alone 
 
 they looked at one another surprised 
 
 well a sort of riot going on said ron 
 
 bagman stared at him 
 
 what 
 
 at the campsitesome people have got hold of a family of muggles 
 
 bagman swore loudly 
 
 damn them he said looking quite distracted and without another word he disapparated with a small pop 
 
 not exactly on top of things mr bagman is he said hermione frowning 
 
 he was a great beater though said ron leading the way off the path into a small clearing and sitting down on a patch of dry grass at the foot of a tree the wimbourne wasps won the league three times in a row while he was with them 
 
 he took his small figure of krum out of his pocket set it down on the ground and watched it walk around like the real krum the model was slightly and much less impressive on his splayed feet than on his broomstick harry was listening for noise from the campsite everything seemed much quieter perhaps the riot was over 
 
 i hope the others are okay said hermione after a while 
 
 be fine said ron 
 
 imagine if your dad catches lucius malfoy said harry sitting down next to ron and watching the small figure of krum slouching over the fallen leaves always said like to get something on him 
 
 wipe the smirk off old face all right said ron 
 
 those poor muggles though said hermione nervously what if they get them down 
 
 they will said ron reassuringly find a way 
 
 mad though to do something like that when the whole ministry of out here tonight said hermione i mean how do they expect to get away with it do you think been drinking or are they just 
 
 but she broke off abruptly and looked over her shoulder harry and ron looked quickly around too it sounded as though someone was staggering toward their clearing they waited listening to the sounds of the uneven steps behind the dark trees but the footsteps came to a sudden halt 
 
 hello called harry 
 
 there was silence harry got to his feet and peered around the tree it was too dark to see very far but he could sense somebody standing just beyond the range of his vision 
 
 there he said 
 
 and then without warning the silence was rent by a voice unlike any they had heard in the wood and it uttered not a panicked shout but what sounded like a spell 
 
 morsmordre 
 
 and something vast green and glittering erupted from the patch of darkness eyes had been struggling to penetrate it flew up over the treetops and into the sky 
 
 what the gasped ron as he sprang to his feet again staring up at the thing that had appeared 
 
 for a split second harry thought it was another leprechaun formation then he realized that it was a colossal skull comprised of what looked like emerald stars with a serpent protruding from its mouth like a tongue as they watched it rose higher and higher blazing in a haze of greenish smoke etched against the black sky like a new constellation 
 
 suddenly the wood all around them erupted with screams harry understand why but the only possible cause was the sudden appearance of the skull which had now risen high enough to illuminate the entire wood like some grisly neon sign he scanned the darkness for the person who had conjured the skull but he see anyone 
 
 there he called again 
 
 harry come on move hermione had seized the collar of his jacket and was tugging him backward 
 
 the matter harry said startled to see her face so white and terrified 
 
 the dark mark harry hermione moaned pulling him as hard as she could sign 
 
 
 
 harry come on 
 
 harry turned ron was hurriedly scooping up his miniature krum the three of them started across the clearing but before they had taken a few hurried steps a series of popping noises announced the arrival of twenty wizards appearing from thin air surrounding them 
 
 harry whirled around and in an instant he registered one fact each of these wizards had his wand out and every wand was pointing right at himself ron and hermione 
 
 without pausing to think he yelled duck 
 
 he seized the other two and pulled them down onto the ground 
 
 stupefy roared twenty voices there was a blinding series of flashes and harry felt the hair on his head ripple as though a powerful wind had swept the clearing raising his head a fraction of an inch he saw jets of fiery red light flying over them from the wizards wands crossing one another bouncing off tree trunks rebounding into the darkness 
 
 stop yelled a voice he recognized stop my son 
 
 hair stopped blowing about he raised his head a little higher the wizard in front of him had lowered his wand he rolled over and saw mr weasley striding toward them looking terrified 
 
 ron harry his voice sounded shaky hermione are you all right 
 
 out of the way arthur said a cold curt voice 
 
 it was mr crouch he and the other ministry wizards were closing in on them harry got to his feet to face them mr face was taut with rage 
 
 which of you did it he snapped his sharp eyes darting between them which of you conjured the dark mark 
 
 we do that said harry gesturing up at the skull 
 
 we do anything said ron who was rubbing his elbow and looking indignantly at his father what did you want to attack us for 
 
 do not lie sir shouted mr crouch his wand was still pointing directly at ron and his eyes were popping he looked slightly mad you have been discovered at the scene of the crime 
 
 barty whispered a witch in a long woolen dressing gown kids barty never have been able to 
 
 where did the mark come from you three said mr weasley quickly 
 
 over there said hermione shakily pointing at the place where they had heard the voice there was someone behind the treesthey shouted words an incantation 
 
 oh stood over there did they said mr crouch turning his popping eyes on hermione now disbelief etched all over his face said an incantation did they you seem very well informed about how that mark is summoned missy 
 
 but none of the ministry wizards apart from mr crouch seemed to think it remotely likely that harry ron or hermione had conjured the skull on the contrary at words they had all raised their wands again and were pointing in the direction she had indicated squinting through the dark trees 
 
 too late said the witch in the woolen dressing gown shaking her head have disapparated 
 
 i think so said a wizard with a scrubby brown beard it was amos diggory father our stunners went right through those a good chance we got them 
 
 amos be careful said a few of the wizards warningly as mr diggory squared his shoulders raised his wand marched across the clearing and disappeared into the darkness hermione watched him vanish with her hands over her mouth 
 
 a few seconds later they heard mr diggory shout 
 
 yes we got them someone here unconscious but blimey 
 
 got someone shouted mr crouch sounding highly disbelieving who who is it 
 
 they heard snapping twigs the rustling of leaves and then crunching footsteps as mr diggory reemerged from behind the trees he was carrying a tiny limp figure in his arms harry recognized the tea towel at once it was winky 
 
 mr crouch did not move or speak as mr diggory deposited his elf on the ground at his feet the other ministry wizards were all staring at mr crouch for a few seconds crouch remained transfixed his eyes blazing in his white face as he stared down at winky then he appeared to come to life again 
 
 this cannot be he said jerkily no 
 
 he moved quickly around mr diggory and strode off toward the place where he had found winky 
 
 no point mr crouch mr diggory called after him no one else there 
 
 but mr crouch did not seem prepared to take his word for it they could hear him moving around and the rustling of leaves as he pushed the bushes aside searching 
 
 bit embarrassing mr diggory said grimly looking down at unconscious form barty mean to say 
 
 come off it amos said mr weasley quietly you seriously think it was the elf the dark a sign it requires a wand 
 
 yeah said mr diggory and she had a wand 
 
 what said mr weasley 
 
 here look mr diggory held up a wand and showed it to mr weasley had it in her hand so clause three of the code of wand use broken for a start no creature is permitted to carry or use a wand 
 
 just then there was another pop and ludo bagman apparated right next to mr weasley looking breathless and disorientated he spun on the spot goggling upward at the skull 
 
 the dark mark he panted almost trampling winky as he turned inquiringly to his colleagues who did it did you get them barry going on 
 
 mr crouch had returned his face was still ghostly white and his hands and his toothbrush mustache were both twitching 
 
 where have you been barty said bagman why you at the match your elf was saving you a seat too gulping gargoyles bagman had just noticed winky lying at his feet what happened to her 
 
 i have been busy ludo said mr crouch still talking in the same jerky fashion barely moving his lips and my elf has been stunned 
 
 stunned by you lot you mean but why 
 
 comprehension dawned suddenly on round shiny face he looked up at the skull down at winky and then at mr crouch 
 
 no he said winky conjure the dark mark she know how need a wand for a start 
 
 and she had one said mr diggory i found her holding one ludo if all right with you mr crouch i think we should hear what got to say for herself 
 
 crouch gave no sign that he had heard mr diggory but mr diggory seemed to take his silence for assent he raised his own wand pointed it at winky and said ennervate 
 
 winky stirred feebly her great brown eyes opened and she blinked several times in a bemused sort of way watched by the silent wizards she raised herself shakily into a sitting position 
 
 she caught sight of mr feet and slowly tremulously raised her eyes to stare up into his face then more slowly still she looked up into the sky harry could see the floating skull reflected twice in her enormous glassy eyes she gave a gasp looked wildly around the crowded clearing and burst into terrified sobs 
 
 elf said mr diggory sternly do you know who i am a member of the department for the regulation and control of magical creatures 
 
 winky began to rock backward and forward on the ground her breath coming in sharp bursts harry was reminded forcibly of dobby in his moments of terrified disobedience 
 
 as you see elf the dark mark was conjured here a short while ago said mr diggory and you were discovered moments later right beneath it an explanation if you please 
 
 i i i is not doing it sir winky gasped i is not knowing how sir 
 
 you were found with a wand in your hand barked mr diggory brandishing it in front of her and as the wand caught the green light that was filling the clearing from the skull above harry recognized it 
 
 hey mine he said 
 
 everyone in the clearing looked at him 
 
 excuse me said mr diggory incredulously 
 
 my wand said harry i dropped it 
 
 you dropped it repeated mr diggory in disbelief is this a confession you threw it aside after you conjured the mark 
 
 amos think who talking to said mr weasley very angrily is harry potter likely to conjure the dark mark 
 
 er of course not mumbled mr diggory sorrycarried away 
 
 i drop it there anyway said harry jerking his thumb toward the trees beneath the skull i missed it right after we got into the wood 
 
 so said mr diggory his eyes hardening as he turned to look at winky again cowering at his feet you found this wand eh elf and you picked it up and thought have some fun with it did you 
 
 i is not doing magic with it sir squealed winky tears streaming down the sides of her squashed and bulbous nose i isi isi is just picking it up sir i is not making the dark mark sir i is not knowing how 
 
 it her said hermione she looked very nervous speaking up in front of all these ministry wizards yet determined all the same got a squeaky little voice and the voice we heard doing the incantation was much deeper she looked around at harry and ron appealing for their support it sound anything like winky did it 
 
 no said harry shaking his head it definitely sound like an elf 
 
 yeah it was a human voice said ron 
 
 well soon see growled mr diggory looking unimpressed a simple way of discovering the last spell a wand performed elf did you know that 
 
 winky trembled and shook her head frantically her ears flapping as mr diggory raised his own wand again and placed it tip to tip with 
 
 prior incantato roared mr diggory 
 
 harry heard hermione gasp horrified as a gigantic skull erupted from the point where the two wands met but it was a mere shadow of the green skull high above them it looked as though it were made of thick gray smoke the ghost of a spell 
 
 deletrius mr diggory shouted and the smoky skull vanished in a wisp of smoke 
 
 so said mr diggory with a kind of savage triumph looking down upon winky who was still shaking convulsively 
 
 i is not doing it she squealed her eyes rolling in terror i is not i is not i is not knowing how i is a good elf i using wands i knowing how 
 
 been caught elf mr diggory roared caught with the guilty wand in your hand 
 
 amos said mr weasley loudly think about itprecious few wizards know how to do that would she have learned it 
 
 perhaps amos is suggesting said mr crouch cold anger in every syllable that i routinely teach my servants to conjure the dark mark 
 
 there was a deeply unpleasant silence amos diggory looked horrified mr crouchnotnot at all 
 
 you have now come very close to accusing the two people in this clearing who are least likely to conjure that mark barked mr crouch harry potter and myself i suppose you are familiar with the story amos 
 
 of course everyone knows muttered mr diggory looking highly discomforted 
 
 and i trust you remember the many proofs i have given over a long career that i despise and detest the dark arts and those who practice them mr crouch shouted his eyes bulging again 
 
 mr crouch i i never suggested you had anything to do with it amos diggory muttered again now reddening behind his scrubby brown beard 
 
 if you accuse my elf you accuse me diggory shouted mr crouch where else would she have learned to conjure it 
 
 she she picked it up anywhere 
 
 precisely amos said mr weasley she might have picked it up he said kindly turning to the elf but she flinched as though he too was shouting at her where exactly did you find wand 
 
 winky was twisting the hem of her tea towel so violently that it was fraying beneath her fingers 
 
 i i is finding itfinding it there sir she whispered therein the trees sir 
 
 you see amos said mr weasley whoever conjured the mark could have disapparated right after done it leaving wand behind a clever thing to do not using their own wand which could have betrayed them and winky here had the misfortune to come across the wand moments later and pick it up 
 
 but then have been only a few feet away from the real culprit said mr diggory impatiently elf did you see anyone 
 
 winky began to tremble worse than ever her giant eyes flickered from mr diggory to ludo bagman and onto mr crouch then she gulped and said i is seeing no one sirno one 
 
 amos said mr crouch curtly i am fully aware that in the ordinary course of events you would want to take winky into your department for questioning i ask you however to allow me to deal with her 
 
 mr diggory looked as though he think much of this suggestion at all but it was clear to harry that mr crouch was such an important member of the ministry that he did not dare refuse him 
 
 you may rest assured that she will be punished mr crouch added coldly 
 
 winky stammered looking up at mr crouch her eyes brimming with tears 
 
 mr crouch stared back his face somehow sharpened each line upon it more deeply etched there was no pity in his gaze 
 
 winky has behaved tonight in a manner i would not have believed possible he said slowly i told her to remain in the tent i told her to stay there while i went to sort out the trouble and i find that she disobeyed me this means clothes 
 
 no shrieked winky prostrating herself at mr feet no master not clothes not clothes 
 
 harry knew that the only way to turn a free was to present it with proper garments it was pitiful to see the way winky clutched at her tea towel as she sobbed over mr feet 
 
 but she was frightened hermione burst out angrily glaring at mr crouch your scared of heights and those wizards in masks were levitating people you blame her for wanting to get out of their way 
 
 mr crouch took a step backward freeing himself from contact with the elf whom he was surveying as though she were something filthy and rotten that was contaminating his shoes 
 
 i have no use for a who disobeys me he said coldly looking over at hermione i have no use for a servant who forgets what is due to her master and to her reputation 
 
 winky was crying so hard that her sobs echoed around the clearing there was a very nasty silence which was ended by mr weasley who said quietly well i think take my lot back to the tent if got any objections amos that told us all it can if harry could have it back please 
 
 mr diggory handed harry his wand and harry pocketed it 
 
 come on you three mr weasley said quietly but hermione seem to want to move her eyes were still upon the sobbing elf hermione mr weasley said more urgently she turned and followed harry and ron out of the clearing and off through the trees 
 
 going to happen to winky said hermione the moment they had left the clearing 
 
 i know said mr weasley 
 
 the way they were treating her said hermione furiously mr diggory calling her elf all the timeand mr crouch he knows she do it and still going to sack her he care how frightened been or how upset she was it was like she even human 
 
 well not said ron 
 
 hermione rounded on him 
 
 that mean she got feelings ron disgusting the way 
 
 hermione i agree with you said mr weasley quickly beckoning her on but now is not the time to discuss elf rights i want to get back to the tent as fast as we can what happened to the others 
 
 we lost them in the dark said ron dad why was everyone so uptight about that skull thing 
 
 explain everything back at the tent said mr weasley tensely 
 
 but when they reached the edge of the wood their progress was impeded a large crowd of witches and wizards was congregated there and when they saw mr weasley coming toward them many of them surged forward 
 
 going on in there 
 
 who conjured it 
 
 arthur not him 
 
 of course not him said mr weasley impatiently we know who it was it looks like they disapparated now excuse me please i want to get to bed 
 
 he led harry ron and hermione through the crowd and back into the campsite all was quiet now there was no sign of the masked wizards though several ruined tents were still smoking 
 
 head was poking out of the boys tent 
 
 dad going on he called through the dark fred george and ginny got back okay but the others 
 
 got them here said mr weasley bending down and entering the tent harry ron and hermione entered after him 
 
 bill was sitting at the small kitchen table holding a bedsheet to his arm which was bleeding profusely charlie had a large rip in his shirt and percy was sporting a bloody nose fred george and ginny looked unhurt though shaken 
 
 did you get them dad said bill sharply the person who conjured the mark 
 
 no said mr weasley we found barry elf holding wand but none the wiser about who actually conured the mark 
 
 what said bill charlie and percy together 
 
 wand said fred 
 
 mr elf said percy sounding thunderstruck 
 
 with some assistance from harry ron and hermione mr weasley explained what had happened in the woods when they had finished their story percy swelled indignantly 
 
 well mr crouch is quite right to get rid of an elf like that he said running away when expressly told her not toembarrassing him in front of the whole ministryhow would that have looked if been brought up in front of the department for the regulation and control 
 
 she do anything she was just in the wrong place at the wrong time hermione snapped at percy who looked very taken aback hermione had always got on fairly well with percy better indeed than any of the others 
 
 hermione a wizard in mr position afford a going to run amok with a wand said percy pompously recovering himself 
 
 she run amok shouted hermione she just picked it up off the ground 
 
 look can someone just explain what that skull thing was said ron impatiently it hurting it such a big deal 
 
 i told you symbol ron said hermione before anyone else could answer i read about it in the rise and fall of the dark arts 
 
 and it been seen for thirteen years said mr weasley quietly of course people panickedit was almost like seeing back again 
 
 i get it said ron frowning i still only a shape in the sky 
 
 ron and his followers sent the dark mark into the air whenever they killed said mr weasley the terror it inspiredyou have no idea too young just picture coming home and finding the dark mark hovering over your house and knowing what about to find inside mr weasley winced worst fearthe very worst 
 
 there was silence for a moment then bill removing the sheet from his arm to check on his cut said well it help us tonight whoever conjured it it scared the death eaters away the moment they saw it they all disapparated before got near enough to unmask any of them we caught the robertses before they hit the ground though having their memories modified right now 
 
 death eaters said harry what are death eaters 
 
 what supporters called themselves said bill i think we saw left of them tonight the ones who managed to keep themselves out of azkaban anyway 
 
 we prove it was them bill said mr weasley though it probably was he added hopelessly 
 
 yeah i bet it was said ron suddenly dad we met draco malfoy in the woods and he as good as told us his dad was one of those nutters in masks and we all know the malfoys were right in with 
 
 but what were supporters harry began everybody flinched like most of the wizarding world the weasleys always avoided saying name sorry said harry quickly what were supporters up to levitating muggles i mean what was the point 
 
 the point said mr weasley with a hollow laugh harry their idea of fun half the muggle killings back when was in power were done for fun i suppose they had a few drinks tonight and resist reminding us all that lots of them are still at large a nice little reunion for them he finished disgustedly 
 
 but if they were the death eaters why did they disapparate when they saw the dark mark said ron have been pleased to see it they 
 
 use your brains ron said bill if they really were death eaters they worked very hard to keep out of azkaban when lost power and told all sorts of lies about him forcing them to kill and torture people i bet be even more frightened than the rest of us to see him come back they denied ever been involved with him when he lost his powers and went back to their daily reckon be with them do you 
 
 sowhoever conjured the dark mark said hermione slowly were they doing it to show support for the death eaters or to scare them away 
 
 your guess is as good as ours hermione said mr weasley but tell you thisit was only the death eaters who ever knew how to conjure it be very surprised if the person who did it been a death eater once even if not very late and if your mother hears happened be worried sick get a few more hours sleep and then try and get an early portkey out of here 
 
 harry got back into his bunk with his head buzzing he knew he ought to feel exhausted it was nearly three in the morning but he felt and worried 
 
 three days ago it felt like much longer but it had only been three days he had awoken with his scar burning and tonight for the first time in thirteen years lord mark had appeared in the sky what did these things mean 
 
 he thought of the letter he had written to sirius before leaving privet drive would sirius have gotten it yet when would he reply harry lay looking up at the canvas but no flying fantasies came to him now to ease him to sleep and it was a long time after snores filled the tent that harry finally dozed off

lionfish nov chapter nine the woes of mrs weasleycontents prev chapter next chapter 
 abrupt departure took harry completely by surprise he remained sitting where he was in the chained chair struggling with his feelings of shock and relief the wizengamot were all getting to their feet talking gathering up their papers and packing them away harry stood up nobody seemed to be paying him the slightest bit of attention except the toadlike witch on right who was now gazing down at him instead of at dumbledore ignoring her he tried to catch eye or madam wanting to ask whether he was free to go but fudge seemed quite determined not to notice harry and madam bones was busy with her briefcase so he took a lew tentative steps towards the exit and when nobody called him back broke into a very fast walk 
 
 he took the last lew steps at a run wrenched open the door and almost collided with mr weasley who was standing right outside looking pale and apprehensive 
 
 dumbledore say 
 
 cleared harry said pulling the door closed behind him of all charges 
 
 beaming mr weasley seized harry by the shoulders 
 
 harry wonderful well of course they have found you guilty not on the evidence but even so i pretend i 
 
 but mr weasley broke off because the courtroom door had ust opened again the wizengamot were filing out 
 
 beard exclaimed mr weasley wonderingly pulling harry aside to let them all pass you were tried by the full court 
 
 i think so said harry quietly 
 
 one or two of the wizards nodded to harry as they passed and a few including madam bones said morning arthur to mr weasley but most averted their eyes cornelius fudge and the toadlike witch were almost the last to leave the dungeon fudge acted as though mr weasley and harry were part of the wall but again the witch looked almost appraisingly at harry as she passed last of all to pass was percy like fudge he completely ignored his father and harry he marched past clutching a large roll of parchment and a handful of spare quills his back rigid and his nose in the air the lines around mr mouth tightened slightly but other than this he gave no sign that he had seen his third son 
 
 going to take you straight back so you can tell the others the good news he said beckoning harry forwards as heels disappeared up the steps to level nine drop you off on the way to that toilet in bethnal green come on 
 
 so what will you have to do about the toilet harry asked grinning everything suddenly seemed five times funnier than usual it was starting to sink in he was cleared he was going back to hogwarts 
 
 oh a simple enough said mr weasley as they mounted the stairs but not so much having to repair the damage more the attitude behind the vandalism harry might strike some wizards as funny but an expression of something much deeper and nastier and i for one 
 
 mr weasley broke off in they had just reached the corridor and cornelius fudge was standing a few feet away from them talking quietly to a tall man with sleek blond hair and a pointed pale face 
 
 the second man turned at the sound of their footsteps he too broke off in his cold grey eyes narrowed and fixed upon face 
 
 well well well patronus potter said lucius malfoy coolly 
 
 harry felt winded as though he had just walked into something solid he had last seen those cold grey eyes through slits in a death hood and last heard that voice jeering in a dark graveyard while lord voldemort tortured him harry could not believe that lucius malfoy dared look him in the face he could not believe that he was here in the ministry of magic or that cornelius fudge was talking to him when harry had told fudge mere weeks ago that malfoy was a death eater 
 
 the minister was just telling me about your lucky escape potter drawled mr malfoy quite astonishing the way you continue to wriggle out of very tight holes snakelike in fact 
 
 mr weasley gripped shoulder in warning 
 
 yeah said harry yeah good at escaping 
 
 lucius malfoy raised his eyes to mr face 
 
 and arthur weasley too what are you doing here arthur 
 
 i work here said mr weasley curtly 
 
 not here surely said mr malfoy raising his eyebrows and glancing towards the door over mr shoulder i thought you were up on the second floor you do something that involves sneaking muggle artefacts home and bewitching them 
 
 no mr weasley snapped his fingers now biting into shoulder 
 
 what areyou doing here anyway harry asked lucius malfoy 
 
 i think private matters between myself and the minister are any concern of yours potter said malfoy smoothing the front of his robes harry distinctly heard the gentle clinking of what sounded like a full pocket of gold really just because you are favourite boy you must not expect the same indulgence from the rest of us shall we go up to your office then minister 
 
 certainly said fudge turning his back on harry and mr weasley this way lucius 
 
 they strode off together talking in low voices mr weasley did not let go of shoulder until they had disappeared into the lift 
 
 why he waiting outside office if got business to do together harry burst out furiously what was he doing down here 
 
 trying to sneak down to the courtroom if you ask me said mr weasley looking extremely agitated and glancing over his shoulder as though making sure they could not be overheard trying to find out whether been expelled or not leave a note for dumbledore when i drop you off he ought to know been talking to fudge again 
 
 what private business have they got together anyway 
 
 gold i expect said mr weasley angrily been giving generously to all sorts of things for years gets him in with the right people then he can ask favours delay laws he want passed oh very lucius malfoy 
 
 the lift arrived it was empty except for a flock of memos that flapped around mr head as he pressed the button for the atrium and the doors clanged shut he waved them away irritably 
 
 mr weasley said harry slowly if fudge is meeting death eaters like malfoy if seeing them alone how do we know they put the imperius curse on him 
 
 think it occurred to us harry said mr weasley quietly but dumbledore thinks fudge is acting of his own accord at the momentwhich as dumbledore says is not a lot of comfort best not talk about it any more just now harry 
 
 the doors slid open and they stepped out into the now atrium eric the watchwizard was hidden behind his daily prophet again they had walked straight past the golden fountain before harry remembered 
 
 wait he told mr weasley and pulling his moneybag from his pocket he turned back to the fountain 
 
 he looked up into the handsome face but up close harry thought he looked rather weak and foolish the witch was wearing a vapid smile like a beauty contestant and from what harry knew of goblins and centaurs they were most unlikely to be caught staring so soppily at humans of any description only the attitude of creeping servility looked convincing with a grin at the thought of what hermione would say if she could see the statue of the elf harry turned his moneybag and emptied not just ten galleons but the whole contents into the pool at the statues feet 
 
 i knew it yelled ron punching the air you always get away with stuff 
 
 they were bound to clear you said hermione who had looked positively faint with anxiety when harry had entered the kitchen and was now holding a shaking hand over her eyes there was no case against you none at all 
 
 everyone seems quite relieved though considering you all knew get off said harry smiling 
 
 mrs weasley was wiping her face on her apron and fred george and ginny were doing a kind of war dance to a chant that went he got off he got off he got off 
 
 enough settle down shouted mr weasley though he too was smiling listen sirius lucius malfoy was at the ministry 
 
 what said sirius sharply 
 
 he got off he got off he got off 
 
 be quiet you three yes we saw him talking to fudge on level nine then they went up to office together dumbledore ought to know 
 
 absolutely said sirius tell him worry 
 
 well better get going a vomiting toilet waiting for me in bethnal green molly be late covering for tonks but kingsley might be dropping in for dinner 
 
 he got off he got off he got off 
 
 enoughfredgeorgeginny said mrs weasley as mr weasley left the kitchen harry dear come and sit down have some lunch you hardly ate breakfast 
 
 ron and hermione sat themselves down opposite him looking happier than they had done since he had first arrived at grimmauld place and feeling of giddy relief which had been somewhat dented by his encounter with lucius malfoy swelled again the gloomy house seemed warmer and more welcoming all of a sudden even kreacher looked less ugly as he poked his snoutlike nose into the kitchen to investigate the source of all the noise 
 
 course once dumbledore turned up on your side there was no way they were going to convict you said ron happily now dishing great mounds of mashed potato on to plates 
 
 yeah he swung it for me said harry he felt it would sound highly ungrateful not to mention childish to say i wish talked to me though or even looked at me 
 
 and as he thought this the scar on his forehead burned so badly that he clapped his hand to it 
 
 up said hermione looking alarmed 
 
 scar harry mumbled but nothing it happens all the time now 
 
 none of the others had noticed a thing all of them were now helping themselves to food while gloating over narrow escape fred george and ginny were still singing hermione looked rather anxious but before she could say anything ron had said happily i bet dumbledore turns up this evening to celebrate with us you know 
 
 i think be able to ron said mrs weasley setting a huge plate of roast chicken down in front of harry really very busy at the moment 
 
 he got off he got off he got off 
 
 shut up roared mrs weasley 
 
 over the next few days harry could not help noticing that there was one person within number twelve grimmauld place who did not seem wholly overjoyed that he would be returning to hogwarts sirius had put up a very good show of happiness on first hearing the news wringing hand and beaming just like the rest of them soon however he was moodier and surlier than before talking less to everybody even harry and spending increasing amounts of time shut up in his room with buckbeak 
 
 you go feeling guilty said hermione sternly after harry had confided some of his feelings to her and ron while they scrubbed out a mouldy cupboard on the third floor a few days later you belong at hogwarts and sirius knows it personally i think being selfish 
 
 a bit harsh hermione said ron frowning as he attempted to prise off a bit of mould that had attached itself firmly to his finger you want to be stuck inside this house without any company 
 
 have company said hermione headquarters to the order of the phoenix it he just got his hopes up that harry would be coming to live here with him 
 
 i think true said harry wringing out his cloth he give me a straight answer when i asked him if i could 
 
 he just want to get his own hopes up even more said hermione wisely and he probably felt a bit guilty himself because i think a part of him was really hoping be expelled then both be outcasts together 
 
 come off it said harry and ron together but hermione merely shrugged 
 
 suit yourselves but i sometimes think right and sirius gets confused about whether you or your father harry 
 
 so you think touched in the head said harry heatedly 
 
 no i just think been very lonely for a long time said hermione simply 
 
 at this point mrs weasley entered the bedroom behind them 
 
 still not finished she said poking her head into the cupboard 
 
 i thought you might be here to tell us to have a break said ron bitterly know how much mould got rid of since we arrived here 
 
 you were so keen to help the order said mrs weasley you can do your bit by making headquarters fit to live in 
 
 i feel like a grumbled ron 
 
 well now you understand what dreadful lives they lead perhaps be a bit more active in said hermione hopefully as mrs weasley left them to it you know maybe it be a bad idea to show people exactly how horrible it is to clean all the timewe could do a sponsored scrub of gryffindor common room all proceeds to it would raise awareness as well as funds 
 
 sponsor you to shut up about spew ron muttered irritably but only so harry could hear him 
 
 harry found himself daydreaming about hogwarts more and more as the end of the holidays approached he could not wait to see hagrid again to play quidditch even to stroll across the vegetable patches to the herbology greenhouses it would be a treat just to leave this dusty musty house where half of the cupboards were still bolted shut and kreacher wheezed insults out of the shadows as you passed though harry was careful not to say any of this within earshot of sirius 
 
 the fact was that living at the headquarters of the movement was not nearly as interesting or exciting as harry would have expected before experienced it though members of the order of the phoenix came and went regularly sometimes staying for meals sometimes only for a few minutes of whispered conversation mrs weasley made sure that harry and the others were kept well out of earshot whether extendable or normal and nobody not even sirius seemed to feel that harry needed to know anything more than he had heard on the night of his arrival 
 
 on the very last day of the holidays harry was sweeping up owl droppings from the top of the wardrobe when ron entered their bedroom carrying a couple of envelopes 
 
 booklists have arrived he said throwing one of the envelopes up to harry who was standing on a chair about time i thought forgotten they usually come much earlier than this 
 
 harry swept the last of the droppings into a rubbish bag and threw the bag over head into the wastepaper basket in the corner which swallowed it and belched loudly he then opened his letter it contained two pieces of parchment one the usual reminder that term started on the first of september the other telling him which books he would need for the coming year 
 
 only two new ones he said reading the list the standard book of spells grade by miranda goshawk and defensive magical theory by wilbert slinkhard 
 
 crack 
 
 fred and george apparated right beside harry he was so used to them doing this by now that he even fall off his chair 
 
 we were just wondering who assigned the slinkhard book said fred conversationally 
 
 because it means found a new defence against the dark arts teacher said george 
 
 and about time too said fred 
 
 what mean harry asked jumping down beside them 
 
 well we overheard mum and dad talking on the extendable ears a few weeks back fred told harry and from what they were saying dumbledore was having real trouble finding anyone to do the job this year 
 
 not surprising is it when you look at happened to the last four said george 
 
 one sacked one dead memory removed and one locked in a trunk for nine months said harry counting them off on his fingers yeah i see what you mean 
 
 up with you ron asked fred 
 
 ron did not answer harry looked round ron was standing very still with his mouth slightly open gaping at his letter from hogwarts 
 
 the matter said fred impatiently moving around ron to look over his shoulder at the parchment 
 
 mouth fell open too 
 
 prefect he said staring incredulously at the letter prefect 
 
 george leapt forward seized the envelope in other hand and turned it harry saw something scarlet and gold fall into palm 
 
 no way said george in a hushed voice 
 
 been a mistake said fred snatching the letter out of grasp and holding it up to the light as though checking for a watermark no one in their right mind would make ron a prefect 
 
 the twins heads turned in unison and both of them stared at harry 
 
 we thought you were a cert said fred in a tone that suggested harry had tricked them in some way 
 
 we thought dumbledore was bound to pick you said george indignantly 
 
 winning the triwizard and everything said fred 
 
 i suppose all the mad stuff counted against him said george to fred 
 
 yeah said fred slowly yeah caused too much trouble mate well at least one of got their priorities right 
 
 he strode over to harry and clapped him on the back while giving ron a scathing look 
 
 prefect ickle ronnie the prefect 
 
 oh going to be revolting groaned george thrusting the prefect badge back at ron as though it might contaminate him 
 
 ron who still had not said a word took the badge stared at it for a moment then held it out to harry as though asking mutely for confirmation that it was genuine harry took it a large p was superimposed on the gryffindor lion he had seen a badge just like this on chest on his very first day at hogwarts 
 
 the door banged open hermione came tearing into the room her cheeks flushed and her hair flying there was an envelope in her hand 
 
 did youdid you get 
 
 she spotted the badge in hand and let out a shriek 
 
 i knew it she said excitedly brandishing her letter me too harry me too 
 
 no said harry quickly pushing the badge back into hand ron not me 
 
 itwhat 
 
 prefect not me harry said 
 
 ron said hermione her jaw dropping but are you sure i mean 
 
 she turned red as ron looked round at her with a defiant expression on his lace 
 
 my name on the letter he said 
 
 i said hermione looking thoroughly bewildered i well wow well done ron really 
 
 unexpected said george nodding 
 
 no said hermione blushing harder than ever no not done loads of really 
 
 the door behind her opened a little wider and mrs weasley backed into the room carrying a pile of freshly laundered robes 
 
 ginny said the booklists had come at last she said glancing around at all the envelopes as she made her way over to the bed and started sorting the robes into two piles if you give them to me take them over to diagon alley this afternoon and get your books while packing ron have to get you more pyjamas these are at least six inches too short i believe how fast growing what colour would you like 
 
 get him red and gold to match his badge said george smirking 
 
 match his what said mrs weasley absently rolling up a pair of maroon socks and placing them on pile 
 
 his badge said fred with the air of getting the worst over quickly his lovely shiny new badge 
 
 words took a moment to penetrate mrs preoccupation with pyjamas 
 
 his but ron not 
 
 ron held up his badge 
 
 mrs weasley let out a shriek just like 
 
 i believe it i believe it oh ron how wonderful a prefect everyone in the family 
 
 what are fred and i neighbours said george indignantly as his mother pushed him aside and flung her arms around her youngest son 
 
 wait until your father hears ron so proud of you what wonderful news you could end up head boy just like bill and percy the first step oh what a thing to happen in the middle of all this worry just thrilled oh ronnie 
 
 fred and george were both making loud retching noises behind her back but mrs weasley did not notice arms tight around neck she was kissing him all over his face which had turned a brighter scarlet than his badge 
 
 mum mum get a grip he muttered trying to push her away 
 
 she let go of him and said breathlessly well what will it be we gave percy an owl but already got one of course 
 
 do you mean said ron looking as though he did not dare believe his ears 
 
 got to have a reward for this said mrs weasley fondly how about a nice new set of dress robes 
 
 already bought him some said fred sourly who looked as though he sincerely regretted this generosity 
 
 or a new cauldron old rusting through or a new rat you always liked scabbers 
 
 mum said ron hopefully can i have a new broom 
 
 mrs face fell slightly broomsticks were expensive 
 
 not a really good one ron hastened to add justjust a new one for a change 
 
 mrs weasley hesitated then smiled 
 
 of course you can well better get going if got a broom to buy too see you all later little ronnie a prefect and forget to pack your trunks a prefect oh all of a dither 
 
 she gave ron yet another kiss on the cheek sniffed loudly and bustled from the room 
 
 fred and george exchanged looks 
 
 you mind if we kiss you do you ron said fred in a falsely anxious voice 
 
 we could curtsey if you like said george 
 
 oh shut up said ron scowling at them 
 
 or what said fred an evil grin spreading across his face going to put us in detention 
 
 love to see him try sniggered george 
 
 he could if you watch out said hermione angrily 
 
 fred and george burst out laughing and ron muttered drop it hermione 
 
 going to have to watch our step george said fred pretending to tremble with these two on our case 
 
 yeah it looks like our days are finally over said george shaking his head 
 
 and with another loud crack the twins disapparated 
 
 those two said hermione furiously staring up at the ceiling through which they could now hear fred and george roaring with laughter in the room upstairs pay any attention to them ron only jealous 
 
 i think they are said ron doubtfully also looking up at the ceiling always said only prats become prefects still he added on a happier note never had new brooms i wish i could go with mum and choose never be able to afford a nimbus but the new cleansweep out be great yeah i think go and tell her i like the cleansweep just so she knows 
 
 he dashed from the room leaving harry and hermione alone 
 
 for some reason harry found he did not want to look at hermione he turned to his bed picked up the pile of clean robes mrs weasley had laid on it and crossed the room to his trunk 
 
 harry said hermione tentatively 
 
 well done hermione said harry so heartily it did not sound like his voice at all and still not looking at her brilliant prefect great 
 
 thanks said hermione ermharrycould i borrow hedwig so i can tell mum and dad be really pleasedi mean prefect is something they can understand 
 
 yeah no problem said harry still in the horrible hearty voice that did not belong to him take her 
 
 he leaned over his trunk laid the robes on the bottom of it and pretended to be rummaging for something while hermione crossed to the wardrobe and called hedwig down a few moments passed harry heard the door close but remained bent double listening the only sounds he could hear were the blank picture on the wall sniggering again and the wastepaper basket in the corner coughing up the owl droppings 
 
 he straightened up and looked behind him hermione had left and hedwig had gone harry hurried across the room closed the door then returned slowly to his bed and sank on to it gazing unseeingly at the foot of the wardrobe 
 
 he had forgotten completely about prefects being chosen in the fifth year he had been too anxious about the possibility of being expelled to spare a thought for the fact that badges must be winging their way towards certain people but if he had remembered if he had thought about it what would he have expected 
 
 not this said a small and truthful voice inside his head 
 
 harry screwed up his face and buried it in his hands he could not lie to himself if he had known the prefect badge was on its way he would have expected it to come to him not ron did this make him as arrogant as draco malfoy did he think himself superior to everyone else did he really believe he was better than ron 
 
 no said the small voice defiantly 
 
 was that true harry wondered anxiously probing his own feelings 
 
 better at quidditch said the voice but not better at anything else 
 
 that was definitely true harry thought he was no better than ron in lessons but what about outside lessons what about those adventures he ron and hermione had had together since starting at hogwarts often risking much worse than expulsion 
 
 well ron and hermione were with me most of the time said the voice in head 
 
 not all the time though harry argued with himself they fight quirrell with me they take on riddle and the basilisk they get rid of all those dementors the night sirius escaped they in that graveyard with me the night voldemort returned 
 
 and the same feeling of that had overwhelmed him on the night he had arrived rose again definitely done more harry thought indignantly done more than either of them 
 
 but maybe said the small voice fairly maybe dumbledore choose prefects because got themselves into a load of dangerous situations maybe he chooses them for other reasons ron must have something you 
 
 harry opened his eyes and stared through his fingers at the clawed feet remembering what fred had said 
 
 no one in their right mind would make ron a prefect 
 
 harry gave a small snort of laughter a second later he felt sickened with himself 
 
 ron had not asked dumbledore to give him the prefect badge this was not fault was he harry best friend in the world going to sulk because he have a badge laugh with the twins behind back ruin this for ron when for the first time he had beaten harry at something 
 
 at this point harry heard footsteps on the stairs again he stood up straightened his glasses and hitched a grin on to his face as ron bounded back through the door 
 
 just caught her he said happily she says get the cleansweep if she can 
 
 cool harry said and he was relieved to hear that his voice had stopped sounding hearty listenronwell done mate 
 
 the smile faded off face 
 
 i never thought it would be me he said shaking his head i thought it would be you 
 
 nah caused too much trouble harry said echoing fred 
 
 yeah said ron yeah i suppose well better get our trunks packed we 
 
 it was odd how widely their possessions seemed to have scattered themselves since they had arrived it took them most of the afternoon to retrieve their books and belongings from all over the house and stow them back inside their school trunks marry noticed that ron kept moving his badge around first placing it on his bedside table then putting it into his jeans pocket then taking it out and lying it on his folded robes as though to see the effect of the red on the black only when fred and george dropped in and offered to attach it to his forehead with a permanent sticking charm did he wrap it tenderly in his maroon socks and lock it in his trunk 
 
 mrs weasley returned from diagon alley around six laden with books and carrying a long package wrapped in thick brown paper that ron took from her with a moan of longing 
 
 never mind unwrapping it now people are arriving for dinner i want you all downstairs she said but the moment she was out of sight ron ripped off the paper in a frenzy and examined every inch of his new broom an ecstatic expression on his face 
 
 down in the basement mrs weasley had hung a scarlet banner over the heavily laden dinner table which read congratulations ron and hermionenew prefects she looked in a better mood than harry had seen her all holiday 
 
 i thought have a little party not a dinner she told harry ron hermione fred george and ginny as they entered the room your father and bill are on their way ron sent them both owls and thrilled she added beaming 
 
 fred rolled his eyes 
 
 sirius lupin tonks and kingsley shacklebolt were already there and moody stumped in shortly after harry had got himself a butterbeer 
 
 oh alastor i am glad here said mrs weasley brightly as shrugged off his travelling cloak been wanting to ask you for agescould you have a look in the writing desk in the drawing room and tell us inside it we wanted to open it just in case something really nasty 
 
 no problem molly 
 
 eye swivelled upwards and stared fixedly through the ceiling of the kitchen 
 
 drawing room he growled as the pupil contracted desk in the corner yeah i see it yeah a boggart want me to go up and get rid of it molly 
 
 no no do it myself later beamed mrs weasley you have your drink having a little bit of a celebration actually she gestured at the scarlet banner fourth prefect in the family she said fondly ruffling hair 
 
 prefect eh growled moody his normal eye on ron and his magical eye swivelling around to gaze into the side of his head harry had the very uncomfortable feeling it was looking at him and moved away towards sirius and lupin 
 
 well congratulations said moody still glaring at ron with his normal eye authority figures always attract trouble but i suppose dumbledore thinks you can withstand most major jinxes or he have appointed you 
 
 ron looked rather startled at this view of the matter but was saved the trouble of responding by the arrival of his father and eldest brother mrs weasley was in such a good mood she did not even complain that they had brought mundungus with them he was wearing a long overcoat that seemed oddly lumpy in unlikely places and declined the offer to remove it and put it with travelling cloak 
 
 well i think a toast is in order said mr weasley when everyone had a drink he raised his goblet to ron and hermione the new gryffindor prefects 
 
 ron and hermione beamed as everyone drank to them and then applauded 
 
 i was never a prefect myself said tonks brightly from behind harry as everybody moved towards the table to help themselves to food her hair was tomato red and today she looked like older sister my head of house said i lacked certain necessary qualities 
 
 like what said ginny who was choosing a baked potato 
 
 like the ability to behave myself said tonks 
 
 ginny laughed hermione looked as though she did not know whether to smile or not and compromised by taking an extra large gulp of butterbeer and choking on it 
 
 what about you sirius ginny asked thumping hermione on the back 
 
 sirius who was right beside harry let out his usual laugh 
 
 no one would have made me a prefect i spent too much time in detention with james lupin was the good boy he got the badge 
 
 i think dumbledore might have hoped i would be able to exercise some control over my best friends said lupin i need scarcely say that i failed dismally 
 
 mood suddenly lifted his father had not been a prefect either all at once the party seemed much more enjoyable he loaded up his plate feeling doubly fond of everyone in the room 
 
 ron was rhapsodising about his new broom to anybody who would listen 
 
 nought to seventy in ten seconds not bad is it when you think the comet two only nought to sixty and with a decent tailwind according to which broomstick 
 
 hermione was talking very earnestly to lupin about her view of elf rights 
 
 i mean the same kind of nonsense as werewolf segregation it it all stems from this horrible thing wizards have of thinking superior to other creatures 
 
 mrs weasley and bill were having their usual argument about hair 
 
 getting really out of hand and so it would look much better shorter it harry 
 
 ohi dunno said harry slightly alarmed at being asked his opinion he slid away from them in the direction of fred and george who were huddled in a corner with mundungus 
 
 mundungus stopped talking when he saw harry but fred winked and beckoned harry closer 
 
 ok he told mundungus we can trust harry our financial backer 
 
 look what got us said george holding out his hand to harry it was full of what looked like shrivelled black pods a faint rattling noise was coming from them even though they were completely stationary 
 
 venomous tentacula seeds said george we need them for the skiving snackboxes but a class c substance so been having a bit of trouble getting hold of them 
 
 ten galleons the lot then dung said fred 
 
 wiv all the trouble i went to to get em said mundungus his saggy bloodshot eyes stretching even wider sorry lads but not taking a knut under twenty 
 
 dung likes his little joke fred said to harry 
 
 yeah his best one so far has been six sickles for a bag of knarl quills said george 
 
 be careful harry warned them quietly 
 
 what said fred busy cooing over prefect ron okay 
 
 but moody could have his eye on you harry pointed out 
 
 mundungus looked nervously over his shoulder 
 
 good point that he grunted all right lads ten it is if take em quick 
 
 cheers harry said fred delightedly when mundungus had emptied his pockets into the twins outstretched hands and scuttled off towards the food better get these upstairs 
 
 harry watched them go feeling slightly uneasy it had just occurred to him that mr and mrs weasley would want to know how fred and george were financing their joke shop business when as was inevitable they finally found out about it giving the twins his triwizard winnings had seemed a simple thing to do at the time but what if it led to another family row and a estrangement would mrs weasley still feel that harry was as good as her son if she found out he had made it possible for fred and george to start a career she thought quite unsuitable 
 
 standing where the twins had left him with nothing but a guilty weight in the pit of his stomach for company harry caught the sound of his own name kingsley deep voice was audible even over the surrounding chatter 
 
 why dumbledore make potter a prefect said kingsley 
 
 have had his reasons replied lupin 
 
 but it shown confidence in him what done persisted kingsley specially with the daily prophet having a go at him every few days 
 
 harry did not look round he did not want lupin or kingsley to know he had heard though not remotely hungry he followed mundungus back towards the table his pleasure in the party had evaporated as quickly as it had come he wished he were upstairs in bed 
 
 moody was sniffing at a chicken leg with what remained of his nose evidently he could not detect any trace of poison because he then tore a strip off it with his teeth 
 
 the made of spanish oak with varnish and vibration control ron was saying to tonks 
 
 mrs weasley yawned widely 
 
 well i think sort out that boggart before i turn in arthur i want this lot up too late all right night harry dear 
 
 she left the kitchen harry set down his plate and wondered whether he could follow her without attracting attention 
 
 you all right potter grunted moody 
 
 yeah fine lied harry 
 
 moody took a swig from his hipflask his eye staring sideways at harry 
 
 come here got something that might interest you he said 
 
 from an inner pocket of his robes moody pulled a very tattered old wizarding photograph 
 
 original order of the phoenix growled moody found it last night when i was looking for my spare invisibility cloak seeing as podmore had the manners to return my best one thought people might like to see it 
 
 harry took the photograph a small crowd of people some waving at him others lifting their glasses looked back up at him 
 
 me said moody unnecessarily pointing at himself the moody in the picture was unmistakeable though his hair was slightly less grey and his nose was intact and dumbledore beside me dedalus diggle on the other side marlene mckinnon she was killed two weeks after this was taken they got her whole family frank and alice longbottom 
 
 stomach already uncomfortable clenched as he looked at alice longbottom he knew her round friendly face very well even though he had never met her because she was the image of her son neville 
 
 poor devils growled moody better dead than what happened to them and emmeline vance met her and that lupin obviously benjy fenwick he copped it too we only ever found bits of him shift aside there he added poking the picture and the little photographic people edged sideways so that those who were partially obscured could move to the front 
 
 edgar bones brother of amelia bones they got him and his family too he was a great wizard sturgis podmore blimey he looks young caradoc dearborn vanished six months after this we never found his body hagrid of course looks exactly the same as ever elphias doge met him forgotten he used to wear that stupid hat gideon prewett it took five death eaters to kill him and his brother fabian they fought like heroes budge along budge along 
 
 the little people in the photograph jostled among themselves and those hidden right at the back appeared at the forefront of the picture 
 
 brother aberforth only time i ever met him strange bloke dorcas meadowes voldemort killed her personally sirius when he still had short hair and there you go thought that would interest you 
 
 heart turned over his mother and father were beaming up at him sitting on either side of a small man whom harry recognised at once as wormtail the one who had betrayed his parents whereabouts to voldemort and so helped to bring about their deaths 
 
 eh said moody 
 
 harry looked up into moody s heavily scarred and pitted face evidently moody was under the impression he had just given harry a bit of a treat 
 
 yeah said harry once again attempting to grin er listen just remembered i packed my 
 
 he was spared the trouble of inventing an object he had not packed sirius had just said that got there and moody had turned towards him harry crossed the kitchen slipped through the door and up the stairs before anyone could call him back 
 
 he did not know why it had been such a shock he had seen pictures of his parents before after all and he had met wormtail but to have them sprung on him like that when he was least expecting it no one would like that he thought angrily 
 
 and then to see them surrounded by all those other happy faces benjy fenwick who had been found in bits and gideon prewett who had died like a hero and the longbottoms who had been tortured into madness all waving happily out of the photograph forever more not knowing that they were doomed well moody might find that interesting he harry found it disturbing 
 
 harry tiptoed up the stairs in the hall past the stuffed glad to be on his own again but as he approached the first landing he heard noises someone was sobbing in the drawing room 
 
 hello harry said 
 
 there was no answer but the sobbing continued he climbed the remaining stairs two at a time walked across the landing and opened the door 
 
 someone was cowering against the dark wall her wand in her hand her whole body shaking with sobs sprawled on the dusty old carpet in a patch of moonlight clearly dead was ron 
 
 all the air seemed to vanish from lungs he felt as though he were falling through the floor his brain turned icy coldron dead no it be 
 
 but wait a moment it be ron was downstairs 
 
 mrs weasley harry croaked 
 
 mrs weasley sobbed pointing her shaking wand at body 
 
 crack 
 
 body turned into on his back his eyes wide open and empty mrs weasley sobbed harder than ever 
 
 she sobbed again 
 
 crack 
 
 mr body replaced his glasses askew a trickle of blood running down his face 
 
 no mrs weasley moaned no riddikulus riddikulus riddikulus 
 
 crack dead twins crack dead percy crack dead harry 
 
 mrs weasley just get out of here shouted harry staring down at his own dead body on the floor let someone else 
 
 going on 
 
 lupin had come running into the room closely followed by sirius with moody stumping along behind them lupin looked from mrs weasley to the dead harry on the floor and seemed to understand in an instant pulling out his own wand he said very firmly and clearly riddikulus 
 
 body vanished a silvery orb hung in the air over the spot where it had lain lupin waved his wand once more and the orb vanished in a puff of smoke 
 
 ohohoh gulped mrs weasley and she broke into a storm of crying her face in her hands 
 
 molly said lupin bleakly walking over to her molly 
 
 next second she was sobbing her heart out on shoulder 
 
 molly it was just a boggart he said soothingly patting her on the head just a stupid boggart 
 
 i see them all the time mrs weasley moaned into his shoulder all the i about it 
 
 sirius was staring at the patch of carpet where the boggart pretending to be body had lain moody was looking at harry who avoided his gaze he had a funny feeling magical eye had followed him all the way out of the kitchen 
 
 tell arthur mrs weasley was gulping now mopping her eyes frantically with her cuffs i want him to know being silly 
 
 lupin handed her a handkerchief and she blew her nose 
 
 harry so sorry what must you think of me she said shakily not even able to get rid of a boggart 
 
 be stupid said harry trying to smile 
 
 just worried she said tears spilling out of her eyes again half the in the order a miracle if we all come through this and not talking to us what if something happens and never it up with him and going to happen if arthur and i get killed to look after ron and ginny 
 
 molly enough said lupin firmly this like last time the order are better prepared got a head start we know what up to 
 
 mrs weasley gave a little squeak of fright at the sound of the name 
 
 oh molly come on about time you got used to hearing his namelook i promise no going to get hurt nobody can promise that but much better off than we were last time you in the order then you understand last time we were outnumbered twenty to one by the death eaters and they were picking us off one by one 
 
 harry thought of the photograph again of his parents beaming faces he knew moody was still watching him 
 
 worry about percy said sirius abruptly come round only a matter of time before voldemort moves into the open once he does the whole going to be begging us to forgive them and not sure be accepting their apology he added bitterly 
 
 and as for going to look after ron and ginny if you and arthur died said lupin smiling slightly what do you think do let them starve 
 
 mrs weasley smiled tremulously 
 
 being silly she muttered again mopping her eyes 
 
 but harry closing his bedroom door behind him some ten minutes later could not think mrs weasley silly he could still see his parents beaming up at him from the battered old photograph unaware that their lives like so many of those around them were drawing to a close the image of the boggart posing as the corpse of each member of mrs family in turn kept flashing before his eyes 
 
 without warning the scar on his forehead seared with pain again and his stomach churned horribly 
 
 cut it out he said firmly rubbing the scar as the pain receded 
 
 first sign of madness talking to your own head said a sly voice from the empty picture on the wall 
 
 harry ignored it he felt older than he had ever felt in his life and it seemed extraordinary to him that barely an hour ago he had been worried about a joke shop and who had got a badge 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the order of the phoenix 
 

lionfish nov chapter nine the woes of mrs weasleycontents prev chapter next chapter 
 abrupt departure took harry completely by surprise he remained sitting where he was in the chained chair struggling with his feelings of shock and relief the wizengamot were all getting to their feet talking gathering up their papers and packing them away harry stood up nobody seemed to be paying him the slightest bit of attention except the toadlike witch on right who was now gazing down at him instead of at dumbledore ignoring her he tried to catch eye or madam wanting to ask whether he was free to go but fudge seemed quite determined not to notice harry and madam bones was busy with her briefcase so he took a lew tentative steps towards the exit and when nobody called him back broke into a very fast walk 
 
 he took the last lew steps at a run wrenched open the door and almost collided with mr weasley who was standing right outside looking pale and apprehensive 
 
 dumbledore say 
 
 cleared harry said pulling the door closed behind him of all charges 
 
 beaming mr weasley seized harry by the shoulders 
 
 harry wonderful well of course they have found you guilty not on the evidence but even so i pretend i 
 
 but mr weasley broke off because the courtroom door had ust opened again the wizengamot were filing out 
 
 beard exclaimed mr weasley wonderingly pulling harry aside to let them all pass you were tried by the full court 
 
 i think so said harry quietly 
 
 one or two of the wizards nodded to harry as they passed and a few including madam bones said morning arthur to mr weasley but most averted their eyes cornelius fudge and the toadlike witch were almost the last to leave the dungeon fudge acted as though mr weasley and harry were part of the wall but again the witch looked almost appraisingly at harry as she passed last of all to pass was percy like fudge he completely ignored his father and harry he marched past clutching a large roll of parchment and a handful of spare quills his back rigid and his nose in the air the lines around mr mouth tightened slightly but other than this he gave no sign that he had seen his third son 
 
 going to take you straight back so you can tell the others the good news he said beckoning harry forwards as heels disappeared up the steps to level nine drop you off on the way to that toilet in bethnal green come on 
 
 so what will you have to do about the toilet harry asked grinning everything suddenly seemed five times funnier than usual it was starting to sink in he was cleared he was going back to hogwarts 
 
 oh a simple enough said mr weasley as they mounted the stairs but not so much having to repair the damage more the attitude behind the vandalism harry might strike some wizards as funny but an expression of something much deeper and nastier and i for one 
 
 mr weasley broke off in they had just reached the corridor and cornelius fudge was standing a few feet away from them talking quietly to a tall man with sleek blond hair and a pointed pale face 
 
 the second man turned at the sound of their footsteps he too broke off in his cold grey eyes narrowed and fixed upon face 
 
 well well well patronus potter said lucius malfoy coolly 
 
 harry felt winded as though he had just walked into something solid he had last seen those cold grey eyes through slits in a death hood and last heard that voice jeering in a dark graveyard while lord voldemort tortured him harry could not believe that lucius malfoy dared look him in the face he could not believe that he was here in the ministry of magic or that cornelius fudge was talking to him when harry had told fudge mere weeks ago that malfoy was a death eater 
 
 the minister was just telling me about your lucky escape potter drawled mr malfoy quite astonishing the way you continue to wriggle out of very tight holes snakelike in fact 
 
 mr weasley gripped shoulder in warning 
 
 yeah said harry yeah good at escaping 
 
 lucius malfoy raised his eyes to mr face 
 
 and arthur weasley too what are you doing here arthur 
 
 i work here said mr weasley curtly 
 
 not here surely said mr malfoy raising his eyebrows and glancing towards the door over mr shoulder i thought you were up on the second floor you do something that involves sneaking muggle artefacts home and bewitching them 
 
 no mr weasley snapped his fingers now biting into shoulder 
 
 what areyou doing here anyway harry asked lucius malfoy 
 
 i think private matters between myself and the minister are any concern of yours potter said malfoy smoothing the front of his robes harry distinctly heard the gentle clinking of what sounded like a full pocket of gold really just because you are favourite boy you must not expect the same indulgence from the rest of us shall we go up to your office then minister 
 
 certainly said fudge turning his back on harry and mr weasley this way lucius 
 
 they strode off together talking in low voices mr weasley did not let go of shoulder until they had disappeared into the lift 
 
 why he waiting outside office if got business to do together harry burst out furiously what was he doing down here 
 
 trying to sneak down to the courtroom if you ask me said mr weasley looking extremely agitated and glancing over his shoulder as though making sure they could not be overheard trying to find out whether been expelled or not leave a note for dumbledore when i drop you off he ought to know been talking to fudge again 
 
 what private business have they got together anyway 
 
 gold i expect said mr weasley angrily been giving generously to all sorts of things for years gets him in with the right people then he can ask favours delay laws he want passed oh very lucius malfoy 
 
 the lift arrived it was empty except for a flock of memos that flapped around mr head as he pressed the button for the atrium and the doors clanged shut he waved them away irritably 
 
 mr weasley said harry slowly if fudge is meeting death eaters like malfoy if seeing them alone how do we know they put the imperius curse on him 
 
 think it occurred to us harry said mr weasley quietly but dumbledore thinks fudge is acting of his own accord at the momentwhich as dumbledore says is not a lot of comfort best not talk about it any more just now harry 
 
 the doors slid open and they stepped out into the now atrium eric the watchwizard was hidden behind his daily prophet again they had walked straight past the golden fountain before harry remembered 
 
 wait he told mr weasley and pulling his moneybag from his pocket he turned back to the fountain 
 
 he looked up into the handsome face but up close harry thought he looked rather weak and foolish the witch was wearing a vapid smile like a beauty contestant and from what harry knew of goblins and centaurs they were most unlikely to be caught staring so soppily at humans of any description only the attitude of creeping servility looked convincing with a grin at the thought of what hermione would say if she could see the statue of the elf harry turned his moneybag and emptied not just ten galleons but the whole contents into the pool at the statues feet 
 
 i knew it yelled ron punching the air you always get away with stuff 
 
 they were bound to clear you said hermione who had looked positively faint with anxiety when harry had entered the kitchen and was now holding a shaking hand over her eyes there was no case against you none at all 
 
 everyone seems quite relieved though considering you all knew get off said harry smiling 
 
 mrs weasley was wiping her face on her apron and fred george and ginny were doing a kind of war dance to a chant that went he got off he got off he got off 
 
 enough settle down shouted mr weasley though he too was smiling listen sirius lucius malfoy was at the ministry 
 
 what said sirius sharply 
 
 he got off he got off he got off 
 
 be quiet you three yes we saw him talking to fudge on level nine then they went up to office together dumbledore ought to know 
 
 absolutely said sirius tell him worry 
 
 well better get going a vomiting toilet waiting for me in bethnal green molly be late covering for tonks but kingsley might be dropping in for dinner 
 
 he got off he got off he got off 
 
 enoughfredgeorgeginny said mrs weasley as mr weasley left the kitchen harry dear come and sit down have some lunch you hardly ate breakfast 
 
 ron and hermione sat themselves down opposite him looking happier than they had done since he had first arrived at grimmauld place and feeling of giddy relief which had been somewhat dented by his encounter with lucius malfoy swelled again the gloomy house seemed warmer and more welcoming all of a sudden even kreacher looked less ugly as he poked his snoutlike nose into the kitchen to investigate the source of all the noise 
 
 course once dumbledore turned up on your side there was no way they were going to convict you said ron happily now dishing great mounds of mashed potato on to plates 
 
 yeah he swung it for me said harry he felt it would sound highly ungrateful not to mention childish to say i wish talked to me though or even looked at me 
 
 and as he thought this the scar on his forehead burned so badly that he clapped his hand to it 
 
 up said hermione looking alarmed 
 
 scar harry mumbled but nothing it happens all the time now 
 
 none of the others had noticed a thing all of them were now helping themselves to food while gloating over narrow escape fred george and ginny were still singing hermione looked rather anxious but before she could say anything ron had said happily i bet dumbledore turns up this evening to celebrate with us you know 
 
 i think be able to ron said mrs weasley setting a huge plate of roast chicken down in front of harry really very busy at the moment 
 
 he got off he got off he got off 
 
 shut up roared mrs weasley 
 
 over the next few days harry could not help noticing that there was one person within number twelve grimmauld place who did not seem wholly overjoyed that he would be returning to hogwarts sirius had put up a very good show of happiness on first hearing the news wringing hand and beaming just like the rest of them soon however he was moodier and surlier than before talking less to everybody even harry and spending increasing amounts of time shut up in his room with buckbeak 
 
 you go feeling guilty said hermione sternly after harry had confided some of his feelings to her and ron while they scrubbed out a mouldy cupboard on the third floor a few days later you belong at hogwarts and sirius knows it personally i think being selfish 
 
 a bit harsh hermione said ron frowning as he attempted to prise off a bit of mould that had attached itself firmly to his finger you want to be stuck inside this house without any company 
 
 have company said hermione headquarters to the order of the phoenix it he just got his hopes up that harry would be coming to live here with him 
 
 i think true said harry wringing out his cloth he give me a straight answer when i asked him if i could 
 
 he just want to get his own hopes up even more said hermione wisely and he probably felt a bit guilty himself because i think a part of him was really hoping be expelled then both be outcasts together 
 
 come off it said harry and ron together but hermione merely shrugged 
 
 suit yourselves but i sometimes think right and sirius gets confused about whether you or your father harry 
 
 so you think touched in the head said harry heatedly 
 
 no i just think been very lonely for a long time said hermione simply 
 
 at this point mrs weasley entered the bedroom behind them 
 
 still not finished she said poking her head into the cupboard 
 
 i thought you might be here to tell us to have a break said ron bitterly know how much mould got rid of since we arrived here 
 
 you were so keen to help the order said mrs weasley you can do your bit by making headquarters fit to live in 
 
 i feel like a grumbled ron 
 
 well now you understand what dreadful lives they lead perhaps be a bit more active in said hermione hopefully as mrs weasley left them to it you know maybe it be a bad idea to show people exactly how horrible it is to clean all the timewe could do a sponsored scrub of gryffindor common room all proceeds to it would raise awareness as well as funds 
 
 sponsor you to shut up about spew ron muttered irritably but only so harry could hear him 
 
 harry found himself daydreaming about hogwarts more and more as the end of the holidays approached he could not wait to see hagrid again to play quidditch even to stroll across the vegetable patches to the herbology greenhouses it would be a treat just to leave this dusty musty house where half of the cupboards were still bolted shut and kreacher wheezed insults out of the shadows as you passed though harry was careful not to say any of this within earshot of sirius 
 
 the fact was that living at the headquarters of the movement was not nearly as interesting or exciting as harry would have expected before experienced it though members of the order of the phoenix came and went regularly sometimes staying for meals sometimes only for a few minutes of whispered conversation mrs weasley made sure that harry and the others were kept well out of earshot whether extendable or normal and nobody not even sirius seemed to feel that harry needed to know anything more than he had heard on the night of his arrival 
 
 on the very last day of the holidays harry was sweeping up owl droppings from the top of the wardrobe when ron entered their bedroom carrying a couple of envelopes 
 
 booklists have arrived he said throwing one of the envelopes up to harry who was standing on a chair about time i thought forgotten they usually come much earlier than this 
 
 harry swept the last of the droppings into a rubbish bag and threw the bag over head into the wastepaper basket in the corner which swallowed it and belched loudly he then opened his letter it contained two pieces of parchment one the usual reminder that term started on the first of september the other telling him which books he would need for the coming year 
 
 only two new ones he said reading the list the standard book of spells grade by miranda goshawk and defensive magical theory by wilbert slinkhard 
 
 crack 
 
 fred and george apparated right beside harry he was so used to them doing this by now that he even fall off his chair 
 
 we were just wondering who assigned the slinkhard book said fred conversationally 
 
 because it means found a new defence against the dark arts teacher said george 
 
 and about time too said fred 
 
 what mean harry asked jumping down beside them 
 
 well we overheard mum and dad talking on the extendable ears a few weeks back fred told harry and from what they were saying dumbledore was having real trouble finding anyone to do the job this year 
 
 not surprising is it when you look at happened to the last four said george 
 
 one sacked one dead memory removed and one locked in a trunk for nine months said harry counting them off on his fingers yeah i see what you mean 
 
 up with you ron asked fred 
 
 ron did not answer harry looked round ron was standing very still with his mouth slightly open gaping at his letter from hogwarts 
 
 the matter said fred impatiently moving around ron to look over his shoulder at the parchment 
 
 mouth fell open too 
 
 prefect he said staring incredulously at the letter prefect 
 
 george leapt forward seized the envelope in other hand and turned it harry saw something scarlet and gold fall into palm 
 
 no way said george in a hushed voice 
 
 been a mistake said fred snatching the letter out of grasp and holding it up to the light as though checking for a watermark no one in their right mind would make ron a prefect 
 
 the twins heads turned in unison and both of them stared at harry 
 
 we thought you were a cert said fred in a tone that suggested harry had tricked them in some way 
 
 we thought dumbledore was bound to pick you said george indignantly 
 
 winning the triwizard and everything said fred 
 
 i suppose all the mad stuff counted against him said george to fred 
 
 yeah said fred slowly yeah caused too much trouble mate well at least one of got their priorities right 
 
 he strode over to harry and clapped him on the back while giving ron a scathing look 
 
 prefect ickle ronnie the prefect 
 
 oh going to be revolting groaned george thrusting the prefect badge back at ron as though it might contaminate him 
 
 ron who still had not said a word took the badge stared at it for a moment then held it out to harry as though asking mutely for confirmation that it was genuine harry took it a large p was superimposed on the gryffindor lion he had seen a badge just like this on chest on his very first day at hogwarts 
 
 the door banged open hermione came tearing into the room her cheeks flushed and her hair flying there was an envelope in her hand 
 
 did youdid you get 
 
 she spotted the badge in hand and let out a shriek 
 
 i knew it she said excitedly brandishing her letter me too harry me too 
 
 no said harry quickly pushing the badge back into hand ron not me 
 
 itwhat 
 
 prefect not me harry said 
 
 ron said hermione her jaw dropping but are you sure i mean 
 
 she turned red as ron looked round at her with a defiant expression on his lace 
 
 my name on the letter he said 
 
 i said hermione looking thoroughly bewildered i well wow well done ron really 
 
 unexpected said george nodding 
 
 no said hermione blushing harder than ever no not done loads of really 
 
 the door behind her opened a little wider and mrs weasley backed into the room carrying a pile of freshly laundered robes 
 
 ginny said the booklists had come at last she said glancing around at all the envelopes as she made her way over to the bed and started sorting the robes into two piles if you give them to me take them over to diagon alley this afternoon and get your books while packing ron have to get you more pyjamas these are at least six inches too short i believe how fast growing what colour would you like 
 
 get him red and gold to match his badge said george smirking 
 
 match his what said mrs weasley absently rolling up a pair of maroon socks and placing them on pile 
 
 his badge said fred with the air of getting the worst over quickly his lovely shiny new badge 
 
 words took a moment to penetrate mrs preoccupation with pyjamas 
 
 his but ron not 
 
 ron held up his badge 
 
 mrs weasley let out a shriek just like 
 
 i believe it i believe it oh ron how wonderful a prefect everyone in the family 
 
 what are fred and i neighbours said george indignantly as his mother pushed him aside and flung her arms around her youngest son 
 
 wait until your father hears ron so proud of you what wonderful news you could end up head boy just like bill and percy the first step oh what a thing to happen in the middle of all this worry just thrilled oh ronnie 
 
 fred and george were both making loud retching noises behind her back but mrs weasley did not notice arms tight around neck she was kissing him all over his face which had turned a brighter scarlet than his badge 
 
 mum mum get a grip he muttered trying to push her away 
 
 she let go of him and said breathlessly well what will it be we gave percy an owl but already got one of course 
 
 do you mean said ron looking as though he did not dare believe his ears 
 
 got to have a reward for this said mrs weasley fondly how about a nice new set of dress robes 
 
 already bought him some said fred sourly who looked as though he sincerely regretted this generosity 
 
 or a new cauldron old rusting through or a new rat you always liked scabbers 
 
 mum said ron hopefully can i have a new broom 
 
 mrs face fell slightly broomsticks were expensive 
 
 not a really good one ron hastened to add justjust a new one for a change 
 
 mrs weasley hesitated then smiled 
 
 of course you can well better get going if got a broom to buy too see you all later little ronnie a prefect and forget to pack your trunks a prefect oh all of a dither 
 
 she gave ron yet another kiss on the cheek sniffed loudly and bustled from the room 
 
 fred and george exchanged looks 
 
 you mind if we kiss you do you ron said fred in a falsely anxious voice 
 
 we could curtsey if you like said george 
 
 oh shut up said ron scowling at them 
 
 or what said fred an evil grin spreading across his face going to put us in detention 
 
 love to see him try sniggered george 
 
 he could if you watch out said hermione angrily 
 
 fred and george burst out laughing and ron muttered drop it hermione 
 
 going to have to watch our step george said fred pretending to tremble with these two on our case 
 
 yeah it looks like our days are finally over said george shaking his head 
 
 and with another loud crack the twins disapparated 
 
 those two said hermione furiously staring up at the ceiling through which they could now hear fred and george roaring with laughter in the room upstairs pay any attention to them ron only jealous 
 
 i think they are said ron doubtfully also looking up at the ceiling always said only prats become prefects still he added on a happier note never had new brooms i wish i could go with mum and choose never be able to afford a nimbus but the new cleansweep out be great yeah i think go and tell her i like the cleansweep just so she knows 
 
 he dashed from the room leaving harry and hermione alone 
 
 for some reason harry found he did not want to look at hermione he turned to his bed picked up the pile of clean robes mrs weasley had laid on it and crossed the room to his trunk 
 
 harry said hermione tentatively 
 
 well done hermione said harry so heartily it did not sound like his voice at all and still not looking at her brilliant prefect great 
 
 thanks said hermione ermharrycould i borrow hedwig so i can tell mum and dad be really pleasedi mean prefect is something they can understand 
 
 yeah no problem said harry still in the horrible hearty voice that did not belong to him take her 
 
 he leaned over his trunk laid the robes on the bottom of it and pretended to be rummaging for something while hermione crossed to the wardrobe and called hedwig down a few moments passed harry heard the door close but remained bent double listening the only sounds he could hear were the blank picture on the wall sniggering again and the wastepaper basket in the corner coughing up the owl droppings 
 
 he straightened up and looked behind him hermione had left and hedwig had gone harry hurried across the room closed the door then returned slowly to his bed and sank on to it gazing unseeingly at the foot of the wardrobe 
 
 he had forgotten completely about prefects being chosen in the fifth year he had been too anxious about the possibility of being expelled to spare a thought for the fact that badges must be winging their way towards certain people but if he had remembered if he had thought about it what would he have expected 
 
 not this said a small and truthful voice inside his head 
 
 harry screwed up his face and buried it in his hands he could not lie to himself if he had known the prefect badge was on its way he would have expected it to come to him not ron did this make him as arrogant as draco malfoy did he think himself superior to everyone else did he really believe he was better than ron 
 
 no said the small voice defiantly 
 
 was that true harry wondered anxiously probing his own feelings 
 
 better at quidditch said the voice but not better at anything else 
 
 that was definitely true harry thought he was no better than ron in lessons but what about outside lessons what about those adventures he ron and hermione had had together since starting at hogwarts often risking much worse than expulsion 
 
 well ron and hermione were with me most of the time said the voice in head 
 
 not all the time though harry argued with himself they fight quirrell with me they take on riddle and the basilisk they get rid of all those dementors the night sirius escaped they in that graveyard with me the night voldemort returned 
 
 and the same feeling of that had overwhelmed him on the night he had arrived rose again definitely done more harry thought indignantly done more than either of them 
 
 but maybe said the small voice fairly maybe dumbledore choose prefects because got themselves into a load of dangerous situations maybe he chooses them for other reasons ron must have something you 
 
 harry opened his eyes and stared through his fingers at the clawed feet remembering what fred had said 
 
 no one in their right mind would make ron a prefect 
 
 harry gave a small snort of laughter a second later he felt sickened with himself 
 
 ron had not asked dumbledore to give him the prefect badge this was not fault was he harry best friend in the world going to sulk because he have a badge laugh with the twins behind back ruin this for ron when for the first time he had beaten harry at something 
 
 at this point harry heard footsteps on the stairs again he stood up straightened his glasses and hitched a grin on to his face as ron bounded back through the door 
 
 just caught her he said happily she says get the cleansweep if she can 
 
 cool harry said and he was relieved to hear that his voice had stopped sounding hearty listenronwell done mate 
 
 the smile faded off face 
 
 i never thought it would be me he said shaking his head i thought it would be you 
 
 nah caused too much trouble harry said echoing fred 
 
 yeah said ron yeah i suppose well better get our trunks packed we 
 
 it was odd how widely their possessions seemed to have scattered themselves since they had arrived it took them most of the afternoon to retrieve their books and belongings from all over the house and stow them back inside their school trunks marry noticed that ron kept moving his badge around first placing it on his bedside table then putting it into his jeans pocket then taking it out and lying it on his folded robes as though to see the effect of the red on the black only when fred and george dropped in and offered to attach it to his forehead with a permanent sticking charm did he wrap it tenderly in his maroon socks and lock it in his trunk 
 
 mrs weasley returned from diagon alley around six laden with books and carrying a long package wrapped in thick brown paper that ron took from her with a moan of longing 
 
 never mind unwrapping it now people are arriving for dinner i want you all downstairs she said but the moment she was out of sight ron ripped off the paper in a frenzy and examined every inch of his new broom an ecstatic expression on his face 
 
 down in the basement mrs weasley had hung a scarlet banner over the heavily laden dinner table which read congratulations ron and hermionenew prefects she looked in a better mood than harry had seen her all holiday 
 
 i thought have a little party not a dinner she told harry ron hermione fred george and ginny as they entered the room your father and bill are on their way ron sent them both owls and thrilled she added beaming 
 
 fred rolled his eyes 
 
 sirius lupin tonks and kingsley shacklebolt were already there and moody stumped in shortly after harry had got himself a butterbeer 
 
 oh alastor i am glad here said mrs weasley brightly as shrugged off his travelling cloak been wanting to ask you for agescould you have a look in the writing desk in the drawing room and tell us inside it we wanted to open it just in case something really nasty 
 
 no problem molly 
 
 eye swivelled upwards and stared fixedly through the ceiling of the kitchen 
 
 drawing room he growled as the pupil contracted desk in the corner yeah i see it yeah a boggart want me to go up and get rid of it molly 
 
 no no do it myself later beamed mrs weasley you have your drink having a little bit of a celebration actually she gestured at the scarlet banner fourth prefect in the family she said fondly ruffling hair 
 
 prefect eh growled moody his normal eye on ron and his magical eye swivelling around to gaze into the side of his head harry had the very uncomfortable feeling it was looking at him and moved away towards sirius and lupin 
 
 well congratulations said moody still glaring at ron with his normal eye authority figures always attract trouble but i suppose dumbledore thinks you can withstand most major jinxes or he have appointed you 
 
 ron looked rather startled at this view of the matter but was saved the trouble of responding by the arrival of his father and eldest brother mrs weasley was in such a good mood she did not even complain that they had brought mundungus with them he was wearing a long overcoat that seemed oddly lumpy in unlikely places and declined the offer to remove it and put it with travelling cloak 
 
 well i think a toast is in order said mr weasley when everyone had a drink he raised his goblet to ron and hermione the new gryffindor prefects 
 
 ron and hermione beamed as everyone drank to them and then applauded 
 
 i was never a prefect myself said tonks brightly from behind harry as everybody moved towards the table to help themselves to food her hair was tomato red and today she looked like older sister my head of house said i lacked certain necessary qualities 
 
 like what said ginny who was choosing a baked potato 
 
 like the ability to behave myself said tonks 
 
 ginny laughed hermione looked as though she did not know whether to smile or not and compromised by taking an extra large gulp of butterbeer and choking on it 
 
 what about you sirius ginny asked thumping hermione on the back 
 
 sirius who was right beside harry let out his usual laugh 
 
 no one would have made me a prefect i spent too much time in detention with james lupin was the good boy he got the badge 
 
 i think dumbledore might have hoped i would be able to exercise some control over my best friends said lupin i need scarcely say that i failed dismally 
 
 mood suddenly lifted his father had not been a prefect either all at once the party seemed much more enjoyable he loaded up his plate feeling doubly fond of everyone in the room 
 
 ron was rhapsodising about his new broom to anybody who would listen 
 
 nought to seventy in ten seconds not bad is it when you think the comet two only nought to sixty and with a decent tailwind according to which broomstick 
 
 hermione was talking very earnestly to lupin about her view of elf rights 
 
 i mean the same kind of nonsense as werewolf segregation it it all stems from this horrible thing wizards have of thinking superior to other creatures 
 
 mrs weasley and bill were having their usual argument about hair 
 
 getting really out of hand and so it would look much better shorter it harry 
 
 ohi dunno said harry slightly alarmed at being asked his opinion he slid away from them in the direction of fred and george who were huddled in a corner with mundungus 
 
 mundungus stopped talking when he saw harry but fred winked and beckoned harry closer 
 
 ok he told mundungus we can trust harry our financial backer 
 
 look what got us said george holding out his hand to harry it was full of what looked like shrivelled black pods a faint rattling noise was coming from them even though they were completely stationary 
 
 venomous tentacula seeds said george we need them for the skiving snackboxes but a class c substance so been having a bit of trouble getting hold of them 
 
 ten galleons the lot then dung said fred 
 
 wiv all the trouble i went to to get em said mundungus his saggy bloodshot eyes stretching even wider sorry lads but not taking a knut under twenty 
 
 dung likes his little joke fred said to harry 
 
 yeah his best one so far has been six sickles for a bag of knarl quills said george 
 
 be careful harry warned them quietly 
 
 what said fred busy cooing over prefect ron okay 
 
 but moody could have his eye on you harry pointed out 
 
 mundungus looked nervously over his shoulder 
 
 good point that he grunted all right lads ten it is if take em quick 
 
 cheers harry said fred delightedly when mundungus had emptied his pockets into the twins outstretched hands and scuttled off towards the food better get these upstairs 
 
 harry watched them go feeling slightly uneasy it had just occurred to him that mr and mrs weasley would want to know how fred and george were financing their joke shop business when as was inevitable they finally found out about it giving the twins his triwizard winnings had seemed a simple thing to do at the time but what if it led to another family row and a estrangement would mrs weasley still feel that harry was as good as her son if she found out he had made it possible for fred and george to start a career she thought quite unsuitable 
 
 standing where the twins had left him with nothing but a guilty weight in the pit of his stomach for company harry caught the sound of his own name kingsley deep voice was audible even over the surrounding chatter 
 
 why dumbledore make potter a prefect said kingsley 
 
 have had his reasons replied lupin 
 
 but it shown confidence in him what done persisted kingsley specially with the daily prophet having a go at him every few days 
 
 harry did not look round he did not want lupin or kingsley to know he had heard though not remotely hungry he followed mundungus back towards the table his pleasure in the party had evaporated as quickly as it had come he wished he were upstairs in bed 
 
 moody was sniffing at a chicken leg with what remained of his nose evidently he could not detect any trace of poison because he then tore a strip off it with his teeth 
 
 the made of spanish oak with varnish and vibration control ron was saying to tonks 
 
 mrs weasley yawned widely 
 
 well i think sort out that boggart before i turn in arthur i want this lot up too late all right night harry dear 
 
 she left the kitchen harry set down his plate and wondered whether he could follow her without attracting attention 
 
 you all right potter grunted moody 
 
 yeah fine lied harry 
 
 moody took a swig from his hipflask his eye staring sideways at harry 
 
 come here got something that might interest you he said 
 
 from an inner pocket of his robes moody pulled a very tattered old wizarding photograph 
 
 original order of the phoenix growled moody found it last night when i was looking for my spare invisibility cloak seeing as podmore had the manners to return my best one thought people might like to see it 
 
 harry took the photograph a small crowd of people some waving at him others lifting their glasses looked back up at him 
 
 me said moody unnecessarily pointing at himself the moody in the picture was unmistakeable though his hair was slightly less grey and his nose was intact and dumbledore beside me dedalus diggle on the other side marlene mckinnon she was killed two weeks after this was taken they got her whole family frank and alice longbottom 
 
 stomach already uncomfortable clenched as he looked at alice longbottom he knew her round friendly face very well even though he had never met her because she was the image of her son neville 
 
 poor devils growled moody better dead than what happened to them and emmeline vance met her and that lupin obviously benjy fenwick he copped it too we only ever found bits of him shift aside there he added poking the picture and the little photographic people edged sideways so that those who were partially obscured could move to the front 
 
 edgar bones brother of amelia bones they got him and his family too he was a great wizard sturgis podmore blimey he looks young caradoc dearborn vanished six months after this we never found his body hagrid of course looks exactly the same as ever elphias doge met him forgotten he used to wear that stupid hat gideon prewett it took five death eaters to kill him and his brother fabian they fought like heroes budge along budge along 
 
 the little people in the photograph jostled among themselves and those hidden right at the back appeared at the forefront of the picture 
 
 brother aberforth only time i ever met him strange bloke dorcas meadowes voldemort killed her personally sirius when he still had short hair and there you go thought that would interest you 
 
 heart turned over his mother and father were beaming up at him sitting on either side of a small man whom harry recognised at once as wormtail the one who had betrayed his parents whereabouts to voldemort and so helped to bring about their deaths 
 
 eh said moody 
 
 harry looked up into moody s heavily scarred and pitted face evidently moody was under the impression he had just given harry a bit of a treat 
 
 yeah said harry once again attempting to grin er listen just remembered i packed my 
 
 he was spared the trouble of inventing an object he had not packed sirius had just said that got there and moody had turned towards him harry crossed the kitchen slipped through the door and up the stairs before anyone could call him back 
 
 he did not know why it had been such a shock he had seen pictures of his parents before after all and he had met wormtail but to have them sprung on him like that when he was least expecting it no one would like that he thought angrily 
 
 and then to see them surrounded by all those other happy faces benjy fenwick who had been found in bits and gideon prewett who had died like a hero and the longbottoms who had been tortured into madness all waving happily out of the photograph forever more not knowing that they were doomed well moody might find that interesting he harry found it disturbing 
 
 harry tiptoed up the stairs in the hall past the stuffed glad to be on his own again but as he approached the first landing he heard noises someone was sobbing in the drawing room 
 
 hello harry said 
 
 there was no answer but the sobbing continued he climbed the remaining stairs two at a time walked across the landing and opened the door 
 
 someone was cowering against the dark wall her wand in her hand her whole body shaking with sobs sprawled on the dusty old carpet in a patch of moonlight clearly dead was ron 
 
 all the air seemed to vanish from lungs he felt as though he were falling through the floor his brain turned icy coldron dead no it be 
 
 but wait a moment it be ron was downstairs 
 
 mrs weasley harry croaked 
 
 mrs weasley sobbed pointing her shaking wand at body 
 
 crack 
 
 body turned into on his back his eyes wide open and empty mrs weasley sobbed harder than ever 
 
 she sobbed again 
 
 crack 
 
 mr body replaced his glasses askew a trickle of blood running down his face 
 
 no mrs weasley moaned no riddikulus riddikulus riddikulus 
 
 crack dead twins crack dead percy crack dead harry 
 
 mrs weasley just get out of here shouted harry staring down at his own dead body on the floor let someone else 
 
 going on 
 
 lupin had come running into the room closely followed by sirius with moody stumping along behind them lupin looked from mrs weasley to the dead harry on the floor and seemed to understand in an instant pulling out his own wand he said very firmly and clearly riddikulus 
 
 body vanished a silvery orb hung in the air over the spot where it had lain lupin waved his wand once more and the orb vanished in a puff of smoke 
 
 ohohoh gulped mrs weasley and she broke into a storm of crying her face in her hands 
 
 molly said lupin bleakly walking over to her molly 
 
 next second she was sobbing her heart out on shoulder 
 
 molly it was just a boggart he said soothingly patting her on the head just a stupid boggart 
 
 i see them all the time mrs weasley moaned into his shoulder all the i about it 
 
 sirius was staring at the patch of carpet where the boggart pretending to be body had lain moody was looking at harry who avoided his gaze he had a funny feeling magical eye had followed him all the way out of the kitchen 
 
 tell arthur mrs weasley was gulping now mopping her eyes frantically with her cuffs i want him to know being silly 
 
 lupin handed her a handkerchief and she blew her nose 
 
 harry so sorry what must you think of me she said shakily not even able to get rid of a boggart 
 
 be stupid said harry trying to smile 
 
 just worried she said tears spilling out of her eyes again half the in the order a miracle if we all come through this and not talking to us what if something happens and never it up with him and going to happen if arthur and i get killed to look after ron and ginny 
 
 molly enough said lupin firmly this like last time the order are better prepared got a head start we know what up to 
 
 mrs weasley gave a little squeak of fright at the sound of the name 
 
 oh molly come on about time you got used to hearing his namelook i promise no going to get hurt nobody can promise that but much better off than we were last time you in the order then you understand last time we were outnumbered twenty to one by the death eaters and they were picking us off one by one 
 
 harry thought of the photograph again of his parents beaming faces he knew moody was still watching him 
 
 worry about percy said sirius abruptly come round only a matter of time before voldemort moves into the open once he does the whole going to be begging us to forgive them and not sure be accepting their apology he added bitterly 
 
 and as for going to look after ron and ginny if you and arthur died said lupin smiling slightly what do you think do let them starve 
 
 mrs weasley smiled tremulously 
 
 being silly she muttered again mopping her eyes 
 
 but harry closing his bedroom door behind him some ten minutes later could not think mrs weasley silly he could still see his parents beaming up at him from the battered old photograph unaware that their lives like so many of those around them were drawing to a close the image of the boggart posing as the corpse of each member of mrs family in turn kept flashing before his eyes 
 
 without warning the scar on his forehead seared with pain again and his stomach churned horribly 
 
 cut it out he said firmly rubbing the scar as the pain receded 
 
 first sign of madness talking to your own head said a sly voice from the empty picture on the wall 
 
 harry ignored it he felt older than he had ever felt in his life and it seemed extraordinary to him that barely an hour ago he had been worried about a joke shop and who had got a badge 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the order of the phoenix 
 

lionfish nov chapter nine the princecontents prev chapter next chapter 
 harry and ron met hermione in the common room before breakfast next morning hoping for some support in his theory harry lost no time in telling hermione what he had overheard malfoy saying on the hogwarts express 
 
 but he was obviously showing off for parkinson he interjected ron quickly before hermione could say anything 
 
 well she said uncertainly i know it would be like malfoy to make himself seem more important than he is but a big lie to tell 
 
 exactly said harry but he could nor press the point because so many people were trying to listen in to his conversation not to mention staring at him and whispering behind their hands 
 
 rude to point ron snapped at a particularly minuscule boy as they joined the queue to climb out of the portrait hole the boy who had been muttering something about harry behind his hand to his friend promptly turned scarlet and toppled out of the hole in alarm ron sniggered i love being a sixth year and going to be getting free time this year whole periods when we can just sit up here and relax 
 
 going to need that time for studying ron said hermione as they set off down the corridor 
 
 yeah but not today said ron going to be a real loss i reckon 
 
 hold it said hermione throwing out an arm and halting a passing fourth year who was attempting to push past her with a disk clutched tightly in his hand fanged frisbees banned hand it over she told him sternly the scowling boy handed over the snarling frisbee ducked under her arm and took off after his friends ron waited for him to vanish then tugged the frisbee from grip 
 
 excellent always wanted one of these 
 
 remonstration was drowned by a loud giggle lavender brown had apparently found remark highly amusing she continued to laugh as she passed them glancing back at ron over her shoulder ron looked rather pleased with himself 
 
 the ceiling of the great hall was serenely blue and streaked with frail wispy clouds just like the squares of sky visible through the high mullioned windows while they tucked into porridge and eggs and bacon harry and ron told hermione about their embarassing conversation with hagrid the previous evening 
 
 but he really think continue care of magical creatures she said looking distressed i mean when has any of us expressed you know any enthusiasm 
 
 it though innit said ron swallowing an entire fried egg whole we were the ones who made the most effort in classes because we like hagrid but he thinks we liked the stupid subject reckon going to go on to 
 
 neither harry nor hermione answered there was no need they knew perfectly well that nobody in their year would want to continue care of magical creatures they avoided eye and returned his cheery wave only when he left the staff table ten minutes later 
 
 after they had eaten they remained in their places awaiting professor descent from the staff table the distribution of class schedules was more complicated than usual this year for professor mcgonagall needed first to confirm that everybody had achieved the necessary grades to continue with their chosen 
 
 hermione was immediately cleared to continue with charms defense against the dark arts transfiguration herbology arithmancy ancient runes and potions and shot off to a first period ancient runes class without further ado neville took a little longer to sort out his round face was anxious as professor mcgonagall looked down his application and then consulted his results 
 
 herbology fine she said professor sprout will be delighted to see you back with an outstanding and you qualify for defense against the dark arts with exceeds expectations but the problem is transfiguration sorry longbottom but an acceptable really good enough to continue to level just think be able to cope with the coursework 
 
 neville hung his head professor mcgonagall peered at him through her square spectacles 
 
 why do you want to continue with transfiguration anyway never had the impression that you particularly enjoyed it 
 
 neville looked miserable and muttered something about my grandmother wants 
 
 hmph snorted professot mcgonagall high time your grandmother learned to be proud of the grandson got rather than the one she thinks she ought to haveparticularly after what happened at the ministry 
 
 neville turned very pink and blinked confusedly professor mcgonagall had never paid him a compliment before 
 
 sorry longbottom but i cannot let you into my class i see that you have an exceeds expectations in charm howeverwhy not try for a in charms 
 
 my grandmother thinks charms is a soft option mumbled neville 
 
 take charms said professor mcgonagall and i shall drop augusta a line reminding her that just because she failed her charms the subject is not necessarily worthless smiling slightly at the look of delighted incredulity on face professor mcgonagall tapped a blank schedule with the tip of her wand and handed it now carrying details of his new classes to neville 
 
 professor mcgonagall turned next to parvati patil whose first question was whether firenze the handsome centaur was still teaching divination 
 
 he and professor trelawney are dividing classes between them this year said professor mcgonagall a hint of disapproval in her voice it was common knowledge that she despised the subject of divination the sixth year is being taken by professor trelawney 
 
 parvati set off for divination five minutes later looking slightly crestfallen 
 
 so potter potter said professor mcgonagall consulting her notes as she turned to harry charms defense against the dark arts herbology transfiguration all fine i must say i was pleased with your transfiguration mark potter very pleased now why you applied to continue with potions i thought it was your ambition to become an auror 
 
 it was but you told me i had to get an outstanding in my professor 
 
 and so you did when professor snape was teaching the subject professor slughorn however is perfectly happy to accept students with exceeds expectations at do you wish to proceed with potions 
 
 yes said harry but i buy the books or any ingredients or anything 
 
 sure professor slughorn will be able to lend you some said professor mcgonagall very well potter here is your schedule oh by the waytwenty hopefuls have already put down their names for the gryffindor quidditch team i shall pass the list to you in due course and you can fix up trials at your leisure 
 
 a few minutes later ron was cleared to do the same subjects as harry and the two of them left the table together 
 
 look said ron delightedly gazing ar his schedule got a free period now and a free period after break and after lunch excellent 
 
 they returned to the common room which was empty apart from a half dozen seventh years including katie bell the only remaining member of the original gryffindor quidditch team that harry had joined in his first year 
 
 i thought get that well done she called over pointing at the captains badge on chest tell me when you call trials 
 
 be stupid said harry you need to try out i watched you play for five years 
 
 you start off like that she said warningly for all you know someone much better than me out there good teams have been ruined before now because captains just kept playing the old faces or letting in their friends 
 
 ron looked a little uncomfortable and began playing with the fanged frisbee hermione had taken from the student it zoomed around the common room snarling and attempting to take bites of the tapestry yellow eyes followed it and he hissed when it came too close 
 
 an hour later they reluctantly left the sunlit common room for the defense against the dark arts classroom four floors below hermione was already queuing outside carrying an armful of heavy books and looking 
 
 we got so much homework for runes she said anxiously when harry and ron joined her a essay two translations and got to read these by wednesday 
 
 shame yawned ron 
 
 you wait she said resentfully i bet snape gives us loads 
 
 the classroom door opened as she spoke and snape stepped into the corridor his sallow face framed as ever by two curtains of greasy black hair silence fell over the queue immediately 
 
 inside he said 
 
 harry looked around as they entered snape had imposed his personality upon the room already it was gloomier than usual as curtains had been drawn over the windows and was lit by candlelight new pictures adorned the walls many of them showing people who appeared to be in pain sporting grisly injuries or strangely contorted body parts nobody spoke as they settled down looking around at the shadowy gruesome pictures 
 
 i have not asked you to take out your books said snape closing the door and moving to face the class from behind his desk hermione hastily dropped her copy of confronting the faceless back into her bag and stowed it under her chair i wish to speak to you and i want your fullest attention 
 
 his black eyes roved over their upturned faces lingering for a fraction of a second longer on than anyone 
 
 you have had five teachers in this subject so far i believe 
 
 you believe like you watched them all come and go hoping be next thought harry scathingly 
 
 naturally these teachers will all have had their own methods and priorities given this confusion i am surprised so many of you scraped an in this subject i shall be even more surprised if all of you manage to keep up with the work which will be more advanced 
 
 snape set off around the edge of the room speaking now in a lower voice the class craned their necks to keep him in view 
 
 the dark arts said snape are many varied and eternal fighting them is like fighting a monster which each time a neck is severed sprouts a head even fiercer and cleverer than before you are fighting that which is unfixed mutating indestructible 
 
 harry stared at snape it was surely one thing to respect the dark arts as a dangerous enemy another to speak of them as snape was doing with a loving caress in his voice 
 
 your defenses said snape a little louder must therefore be as flexible and inventive as the arts you seek to undo these pictures he indicated a few of them as he swept past give a fair representation of what happens to those who suffer for instance the cruciatus curse he waved a hand toward a witch who was clearly shrieking in agony feel the kiss a wizard lying huddled and slumped against a wall or provoke the aggression of the inferius a bloody mass upon ground 
 
 has an inferius been seen then said parvati patil in a high pitched voice is it definite is he using them 
 
 the dark lord has used inferi in the past said snape which means you would be to assume he might use them again now 
 
 he set off again around the other side of the classroom toward his desk and again they watched him as he walked his dark robes billowing behind him 
 
 you are i believe complete novices in the use of spells what is the advantage of a spell 
 
 hand shot into the air snape took his time looking around at everybody else making sure he had no choice before saying curtly very wellmiss granger 
 
 your adversary has no warning about what kind of magic about to perform said hermione which gives you a advantage 
 
 an answer copied almost word for word from the standard book of spells grade six said snape dismissively over in the corner malfoy sniggered but correct in essentials yes those who progress in using magic without shouting incantations gain an element of surprise in their not all wizards can do this of course it is a question of concentration and mind power which some his gaze lingered maliciously upon harry once more lack 
 
 harry knew snape was thinking of their disastrous occlumency lessons of the previous year he refused to drop his gaze but glowered at snape until snape looked away 
 
 you will now divide snape went on into pairs one partner will attempt to jinx the other without speaking the other will attempt to repel the jinx in equal silence carry on 
 
 although snape did not know it harry had taught at least half the class everyone who had been a member of the how to perform a shield charm the previous year none of them had ever cast the charm without speaking however a reasonable amount of cheating ensued many people were merely whispering the incantation instead of saying it aloud typically ten minutes into the lesson hermione managed to repel muttered jinx without uttering a single word a feat that would surely have earned her twenty points for gryffindor from any reasonable teacher thought harry bitterly but which snape ignored he swept between them as they practiced looking just as much like an overgrown bat as ever lingering to watch harry and ron struggling with the task 
 
 ron who was supposed to be jinxing harry was purple in the face his lips tightly compressed to save himself from the temptation of muttering the incantation harry had his wand raised waiting on tenterhooks to repel a jinx that seemed unlikely ever to come 
 
 pathetic weasley said snape after a while herelet me show you 
 
 he turned his wand on harry so fast that harry reacted instinctively all thought of spells forgotten he yelled protego 
 
 his shield charm was so strong snape was knocked and hit a desk the whole class had looked around and now watched as snape righted himself scowling 
 
 do you remember me telling you we are practicing spells potter 
 
 yes said harry stiffly 
 
 yes sir 
 
 no need to call me sir professor the words had escaped him before he knew what he was saying several people gasped including hermione behind snape however ron dean and seamus grinned appreciatively 
 
 detention saturday night my office said snape i do not take cheek from anyone potter not even the chosen one 
 
 that was brilliant harry chortled ron once they were safely on their way to break a short while later 
 
 you really have said it said hermione frowning at ron what made you 
 
 he tried to jinx me in case you notice fumed harry i had enough of that during those occlumency lessons why he use another guinea pig for a change dumbledore playing at anyway letting him teach defense did you hear him talking about the dark arts he loves them all that unfixed indestructible stuff 
 
 well said hermione i thought he sounded a bit like you 
 
 like me 
 
 yes when you were telling us what like to face voldemort you said it just memorizing a bunch of spells you said it was just you and your brains and your gutswell that what snape was saying that it really comes down to being brave and 
 
 harry was so disarmed that she had thought his words as well worth memorizing as the standard book of spells that he did not argue 
 
 harry hey harry 
 
 harry looked around jack sloper one of the beaters on last gryffindor quidditch team was hurrying toward him holding a roll of parchment 
 
 for you panted sloper listen i heard the new captain you holding trials 
 
 not sure yet said harry thinking privately that sloper would be very lucky to get back on the team let you know 
 
 oh right i was hoping be this weekend 
 
 but harry was not listening he had just recognized the thin slanting writing on the parchment leaving sloper in he hurried away with ron and hermione unrolling the parchment as he went 
 
 dear harry 
 i would like to start our private lessons this saturday kindly come along to my office at eight i hope you are enjoying your first day back at school 
 yours sincerely 
 albus dumbledore 
 i enjoy acid pops 
 he enjoys acid pops said ron who had read the message over shoulder and was looking perplexed 
 
 the password to get past the gargoyle outside his study said harry in a low voice ha not going to be pleased i be able to do his detention 
 
 he ron and hermione spent the whole of break speculating on what dumbledore would teach harry ron thought it most likely to be spectacular jinxes and hexes of the type the death eaters would not know hermione said such things were illegal and thought it much more likely that dumbledore wanted to teach harry advanced defensive magic after break she went off to arithmancy while harry and ron returned to the common room where they grudgingly started homework this turned out to be so complex that they still had not finished when hermione joined them for their free period though she considerably speeded up the process they had only just finished when the bell rang for the double potions and they beat the familiar path down to the dungeon classroom that had for so long been 
 
 when they arrived in the corridor they saw that there were only a dozen people progressing to level crabbe and goyle had evidently failed to achieve the required grade but four slytherins had made it through including malfoy four ravenclaws were there and one hufflepuff ernie macmillan whom harry liked despite his rather pompous manner 
 
 harry ernie said portentously holding out his hand as harry approached get a chance to speak in defense against the dark arts this morning good lesson i thought but shield charms are old hat of course for us old lags and how are you ronhermione 
 
 before they could say more than fine the dungeon door opened and belly preceded him out of the door as they filed into the room his great walrus mustache curved above his beaming mouth and he greeted harry and zabini with particular enthusiasm 
 
 the dungeon was most unusually already full of vapors and odd smells harry ron and hermione sniffed interestedly as they passed large bubbling cauldrons the four slytherins took a table together as did the four ravenclaws this left harry ron and hermione to share a table with ernie they chose the one nearest a cauldron that was emitting one of the most seductive scents harry had ever inhaled somehow it reminded him simultaneously of treacle tart the woody smell of a broomstick handle and something flowery he thought he might have smelled at the burrow he found that he was breathing very slowly and deeply and that the fumes seemed to be filling him up like drink a great contentment stole over him he grinned across at ron who grinned back lazily 
 
 now then now then now then said slughorn whose massive outline was quivering through the many shimmering vapors scales out everyone and potion kits and forget your copies of advanced 
 
 sir said harry raising his hand 
 
 harry 
 
 i got a book or scales or ronwe realize be able to do the you see 
 
 ah yes professor mcgonagall did mention not to worry my dear boy not to worry at all you can use ingredients from the store cupboard today and sure we can lend you some scales and got a small stock of old books here do until you can write to flourish and blotts 
 
 slughorn strode over to a corner cupboard and after a foraging emerged with two very copies of advanced by libatius borage which he gave to harry and ron along with two sets of tarnished scales 
 
 now then said slughorn returning to the front of the class and inflating his already bulging chest so that the buttons on his waistcoat threatened to burst off prepared a few potions for you to have a look at just out of interest you know these are the kind of thing you ought to be able to make after completing your you ought to have heard of em even if you made em yet anyone tell me what this one is 
 
 he indicated the cauldron nearest the slytherin table harry raised himself slighty in his seat and saw what looked like plain water boiling away inside it 
 
 hand hit the air before anybody slughorn pointed at her 
 
 veritaserum a colorless odorless potion thar forces the drinker to tell the truth said hermione 
 
 very good very good said slughorn happily now he continued pointing at the cauldron nearest the ravenclaw table this one here is pretty well known featured in a few ministry leaflets lately too who can 
 
 hand was fastest once more 
 
 polyjuice potion sir she said 
 
 harry too had recognized the mudlike substance the second cauldron but did not resent hermione getting the credit for answering the question she after all was the one who had succeeded in making it back in their second year 
 
 excellent excellent now this one her yes my dear said slughorn now looking slightly bemused as hand punched the air again 
 
 amortentia 
 
 it is indeed ir seems almost foolish to ask said slughorn who was looking mightily impressed but i assume you know what it does 
 
 the most powerful love porion in the world said hermione 
 
 quite right you recognized it i suppose by its distinctive sheen 
 
 and the steam rising in characteristic spirals said hermione enthusiastically and supposed to smell differently to each of according to what attracts us and i can smell freshly mown grass and new parchment and 
 
 but she turned slightly pink and did not complete the sentence 
 
 may i ask your name my dear said slughorn ignoring embarrassment 
 
 hermione granger sir 
 
 granger granger can you possibly be related to hector who founded the most extraordinary society of potioneers 
 
 no i think so sir you see 
 
 harry saw malfoy lean close to nott and whisper something both of them sniggered but slughorn showed no dismay on the contrary he beamed and looked from hermione to harry who was sitting next to her 
 
 oho one of my best friends is and the best in our year assuming this is the very friend of whom you spoke harry 
 
 yes sir said harry 
 
 well well take twenty points for gryffindor miss granger said slughorn genially 
 
 malfoy looked rather as he had done the time hermione had punched him in the face hermione turned to harry with a radiant expression and whispered did you really tell him the best in the year oh harry 
 
 well so impressive about that whispered ron who for some reason looked annoyed you are the best in the told him so if asked me 
 
 hermione smiled but made a shushing gesture so that they could hear what slughorn was saying ron looked slightly disgruntled 
 
 amortentia really create love of course it is impossible to manufacture or imitate love no this will simply cause a powerful infatuation or obsession it is probably the most dangerous and powerful potion in this roomoh yes he said nodding gravely at malfoy and nott both of whom were smirking skeptically when you have seen as much of life as i have you will not underestimate the power of obsessive love 
 
 and now said slughorn it is time for us to start work 
 
 sir you told us in this one said ernie macmillan pointing at a small black cauldron standing on desk the potion within was splashing about merrily it was the color of molten gold and large drops were leaping like goldfish above the surface though not a particle had spilled 
 
 oho said slughorn again harry was sure that slughorn had not forgotten the potion at all but had waited to be asked for dramatic effect yes that well that one ladies and gentlemen is a most curious little potion called felix felicis i take it he turned smiling to look at hermione who had let out an audible gasp that you know what felix felicis does miss granger 
 
 liquid luck said hermione excitedly it makes you lucky 
 
 the whole class seemed to sit up a little straighter now all harry could see of malfoy was the back of his sleek blond head because he was at last giving slughorn his full and undivided attention 
 
 quite right take another ten points for gryffindor yes a funny little potion felix felicis said slughorn desperately tricky to make and disastrous to get wrong however if brewed correctly as this has been you will find that all your endeavors tend to succeed at least until the effects wear off 
 
 why people drink it all the time sir said terry boot eagerly 
 
 because if taken in excess it causes giddiness recklessness and dangerous overconfidence said slughorn too much of a good thing you know highly toxic in large quantities but taken sparingly and very occasionally 
 
 have you ever taken it sir asked michael corner with great interest 
 
 twice in my life said slughorn once when i was once when i was two tablespoonfuls taken with breakfast two perfect days 
 
 he gazed dreamily into the distance whether he was playacting or not thought harry the effect was good 
 
 and that said slughorn apparently coming back to earth is what i shall be offering as a prize in this lesson 
 
 there was silence in which every bubble and gurgle of the surrounding potions seemed magnified tenfold 
 
 one tiny bottle of felix felicis said slughorn taking a minuscule glass bottle with a cork in it out of his pocket and showing it to them all enough for twelve hours luck from dawn till dusk you will be lucky in everything you attempt 
 
 now i must give you warning that felix felicis is a banned substance in organized competition sporting events for instance examinations or elections so the winner is to use it on an ordinary day only and watch how that ordinary day becomes extraordinary 
 
 so said slughorn suddenly brisk how are you to win this fabulous prize well by turning to page ten of advanced potion making we have a little over an hour left to us which should be time for you to make a decent attempt at the draught of living death i know it is more complex than anything you have attempted before and i do not expect a perfect potion from anybody the person who does best however will win little felix here off you go 
 
 there was a scraping as everyone drew their cauldrons toward them and some loud clunks as people began adding weights to their scales but nobody spoke the concentration within the room was almost tangible harry saw malfoy riffling feverishly through his copy of advanced it could not have been clearer that malfoy really wanted that lucky day harry bent swiftly over the tattered book slughorn had lent him 
 
 to his annoyance he saw that the previous owner had scribbled all over the pages so that the margins were as black as the printed portions bending low to decipher the ingredients even here the previous owner had made annotations and crossed things out harry hurried off toward the store cupboard to find what he needed as he dashed back to his cauldron he saw malfoy cutting up valerian roots as fast as he could 
 
 everyone kept glancing around at what the rest of the class was doing this was both an advantage and a disadvantage of potions that it was hard to keep your work private within ten minutes the whole place was full of bluish steam hermione of course seemed to have progressed furthest her potion already resembled the smooth black liquid mentioned as the ideal halfway stage 
 
 having finished chopping his roots harry bent low over his book again it was really very irritating having to try and decipher the directions under all the stupid scribbles of the previous owner who for some reason had taken issue with the order to cut up the sopophorous bean and had written in the alternative instruction 
 
 crush with flat side of silver dagger releases juice better than cutting 
 
 sir i think you knew my grandfather abraxas malfoy harry looked up slughorn was just passing the slytherin table 
 
 yes said slughorn without looking at malfoy i was sorry to hear he had died although of course it unexpected dragon pox at his age 
 
 and he walked away harry bent back over his cauldron smirking he could tell that malfoy had expected to be treated like harry or zabini perhaps even hoped for some preferential treatment of the type he had learned to expect from snape it looked as though malfoy would have to rely on nothing but talent to win the bottle of felix felicis 
 
 the sopophorous bean was proving very difficult to cut up harry turned to hermione 
 
 can i borrow your silver knife 
 
 she nodded impatiently not taking her eyes off her potion which was still deep purple though according to the book ought to be turning a light shade of lilac by now 
 
 harry crushed his bean with the flat side of the dagger to his astonishment it immediately exuded so much juice he was amazed the shriveled bean could have held it all 
 
 hastily scooping it all into the cauldron he saw to his surprise that the potion immediately turned exactly the shade of lilac described by the textbook 
 
 his annoyance with the previous owner vanishing on the spot harry now squinted at the next line of instructions according the book he had to stir counterclockwise until the potion turned clear as water according to the addition the previous owner made however he ought to add a clockwise stir after every seventh counterclockwise stir could the old owner be right twice 
 
 harry stirred counterclockwise held his breath and stirred once clockwise the effect was immediate the potion turned pale pink 
 
 how are you doing that demanded hermione who was redfaced and whose hair was growing bushier and bushier in the fumes from her cauldron her potion was still resolutely purple 
 
 add a clockwise stir 
 
 no no the book says counterclockwise she snapped 
 
 harry shrugged and continued what he was doing seven stirs counterclockwise one clockwise pause seven stirs counterclockwise one stir clockwise 
 
 across the table ron was cursing fluently under his breath his potion looked like liquid licorice harry glanced around as far as he could see no one potion had turned as pale as his he felt elated something that had certainly never happened before in this dungeon 
 
 and up called slughorn stop stirring please 
 
 slughorn moved slowly among the tables peering into cauldrons he made no comment but occasionally gave the potions a stir or a sniff at last he reached the table where harry ron hermione and ernie were sitting he smiled ruefully at the tarlike substance in cauldron he passed over navy concoction potion he gave an approving nod then he saw and a look of incredulous delight spread over his face 
 
 the clear winner he cried to the dungeon excellent excellent harry good lord clear inherited your talent she was a dab hand at potions lily was here you are then here you areone bottle of felix felicis as promised and use it well 
 
 harry slipped the tiny bottle of golden liquid into his inner pocket feeling an odd combination of delight at the furious looks on the slytherins faces and guilt at the disappointed expression on ron looked simply dumbfounded 
 
 how did you do that he whispered to harry as they left the dungeon 
 
 got lucky i suppose said harry because malfoy was within earshot 
 
 once they were securely ensconced at the gryffindor table for dinner however he felt safe enough to tell them face became stonier with every word he uttered 
 
 i you think i cheated he finished aggravated by her expression 
 
 well it exactly your own work was it she said stiffly 
 
 he only followed different instructions to ours said ron been a catastrophe it but he took a risk and it paid off he heaved a sigh slughorn handed me that book but no i get the one no ever written on puked on by the look of page but 
 
 hang on said a voice close by left ear and he caught a sudden waft of that flowery smell he had picked up in dungeon he looked around and saw that ginny had joined them did i hear right been taking orders from something someone wrote in a book harry 
 
 she looked alarmed and angry harry knew what was on her mind at once 
 
 nothing he said reassuringly lowering his voice not like you know diary just an old textbook scribbled on 
 
 but doing what it says 
 
 i just tried a few of the tips written in the margins honestly ginny nothing funny 
 
 got a point said hermione perking up at once we ought to check that nothing odd about it i mean all these funny instructions who knows 
 
 hey said harry indignantly as she pulled his copy of advanced out of his bag and raised her wand 
 
 specialis revelio she said rapping it smartly on the front cover nothing whatsoever happened the book simply lay there looking old and dirty and 
 
 finished said harry irritably or want to wait and see if it does a few backflips 
 
 it seems all right said hermione still staring at the book suspiciously i mean it really does seem to be just a textbook 
 
 good then have it back said harry snatching it off the table but it slipped from his hand and landed open on the floor nobody else was looking harry bent low to retrieve the book and as he did so he saw something scribbled along the bottom of the back cover in the same small cramped handwriting as the instructions that had won him his bottle of felix felicis now safely hidden inside a pair of socks in his trunk upstairs 
 
 this book is the property of the half blood prince 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the half blood prince 
 

lionfish nov chapter nine the princecontents prev chapter next chapter 
 harry and ron met hermione in the common room before breakfast next morning hoping for some support in his theory harry lost no time in telling hermione what he had overheard malfoy saying on the hogwarts express 
 
 but he was obviously showing off for parkinson he interjected ron quickly before hermione could say anything 
 
 well she said uncertainly i know it would be like malfoy to make himself seem more important than he is but a big lie to tell 
 
 exactly said harry but he could nor press the point because so many people were trying to listen in to his conversation not to mention staring at him and whispering behind their hands 
 
 rude to point ron snapped at a particularly minuscule boy as they joined the queue to climb out of the portrait hole the boy who had been muttering something about harry behind his hand to his friend promptly turned scarlet and toppled out of the hole in alarm ron sniggered i love being a sixth year and going to be getting free time this year whole periods when we can just sit up here and relax 
 
 going to need that time for studying ron said hermione as they set off down the corridor 
 
 yeah but not today said ron going to be a real loss i reckon 
 
 hold it said hermione throwing out an arm and halting a passing fourth year who was attempting to push past her with a disk clutched tightly in his hand fanged frisbees banned hand it over she told him sternly the scowling boy handed over the snarling frisbee ducked under her arm and took off after his friends ron waited for him to vanish then tugged the frisbee from grip 
 
 excellent always wanted one of these 
 
 remonstration was drowned by a loud giggle lavender brown had apparently found remark highly amusing she continued to laugh as she passed them glancing back at ron over her shoulder ron looked rather pleased with himself 
 
 the ceiling of the great hall was serenely blue and streaked with frail wispy clouds just like the squares of sky visible through the high mullioned windows while they tucked into porridge and eggs and bacon harry and ron told hermione about their embarassing conversation with hagrid the previous evening 
 
 but he really think continue care of magical creatures she said looking distressed i mean when has any of us expressed you know any enthusiasm 
 
 it though innit said ron swallowing an entire fried egg whole we were the ones who made the most effort in classes because we like hagrid but he thinks we liked the stupid subject reckon going to go on to 
 
 neither harry nor hermione answered there was no need they knew perfectly well that nobody in their year would want to continue care of magical creatures they avoided eye and returned his cheery wave only when he left the staff table ten minutes later 
 
 after they had eaten they remained in their places awaiting professor descent from the staff table the distribution of class schedules was more complicated than usual this year for professor mcgonagall needed first to confirm that everybody had achieved the necessary grades to continue with their chosen 
 
 hermione was immediately cleared to continue with charms defense against the dark arts transfiguration herbology arithmancy ancient runes and potions and shot off to a first period ancient runes class without further ado neville took a little longer to sort out his round face was anxious as professor mcgonagall looked down his application and then consulted his results 
 
 herbology fine she said professor sprout will be delighted to see you back with an outstanding and you qualify for defense against the dark arts with exceeds expectations but the problem is transfiguration sorry longbottom but an acceptable really good enough to continue to level just think be able to cope with the coursework 
 
 neville hung his head professor mcgonagall peered at him through her square spectacles 
 
 why do you want to continue with transfiguration anyway never had the impression that you particularly enjoyed it 
 
 neville looked miserable and muttered something about my grandmother wants 
 
 hmph snorted professot mcgonagall high time your grandmother learned to be proud of the grandson got rather than the one she thinks she ought to haveparticularly after what happened at the ministry 
 
 neville turned very pink and blinked confusedly professor mcgonagall had never paid him a compliment before 
 
 sorry longbottom but i cannot let you into my class i see that you have an exceeds expectations in charm howeverwhy not try for a in charms 
 
 my grandmother thinks charms is a soft option mumbled neville 
 
 take charms said professor mcgonagall and i shall drop augusta a line reminding her that just because she failed her charms the subject is not necessarily worthless smiling slightly at the look of delighted incredulity on face professor mcgonagall tapped a blank schedule with the tip of her wand and handed it now carrying details of his new classes to neville 
 
 professor mcgonagall turned next to parvati patil whose first question was whether firenze the handsome centaur was still teaching divination 
 
 he and professor trelawney are dividing classes between them this year said professor mcgonagall a hint of disapproval in her voice it was common knowledge that she despised the subject of divination the sixth year is being taken by professor trelawney 
 
 parvati set off for divination five minutes later looking slightly crestfallen 
 
 so potter potter said professor mcgonagall consulting her notes as she turned to harry charms defense against the dark arts herbology transfiguration all fine i must say i was pleased with your transfiguration mark potter very pleased now why you applied to continue with potions i thought it was your ambition to become an auror 
 
 it was but you told me i had to get an outstanding in my professor 
 
 and so you did when professor snape was teaching the subject professor slughorn however is perfectly happy to accept students with exceeds expectations at do you wish to proceed with potions 
 
 yes said harry but i buy the books or any ingredients or anything 
 
 sure professor slughorn will be able to lend you some said professor mcgonagall very well potter here is your schedule oh by the waytwenty hopefuls have already put down their names for the gryffindor quidditch team i shall pass the list to you in due course and you can fix up trials at your leisure 
 
 a few minutes later ron was cleared to do the same subjects as harry and the two of them left the table together 
 
 look said ron delightedly gazing ar his schedule got a free period now and a free period after break and after lunch excellent 
 
 they returned to the common room which was empty apart from a half dozen seventh years including katie bell the only remaining member of the original gryffindor quidditch team that harry had joined in his first year 
 
 i thought get that well done she called over pointing at the captains badge on chest tell me when you call trials 
 
 be stupid said harry you need to try out i watched you play for five years 
 
 you start off like that she said warningly for all you know someone much better than me out there good teams have been ruined before now because captains just kept playing the old faces or letting in their friends 
 
 ron looked a little uncomfortable and began playing with the fanged frisbee hermione had taken from the student it zoomed around the common room snarling and attempting to take bites of the tapestry yellow eyes followed it and he hissed when it came too close 
 
 an hour later they reluctantly left the sunlit common room for the defense against the dark arts classroom four floors below hermione was already queuing outside carrying an armful of heavy books and looking 
 
 we got so much homework for runes she said anxiously when harry and ron joined her a essay two translations and got to read these by wednesday 
 
 shame yawned ron 
 
 you wait she said resentfully i bet snape gives us loads 
 
 the classroom door opened as she spoke and snape stepped into the corridor his sallow face framed as ever by two curtains of greasy black hair silence fell over the queue immediately 
 
 inside he said 
 
 harry looked around as they entered snape had imposed his personality upon the room already it was gloomier than usual as curtains had been drawn over the windows and was lit by candlelight new pictures adorned the walls many of them showing people who appeared to be in pain sporting grisly injuries or strangely contorted body parts nobody spoke as they settled down looking around at the shadowy gruesome pictures 
 
 i have not asked you to take out your books said snape closing the door and moving to face the class from behind his desk hermione hastily dropped her copy of confronting the faceless back into her bag and stowed it under her chair i wish to speak to you and i want your fullest attention 
 
 his black eyes roved over their upturned faces lingering for a fraction of a second longer on than anyone 
 
 you have had five teachers in this subject so far i believe 
 
 you believe like you watched them all come and go hoping be next thought harry scathingly 
 
 naturally these teachers will all have had their own methods and priorities given this confusion i am surprised so many of you scraped an in this subject i shall be even more surprised if all of you manage to keep up with the work which will be more advanced 
 
 snape set off around the edge of the room speaking now in a lower voice the class craned their necks to keep him in view 
 
 the dark arts said snape are many varied and eternal fighting them is like fighting a monster which each time a neck is severed sprouts a head even fiercer and cleverer than before you are fighting that which is unfixed mutating indestructible 
 
 harry stared at snape it was surely one thing to respect the dark arts as a dangerous enemy another to speak of them as snape was doing with a loving caress in his voice 
 
 your defenses said snape a little louder must therefore be as flexible and inventive as the arts you seek to undo these pictures he indicated a few of them as he swept past give a fair representation of what happens to those who suffer for instance the cruciatus curse he waved a hand toward a witch who was clearly shrieking in agony feel the kiss a wizard lying huddled and slumped against a wall or provoke the aggression of the inferius a bloody mass upon ground 
 
 has an inferius been seen then said parvati patil in a high pitched voice is it definite is he using them 
 
 the dark lord has used inferi in the past said snape which means you would be to assume he might use them again now 
 
 he set off again around the other side of the classroom toward his desk and again they watched him as he walked his dark robes billowing behind him 
 
 you are i believe complete novices in the use of spells what is the advantage of a spell 
 
 hand shot into the air snape took his time looking around at everybody else making sure he had no choice before saying curtly very wellmiss granger 
 
 your adversary has no warning about what kind of magic about to perform said hermione which gives you a advantage 
 
 an answer copied almost word for word from the standard book of spells grade six said snape dismissively over in the corner malfoy sniggered but correct in essentials yes those who progress in using magic without shouting incantations gain an element of surprise in their not all wizards can do this of course it is a question of concentration and mind power which some his gaze lingered maliciously upon harry once more lack 
 
 harry knew snape was thinking of their disastrous occlumency lessons of the previous year he refused to drop his gaze but glowered at snape until snape looked away 
 
 you will now divide snape went on into pairs one partner will attempt to jinx the other without speaking the other will attempt to repel the jinx in equal silence carry on 
 
 although snape did not know it harry had taught at least half the class everyone who had been a member of the how to perform a shield charm the previous year none of them had ever cast the charm without speaking however a reasonable amount of cheating ensued many people were merely whispering the incantation instead of saying it aloud typically ten minutes into the lesson hermione managed to repel muttered jinx without uttering a single word a feat that would surely have earned her twenty points for gryffindor from any reasonable teacher thought harry bitterly but which snape ignored he swept between them as they practiced looking just as much like an overgrown bat as ever lingering to watch harry and ron struggling with the task 
 
 ron who was supposed to be jinxing harry was purple in the face his lips tightly compressed to save himself from the temptation of muttering the incantation harry had his wand raised waiting on tenterhooks to repel a jinx that seemed unlikely ever to come 
 
 pathetic weasley said snape after a while herelet me show you 
 
 he turned his wand on harry so fast that harry reacted instinctively all thought of spells forgotten he yelled protego 
 
 his shield charm was so strong snape was knocked and hit a desk the whole class had looked around and now watched as snape righted himself scowling 
 
 do you remember me telling you we are practicing spells potter 
 
 yes said harry stiffly 
 
 yes sir 
 
 no need to call me sir professor the words had escaped him before he knew what he was saying several people gasped including hermione behind snape however ron dean and seamus grinned appreciatively 
 
 detention saturday night my office said snape i do not take cheek from anyone potter not even the chosen one 
 
 that was brilliant harry chortled ron once they were safely on their way to break a short while later 
 
 you really have said it said hermione frowning at ron what made you 
 
 he tried to jinx me in case you notice fumed harry i had enough of that during those occlumency lessons why he use another guinea pig for a change dumbledore playing at anyway letting him teach defense did you hear him talking about the dark arts he loves them all that unfixed indestructible stuff 
 
 well said hermione i thought he sounded a bit like you 
 
 like me 
 
 yes when you were telling us what like to face voldemort you said it just memorizing a bunch of spells you said it was just you and your brains and your gutswell that what snape was saying that it really comes down to being brave and 
 
 harry was so disarmed that she had thought his words as well worth memorizing as the standard book of spells that he did not argue 
 
 harry hey harry 
 
 harry looked around jack sloper one of the beaters on last gryffindor quidditch team was hurrying toward him holding a roll of parchment 
 
 for you panted sloper listen i heard the new captain you holding trials 
 
 not sure yet said harry thinking privately that sloper would be very lucky to get back on the team let you know 
 
 oh right i was hoping be this weekend 
 
 but harry was not listening he had just recognized the thin slanting writing on the parchment leaving sloper in he hurried away with ron and hermione unrolling the parchment as he went 
 
 dear harry 
 i would like to start our private lessons this saturday kindly come along to my office at eight i hope you are enjoying your first day back at school 
 yours sincerely 
 albus dumbledore 
 i enjoy acid pops 
 he enjoys acid pops said ron who had read the message over shoulder and was looking perplexed 
 
 the password to get past the gargoyle outside his study said harry in a low voice ha not going to be pleased i be able to do his detention 
 
 he ron and hermione spent the whole of break speculating on what dumbledore would teach harry ron thought it most likely to be spectacular jinxes and hexes of the type the death eaters would not know hermione said such things were illegal and thought it much more likely that dumbledore wanted to teach harry advanced defensive magic after break she went off to arithmancy while harry and ron returned to the common room where they grudgingly started homework this turned out to be so complex that they still had not finished when hermione joined them for their free period though she considerably speeded up the process they had only just finished when the bell rang for the double potions and they beat the familiar path down to the dungeon classroom that had for so long been 
 
 when they arrived in the corridor they saw that there were only a dozen people progressing to level crabbe and goyle had evidently failed to achieve the required grade but four slytherins had made it through including malfoy four ravenclaws were there and one hufflepuff ernie macmillan whom harry liked despite his rather pompous manner 
 
 harry ernie said portentously holding out his hand as harry approached get a chance to speak in defense against the dark arts this morning good lesson i thought but shield charms are old hat of course for us old lags and how are you ronhermione 
 
 before they could say more than fine the dungeon door opened and belly preceded him out of the door as they filed into the room his great walrus mustache curved above his beaming mouth and he greeted harry and zabini with particular enthusiasm 
 
 the dungeon was most unusually already full of vapors and odd smells harry ron and hermione sniffed interestedly as they passed large bubbling cauldrons the four slytherins took a table together as did the four ravenclaws this left harry ron and hermione to share a table with ernie they chose the one nearest a cauldron that was emitting one of the most seductive scents harry had ever inhaled somehow it reminded him simultaneously of treacle tart the woody smell of a broomstick handle and something flowery he thought he might have smelled at the burrow he found that he was breathing very slowly and deeply and that the fumes seemed to be filling him up like drink a great contentment stole over him he grinned across at ron who grinned back lazily 
 
 now then now then now then said slughorn whose massive outline was quivering through the many shimmering vapors scales out everyone and potion kits and forget your copies of advanced 
 
 sir said harry raising his hand 
 
 harry 
 
 i got a book or scales or ronwe realize be able to do the you see 
 
 ah yes professor mcgonagall did mention not to worry my dear boy not to worry at all you can use ingredients from the store cupboard today and sure we can lend you some scales and got a small stock of old books here do until you can write to flourish and blotts 
 
 slughorn strode over to a corner cupboard and after a foraging emerged with two very copies of advanced by libatius borage which he gave to harry and ron along with two sets of tarnished scales 
 
 now then said slughorn returning to the front of the class and inflating his already bulging chest so that the buttons on his waistcoat threatened to burst off prepared a few potions for you to have a look at just out of interest you know these are the kind of thing you ought to be able to make after completing your you ought to have heard of em even if you made em yet anyone tell me what this one is 
 
 he indicated the cauldron nearest the slytherin table harry raised himself slighty in his seat and saw what looked like plain water boiling away inside it 
 
 hand hit the air before anybody slughorn pointed at her 
 
 veritaserum a colorless odorless potion thar forces the drinker to tell the truth said hermione 
 
 very good very good said slughorn happily now he continued pointing at the cauldron nearest the ravenclaw table this one here is pretty well known featured in a few ministry leaflets lately too who can 
 
 hand was fastest once more 
 
 polyjuice potion sir she said 
 
 harry too had recognized the mudlike substance the second cauldron but did not resent hermione getting the credit for answering the question she after all was the one who had succeeded in making it back in their second year 
 
 excellent excellent now this one her yes my dear said slughorn now looking slightly bemused as hand punched the air again 
 
 amortentia 
 
 it is indeed ir seems almost foolish to ask said slughorn who was looking mightily impressed but i assume you know what it does 
 
 the most powerful love porion in the world said hermione 
 
 quite right you recognized it i suppose by its distinctive sheen 
 
 and the steam rising in characteristic spirals said hermione enthusiastically and supposed to smell differently to each of according to what attracts us and i can smell freshly mown grass and new parchment and 
 
 but she turned slightly pink and did not complete the sentence 
 
 may i ask your name my dear said slughorn ignoring embarrassment 
 
 hermione granger sir 
 
 granger granger can you possibly be related to hector who founded the most extraordinary society of potioneers 
 
 no i think so sir you see 
 
 harry saw malfoy lean close to nott and whisper something both of them sniggered but slughorn showed no dismay on the contrary he beamed and looked from hermione to harry who was sitting next to her 
 
 oho one of my best friends is and the best in our year assuming this is the very friend of whom you spoke harry 
 
 yes sir said harry 
 
 well well take twenty points for gryffindor miss granger said slughorn genially 
 
 malfoy looked rather as he had done the time hermione had punched him in the face hermione turned to harry with a radiant expression and whispered did you really tell him the best in the year oh harry 
 
 well so impressive about that whispered ron who for some reason looked annoyed you are the best in the told him so if asked me 
 
 hermione smiled but made a shushing gesture so that they could hear what slughorn was saying ron looked slightly disgruntled 
 
 amortentia really create love of course it is impossible to manufacture or imitate love no this will simply cause a powerful infatuation or obsession it is probably the most dangerous and powerful potion in this roomoh yes he said nodding gravely at malfoy and nott both of whom were smirking skeptically when you have seen as much of life as i have you will not underestimate the power of obsessive love 
 
 and now said slughorn it is time for us to start work 
 
 sir you told us in this one said ernie macmillan pointing at a small black cauldron standing on desk the potion within was splashing about merrily it was the color of molten gold and large drops were leaping like goldfish above the surface though not a particle had spilled 
 
 oho said slughorn again harry was sure that slughorn had not forgotten the potion at all but had waited to be asked for dramatic effect yes that well that one ladies and gentlemen is a most curious little potion called felix felicis i take it he turned smiling to look at hermione who had let out an audible gasp that you know what felix felicis does miss granger 
 
 liquid luck said hermione excitedly it makes you lucky 
 
 the whole class seemed to sit up a little straighter now all harry could see of malfoy was the back of his sleek blond head because he was at last giving slughorn his full and undivided attention 
 
 quite right take another ten points for gryffindor yes a funny little potion felix felicis said slughorn desperately tricky to make and disastrous to get wrong however if brewed correctly as this has been you will find that all your endeavors tend to succeed at least until the effects wear off 
 
 why people drink it all the time sir said terry boot eagerly 
 
 because if taken in excess it causes giddiness recklessness and dangerous overconfidence said slughorn too much of a good thing you know highly toxic in large quantities but taken sparingly and very occasionally 
 
 have you ever taken it sir asked michael corner with great interest 
 
 twice in my life said slughorn once when i was once when i was two tablespoonfuls taken with breakfast two perfect days 
 
 he gazed dreamily into the distance whether he was playacting or not thought harry the effect was good 
 
 and that said slughorn apparently coming back to earth is what i shall be offering as a prize in this lesson 
 
 there was silence in which every bubble and gurgle of the surrounding potions seemed magnified tenfold 
 
 one tiny bottle of felix felicis said slughorn taking a minuscule glass bottle with a cork in it out of his pocket and showing it to them all enough for twelve hours luck from dawn till dusk you will be lucky in everything you attempt 
 
 now i must give you warning that felix felicis is a banned substance in organized competition sporting events for instance examinations or elections so the winner is to use it on an ordinary day only and watch how that ordinary day becomes extraordinary 
 
 so said slughorn suddenly brisk how are you to win this fabulous prize well by turning to page ten of advanced potion making we have a little over an hour left to us which should be time for you to make a decent attempt at the draught of living death i know it is more complex than anything you have attempted before and i do not expect a perfect potion from anybody the person who does best however will win little felix here off you go 
 
 there was a scraping as everyone drew their cauldrons toward them and some loud clunks as people began adding weights to their scales but nobody spoke the concentration within the room was almost tangible harry saw malfoy riffling feverishly through his copy of advanced it could not have been clearer that malfoy really wanted that lucky day harry bent swiftly over the tattered book slughorn had lent him 
 
 to his annoyance he saw that the previous owner had scribbled all over the pages so that the margins were as black as the printed portions bending low to decipher the ingredients even here the previous owner had made annotations and crossed things out harry hurried off toward the store cupboard to find what he needed as he dashed back to his cauldron he saw malfoy cutting up valerian roots as fast as he could 
 
 everyone kept glancing around at what the rest of the class was doing this was both an advantage and a disadvantage of potions that it was hard to keep your work private within ten minutes the whole place was full of bluish steam hermione of course seemed to have progressed furthest her potion already resembled the smooth black liquid mentioned as the ideal halfway stage 
 
 having finished chopping his roots harry bent low over his book again it was really very irritating having to try and decipher the directions under all the stupid scribbles of the previous owner who for some reason had taken issue with the order to cut up the sopophorous bean and had written in the alternative instruction 
 
 crush with flat side of silver dagger releases juice better than cutting 
 
 sir i think you knew my grandfather abraxas malfoy harry looked up slughorn was just passing the slytherin table 
 
 yes said slughorn without looking at malfoy i was sorry to hear he had died although of course it unexpected dragon pox at his age 
 
 and he walked away harry bent back over his cauldron smirking he could tell that malfoy had expected to be treated like harry or zabini perhaps even hoped for some preferential treatment of the type he had learned to expect from snape it looked as though malfoy would have to rely on nothing but talent to win the bottle of felix felicis 
 
 the sopophorous bean was proving very difficult to cut up harry turned to hermione 
 
 can i borrow your silver knife 
 
 she nodded impatiently not taking her eyes off her potion which was still deep purple though according to the book ought to be turning a light shade of lilac by now 
 
 harry crushed his bean with the flat side of the dagger to his astonishment it immediately exuded so much juice he was amazed the shriveled bean could have held it all 
 
 hastily scooping it all into the cauldron he saw to his surprise that the potion immediately turned exactly the shade of lilac described by the textbook 
 
 his annoyance with the previous owner vanishing on the spot harry now squinted at the next line of instructions according the book he had to stir counterclockwise until the potion turned clear as water according to the addition the previous owner made however he ought to add a clockwise stir after every seventh counterclockwise stir could the old owner be right twice 
 
 harry stirred counterclockwise held his breath and stirred once clockwise the effect was immediate the potion turned pale pink 
 
 how are you doing that demanded hermione who was redfaced and whose hair was growing bushier and bushier in the fumes from her cauldron her potion was still resolutely purple 
 
 add a clockwise stir 
 
 no no the book says counterclockwise she snapped 
 
 harry shrugged and continued what he was doing seven stirs counterclockwise one clockwise pause seven stirs counterclockwise one stir clockwise 
 
 across the table ron was cursing fluently under his breath his potion looked like liquid licorice harry glanced around as far as he could see no one potion had turned as pale as his he felt elated something that had certainly never happened before in this dungeon 
 
 and up called slughorn stop stirring please 
 
 slughorn moved slowly among the tables peering into cauldrons he made no comment but occasionally gave the potions a stir or a sniff at last he reached the table where harry ron hermione and ernie were sitting he smiled ruefully at the tarlike substance in cauldron he passed over navy concoction potion he gave an approving nod then he saw and a look of incredulous delight spread over his face 
 
 the clear winner he cried to the dungeon excellent excellent harry good lord clear inherited your talent she was a dab hand at potions lily was here you are then here you areone bottle of felix felicis as promised and use it well 
 
 harry slipped the tiny bottle of golden liquid into his inner pocket feeling an odd combination of delight at the furious looks on the slytherins faces and guilt at the disappointed expression on ron looked simply dumbfounded 
 
 how did you do that he whispered to harry as they left the dungeon 
 
 got lucky i suppose said harry because malfoy was within earshot 
 
 once they were securely ensconced at the gryffindor table for dinner however he felt safe enough to tell them face became stonier with every word he uttered 
 
 i you think i cheated he finished aggravated by her expression 
 
 well it exactly your own work was it she said stiffly 
 
 he only followed different instructions to ours said ron been a catastrophe it but he took a risk and it paid off he heaved a sigh slughorn handed me that book but no i get the one no ever written on puked on by the look of page but 
 
 hang on said a voice close by left ear and he caught a sudden waft of that flowery smell he had picked up in dungeon he looked around and saw that ginny had joined them did i hear right been taking orders from something someone wrote in a book harry 
 
 she looked alarmed and angry harry knew what was on her mind at once 
 
 nothing he said reassuringly lowering his voice not like you know diary just an old textbook scribbled on 
 
 but doing what it says 
 
 i just tried a few of the tips written in the margins honestly ginny nothing funny 
 
 got a point said hermione perking up at once we ought to check that nothing odd about it i mean all these funny instructions who knows 
 
 hey said harry indignantly as she pulled his copy of advanced out of his bag and raised her wand 
 
 specialis revelio she said rapping it smartly on the front cover nothing whatsoever happened the book simply lay there looking old and dirty and 
 
 finished said harry irritably or want to wait and see if it does a few backflips 
 
 it seems all right said hermione still staring at the book suspiciously i mean it really does seem to be just a textbook 
 
 good then have it back said harry snatching it off the table but it slipped from his hand and landed open on the floor nobody else was looking harry bent low to retrieve the book and as he did so he saw something scribbled along the bottom of the back cover in the same small cramped handwriting as the instructions that had won him his bottle of felix felicis now safely hidden inside a pair of socks in his trunk upstairs

 everything seemed fuzzy slow harry and hermione jumped to their feet and drew their wands many people were only just realizing that something strange had happened heads were still turning toward the silver cat as it vanished silence spread outward in cold ripples from the place where the patronus had landed then somebody screamed 
 
 harry and hermione threw themselves into the panicking crowd guests were sprinting in all directions many were disapparating the protective enchantments around the burrow had broken 
 
 ron hermione cried ron where are you 
 
 as they pushed their way across the dance floor harry saw cloaked and masked figures appearing in the crowd then he saw lupin and tonks their wands raised and heard both of them shout protego a cry that was echoed on all sides c 
 
 ron ron hermione called half sobbing as she and harry were buffered by terrified guests harry seized her hand to make sure they werent separated as a streak of light whizzed over their heads whether a protective charm or something more sinister he did not know c 
 
 and then ron was there he caught hold of hermiones free arm and harry felt her turn on the spot sight and sound were extinguished as darkness pressed in upon him all he could feel was hermiones hand as he was squeezed through space and time away from the burrow away from the descending death eaters away perhaps from voldemort himself 
 
 where are we said rons voice 
 
 harry opened his eyes for a moment he thought they had not left the wedding after all they still seemed to be surrounded by people 
 
 tottenham court road panted hermione walk just walk we need to find somewhere for you to change 
 
 harry did as she asked they half walked half ran up the wide dark street thronged with revelers and lined with closed shops stars twinkling above them a bus rumbled by and a group of merry ogled them as they passed harry and ron were still wearing dress robes 
 
 hermione we havent got anything to change into ron told her as a young woman burst into raucous giggles at the sight of him 
 
 why didnt i make sure i had the invisibility cloak with me said harry inwardly cursing his own stupidity all last year i kept it on me and c 
 
 its okay ive got the cloak ive got clothes for both of you said hermione just try and act naturally until c this will do 
 
 she led them down a side street then into the shelter of a shadowy alleyway 
 
 when you say youve got the cloak and clothes said harry frowning at hermione who was carrying nothing except her small beaded handbag in which she was now rummaging 
 
 yes theyre here said hermione and to harry and rons utter astonishment she pulled out a pair of jeans a sweatshirt some maroon socks and finally the silvery invisibility cloak 
 
 how the ruddy hell c 
 
 undetectable extension charm said hermione tricky but i think ive done it okay anyway i managed to fit everything we need in here she gave the bag a little shake and it echoed like a cargo hold as a number of heavy objects rolled around inside it oh damn thatll be the books she said peering into it and i had them all stacked by subject oh well harry youd better take the invisibility cloak ron hurry up and change 
 
 when did you do all this harry asked as ron stripped off his robes 
 
 i told you at the burrow ive had the essentials packed for days you know in case we needed to make a quick getaway i packed your rucksack this morning harry after you changed and put it in here i just had a feeling 
 
 youre amazing you are said ron handing her his robes 
 
 thank you said hermione managing a small smile as she pushed the robes into the bag please harry get that cloak on 
 
 harry threw his invisibility cloak around his shoulders and pulled it up over his head vanishing from sight he was only just beginning to appreciate what had happened 
 
 the others c everybody at the wedding c 
 
 we cant worry about that now whispered hermione its you theyre after harry and well just put everyone in even more danger by going back 
 
 shes right said ron who seemed to know that harry was about to argue even if he could not see his face most of the order was there theyll look after everyone 
 
 harry nodded then remembered that they could not see him and said yeah but he thought of ginny and fear bubbled like acid in his stomach 
 
 come on i think we ought to keep moving said hermione 
 
 they moved back up the side street and onto the main road again where a group of men on the opposite side was singing and weaving across the pavement 
 
 just as a matter of interest why tottenham court road ron asked hermione 
 
 ive no idea it just popped into my head but im sure were safer out in the muggle world its not where theyll expect us to be 
 
 true said ron looking around but dont you feel a bit c exposed 
 
 where else is there asked hermione cringing as the men on the other side of the road started at her we can hardly book rooms at the leaky cauldron can we and grimmauld place is out if snape can get in there i suppose we could try my parents home though i think theres a chance they might check there oh i wish theyd shut up 
 
 all right darling the drunkest of the men on the other pavement was yelling fancy a drink ditch ginger and come and have a pint 
 
 lets sit down somewhere hermione said hastily as ron opened his mouth to shout back across the road look this will do in here 
 
 it was a small and shabby caf a light layer of grease lay on all the tables but it was at least empty harry slipped into a booth first and ron sat next to him opposite hermione who had her back to the entrance and did not like it she glanced over her shoulder so frequently she appeared to have a twitch harry did not like being stationary walking had given the illusion that they had a goal beneath the cloak he could feel the last vestiges of polyjuice leaving him his hands returning to their usual length and shape he pulled his glasses out of his pocket and put them on again 
 
 after a minute or two ron said you know were not far from the leaky cauldron here its only in charing cross c 
 
 ron we cant said hermione at once 
 
 not to stay there but to find out whats going on 
 
 we know whats going on voldemorts taken over the ministry what else do we need to know 
 
 okay okay it was just an idea 
 
 they relapsed into a prickly silence the waitress shuffled over and hermione ordered two cappuccinos as harry was invisible it would have looked odd to order him one a pair of burly workmen entered the caf and squeezed into the next booth hermione dropped her voice to a whisper 
 
 i say we find a quiet place to disapparate and head for the countryside once were there we could send a message to the order 
 
 can you do that talking patronus thing then asked ron 
 
 ive been practicing and i think so said hermione 
 
 well as long as it doesnt get them into trouble though they mightve been arrested already god thats revolting ron added after one sip of the foamy grayish coffee the waitress had heard she shot ron a nasty look as she shuffled off to take the new customers orders the larger of the two workmen who was blond and quite huge now that harry came to look at him waved her away she stared affronted 
 
 lets get going then i dont want to drink this muck said ron hermione have you got muggle money to pay for this 
 
 yes i took out all my building society savings before i came to the burrow ill bet all the change is at the bottom sighed hermione reaching for her beaded bag 
 
 the two workmen made identical movements and harry mirrored them without conscious thought all three of them drew their wands ron a few seconds late in realizing what was going on lunged across the table pushing hermione sideways onto her bench the force of the death eaters spells shattered the tiled wall where rons head had just been as harry still invisible yelled stupefy 
 
 the great blond death eater was hit in the face by a jet of red light he slumped sideways unconscious his companion unable to see who had cast the spell fired another at ron shining black ropes flew from his and bound ron head to foot c the waitress screamed and ran for the door c harry sent another stunning spell at the death eater with the twisted face who had tied up ron but the spell missed rebounded on the window and hit the waitress who collapsed in front of the door 
 
 expulso bellowed the death eater and the table behind which harry was standing blew up the force of the explosion slammed him into the wall and he felt his wand leave his hand as the cloak slipped off him 
 
 petrificus totalus screamed hermione from out of sight and the death eater fell forward like a statue to land with a crunching thud on the mess of broken china table and coffee hermione crawled out from underneath the bench shaking bits of glass ashtray out of her hair and trembling all over 
 
 she said pointing her wand at ron who roared in pain as she slashed open the knee of his jeans leaving a deep cut oh im so sorry ron my hands shaking diffindo 
 
 the severed ropes fell away ron got to his feet shaking his arms to regain feeling in them harry picked up his wand and climbed over all the debris to where the large blond death eater was sprawled across the bench 
 
 i shouldve recognized him he was there the night dumbledore died he said he turned over the darker death eater with his foot the mans eyes moved rapidly between harry ron and hermione 
 
 thats dolohov said ron i recognize him from the old wanted posters i think the big ones thorfinn rowle 
 
 never mind what theyre called said hermione a little hysterically how did they find us what are we going to do 
 
 somehow her panic seemed to clear harrys head 
 
 lock the door he told her and ron turn out the lights 
 
 he looked down at the paralyzed dolohov thinking fast as the lock clicked and ron used the deluminator to plunge the caf into darkness harry could hear the men who had jeered at hermione earlier yelling at another girl in the distance 
 
 what are we going to do with them ron whispered to harry through the dark then even more quietly kill them theyd kill us they had a good go just now 
 
 hermione shuddered and took a step backward harry shook his head 
 
 we just need to wipe their memories said harry its better like that itll throw them off the scent if we killed them itd be obvious we were here 
 
 youre the boss said ron sounding profoundly relieved but ive never down a memory charm 
 
 nor have i said hermione but i know the theory 
 
 she took a deep calming breath then pointed her wand at dolohovs forehead and said obliviate 
 
 at once dolohovs eyes became unfocused and dreamy 
 
 brilliant said harry clapping her on the back take care of the other one and the waitress while ron and i clear up 
 
 clear up said ron looking around at the partly destroyed caf why 
 
 dont you think they might wonder whats happened if they wake up and find themselves in a place that looks like its just been bombed 
 
 oh right yeah 
 
 ron struggled for a moment before managing to extract his wand from his pocket 
 
 its no wonder i cant get it out hermione you packed my old jeans theyre tight 
 
 oh im so sorry hissed hermione and as she dragged the waitress out of sight of the windows harry heard her mutter a suggestion as to where ron could stick his wand instead 
 
 once the caf was restored to its previous condition they heaved the death eaters back into their booth and propped them up facing each other but how did they find us hermione asked looking from one inert man to the other how did they know where we were 
 
 she turned to harry 
 
 you c you dont think youve still got your trace on you do you harry 
 
 he cant have said ron the trace breaks at seventeen thats wizarding law you cant put it on an adult 
 
 as far as you know said hermione what if the death eaters have found a way to put it on a 
 
 but harry hasnt been near a death eater in the last hours whos supposed to have put a trace back on him 
 
 hermione did not reply harry felt contaminated tainted was that really how the death eaters had found them 
 
 if i cant use magic and you cant use magic near me without us giving away our position c he began 
 
 were not splitting up said hermione firmly 
 
 we need a safe place to hide said ron give us time to think things through 
 
 grimmauld place said harry 
 
 the other two gaped 
 
 dont be silly harry snape can get in there 
 
 rons dad said theyve put up jinxes against him c and even if they havent worked he pressed on as hermione began to argue so what i swear id like nothing better than to meet snape 
 
 but c 
 
 hermione where else is there its the best chance weve got snapes only one death eater if ive still got the trace on me well have whole crowds of them on us wherever else we go 
 
 she could not argue though she looked as if she would have liked to while she unlocked the caf door ron clicked the deluminator to release the cafs light then on harrys count of three they reversed the spells upon their three victims and before the waitress or either of the death eaters could do more than stir sleepily harry ron and hermione had turned on the spot and vanished into the compressing darkness once more 
 
 seconds later harrys lungs expanded gratefully and he opened his eyes they were now standing in the middle of a familiar small and shabby square tall dilapidated houses looked down on them from every side number twelve was visible to them for they had been told of its existence by dumbledore its and they rushed toward it checking every few yards that they were not being followed or observed they raced up the stone steps and harry tapped the front door once with his wand they heard a series of metallic clicks and the clatter of a chain then the door swung open with a creak and they hurried over the threshold 
 
 as harry closed the door behind them the gas lamps sprang into life casting flickering light along the length of the hallway it looked just as harry remembered it eerie cobwebbed the outlines of the heads on the wall throwing odd shadows up the staircase long dark curtains concealed the portrait of siriuss mother the only thing that was out of place was the trolls leg umbrella stand which was lying on its side as if tonks had just knocked it over again 
 
 i think somebodys been in here hermione whispered pointing toward it 
 
 that couldve happened as the order left ron murmured back 
 
 so where are these jinxes they put up against snape harry asked 
 
 maybe theyre only activated if he shows up suggested ron 
 
 yet they remained close together on the doormat backs against the door scared to move farther into the house 
 
 well we cant stay here forever said harry and he took a step forward 
 
 severus snape 
 
 moodys voice whispered out of the darkness making all three of them jump back in fright were not snape croaked harry before something whooshed over him like cold air and his tongue curled backward on itself making it impossible to speak before he had time to feel inside his mouth however his tongue had unraveled again 
 
 the other two seemed to have experienced the same unpleasant sensation ron was making retching noises hermione stammered that have the curse set up for snape 
 
 gingerly harry took another step forward something shifted in the shadows at the end of the hall and before any of them could say another word a figure had risen up out of the carpet tall and terrible hermione screamed and so did mrs black her curtains flying open the gray figure was gliding toward them faster and faster its hair and beard streaming behind it its face sunken fleshless with empty eye sockets horribly familiar dreadfully altered it raised a wasted arm pointing at harry 
 
 no harry shouted and though he had raised his wand no spell occurred to him no it wasnt us we didnt kill you c 
 
 on the word kill the figure exploded in a great cloud of dust coughing his eyes watering harry looked around to see hermione crouched on the floor by the door with her arms over her head and ron who was shaking from head to foot patting her clumsily on the shoulder and saying its all its 
 
 dust swirled around harry like mist catching the blue gaslight as mrs black continued to scream 
 
 mudbloods filth stains of dishonor taint of shame on the house of my fathers c 
 
 shut up harry bellowed directing his wand at her and with a bang and a burst of red sparks the curtains swung shut again silencing her 
 
 that that was hermione whimpered as ron helped her to her feet 
 
 yeah said harry but it wasnt really him was it just something to scare snape 
 
 had it worked harry wondered or had snape already blasted the aside as casually as he had killed the real dumbledore nerves still tingling he led the other two up the hall some new terror to reveal itself but nothing moved except for a mouse skittering along the skirting board 
 
 before we go any farther i think wed better check whispered hermione and she raised her wand and said homenum revelio 
 
 nothing happened 
 
 well youve just had a big shock said ron kindly what was that supposed to do 
 
 it did what i meant it to do said hermione rather crossly that was a spell to reveal human presence and theres nobody here except us 
 
 and old dusty said ron glancing at the patch of carpet from which the had risen 
 
 lets go up said hermione with a frightened look at the same spot and she led the way up the creaking stairs to the drawing room on the first floor 
 
 hermione waved her wand to ignite the old gas lamps then shivering slightly in the drafty room she perched on the sofa her arms wrapped tightly around her ron crossed to the window and moved the heavy velvet curtains aside an inch 
 
 cant see anyone out there he reported and youd think if harry still had a trace on him theyd have followed us here i know they cant get in the house but c whats up harry 
 
 harry had given a cry of pain his scar had burned against as something flashed across his mind like a bright light on water he saw a large shadow and felt a fury that was not his own pound through his body violent and brief as an electric shock 
 
 what did you see ron asked advancing on harry did you see him at my place 
 
 no i just felt anger c hes really angry c 
 
 but that could be at the burrow said ron loudly what else didnt you see anything was he cursing someone 
 
 no i just felt anger c i couldnt tell c 
 
 harry felt badgered confused and hermione did not help as she said in a frightened voice your scar again but whats going on i thought that connection had closed 
 
 it did for a while muttered harry his scar was still painful which made it hard to concentrate i c i think its started opening again whenever he loses control thats how it used to c 
 
 but then youve got to close your mind said hermione shrilly harry dumbledore didnt want you to use that connection he wanted you to shut it down thats why you were supposed to use occlumency otherwise voldemort can plant false images in your mind remember c 
 
 yeah i do remember thanks said harry through gritted teeth he did not need hermione to tell him that voldemort had once used this selfsame connection between them to lead him into a trap nor that it had resulted in siriuss death he wished that he had not told them what he had seen and felt it made voldemort more threatening as though he were pressing against the window of the room and still the pain in his scar was building and he fought it it was like resisting the urge to be sick 
 
 he turned his back on ron and hermione pretending to examine the old tapestry of the black family tree on the wall then hermione shrieked harry drew his wand again and spun around to see a silver patronus soar through the drawing room window and land upon the floor in front of them where it solidified into the weasel that spoke with the voice of rons father 
 
 family safe do not reply we are being watched 
 
 the patronus dissolved into nothingness ron let out a noise between a whimper and a groan and dropped onto the sofa hermione joined him gripping his arm 
 
 theyre all right theyre all right she whispered and ron half laughed and hugged her 
 
 harry he said over hermiones shoulder i c 
 
 its not a problem said harry sickened by the pain in his head its your family course you were worried id feel the same way he thought of ginny i do feel the same way 
 
 the pain in his scar was reaching a peak burning as it had back in the garden of the burrow faintly he heard hermione say i dont want to be on my own could we use the sleeping bags ive brought and camp in here tonight 
 
 he heard ron agree he could not fight the pain much longer he had to succumb 
 
 bathroom he muttered and he left the room as fast as he could without running 
 
 he barely made it bolting the door behind him with trembling hands he grasped his pounding head and fell to the floor then in an explosion of agony he felt the rage that did not belong to him possess his soul saw a long room lit only by firelight and the giant blond death eater on the floor screaming and writhing and a slighter figure standing over him wand outstretched while harry spoke in a high cold merciless voice 
 
 more rowle or shall we end it and feed you to nagini lord voldemort is not sure that he will forgive this time you called me back for this to tell me that harry potter has escaped again draco give rowle another taste of our displeasure do it or feel my wrath yourself 
 
 a log fell in the fire flames reared their light darting across a terrified pointed white face c with a sense of emerging from deep water harry drew heaving breaths and opened his eyes 
 
 he was on the cold black marble floor his nose inches from one of the silver serpent tails that supported the large bathtub he sat up malfoys gaunt petrified face seemed burned on the inside of his eyes harry felt sickened by what he had seen by the use to which draco was now being put by voldemort 
 
 there was a sharp rap on the door and harry jumped as hermiones voice rang out 
 
 harry do you want your toothbrush ive got it here 
 
 yeah great thanks he said fighting to keep his voice casual as he stood up to let her in 
 
 rowling

 where else is there asked hermione cringing as the men on the other side of the road started at her we can hardly book rooms at the leaky cauldron can we and grimmauld place is out if snape can get in there i suppose we could try my parents home though i think theres a chance they might check there oh i wish theyd shut up 
 
 all right darling the drunkest of the men on the other pavement was yelling fancy a drink ditch ginger and come and have a pint 
 
 lets sit down somewhere hermione said hastily as ron opened his mouth to shout back across the road look this will do in here 
 
 it was a small and shabby caf a light layer of grease lay on all the tables but it was at least empty harry slipped into a booth first and ron sat next to him opposite hermione who had her back to the entrance and did not like it she glanced over her shoulder so frequently she appeared to have a twitch harry did not like being stationary walking had given the illusion that they had a goal beneath the cloak he could feel the last vestiges of polyjuice leaving him his hands returning to their usual length and shape he pulled his glasses out of his pocket and put them on again 
 
 after a minute or two ron said you know were not far from the leaky cauldron here its only in charing cross c 
 
 ron we cant said hermione at once 
 
 not to stay there but to find out whats going on 
 
 we know whats going on voldemorts taken over the ministry what else do we need to know 
 
 okay okay it was just an idea 
 
 they relapsed into a prickly silence the waitress shuffled over and hermione ordered two cappuccinos as harry was invisible it would have looked odd to order him one a pair of burly workmen entered the caf and squeezed into the next booth hermione dropped her voice to a whisper 
 
 i say we find a quiet place to disapparate and head for the countryside once were there we could send a message to the order 
 
 can you do that talking patronus thing then asked ron 
 
 ive been practicing and i think so said hermione 
 
 well as long as it doesnt get them into trouble though they mightve been arrested already god thats revolting ron added after one sip of the foamy grayish coffee the waitress had heard she shot ron a nasty look as she shuffled off to take the new customers orders the larger of the two workmen who was blond and quite huge now that harry came to look at him waved her away she stared affronted 
 
 lets get going then i dont want to drink this muck said ron hermione have you got muggle money to pay for this 
 
 yes i took out all my building society savings before i came to the burrow ill bet all the change is at the bottom sighed hermione reaching for her beaded bag 
 
 the two workmen made identical movements and harry mirrored them without conscious thought all three of them drew their wands ron a few seconds late in realizing what was going on lunged across the table pushing hermione sideways onto her bench the force of the death eaters spells shattered the tiled wall where rons head had just been as harry still invisible yelled stupefy 
 
 the great blond death eater was hit in the face by a jet of red light he slumped sideways unconscious his companion unable to see who had cast the spell fired another at ron shining black ropes flew from his and bound ron head to foot c the waitress screamed and ran for the door c harry sent another stunning spell at the death eater with the twisted face who had tied up ron but the spell missed rebounded on the window and hit the waitress who collapsed in front of the door 
 
 expulso bellowed the death eater and the table behind which harry was standing blew up the force of the explosion slammed him into the wall and he felt his wand leave his hand as the cloak slipped off him 
 
 petrificus totalus screamed hermione from out of sight and the death eater fell forward like a statue to land with a crunching thud on the mess of broken china table and coffee hermione crawled out from underneath the bench shaking bits of glass ashtray out of her hair and trembling all over 
 
 she said pointing her wand at ron who roared in pain as she slashed open the knee of his jeans leaving a deep cut oh im so sorry ron my hands shaking diffindo 
 
 the severed ropes fell away ron got to his feet shaking his arms to regain feeling in them harry picked up his wand and climbed over all the debris to where the large blond death eater was sprawled across the bench 
 
 i shouldve recognized him he was there the night dumbledore died he said he turned over the darker death eater with his foot the mans eyes moved rapidly between harry ron and hermione 
 
 thats dolohov said ron i recognize him from the old wanted posters i think the big ones thorfinn rowle 
 
 never mind what theyre called said hermione a little hysterically how did they find us what are we going to do 
 
 somehow her panic seemed to clear harrys head 
 
 lock the door he told her and ron turn out the lights 
 
 he looked down at the paralyzed dolohov thinking fast as the lock clicked and ron used the deluminator to plunge the caf into darkness harry could hear the men who had jeered at hermione earlier yelling at another girl in the distance 
 
 what are we going to do with them ron whispered to harry through the dark then even more quietly kill them theyd kill us they had a good go just now 
 
 hermione shuddered and took a step backward harry shook his head 
 
 we just need to wipe their memories said harry its better like that itll throw them off the scent if we killed them itd be obvious we were here 
 
 youre the boss said ron sounding profoundly relieved but ive never down a memory charm 
 
 nor have i said hermione but i know the theory 
 
 she took a deep calming breath then pointed her wand at dolohovs forehead and said obliviate 
 
 at once dolohovs eyes became unfocused and dreamy 
 
 brilliant said harry clapping her on the back take care of the other one and the waitress while ron and i clear up 
 
 clear up said ron looking around at the partly destroyed caf why 
 
 dont you think they might wonder whats happened if they wake up and find themselves in a place that looks like its just been bombed 
 
 oh right yeah 
 
 ron struggled for a moment before managing to extract his wand from his pocket 
 
 its no wonder i cant get it out hermione you packed my old jeans theyre tight 
 
 oh im so sorry hissed hermione and as she dragged the waitress out of sight of the windows harry heard her mutter a suggestion as to where ron could stick his wand instead 
 
 once the caf was restored to its previous condition they heaved the death eaters back into their booth and propped them up facing each other but how did they find us hermione asked looking from one inert man to the other how did they know where we were 
 
 she turned to harry 
 
 you c you dont think youve still got your trace on you do you harry 
 
 he cant have said ron the trace breaks at seventeen thats wizarding law you cant put it on an adult 
 
 as far as you know said hermione what if the death eaters have found a way to put it on a 
 
 but harry hasnt been near a death eater in the last hours whos supposed to have put a trace back on him 
 
 hermione did not reply harry felt contaminated tainted was that really how the death eaters had found them 
 
 if i cant use magic and you cant use magic near me without us giving away our position c he began 
 
 were not splitting up said hermione firmly 
 
 we need a safe place to hide said ron give us time to think things through 
 
 grimmauld place said harry 
 
 the other two gaped 
 
 dont be silly harry snape can get in there 
 
 rons dad said theyve put up jinxes against him c and even if they havent worked he pressed on as hermione began to argue so what i swear id like nothing better than to meet snape 
 
 but c 
 
 hermione where else is there its the best chance weve got snapes only one death eater if ive still got the trace on me well have whole crowds of them on us wherever else we go 
 
 she could not argue though she looked as if she would have liked to while she unlocked the caf door ron clicked the deluminator to release the cafs light then on harrys count of three they reversed the spells upon their three victims and before the waitress or either of the death eaters could do more than stir sleepily harry ron and hermione had turned on the spot and vanished into the compressing darkness once more 
 
 seconds later harrys lungs expanded gratefully and he opened his eyes they were now standing in the middle of a familiar small and shabby square tall dilapidated houses looked down on them from every side number twelve was visible to them for they had been told of its existence by dumbledore its and they rushed toward it checking every few yards that they were not being followed or observed they raced up the stone steps and harry tapped the front door once with his wand they heard a series of metallic clicks and the clatter of a chain then the door swung open with a creak and they hurried over the threshold 
 
 as harry closed the door behind them the gas lamps sprang into life casting flickering light along the length of the hallway it looked just as harry remembered it eerie cobwebbed the outlines of the heads on the wall throwing odd shadows up the staircase long dark curtains concealed the portrait of siriuss mother the only thing that was out of place was the trolls leg umbrella stand which was lying on its side as if tonks had just knocked it over again 
 
 i think somebodys been in here hermione whispered pointing toward it 
 
 that couldve happened as the order left ron murmured back 
 
 so where are these jinxes they put up against snape harry asked 
 
 maybe theyre only activated if he shows up suggested ron 
 
 yet they remained close together on the doormat backs against the door scared to move farther into the house 
 
 well we cant stay here forever said harry and he took a step forward 
 
 severus snape 
 
 moodys voice whispered out of the darkness making all three of them jump back in fright were not snape croaked harry before something whooshed over him like cold air and his tongue curled backward on itself making it impossible to speak before he had time to feel inside his mouth however his tongue had unraveled again 
 
 the other two seemed to have experienced the same unpleasant sensation ron was making retching noises hermione stammered that have the curse set up for snape 
 
 gingerly harry took another step forward something shifted in the shadows at the end of the hall and before any of them could say another word a figure had risen up out of the carpet tall and terrible hermione screamed and so did mrs black her curtains flying open the gray figure was gliding toward them faster and faster its hair and beard streaming behind it its face sunken fleshless with empty eye sockets horribly familiar dreadfully altered it raised a wasted arm pointing at harry 
 
 no harry shouted and though he had raised his wand no spell occurred to him no it wasnt us we didnt kill you c 
 
 on the word kill the figure exploded in a great cloud of dust coughing his eyes watering harry looked around to see hermione crouched on the floor by the door with her arms over her head and ron who was shaking from head to foot patting her clumsily on the shoulder and saying its all its 
 
 dust swirled around harry like mist catching the blue gaslight as mrs black continued to scream 
 
 mudbloods filth stains of dishonor taint of shame on the house of my fathers c 
 
 shut up harry bellowed directing his wand at her and with a bang and a burst of red sparks the curtains swung shut again silencing her 
 
 that that was hermione whimpered as ron helped her to her feet 
 
 yeah said harry but it wasnt really him was it just something to scare snape 
 
 had it worked harry wondered or had snape already blasted the aside as casually as he had killed the real dumbledore nerves still tingling he led the other two up the hall some new terror to reveal itself but nothing moved except for a mouse skittering along the skirting board 
 
 before we go any farther i think wed better check whispered hermione and she raised her wand and said homenum revelio 
 
 nothing happened 
 
 well youve just had a big shock said ron kindly what was that supposed to do 
 
 it did what i meant it to do said hermione rather crossly that was a spell to reveal human presence and theres nobody here except us 
 
 and old dusty said ron glancing at the patch of carpet from which the had risen 
 
 lets go up said hermione with a frightened look at the same spot and she led the way up the creaking stairs to the drawing room on the first floor 
 
 hermione waved her wand to ignite the old gas lamps then shivering slightly in the drafty room she perched on the sofa her arms wrapped tightly around her ron crossed to the window and moved the heavy velvet curtains aside an inch 
 
 cant see anyone out there he reported and youd think if harry still had a trace on him theyd have followed us here i know they cant get in the house but c whats up harry 
 
 harry had given a cry of pain his scar had burned against as something flashed across his mind like a bright light on water he saw a large shadow and felt a fury that was not his own pound through his body violent and brief as an electric shock 
 
 what did you see ron asked advancing on harry did you see him at my place 
 
 no i just felt anger c hes really angry c 
 
 but that could be at the burrow said ron loudly what else didnt you see anything was he cursing someone 
 
 no i just felt anger c i couldnt tell c 
 
 harry felt badgered confused and hermione did not help as she said in a frightened voice your scar again but whats going on i thought that connection had closed 
 
 it did for a while muttered harry his scar was still painful which made it hard to concentrate i c i think its started opening again whenever he loses control thats how it used to c 
 
 but then youve got to close your mind said hermione shrilly harry dumbledore didnt want you to use that connection he wanted you to shut it down thats why you were supposed to use occlumency otherwise voldemort can plant false images in your mind remember c 
 
 yeah i do remember thanks said harry through gritted teeth he did not need hermione to tell him that voldemort had once used this selfsame connection between them to lead him into a trap nor that it had resulted in siriuss death he wished that he had not told them what he had seen and felt it made voldemort more threatening as though he were pressing against the window of the room and still the pain in his scar was building and he fought it it was like resisting the urge to be sick 
 
 he turned his back on ron and hermione pretending to examine the old tapestry of the black family tree on the wall then hermione shrieked harry drew his wand again and spun around to see a silver patronus soar through the drawing room window and land upon the floor in front of them where it solidified into the weasel that spoke with the voice of rons father 
 
 family safe do not reply we are being watched 
 
 the patronus dissolved into nothingness ron let out a noise between a whimper and a groan and dropped onto the sofa hermione joined him gripping his arm 
 
 theyre all right theyre all right she whispered and ron half laughed and hugged her 
 
 harry he said over hermiones shoulder i c 
 
 its not a problem said harry sickened by the pain in his head its your family course you were worried id feel the same way he thought of ginny i do feel the same way 
 
 the pain in his scar was reaching a peak burning as it had back in the garden of the burrow faintly he heard hermione say i dont want to be on my own could we use the sleeping bags ive brought and camp in here tonight 
 
 he heard ron agree he could not fight the pain much longer he had to succumb 
 
 bathroom he muttered and he left the room as fast as he could without running 
 
 he barely made it bolting the door behind him with trembling hands he grasped his pounding head and fell to the floor then in an explosion of agony he felt the rage that did not belong to him possess his soul saw a long room lit only by firelight and the giant blond death eater on the floor screaming and writhing and a slighter figure standing over him wand outstretched while harry spoke in a high cold merciless voice 
 
 more rowle or shall we end it and feed you to nagini lord voldemort is not sure that he will forgive this time you called me back for this to tell me that harry potter has escaped again draco give rowle another taste of our displeasure do it or feel my wrath yourself 
 
 a log fell in the fire flames reared their light darting across a terrified pointed white face c with a sense of emerging from deep water harry drew heaving breaths and opened his eyes 
 
 he was on the cold black marble floor his nose inches from one of the silver serpent tails that supported the large bathtub he sat up malfoys gaunt petrified face seemed burned on the inside of his eyes harry felt sickened by what he had seen by the use to which draco was now being put by voldemort 
 
 there was a sharp rap on the door and harry jumped as hermiones voice rang out 
 
 harry do you want your toothbrush ive got it here 
 
 yeah great thanks he said fighting to keep his voice casual as he stood up to let her in 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the deathly hallows

 by hans christian andersen 
 
 near the rampart which encircles copenhagen lies a 
 great red house balsams and other flowers greet us from the long rows of windows in the house whose interior is sufficiently 
 and poor and old are the people who inhabit it 
 the building is the warton almshouse 
 
 look at the window there leans an old maid she plucks the 
 withered leaf from the balsam and looks at the rampart on which many children are playing what is the old maid thinking of a whole life drama is unfolding itself before her inward gaze the poor little children how happy they are how merrily they 
 play and romp together what red cheeks and what angels eyes but 
 they have no shoes nor stockings they dance on the green rampart 
 just on the place where according to the old story the ground always 
 sank in and where a sportive frolicsome child had been lured by 
 means of flowers toys and sweetmeats into an open grave ready dug for it and which was afterwards closed over the child and from that 
 moment the old story says the ground gave way no longer the mound remained firm and fast and was quickly covered with the green turf the little people who now play on that spot know nothing of the old tale else would they fancy they heard a child crying deep below the earth and the dewdrops on each blade of grass would be to them tears of woe nor do they know anything of the danish king who here in the face of the coming foe took an oath before all his trembling courtiers that he would hold out with the citizens of his capital and die here in his nest they know nothing of the men who have fought here or of the women who from here have drenched with boiling water the enemy clad in white and biding in the snow to surprise the city 
 
 no the poor little ones are playing with light childish 
 spirits play on play on thou little maiden soon the years will 
 come yes those glorious years the priestly hands have been laid 
 on the candidates for confirmation hand in hand they walk on the 
 green rampart thou hast a white frock on it has cost thy mother much labor and yet it is only cut down for thee out of an old larger 
 dress you will also wear a red shawl and what if it hang too far 
 down people will only see how large how very large it is you are 
 thinking of your dress and of the giver of all good so glorious is 
 it to wander on the green rampart 
 
 and the years roll by they have no lack of dark days but you

 know not how you met oh how often you walk together on the rampart in the fresh spring on the high days and holidays when all the world come out to walk upon the ramparts and all the bells of the church steeples seem to be singing a song of praise for the coming spring 
 
 scarcely have the violets come forth but there on the rampart

 bright with the first green buds every year this tree sends forth 
 fresh green shoots alas it is not so with the human heart dark

 happy families are all alike every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way 
 everything was in confusion in the house the wife had discovered that the husband was carrying on an intrigue with a french girl who had been a governess in their family and she had announced to her husband that she could not go on living in the same house with him this position of affairs had now lasted two days and not only the husband and wife themselves but all the members of their family and the household were painfully conscious of it all the members of the family and the household felt that there was no sense in their living together and that even stray people brought together by chance in any inn had more in common with one another than they the members of the family and the household of the oblonskys the wife did not leave her own apartments the husband had not been home for two days the children ran wild all over the house the english governess quarreled with the housekeeper and wrote to a friend asking her to look out for a new employ for her the man cook had walked off the day before just at dinnertime the kitchenmaid and the coachman had given warning 
 two days after the quarrel prince stepan arkadyevich oblonsky stiva as he was called in the fashionable world woke up at his usual hour that is at eight in the morning not in his bedroom but on the sofa in his study he turned over his stout person on the springy sofa as though he would sink into a long sleep again he vigorously embraced the pillow on its other side and buried his face in it but all at once he jumped up sat up on the sofa and opened his eyes 
 yes yes how was it now he thought going over his dream yes how was it yes alabin was giving a dinner at darmstadt no not darmstadt but something american yes but then darmstadt was in america yes alabin was giving a dinner on glass tables and the tables sang il mio tesoro no not il mio tesoro but something better and there were some sort of little decanters on the table and at the same time these decanters were women he recalled

 chapter 
 
 stepan arkadyevich was a truthful man in his relations with himself he was incapable of and of persuading himself that he repented his conduct he could not at this date repent the fact that he handsome susceptible to love a man of was not in love with his wife the mother of five living and two dead children and only a year younger than himself all he repented was that he had not succeeded better in hiding this from his wife but he felt all the difficulty of his position and was sorry for his wife his children and himself possibly he might have managed to conceal his sins better from his wife if he had anticipated that the knowledge of them would have had such an effect upon her he had never clearly reflected on the subject but he had vaguely conceived that his wife must long ago have suspected him of being unfaithful to her and had shut her eyes to the fact he had even supposed that she a woman no longer young or and in no way remarkable or uncommon merely a good mother ought from a sense of fairness to take an indulgent view it had turned out quite the other way 
 oh awful oh dear oh dear awful stepan arkadyevich kept repeating to himself and he could think of nothing to be done and how well things were going up till now how well we got on she was contented and happy in her children i never interfered with her in anything i let her manage the children and the house just as she liked true bad her having been a governess in our house bad something common vulgar in flirting with governess but what a governess he vividly recalled the roguish black eyes of mlle roland and her smile but after all while she was in the house i kept myself in hand and the worst of it all is that already it seems as if ill luck would have it so oh oh but what what is to be done 
 there was no solution save that universal solution which life gives to all questions even the most complex and insolvable one must live in the needs of the day that is forget oneself to forget himself in sleep was impossible now at least till nighttime he could not go back now to the music sung by the decanter women so he must forget himself in the dream of daily life 
 then we shall see stepan arkadyevich said to himself and getting up he put on a gray dressing gown lined with blue silk tied the tassels in a knot and drawing a deep breath of air into his broad chest he walked to the window with his usual confident step turning out his feet that carried his full frame so easily he pulled up the blind and rang the bell loudly it was at once answered by the appearance of an old friend his valet matvei carrying his clothes his boots and a telegram matvei was followed by the barber with all the necessaries for shaving 
 are there any papers from the board asked stepan arkadyevich taking the telegram and seating himself at the looking glass 
 on the table replied matvei glancing with inquiring sympathy at his master and after a short pause he added with a sly smile 
 sent from the carriage jobber 
 stepan arkadyevich made no reply but merely glanced at matvei in the looking glass the glance in which their eyes met in the looking glass made it clear that they understood one another stepan eyes seemed to ask why do you tell me that you know 
 matvei put his hands in his jacket pockets thrust out one leg and gazed silently with a faint smile at his master 
 i told them to come on sunday and till then not to trouble you or themselves for nothing he said he had obviously prepared the sentence beforehand 
 stepan arkadyevich saw matvei wanted to make a joke and attract attention to himself tearing open the telegram he read it through guessing at the words misspelled as they always are in telegrams and his face brightened 
 matvei my sister anna arkadyevna will be here tomorrow he said checking for a minute the sleek plump hand of the barber cutting a pink path between his long curly side whiskers 
 thank god said matvei showing by this response that he like his master realized the significance of this arrival anna arkadyevna the sister his master was so fond of might bring about a reconciliation between husband and wife 
 alone or with her husband inquired matvei 
 stepan arkadyevich could not answer as the barber was at work on his upper lip and he raised one finger matvei nodded at the looking glass 
 alone is the room to be got ready upstairs 
 inform darya alexandrovna where she orders 
 darya alexandrovna matvei repeated as though in doubt 
 yes inform her here take the telegram give it to her and then do what she tells you 
 you want to try it out matvei guessed but only said yes sir

 stepan arkadyevich was a truthful man in his relations with himself he was incapable of and of persuading himself that he repented his conduct he could not at this date repent the fact that he handsome susceptible to love a man of was not in love with his wife the mother of five living and two dead children and only a year younger than himself all he repented was that he had not succeeded better in hiding this from his wife but he felt all the difficulty of his position and was sorry for his wife his children and himself possibly he might have managed to conceal his sins better from his wife if he had anticipated that the knowledge of them would have had such an effect upon her he had never clearly reflected on the subject but he had vaguely conceived that his wife must long ago have suspected him of being unfaithful to her and had shut her eyes to the fact he had even supposed that she a woman no longer young or and in no way remarkable or uncommon merely a good mother ought from a sense of fairness to take an indulgent view it had turned out quite the other way 
 oh awful oh dear oh dear awful stepan arkadyevich kept repeating to himself and he could think of nothing to be done and how well things were going up till now how well we got on she was contented and happy in her children i never interfered with her in anything i let her manage the children and the house just as she liked true bad her having been a governess in our house bad something common vulgar in flirting with governess but what a governess he vividly recalled the roguish black eyes of mlle roland and her smile but after all while she was in the house i kept myself in hand and the worst of it all is that already it seems as if ill luck would have it so oh oh but what what is to be done 
 there was no solution save that universal solution which life gives to all questions even the most complex and insolvable one must live in the needs of the day that is forget oneself to forget himself in sleep was impossible now at least till nighttime he could not go back now to the music sung by the decanter women so he must forget himself in the dream of daily life 
 then we shall see stepan arkadyevich said to himself and getting up he put on a gray dressing gown lined with blue silk tied the tassels in a knot and drawing a deep breath of air into his broad chest he walked to the window with his usual confident step turning out his feet that carried his full frame so easily he pulled up the blind and rang the bell loudly it was at once answered by the appearance of an old friend his valet matvei carrying his clothes his boots and a telegram matvei was followed by the barber with all the necessaries for shaving 
 are there any papers from the board asked stepan arkadyevich taking the telegram and seating himself at the looking glass 
 on the table replied matvei glancing with inquiring sympathy at his master and after a short pause he added with a sly smile 
 sent from the carriage jobber 
 stepan arkadyevich made no reply but merely glanced at matvei in the looking glass the glance in which their eyes met in the looking glass made it clear that they understood one another stepan eyes seemed to ask why do you tell me that you know 
 matvei put his hands in his jacket pockets thrust out one leg and gazed silently with a faint smile at his master 
 i told them to come on sunday and till then not to trouble you or themselves for nothing he said he had obviously prepared the sentence beforehand 
 stepan arkadyevich saw matvei wanted to make a joke and attract attention to himself tearing open the telegram he read it through guessing at the words misspelled as they always are in telegrams and his face brightened 
 matvei my sister anna arkadyevna will be here tomorrow he said checking for a minute the sleek plump hand of the barber cutting a pink path between his long curly side whiskers 
 thank god said matvei showing by this response that he like his master realized the significance of this arrival anna arkadyevna the sister his master was so fond of might bring about a reconciliation between husband and wife

 when he was dressed stepan arkadyevich sprinkled some scent on himself pulled down his shirt cuffs distributed into his pockets his cigarettes pocketbook matches and watch with its double chain and seals and shaking out his handkerchief feeling himself clean fragrant healthy and physically at ease in spite of his misfortune he walked with a slight swing of each leg into the dining room where coffee was already waiting for him and alongside of his cup the letters and papers from the office 
 he read the letters one was very unpleasant from a merchant who was buying a forest on his property to sell this forest was absolutely essential but at present until he was reconciled with his wife the subject could not be discussed the most unpleasant thing of all was that his pecuniary interests should in this way enter into the question of his reconciliation with his wife and the idea that he might be led on by his interests that he might seek a reconciliation with his wife on account of the sale of the forest that idea hurt him 
 when he had finished his letters stepan arkadyevich moved the office papers close to him rapidly looked through two cases made a few notes with a big pencil and pushing away the papers turned to his coffee sipping it he opened a still damp morning paper and began to read it 
 stepan arkadyevich took in and read a liberal paper not an extreme one but one advocating the views held by the majority and in spite of the fact that science art and politics had no special interest for him he firmly held those views on all these subjects which were held by the majority and by his paper and he only changed them when the majority changed them or more strictly speaking he did not change them but they imperceptibly changed of themselves within him 
 stepan arkadyevich had not chosen his political opinions or his views these political opinions and views had come to him of themselves just as he did not choose the shapes of his hat and coat but simply accepted those that were being worn and for him living in a certain society owing to the need ordinarily developed at years of discretion for some degree of mental activity to have views was just as indispensable as to have a hat if there was a reason for his preferring liberal to conservative views which were held also by many of his circle it arose not from his considering liberalism more rational but from its being in closer accordance with his manner of life the liberal party said that in russia everything was wrong and indeed stepan arkadyevich had many debts and was decidedly short of money the liberal party said that marriage was an institution quite out of date and that it stood in need of reconstruction and indeed family life afforded stepan arkadyevich little gratification and forced him into lying and hypocrisy which were so repulsive to his nature the liberal party said or rather allowed it to be understood that religion was only a curb to keep in check the barbarous classes of the people and indeed stepan arkadyevich could not stand through even a short service without his legs aching and could never make out what was the object of all the terrible and language about another world when life might be so very amusing in this world and with all this stepan arkadyevich who liked a merry joke was fond of embarrassing some plain man by saying that if one were to pride oneself on origin one ought not to stop at rurik and disown the founder of the line the monkey and so liberalism had become a habit of stepan arkadyevich and he liked his newspaper as he did his cigar after dinner for the slight fog it diffused in his brain he read the leading article which maintained that it was quite senseless in our day to raise an outcry that radicalism was threatening to swallow up all conservative elements and that the government ought to take measures to crush the revolutionary hydra that on the contrary in our opinion the danger lies not in that imaginary revolutionary hydra but in the obstinacy of traditionalism clogging progress etc etc he read another article too a financial one which alluded to bentham and mill and dropped some innuendoes reflecting on the ministry with his characteristic he caught the drift of each innuendo divined whence it came at whom and on what ground it was aimed and that afforded him as it always did a certain gratification but today that gratification was embittered by matriona advice and the unsatisfactory state of his household he read too that count beist was rumored to have left for wiesbaden and that one need have no more gray hair and of the sale of a light carriage and of a young person seeking a situation but these items of information did not give him as usual a quiet ironical gratification 
 having finished the paper a second cup of coffee and a roll and butter he got up shaking the crumbs off his waistcoat and squaring his broad chest he smiled joyously not because there was anything particularly agreeable in his mind the joyous smile was evoked by a good digestion 
 but this joyous smile at once recalled everything to him and he grew thoughtful 
 two childish voices stepan arkadyevich recognized the voices of grisha his youngest boy and tania his eldest girl were heard outside the door they were carrying something and dropped it 
 i told you not to sit passengers on the roof said the little girl in english there pick them up 
 in confusion thought stepan arkadyevich there are the children running about by themselves and going to the door he called them they left off the box that represented a train and came in to their father 
 the little girl her favorite ran up boldly embraced him and hung laughingly on his neck enjoying as she always did the smell of scent that came from his whiskers at last the little girl kissed his face which was flushed from his stooping posture and beaming with tenderness loosed her hands and was about to run away again but her father held her back 
 how is mamma he asked passing his hand over his smooth soft little neck good morning he said smiling to the boy who had come up to greet him 
 he was conscious that he loved the boy less and always tried to be fair but the boy felt it and did not smile responsively to his chilly smile 
 mamma she is up answered the girl 
 stepan arkadyevich sighed 
 that means she slept again all night he thought 
 well is she cheerful 
 the little girl knew that there was a quarrel between her father and mother and that her mother could not be cheerful and that her father must be aware of this and that he was pretending when he asked about it so lightly and she blushed for her father he at once perceived it and blushed too 
 i know she said she did not say we must do our lessons but she said we were to go for a walk with miss hoole to 
 well go tania my darling oh wait a minute though he said still holding her and stroking her soft little hand 
 he took off the mantelpiece where he had put it yesterday a little box of sweets and gave her two picking out her favorites a chocolate and a bonbon 
 for grisha said the little girl pointing to the chocolate 
 yes yes and still stroking her little shoulder he kissed the nape of her neck and let her go 
 the carriage is ready said matvei but someone to see you with a petition 
 been here long asked stepan arkadyevich 
 half an hour or so 
 how many times have i told you to tell me at once 
 one must let you drink your coffee in peace at least said matvei in the affectionately gruff tone with which it was impossible to be angry 
 well show the person up at once said oblonsky frowning with vexation 
 the petitioner the widow of a staff captain kalinin came with a request impossible and unreasonable but stepan arkadyevich as he generally did made her sit down heard her to the end attentively without interrupting her and gave her detailed advice as to how and to whom to apply and even wrote for her easily and clearly in his large sprawling calligraphic and legible hand a little note to a personage who might be of use to her having got rid of the staff widow stepan arkadyevich took his hat and stopped to recollect whether he had forgotten anything it appeared that he had forgotten nothing except what he wanted to forget his wife 
 ah yes he bowed his head and his handsome face assumed a melancholy expression to go or not to go he said to himself and an inner voice told him he must not go that nothing could come of it but falsity that to amend to set right their relations was impossible because it was impossible to make her attractive again and able to inspire love or to make him an old man not susceptible to love except deceit and lying nothing could come of it now and deceit and lying were opposed to his nature 
 it must be some day though it go on like this he said trying to give himself courage he set straight his chest took out a cigarette lighted it took two whiffs at it flung it into a ash tray and with rapid steps walked through the drawing room and opened the other door into his bedroom

 when he was dressed stepan arkadyevich sprinkled some scent on himself pulled down his shirt cuffs distributed into his pockets his cigarettes pocketbook matches and watch with its double chain and seals and shaking out his handkerchief feeling himself clean fragrant healthy and physically at ease in spite of his misfortune he walked with a slight swing of each leg into the dining room where coffee was already waiting for him and alongside of his cup the letters and papers from the office 
 he read the letters one was very unpleasant from a merchant who was buying a forest on his property to sell this forest was absolutely essential but at present until he was reconciled with his wife the subject could not be discussed the most unpleasant thing of all was that his pecuniary interests should in this way enter into the question of his reconciliation with his wife and the idea that he might be led on by his interests that he might seek a reconciliation with his wife on account of the sale of the forest that idea hurt him 
 when he had finished his letters stepan arkadyevich moved the office papers close to him rapidly looked through two cases made a few notes with a big pencil and pushing away the papers turned to his coffee sipping it he opened a still damp morning paper and began to read it 
 stepan arkadyevich took in and read a liberal paper not an extreme one but one advocating the views held by the majority and in spite of the fact that science art and politics had no special interest for him he firmly held those views on all these subjects which were held by the majority and by his paper and he only changed them when the majority changed them or more strictly speaking he did not change them but they imperceptibly changed of themselves within him 
 stepan arkadyevich had not chosen his political opinions or his views these political opinions and views had come to him of themselves just as he did not choose the shapes of his hat and coat but simply accepted those that were being worn and for him living in a certain society owing to the need ordinarily developed at years of discretion for some degree of mental activity to have views was just as indispensable as to have a hat if there was a reason for his preferring liberal to conservative views which were held also by many of his circle it arose not from his considering liberalism more rational but from its being in closer accordance with his manner of life the liberal party said that in russia everything was wrong and indeed stepan arkadyevich had many debts and was decidedly short of money the liberal party said that marriage was an institution quite out of date and that it stood in need of reconstruction and indeed family life afforded stepan arkadyevich little gratification and forced him into lying and hypocrisy which were so repulsive to his nature the liberal party said or rather allowed it to be understood that religion was only a curb to keep in check the barbarous classes of the people and indeed stepan arkadyevich could not stand through even a short service without his legs aching and could never make out what was the object of all the terrible and language about another world when life might be so very amusing in this world and with all this stepan arkadyevich who liked a merry joke was fond of embarrassing some plain man by saying that if one were to pride oneself on origin one ought not to stop at rurik and disown the founder of the line the monkey and so liberalism had become a habit of stepan arkadyevich and he liked his newspaper as he did his cigar after dinner for the slight fog it diffused in his brain he read the leading article which maintained that it was quite senseless in our day to raise an outcry that radicalism was threatening to swallow up all conservative elements and that the government ought to take measures to crush the revolutionary hydra that on the contrary in our opinion the danger lies not in that imaginary revolutionary hydra but in the obstinacy of traditionalism clogging progress etc etc he read another article too a financial one which alluded to bentham and mill and dropped some innuendoes reflecting on the ministry with his characteristic he caught the drift of each innuendo divined whence it came at whom and on what ground it was aimed and that afforded him as it always did a certain gratification but today that gratification was embittered by matriona advice and the unsatisfactory state of his household he read too that count beist was rumored to have left for wiesbaden and that one need have no more gray hair and of the sale of a light carriage and of a young person seeking a situation but these items of information did not give him as usual a quiet ironical gratification 
 having finished the paper a second cup of coffee and a roll and butter he got up shaking the crumbs off his waistcoat and squaring his broad chest he smiled joyously not because there was anything particularly agreeable in his mind the joyous smile was evoked by a good digestion 
 but this joyous smile at once recalled everything to him and he grew thoughtful 
 two childish voices stepan arkadyevich recognized the voices of grisha his youngest boy and tania his eldest girl were heard outside the door they were carrying something and dropped it 
 i told you not to sit passengers on the roof said the little girl in english there pick them up 
 in confusion thought stepan arkadyevich there are the children running about by themselves and going to the door he called them they left off the box that represented a train and came in to their father 
 the little girl her favorite ran up boldly embraced him and hung laughingly on his neck enjoying as she always did the smell of scent that came from his whiskers at last the little girl kissed his face which was flushed from his stooping posture and beaming with tenderness loosed her hands and was about to run away again but her father held her back 
 how is mamma he asked passing his hand over his smooth soft little neck good morning he said smiling to the boy who had come up to greet him 
 he was conscious that he loved the boy less and always tried to be fair but the boy felt it and did not smile responsively to his chilly smile 
 mamma she is up answered the girl 
 stepan arkadyevich sighed 
 that means she slept again all night he thought 
 well is she cheerful 
 the little girl knew that there was a quarrel between her father and mother and that her mother could not be cheerful and that her father must be aware of this and that he was pretending when he asked about it so lightly and she blushed for her father he at once perceived it and blushed too 
 i know she said she did not say we must do our lessons but she said we were to go for a walk with miss hoole to 
 well go tania my darling oh wait a minute though he said still holding her and stroking her soft little hand 
 he took off the mantelpiece where he had put it yesterday a little box of sweets and gave her two picking out her favorites a chocolate and a bonbon 
 for grisha said the little girl pointing to the chocolate 
 yes yes and still stroking her little shoulder he kissed the nape of her neck and let her go

 darya alexandrovna in a dressing jacket and with her now scanty hair once luxuriant and beautiful fastened up with hairpins on the nape of her neck with a sunken thin face and large startled eyes which looked prominent from the thinness of her face was standing among a litter of all sorts of things scattered all over the room before an open bureau from which she was taking something hearing her steps she stopped looking toward the door and trying in vain to give her features a severe and contemptuous expression she felt she was afraid of him and afraid of the coming interview she was just attempting to do what she had attempted to do ten times already in these last three days to sort out the things and her own so as to take them to her and again she could not bring herself to do this but now again as each time before she kept saying to herself that things cannot go on like this that she must undertake something punish him put him to shame avenge on him some little part at least of the suffering he had caused her she still continued to tell herself that she should leave him but she was conscious that this was impossible it was impossible because she could not get out of the habit of regarding him as her husband and of loving him besides this she realized that if even here in her own house she could hardly manage to look after her five children properly they would be still worse off where she was going with all of them as it was even in the course of these three days the youngest was unwell from being given unwholesome soup and the others had almost gone without their dinner the day before she was conscious that it was impossible to go away but cheating herself she went on all the same sorting out her things and pretending she was going 
 seeing her husband she dropped her hands into the drawer of the bureau as though looking for something and only looked round at him when he had come quite up to her but her face to which she tried to give a severe and resolute expression expressed bewilderment and suffering 
 dolly he said in a subdued and timid voice he had hunched up his shoulders and tried to look pitiful and humble but for all that he was radiant with freshness and health in a rapid glance she scanned his figure beaming with freshness and health yes he is happy and content she thought while i and that disgusting good nature which everyone likes him for and praises i hate that good nature of his she thought her mouth stiffened the muscles of the cheek trembled on the right side of her pale nervous face 
 what do you want she said in a rapid deep unnatural voice 
 dolly he repeated with a quiver in his voice anna is coming today 
 well what is that to me i see her she cried 
 but you must really dolly 
 go away go away go away she shrieked without looking at him as though this shriek were called up by physical pain 
 stepan arkadyevich could be calm when he thought of his wife he could hope that everything would come round as matvei expressed it and had been able to go on reading his paper and drinking his coffee but when he saw her tortured suffering face heard the tone of her voice submissive to fate and full of despair his breath was cut short and a lump came to this throat and his eyes began to shine with tears 
 my god what have i done dolly for sake you know he could not go on there was a sob in his throat 
 she shut the bureau with a slam and glanced at him 
 dolly what can i say one thing forgive me remember cannot nine years of our life atone for an instant 
 she dropped her eyes and listened expecting what he would say as if beseeching him in some way or other to make her believe differently 
 instant of passion he said and would have gone on but at that word as at a pang of physical pain her lips stiffened again and again the muscles of her right cheek worked 
 go away go out of the room she shrieked still more shrilly and talk to me of your passions and your vilenesses 
 she tried to go out but tottered and clung to the back of a chair to support herself his face relaxed his lips became puffy tears welled up in his eyes 
 dolly he said sobbing now for sake think of the children they are not to blame i am to blame punish me then make me expiate my fault anything i can do i am ready to do i am to blame no words can express how much i am to blame but dolly forgive me 
 she sat down he listened to her hard heavy breathing and he was unutterably sorry for her she made several attempts to speak but could not he waited 
 you remember the children stiva to play with them but i remember and know that they go to ruin now she said obviously one of the phrases she had more than once repeated to herself in the course of the last three days 
 she had called him stiva and he glanced at her with gratitude and moved to take her hand but she drew back from him with aversion 
 i remember the children and for that reason i would do anything in the world to save them but i myself know the means by taking them away from their father or by leaving them with a vicious father yes a vicious father tell me after what has happened can we live together is that possible do tell me is it possible she repeated raising her voice after my husband the father of my children enters into a love affair with his own governess 
 but to be done to be done he kept saying in a pitiful voice not knowing what he was saying as his head sank lower and lower 
 you are loathsome to me repulsive she shrieked getting more and more heated your tears mean nothing you have never loved me you have neither a heart nor a sense of honor you are hateful to me disgusting a stranger yes a complete stranger with pain and wrath she uttered the word so terrible to herself stranger 
 he looked at her and the fury expressed in her face alarmed and amazed him he did not understand that it was his pity for her that exasperated her she saw in him compassion for her but not love no she hates me she will not forgive me he thought 
 it is awful awful he said 
 at that moment in the next room a child began to cry probably it had fallen down darya alexandrovna listened and her face suddenly softened 
 she seemed pulling herself together for a few seconds as though she did not know where she was nor what she was doing and getting up rapidly she moved toward the door 
 well she loves my child he thought noticing the change of her face at the cry my child how can she hate me then 
 dolly one word more he said following her 
 if you follow me i will call in the servants and the children let them all know you are a scoundrel i am going away at once and you may live here with your mistress 
 and she went out slamming the door 
 stepan arkadyevich sighed mopped his face and with a subdued tread walked out of the room matvei says everything will come round but how i see the least chance of it ah ah how horrible it is and how vulgarly she shouted he said to himself remembering her shrieks and the words scoundrel and mistress and very likely the maids were listening horribly vulgar horribly stepan arkadyevich stood a few seconds alone wiped his eyes thrust out his chest and walked out of the room 
 it was friday and in the dining room the watchmaker a german was winding up the clock stepan arkadyevich remembered his joke about this punctual bald watchmaker that the german was wound up for a whole lifetime himself to wind up watches and he smiled stepan arkadyevich was fond of a nice joke and maybe it will come round a good expression come round he thought i must tell that 
 matvei he shouted arrange everything with marya in the sitting room for anna arkadyevna he said to matvei when he came in 
 yes sir 
 stepan arkadyevich put on his fur coat and went out on the front steps 
 you dine at home said matvei seeing him off 
 it all depends but for the housekeeping he said taking ten roubles from his pocketbook will it be enough 
 enough or not enough we must make it do said matvei slamming the carriage door and going back to the steps 
 darya alexandrovna meanwhile having pacified the child and knowing from the sound of the carriage that he had gone off went back to her bedroom it was her only refuge from the household cares which crowded upon her directly she went out from it even now in the short time she had been in the nursery the english governess and matriona philimonovna had succeeded in putting several questions to her which did not admit of delay and which only she could answer what were the children to put on for their walk should they have any milk should not a new cook be sent for 
 ah let me alone let me alone she said and going back to her bedroom she sat down in the same place she had occupied when talking to her husband clasping tightly her thin hands her rings slipping down on her bony fingers and fell to going over her recollections of the entire interview he has gone but what has he finally arrived at with her she thought can it be he sees her why i ask him no no reconciliation is impossible even if we remain in the same house we are strangers strangers forever she repeated again with special significance the word so dreadful to her and how i loved him my god how i loved him how i loved him and now i love him i love him more than before the most horrible thing is she began but did not finish her thought because matriona philimonovna put her head in at the door 
 let us send for my brother she said he can get a dinner anyway or we shall have the children getting nothing to eat till six again like yesterday 
 very well i will come directly and see about it but did you send for some new milk 
 and darya alexandrovna plunged into the duties of the day and drowned her grief in them for a time

 darya alexandrovna in a dressing jacket and with her now scanty hair once luxuriant and beautiful fastened up with hairpins on the nape of her neck with a sunken thin face and large startled eyes which looked prominent from the thinness of her face was standing among a litter of all sorts of things scattered all over the room before an open bureau from which she was taking something hearing her steps she stopped looking toward the door and trying in vain to give her features a severe and contemptuous expression she felt she was afraid of him and afraid of the coming interview she was just attempting to do what she had attempted to do ten times already in these last three days to sort out the things and her own so as to take them to her and again she could not bring herself to do this but now again as each time before she kept saying to herself that things cannot go on like this that she must undertake something punish him put him to shame avenge on him some little part at least of the suffering he had caused her she still continued to tell herself that she should leave him but she was conscious that this was impossible it was impossible because she could not get out of the habit of regarding him as her husband and of loving him besides this she realized that if even here in her own house she could hardly manage to look after her five children properly they would be still worse off where she was going with all of them as it was even in the course of these three days the youngest was unwell from being given unwholesome soup and the others had almost gone without their dinner the day before she was conscious that it was impossible to go away but cheating herself she went on all the same sorting out her things and pretending she was going 
 seeing her husband she dropped her hands into the drawer of the bureau as though looking for something and only looked round at him when he had come quite up to her but her face to which she tried to give a severe and resolute expression expressed bewilderment and suffering 
 dolly he said in a subdued and timid voice he had hunched up his shoulders and tried to look pitiful and humble but for all that he was radiant with freshness and health in a rapid glance she scanned his figure beaming with freshness and health yes he is happy and content she thought while i and that disgusting good nature which everyone likes him for and praises i hate that good nature of his she thought her mouth stiffened the muscles of the cheek trembled on the right side of her pale nervous face 
 what do you want she said in a rapid deep unnatural voice 
 dolly he repeated with a quiver in his voice anna is coming today 
 well what is that to me i see her she cried 
 but you must really dolly 
 go away go away go away she shrieked without looking at him as though this shriek were called up by physical pain 
 stepan arkadyevich could be calm when he thought of his wife he could hope that everything would come round as matvei expressed it and had been able to go on reading his paper and drinking his coffee but when he saw her tortured suffering face heard the tone of her voice submissive to fate and full of despair his breath was cut short and a lump came to this throat and his eyes began to shine with tears 
 my god what have i done dolly for sake you know he could not go on there was a sob in his throat 
 she shut the bureau with a slam and glanced at him 
 dolly what can i say one thing forgive me remember cannot nine years of our life atone for an instant 
 she dropped her eyes and listened expecting what he would say as if beseeching him in some way or other to make her believe differently 
 instant of passion he said and would have gone on but at that word as at a pang of physical pain her lips stiffened again and again the muscles of her right cheek worked 
 go away go out of the room she shrieked still more shrilly and talk to me of your passions and your vilenesses 
 she tried to go out but tottered and clung to the back of a chair to support herself his face relaxed his lips became puffy tears welled up in his eyes 
 dolly he said sobbing now for sake think of the children they are not to blame i am to blame punish me then make me expiate my fault anything i can do i am ready to do i am to blame no words can express how much i am to blame but dolly forgive me 
 she sat down he listened to her hard heavy breathing and he was unutterably sorry for her she made several attempts to speak but could not he waited 
 you remember the children stiva to play with them but i remember and know that they go to ruin now she said obviously one of the phrases she had more than once repeated to herself in the course of the last three days 
 she had called him stiva and he glanced at her with gratitude and moved to take her hand but she drew back from him with aversion 
 i remember the children and for that reason i would do anything in the world to save them but i myself know the means by taking them away from their father or by leaving them with a vicious father yes a vicious father tell me after what has happened can we live together is that possible do tell me is it possible she repeated raising her voice after my husband the father of my children enters into a love affair with his own governess 
 but to be done to be done he kept saying in a pitiful voice not knowing what he was saying as his head sank lower and lower 
 you are loathsome to me repulsive she shrieked getting more and more heated your tears mean nothing you have never loved me you have neither a heart nor a sense of honor you are hateful to me disgusting a stranger yes a complete stranger with pain and wrath she uttered the word so terrible to herself stranger 
 he looked at her and the fury expressed in her face alarmed and amazed him he did not understand that it was his pity for her that exasperated her she saw in him compassion for her but not love no she hates me she will not forgive me he thought 
 it is awful awful he said 
 at that moment in the next room a child began to cry probably it had fallen down darya alexandrovna listened and her face suddenly softened 
 she seemed pulling herself together for a few seconds as though she did not know where she was nor what she was doing and getting up rapidly she moved toward the door 
 well she loves my child he thought noticing the change of her face at the cry my child how can she hate me then 
 dolly one word more he said following her 
 if you follow me i will call in the servants and the children let them all know you are a scoundrel i am going away at once and you may live here with your mistress 
 and she went out slamming the door 
 stepan arkadyevich sighed mopped his face and with a subdued tread walked out of the room matvei says everything will come round but how i see the least chance of it ah ah how horrible it is and how vulgarly she shouted he said to himself remembering her shrieks and the words scoundrel and mistress and very likely the maids were listening horribly vulgar horribly stepan arkadyevich stood a few seconds alone wiped his eyes thrust out his chest and walked out of the room 
 it was friday and in the dining room the watchmaker a german was winding up the clock stepan arkadyevich remembered his joke about this punctual bald watchmaker that the german was wound up for a whole lifetime himself to wind up watches and he smiled stepan arkadyevich was fond of a nice joke and maybe it will come round a good expression come round he thought i must tell that 
 matvei he shouted arrange everything with marya in the sitting room for anna arkadyevna he said to matvei when he came in

 stepan arkadyevich put on his fur coat and went out on the front steps

 chapter 
 
 stepan arkadyevich had learned easily at school thanks to his excellent abilities but he had been idle and mischievous and therefore was one of the lowest in his class but in spite of his habitually dissipated mode of life his inferior grade in the service and his comparative youth he occupied the honorable and lucrative position of president of one of the government boards at moscow this post he had received through his sister husband alexei alexandrovich karenin who held one of the most important positions in the ministry to which the moscow office belonged but if karenin had not got his this berth then through a hundred other personages brothers sisters cousins uncles and aunts stiva oblonsky would have received this post or some other like it together with the salary of six thousand absolutely needful for him as his affairs in spite of his considerable property were in a poor state 
 half moscow and peterburg were friends and relations of stepan arkadyevich he was born in the midst of those who had been and had become the powerful ones of this world of the men in the government the older men had been friends of his and had known him in pinafores another third were his intimate chums and the remainder were friendly acquaintances consequently the distributors of earthly blessings in the shape of posts rents concessions and such were all his friends and could not overlook one of their own set and oblonsky had no need to make any special exertion to get a lucrative post he had only not to refuse things not to show jealousy not to be quarrelsome or take offense all of which from his characteristic good nature he never did it would have struck him as absurd if he had been told that he would not get a position with the salary he required especially as he expected nothing out of the way he only wanted what the men of his own age and standing did get and he was no worse qualified for performing duties of this kind than any other man 
 stepan arkadyevich was not merely liked by all who knew him for his good humor his bright disposition and his unquestionable honesty in him in his handsome radiant figure his sparkling eyes black hair and eyebrows and his white and pink complexion there was something which produced a physical effect of kindliness and good humor on the people who met him aha stiva oblonsky the man himself was almost always said with a smile of delight on meeting him even though it happened at times that after a conversation with him it seemed that nothing particularly delightful had happened the next day and the next everyone was just as delighted to meet him again 
 after filling for two years the post of president of one of the government boards at moscow stepan arkadyevich had won the respect as well as the liking of his fellow officials subordinates and superiors and all who had had business with him the principal qualities in stepan arkadyevich which had gained him this universal respect in the service consisted in the first place of his extreme indulgence for others founded on a consciousness of his own shortcomings secondly of his perfect liberalism not the liberalism he read of in the papers but the liberalism that was in his blood in virtue of which he treated all men perfectly equally and exactly the same whatever their fortune or rank might be and thirdly the most important point of his complete indifference to the business in which he was engaged in consequence of which he was never carried away and made no mistakes 
 on reaching the offices of the board stepan arkadyevich escorted by a deferential porter with a portfolio went into his little private room put on his uniform and went into the board room the clerks and officials all rose greeting him with deference stepan arkadyevich moved quickly as always to his place shook hands with the members of the board and sat down he made a joke or two and talked just as much as was consistent with due decorum and began work no one knew better than stepan arkadyevich how to hit on that exact limit of freedom simplicity and official stiffness which is necessary for the agreeable conduct of business a secretary with the deference common to everyone in stepan office came up with papers and began to speak in the familiar and easy tone which had been introduced by stepan arkadyevich 
 we have succeeded in getting the information from the government department of penza here would you care 
 got it at last said stepan arkadyevich laying his finger on the paper now gentlemen 
 and the sitting of the board began 
 if they but knew he thought inclining his head with an important air and listening to the report what a guilty little boy their president was half an hour ago and his eyes were laughing during the reading of the report till two the sitting would go on without a break then there would be an interval and luncheon 
 it was not yet two when the large glass doors of the board room suddenly opened and someone came in 
 all the members of the board sitting at the table from below the portrait of the czar and from behind the mirror of justice delighted at any distraction looked round at the door but the doorkeeper standing there at once drove out the intruder and closed the glass door after him 
 when the case had been read through stepan arkadyevich got up and stretched and by way of tribute to the liberalism of the times took out a cigarette being in the board room and went into his private room two of his board fellows the old veteran in the service nikitin and the kammerjunker grinevich went in with him 
 we shall have time to finish after lunch said stepan arkadyevich 
 to be sure we shall said nikitin 
 a pretty sharp fellow this fomin must be said grinevich of one of the persons taking part in the case they were examining 
 stepan arkadyevich frowned at words giving him thereby to understand that it was improper to pass judgment prematurely and made him no reply 
 who was it who came in he asked the doorkeeper 
 some fellow your excellency sneaked in without permission directly my back was turned he was asking for you i told him when the members come out then 
 where is he 
 maybe gone into the passage he was strolling here till now he said the doorkeeper pointing to a strongly built broad shouldered man with a curly beard who without taking off his sheepskin cap was running lightly and rapidly up the worn steps of the stone staircase one of the officials going down a lean fellow with a portfolio stood out of his way looked disapprovingly at the legs of the running man and then glanced inquiringly at oblonsky 
 stepan arkadyevich was standing at the top of the stairs his beaming face above the embroidered collar of his uniform beamed more than ever when he recognized the man coming up 
 why actually you levin at last he said with a friendly mocking smile gazing on the approaching man how is it you have deigned to look me up in this den said stepan arkadyevich and not content with shaking hands he kissed his friend have you been here long 
 i have just come and very much wanted to see you said levin looking about him shyly and at the same time angrily and uneasily 
 well go into my room said stepan arkadyevich who knew his sensitive and irritable shyness and taking his arm he drew him along as though guiding him through dangers 
 stepan arkadyevich was on familiar terms with almost all his acquaintances and called almost all of them by their christian names old men of sixty boys of twenty actors ministers merchants and adjutant generals so that many of his intimate chums were to be found at the extreme ends of the social ladder and would have been very much surprised to learn that they had through the medium of oblonsky something in common he was the familiar friend of everyone with whom he took a glass of champagne and he took a glass of champagne with everyone and when in consequence he met any of his disreputable chums as he used in joke to call many of his friends in the presence of his subordinates he well knew how with his characteristic tact to diminish any possible disagreeable impression levin was not a disreputable chum but oblonsky with his ready tact felt that levin fancied oblonsky might not care to show his intimacy with him before subordinates and so stepan arkadyevich made haste to take him off into his room 
 levin was almost of the same age as oblonsky their intimacy did not rest merely on champagne levin had been the friend and companion of his early youth they were fond of one another in spite of the difference of their characters and tastes as friends are fond of one another who have been together in early youth but in spite of this each of them as is often the way with men who have selected careers of different kinds though in discussion he would even justify the career in his heart despised it it seemed to each of them that the life he led himself was the only real life and the life led by his friend was a mere phantasm oblonsky could not restrain a slight mocking smile at the sight of levin how often he had seen him come up to moscow from the country where he was doing something but what precisely stepan arkadyevich could never quite make out and indeed took no interest in the matter levin arrived in moscow always excited and in a hurry rather ill at ease and irritated by his own want of ease and for the most part with a perfectly new unexpected view of things stepan arkadyevich laughed at this and liked it in the same way levin in his heart despised the town mode of life of his friend and his official duties which he laughed at and regarded as trifling but the difference was that oblonsky since he was doing the same as everyone did laughed assuredly and while levin laughed without assuredness and sometimes angrily 
 we have long been expecting you said stepan arkadyevich going into his room and letting hand go as though to show that here all danger was over i am very very glad to see you he went on well what now how are you when did you come 
 
 levin was silent looking at the unfamiliar faces of two companions and especially at the elegant hands with such long white fingers such long yellow nails curved at their end and such huge shining studs on the shirt cuff that apparently these hands absorbed all his attention and allowed him no freedom of thought oblonsky noticed this at once and smiled 
 ah to be sure let me introduce you he said my colleagues philip ivanich nikitin mikhail stanislavich grinevich and turning to levin a zemstvo member a modern zemstvo man a gymnast who lifts five poods with one hand a cattle breeder and sportsman and my friend constantin dmitrievich levin the brother of sergei ivanovich koznishev 
 delighted said the veteran 
 i have the honor of knowing your brother sergei ivanovich said grinevich holding out his slender hand with its long nails 
 levin frowned shook hands coldly and at once turned to oblonsky though he had a great respect for his an author well known to all russia he could not endure it when people treated him not as constantin levin but as the brother of the celebrated koznishev 
 no i am no longer a zemstvo man i have quarreled with them all and go to the sessions any more he said turning to oblonsky 
 been quick about it said oblonsky with a smile but how why 
 a long story i will tell you some time said levin but began telling him at once well to put it shortly i was convinced that nothing was really done by the zemstvo councils or ever could be he began as though someone had just insulted him on one side a plaything they play at being a parliament and neither young enough nor old enough to find amusement in playthings and on the other side he stammered a means for the coterie of the district to feather their nests formerly they did this through wardships and courts of justice now they do it through the zemstvo instead of taking the bribes they take the unearned salary he said as hotly as though one of those present had opposed his opinion 
 aha in a new phase again i see a conservative said stepan arkadyevich however we can go into that later 
 yes later but i had to see you said levin looking with hatred at hand 
 stepan arkadyevich gave a scarcely perceptible smile 
 but you used to say never wear european dress again he said gazing on new suit obviously cut by a french tailor so i see a new phase 
 levin suddenly blushed not as grown men blush slightly without being themselves aware of it but as boys blush feeling that they are ridiculous through their shyness and consequently ashamed of it and blushing still more almost to the point of tears and it was so strange to see this sensible manly face in such a childish plight that oblonsky left off looking at him 
 oh where shall we meet you know i want very much to talk to you said levin 
 oblonsky seemed to ponder 
 tell you what go to to lunch and there we can talk i am free till three 
 no answered levin after an thought i have another visit to make 
 all right then dine together 
 dine together but i have nothing very particular just a word or two a question then a little chatting 
 well have your word or two right now and talk it over in the course of the dinner 
 well this said levin however of no importance 
 his face suddenly assumed an expression of anger from the effort he was making to surmount his shyness 
 what are the shcherbatskys doing everything as it used to be he said 
 stepan arkadyevich who had long known that levin was in love with his kitty gave a hardly perceptible smile and his eyes sparkled merrily 
 said your word or two but i answer in a few words because excuse me for just a minute 
 a secretary came in with respectful familiarity and the modest consciousness characteristic of every secretary of superiority to his chief in the knowledge of affairs he went up to oblonsky with some papers and began under pretense of asking a question to explain some objection stepan arkadyevich without hearing him out laid his hand genially on the sleeve 
 no you do as i told you he said smoothing his remark with a smile and with a brief explanation of his view of the matter he moved away the papers and said so do it that way if you please zakhar nikitich 
 the secretary retired in confusion during the consultation with the secretary levin had completely recovered from his embarrassment he was standing with elbows on the back of a chair and on his face was a look of ironical attention 
 i understand it i understand it he said 
 what you understand said oblonsky smiling just as cheerfully and picking up a cigarette he expected some queer outburst from levin 
 i understand what you are doing said levin shrugging his shoulders how can you be serious about it 
 why not 
 why because nothing in it 
 you think so yet overwhelmed with work 
 on paper but there a gift for it added levin 
 to say you think a lack of something in me 
 perhaps so said levin but all the same i admire your grandeur and am proud to have such a great person as a friend not answered my question though he went on with a desperate effort looking oblonsky straight in the face 
 oh all very well you wait a bit and come to this yourself very nice for you to have three thousand dessiatinas in the karazinsky district and such muscles and the freshness of a girl of twelve still be one of us one day yes as to your question there is no change but a pity been away so long 
 oh why so levin queried frightened 
 oh nothing responded oblonsky talk it over but brought you up to town 
 oh talk about that too later on said levin reddening again up to his ears 
 all right i see said stepan arkadyevich i should ask you to come to us you know but my not quite well but tell you what if you want to see them sure now to be at the zoological gardens from four to five kitty skates you drive along there and come and fetch you and go and dine somewhere together 
 capital so till then 
 now mind forget i know you or rush off home to the country stepan arkadyevich called out laughing 
 no truly

 stepan arkadyevich had learned easily at school thanks to his excellent abilities but he had been idle and mischievous and therefore was one of the lowest in his class but in spite of his habitually dissipated mode of life his inferior grade in the service and his comparative youth he occupied the honorable and lucrative position of president of one of the government boards at moscow this post he had received through his sister husband alexei alexandrovich karenin who held one of the most important positions in the ministry to which the moscow office belonged but if karenin had not got his this berth then through a hundred other personages brothers sisters cousins uncles and aunts stiva oblonsky would have received this post or some other like it together with the salary of six thousand absolutely needful for him as his affairs in spite of his considerable property were in a poor state 
 half moscow and peterburg were friends and relations of stepan arkadyevich he was born in the midst of those who had been and had become the powerful ones of this world of the men in the government the older men had been friends of his and had known him in pinafores another third were his intimate chums and the remainder were friendly acquaintances consequently the distributors of earthly blessings in the shape of posts rents concessions and such were all his friends and could not overlook one of their own set and oblonsky had no need to make any special exertion to get a lucrative post he had only not to refuse things not to show jealousy not to be quarrelsome or take offense all of which from his characteristic good nature he never did it would have struck him as absurd if he had been told that he would not get a position with the salary he required especially as he expected nothing out of the way he only wanted what the men of his own age and standing did get and he was no worse qualified for performing duties of this kind than any other man 
 stepan arkadyevich was not merely liked by all who knew him for his good humor his bright disposition and his unquestionable honesty in him in his handsome radiant figure his sparkling eyes black hair and eyebrows and his white and pink complexion there was something which produced a physical effect of kindliness and good humor on the people who met him aha stiva oblonsky the man himself was almost always said with a smile of delight on meeting him even though it happened at times that after a conversation with him it seemed that nothing particularly delightful had happened the next day and the next everyone was just as delighted to meet him again 
 after filling for two years the post of president of one of the government boards at moscow stepan arkadyevich had won the respect as well as the liking of his fellow officials subordinates and superiors and all who had had business with him the principal qualities in stepan arkadyevich which had gained him this universal respect in the service consisted in the first place of his extreme indulgence for others founded on a consciousness of his own shortcomings secondly of his perfect liberalism not the liberalism he read of in the papers but the liberalism that was in his blood in virtue of which he treated all men perfectly equally and exactly the same whatever their fortune or rank might be and thirdly the most important point of his complete indifference to the business in which he was engaged in consequence of which he was never carried away and made no mistakes 
 on reaching the offices of the board stepan arkadyevich escorted by a deferential porter with a portfolio went into his little private room put on his uniform and went into the board room the clerks and officials all rose greeting him with deference stepan arkadyevich moved quickly as always to his place shook hands with the members of the board and sat down he made a joke or two and talked just as much as was consistent with due decorum and began work no one knew better than stepan arkadyevich how to hit on that exact limit of freedom simplicity and official stiffness which is necessary for the agreeable conduct of business a secretary with the deference common to everyone in stepan office came up with papers and began to speak in the familiar and easy tone which had been introduced by stepan arkadyevich 
 we have succeeded in getting the information from the government department of penza here would you care 
 got it at last said stepan arkadyevich laying his finger on the paper now gentlemen 
 and the sitting of the board began 
 if they but knew he thought inclining his head with an important air and listening to the report what a guilty little boy their president was half an hour ago and his eyes were laughing during the reading of the report till two the sitting would go on without a break then there would be an interval and luncheon 
 it was not yet two when the large glass doors of the board room suddenly opened and someone came in 
 all the members of the board sitting at the table from below the portrait of the czar and from behind the mirror of justice delighted at any distraction looked round at the door but the doorkeeper standing there at once drove out the intruder and closed the glass door after him 
 when the case had been read through stepan arkadyevich got up and stretched and by way of tribute to the liberalism of the times took out a cigarette being in the board room and went into his private room two of his board fellows the old veteran in the service nikitin and the kammerjunker grinevich went in with him 
 we shall have time to finish after lunch said stepan arkadyevich 
 to be sure we shall said nikitin 
 a pretty sharp fellow this fomin must be said grinevich of one of the persons taking part in the case they were examining 
 stepan arkadyevich frowned at words giving him thereby to understand that it was improper to pass judgment prematurely and made him no reply 
 who was it who came in he asked the doorkeeper 
 some fellow your excellency sneaked in without permission directly my back was turned he was asking for you i told him when the members come out then 
 where is he 
 maybe gone into the passage he was strolling here till now he said the doorkeeper pointing to a strongly built broad shouldered man with a curly beard who without taking off his sheepskin cap was running lightly and rapidly up the worn steps of the stone staircase one of the officials going down a lean fellow with a portfolio stood out of his way looked disapprovingly at the legs of the running man and then glanced inquiringly at oblonsky 
 stepan arkadyevich was standing at the top of the stairs his beaming face above the embroidered collar of his uniform beamed more than ever when he recognized the man coming up 
 why actually you levin at last he said with a friendly mocking smile gazing on the approaching man how is it you have deigned to look me up in this den said stepan arkadyevich and not content with shaking hands he kissed his friend have you been here long 
 i have just come and very much wanted to see you said levin looking about him shyly and at the same time angrily and uneasily 
 well go into my room said stepan arkadyevich who knew his sensitive and irritable shyness and taking his arm he drew him along as though guiding him through dangers 
 stepan arkadyevich was on familiar terms with almost all his acquaintances and called almost all of them by their christian names old men of sixty boys of twenty actors ministers merchants and adjutant generals so that many of his intimate chums were to be found at the extreme ends of the social ladder and would have been very much surprised to learn that they had through the medium of oblonsky something in common he was the familiar friend of everyone with whom he took a glass of champagne and he took a glass of champagne with everyone and when in consequence he met any of his disreputable chums as he used in joke to call many of his friends in the presence of his subordinates he well knew how with his characteristic tact to diminish any possible disagreeable impression levin was not a disreputable chum but oblonsky with his ready tact felt that levin fancied oblonsky might not care to show his intimacy with him before subordinates and so stepan arkadyevich made haste to take him off into his room 
 levin was almost of the same age as oblonsky their intimacy did not rest merely on champagne levin had been the friend and companion of his early youth they were fond of one another in spite of the difference of their characters and tastes as friends are fond of one another who have been together in early youth but in spite of this each of them as is often the way with men who have selected careers of different kinds though in discussion he would even justify the career in his heart despised it it seemed to each of them that the life he led himself was the only real life and the life led by his friend was a mere phantasm oblonsky could not restrain a slight mocking smile at the sight of levin how often he had seen him come up to moscow from the country where he was doing something but what precisely stepan arkadyevich could never quite make out and indeed took no interest in the matter levin arrived in moscow always excited and in a hurry rather ill at ease and irritated by his own want of ease and for the most part with a perfectly new unexpected view of things stepan arkadyevich laughed at this and liked it in the same way levin in his heart despised the town mode of life of his friend and his official duties which he laughed at and regarded as trifling but the difference was that oblonsky since he was doing the same as everyone did laughed assuredly and while levin laughed without assuredness and sometimes angrily 
 we have long been expecting you said stepan arkadyevich going into his room and letting hand go as though to show that here all danger was over i am very very glad to see you he went on well what now how are you when did you come 
 
 levin was silent looking at the unfamiliar faces of two companions and especially at the elegant hands with such long white fingers such long yellow nails curved at their end and such huge shining studs on the shirt cuff that apparently these hands absorbed all his attention and allowed him no freedom of thought oblonsky noticed this at once and smiled 
 ah to be sure let me introduce you he said my colleagues philip ivanich nikitin mikhail stanislavich grinevich and turning to levin a zemstvo member a modern zemstvo man a gymnast who lifts five poods with one hand a cattle breeder and sportsman and my friend constantin dmitrievich levin the brother of sergei ivanovich koznishev 
 delighted said the veteran 
 i have the honor of knowing your brother sergei ivanovich said grinevich holding out his slender hand with its long nails 
 levin frowned shook hands coldly and at once turned to oblonsky though he had a great respect for his an author well known to all russia he could not endure it when people treated him not as constantin levin but as the brother of the celebrated koznishev 
 no i am no longer a zemstvo man i have quarreled with them all and go to the sessions any more he said turning to oblonsky 
 been quick about it said oblonsky with a smile but how why 
 a long story i will tell you some time said levin but began telling him at once well to put it shortly i was convinced that nothing was really done by the zemstvo councils or ever could be he began as though someone had just insulted him on one side a plaything they play at being a parliament and neither young enough nor old enough to find amusement in playthings and on the other side he stammered a means for the coterie of the district to feather their nests formerly they did this through wardships and courts of justice now they do it through the zemstvo instead of taking the bribes they take the unearned salary he said as hotly as though one of those present had opposed his opinion 
 aha in a new phase again i see a conservative said stepan arkadyevich however we can go into that later 
 yes later but i had to see you said levin looking with hatred at hand 
 stepan arkadyevich gave a scarcely perceptible smile 
 but you used to say never wear european dress again he said gazing on new suit obviously cut by a french tailor so i see a new phase 
 levin suddenly blushed not as grown men blush slightly without being themselves aware of it but as boys blush feeling that they are ridiculous through their shyness and consequently ashamed of it and blushing still more almost to the point of tears and it was so strange to see this sensible manly face in such a childish plight that oblonsky left off looking at him 
 oh where shall we meet you know i want very much to talk to you said levin 
 oblonsky seemed to ponder 
 tell you what go to to lunch and there we can talk i am free till three 
 no answered levin after an thought i have another visit to make 
 all right then dine together 
 dine together but i have nothing very particular just a word or two a question then a little chatting 
 well have your word or two right now and talk it over in the course of the dinner 
 well this said levin however of no importance 
 his face suddenly assumed an expression of anger from the effort he was making to surmount his shyness 
 what are the shcherbatskys doing everything as it used to be he said 
 stepan arkadyevich who had long known that levin was in love with his kitty gave a hardly perceptible smile and his eyes sparkled merrily 
 said your word or two but i answer in a few words because excuse me for just a minute 
 a secretary came in with respectful familiarity and the modest consciousness characteristic of every secretary of superiority to his chief in the knowledge of affairs he went up to oblonsky with some papers and began under pretense of asking a question to explain some objection stepan arkadyevich without hearing him out laid his hand genially on the sleeve 
 no you do as i told you he said smoothing his remark with a smile and with a brief explanation of his view of the matter he moved away the papers and said so do it that way if you please zakhar nikitich 
 the secretary retired in confusion during the consultation with the secretary levin had completely recovered from his embarrassment he was standing with elbows on the back of a chair and on his face was a look of ironical attention 
 i understand it i understand it he said 
 what you understand said oblonsky smiling just as cheerfully and picking up a cigarette he expected some queer outburst from levin 
 i understand what you are doing said levin shrugging his shoulders how can you be serious about it 
 why not 
 why because nothing in it 
 you think so yet overwhelmed with work 
 on paper but there a gift for it added levin 
 to say you think a lack of something in me 
 perhaps so said levin but all the same i admire your grandeur and am proud to have such a great person as a friend not answered my question though he went on with a desperate effort looking oblonsky straight in the face 
 oh all very well you wait a bit and come to this yourself very nice for you to have three thousand dessiatinas in the karazinsky district and such muscles and the freshness of a girl of twelve still be one of us one day yes as to your question there is no change but a pity been away so long 
 oh why so levin queried frightened 
 oh nothing responded oblonsky talk it over but brought you up to town 
 oh talk about that too later on said levin reddening again up to his ears 
 all right i see said stepan arkadyevich i should ask you to come to us you know but my not quite well but tell you what if you want to see them sure now to be at the zoological gardens from four to five kitty skates you drive along there and come and fetch you and go and dine somewhere together 
 capital so till then 
 now mind forget i know you or rush off home to the country stepan arkadyevich called out laughing 
 no truly 
 and levin went out of the room recalling only when he was in the doorway that he had forgotten to take leave of colleagues 
 that gentleman must be a man of great energy said grinevich when levin had gone away 
 yes my dear sir said stepan arkadyevich nodding his head a lucky fellow three thousand dessiatinas in the karazinsky district everything before him and what youth and vigor not like some of us

 on reaching the offices of the board stepan arkadyevich escorted by a deferential porter with a portfolio went into his little private room put on his uniform and went into the board room the clerks and officials all rose greeting him with deference stepan arkadyevich moved quickly as always to his place shook hands with the members of the board and sat down he made a joke or two and talked just as much as was consistent with due decorum and began work no one knew better than stepan arkadyevich how to hit on that exact limit of freedom simplicity and official stiffness which is necessary for the agreeable conduct of business a secretary with the deference common to everyone in stepan office came up with papers and began to speak in the familiar and easy tone which had been introduced by stepan arkadyevich 
 we have succeeded in getting the information from the government department of penza here would you care 
 got it at last said stepan arkadyevich laying his finger on the paper now gentlemen 
 and the sitting of the board began 
 if they but knew he thought inclining his head with an important air and listening to the report what a guilty little boy their president was half an hour ago and his eyes were laughing during the reading of the report till two the sitting would go on without a break then there would be an interval and luncheon 
 it was not yet two when the large glass doors of the board room suddenly opened and someone came in 
 all the members of the board sitting at the table from below the portrait of the czar and from behind the mirror of justice delighted at any distraction looked round at the door but the doorkeeper standing there at once drove out the intruder and closed the glass door after him 
 when the case had been read through stepan arkadyevich got up and stretched and by way of tribute to the liberalism of the times took out a cigarette being in the board room and went into his private room two of his board fellows the old veteran in the service nikitin and the kammerjunker grinevich went in with him 
 we shall have time to finish after lunch said stepan arkadyevich 
 to be sure we shall said nikitin 
 a pretty sharp fellow this fomin must be said grinevich of one of the persons taking part in the case they were examining 
 stepan arkadyevich frowned at words giving him thereby to understand that it was improper to pass judgment prematurely and made him no reply 
 who was it who came in he asked the doorkeeper 
 some fellow your excellency sneaked in without permission directly my back was turned he was asking for you i told him when the members come out then 
 where is he 
 maybe gone into the passage he was strolling here till now he said the doorkeeper pointing to a strongly built broad shouldered man with a curly beard who without taking off his sheepskin cap was running lightly and rapidly up the worn steps of the stone staircase one of the officials going down a lean fellow with a portfolio stood out of his way looked disapprovingly at the legs of the running man and then glanced inquiringly at oblonsky 
 stepan arkadyevich was standing at the top of the stairs his beaming face above the embroidered collar of his uniform beamed more than ever when he recognized the man coming up 
 why actually you levin at last he said with a friendly mocking smile gazing on the approaching man how is it you have deigned to look me up in this den said stepan arkadyevich and not content with shaking hands he kissed his friend have you been here long 
 i have just come and very much wanted to see you said levin looking about him shyly and at the same time angrily and uneasily 
 well go into my room said stepan arkadyevich who knew his sensitive and irritable shyness and taking his arm he drew him along as though guiding him through dangers 
 stepan arkadyevich was on familiar terms with almost all his acquaintances and called almost all of them by their christian names old men of sixty boys of twenty actors ministers merchants and adjutant generals so that many of his intimate chums were to be found at the extreme ends of the social ladder and would have been very much surprised to learn that they had through the medium of oblonsky something in common he was the familiar friend of everyone with whom he took a glass of champagne and he took a glass of champagne with everyone and when in consequence he met any of his disreputable chums as he used in joke to call many of his friends in the presence of his subordinates he well knew how with his characteristic tact to diminish any possible disagreeable impression levin was not a disreputable chum but oblonsky with his ready tact felt that levin fancied oblonsky might not care to show his intimacy with him before subordinates and so stepan arkadyevich made haste to take him off into his room 
 levin was almost of the same age as oblonsky their intimacy did not rest merely on champagne levin had been the friend and companion of his early youth they were fond of one another in spite of the difference of their characters and tastes as friends are fond of one another who have been together in early youth but in spite of this each of them as is often the way with men who have selected careers of different kinds though in discussion he would even justify the career in his heart despised it it seemed to each of them that the life he led himself was the only real life and the life led by his friend was a mere phantasm oblonsky could not restrain a slight mocking smile at the sight of levin how often he had seen him come up to moscow from the country where he was doing something but what precisely stepan arkadyevich could never quite make out and indeed took no interest in the matter levin arrived in moscow always excited and in a hurry rather ill at ease and irritated by his own want of ease and for the most part with a perfectly new unexpected view of things stepan arkadyevich laughed at this and liked it in the same way levin in his heart despised the town mode of life of his friend and his official duties which he laughed at and regarded as trifling but the difference was that oblonsky since he was doing the same as everyone did laughed assuredly and while levin laughed without assuredness and sometimes angrily 
 we have long been expecting you said stepan arkadyevich going into his room and letting hand go as though to show that here all danger was over i am very very glad to see you he went on well what now how are you when did you come 
 
 levin was silent looking at the unfamiliar faces of two companions and especially at the elegant hands with such long white fingers such long yellow nails curved at their end and such huge shining studs on the shirt cuff that apparently these hands absorbed all his attention and allowed him no freedom of thought oblonsky noticed this at once and smiled 
 ah to be sure let me introduce you he said my colleagues philip ivanich nikitin mikhail stanislavich grinevich and turning to levin a zemstvo member a modern zemstvo man a gymnast who lifts five poods with one hand a cattle breeder and sportsman and my friend constantin dmitrievich levin the brother of sergei ivanovich koznishev 
 delighted said the veteran 
 i have the honor of knowing your brother sergei ivanovich said grinevich holding out his slender hand with its long nails 
 levin frowned shook hands coldly and at once turned to oblonsky though he had a great respect for his an author well known to all russia he could not endure it when people treated him not as constantin levin but as the brother of the celebrated koznishev 
 no i am no longer a zemstvo man i have quarreled with them all and go to the sessions any more he said turning to oblonsky 
 been quick about it said oblonsky with a smile but how why 
 a long story i will tell you some time said levin but began telling him at once well to put it shortly i was convinced that nothing was really done by the zemstvo councils or ever could be he began as though someone had just insulted him on one side a plaything they play at being a parliament and neither young enough nor old enough to find amusement in playthings and on the other side he stammered a means for the coterie of the district to feather their nests formerly they did this through wardships and courts of justice now they do it through the zemstvo instead of taking the bribes they take the unearned salary he said as hotly as though one of those present had opposed his opinion 
 aha in a new phase again i see a conservative said stepan arkadyevich however we can go into that later 
 yes later but i had to see you said levin looking with hatred at hand 
 stepan arkadyevich gave a scarcely perceptible smile 
 but you used to say never wear european dress again he said gazing on new suit obviously cut by a french tailor so i see a new phase 
 levin suddenly blushed not as grown men blush slightly without being themselves aware of it but as boys blush feeling that they are ridiculous through their shyness and consequently ashamed of it and blushing still more almost to the point of tears and it was so strange to see this sensible manly face in such a childish plight that oblonsky left off looking at him 
 oh where shall we meet you know i want very much to talk to you said levin 
 oblonsky seemed to ponder 
 tell you what go to to lunch and there we can talk i am free till three 
 no answered levin after an thought i have another visit to make 
 all right then dine together 
 dine together but i have nothing very particular just a word or two a question then a little chatting 
 well have your word or two right now and talk it over in the course of the dinner 
 well this said levin however of no importance 
 his face suddenly assumed an expression of anger from the effort he was making to surmount his shyness 
 what are the shcherbatskys doing everything as it used to be he said 
 stepan arkadyevich who had long known that levin was in love with his kitty gave a hardly perceptible smile and his eyes sparkled merrily 
 said your word or two but i answer in a few words because excuse me for just a minute 
 a secretary came in with respectful familiarity and the modest consciousness characteristic of every secretary of superiority to his chief in the knowledge of affairs he went up to oblonsky with some papers and began under pretense of asking a question to explain some objection stepan arkadyevich without hearing him out laid his hand genially on the sleeve 
 no you do as i told you he said smoothing his remark with a smile and with a brief explanation of his view of the matter he moved away the papers and said so do it that way if you please zakhar nikitich 
 the secretary retired in confusion during the consultation with the secretary levin had completely recovered from his embarrassment he was standing with elbows on the back of a chair and on his face was a look of ironical attention 
 i understand it i understand it he said 
 what you understand said oblonsky smiling just as cheerfully and picking up a cigarette he expected some queer outburst from levin 
 i understand what you are doing said levin shrugging his shoulders how can you be serious about it 
 why not 
 why because nothing in it 
 you think so yet overwhelmed with work 
 on paper but there a gift for it added levin 
 to say you think a lack of something in me 
 perhaps so said levin but all the same i admire your grandeur and am proud to have such a great person as a friend not answered my question though he went on with a desperate effort looking oblonsky straight in the face 
 oh all very well you wait a bit and come to this yourself very nice for you to have three thousand dessiatinas in the karazinsky district and such muscles and the freshness of a girl of twelve still be one of us one day yes as to your question there is no change but a pity been away so long 
 oh why so levin queried frightened 
 oh nothing responded oblonsky talk it over but brought you up to town 
 oh talk about that too later on said levin reddening again up to his ears 
 all right i see said stepan arkadyevich i should ask you to come to us you know but my not quite well but tell you what if you want to see them sure now to be at the zoological gardens from four to five kitty skates you drive along there and come and fetch you and go and dine somewhere together 
 capital so till then 
 now mind forget i know you or rush off home to the country stepan arkadyevich called out laughing 
 no truly 
 and levin went out of the room recalling only when he was in the doorway that he had forgotten to take leave of colleagues 
 that gentleman must be a man of great energy said grinevich when levin had gone away 
 yes my dear sir said stepan arkadyevich nodding his head a lucky fellow three thousand dessiatinas in the karazinsky district everything before him and what youth and vigor not like some of us 
 but why are you complaining stepan arkadyevich 
 why it goes hard with me very bad said stepan arkadyevich with a heavy sigh

 when oblonsky asked levin what had brought him to town levin blushed and was furious with himself for blushing because he could not answer i have come to make your a proposal though that was solely what he had come for 
 the families of the levins and the shcherbatskys were old noble moscow families and had always been on intimate and friendly terms this intimacy had grown still closer during student days he had both prepared for the university with the young prince shcherbatsky the brother of kitty and dolly and had entered at the same time with him in those days levin was a frequent visitor at the house of the shcherbatskys and he was in love with the shcherbatsky household strange as it may appear it was with the household the family that constantin levin was in love especially with the feminine half of the household levin did not remember his own mother and his only sister was older than he was so that it was in the house that he saw for the first time that inner life of an old noble cultured and honorable family of which he had been deprived by the death of his father and mother all the members of that family especially the feminine half were pictured by him as it were wrapped about with a mysterious poetical veil and he not only perceived no defects whatever in them but under the poetical veil that shrouded them he assumed the existence of the loftiest sentiments and every possible perfection why it was the three young ladies had one day to speak french and the next english why it was that at certain hours they played by turns on the piano the sounds of which were audible in their room above where the students used to work why they were visited by those professors of french literature of music of drawing of dancing why at certain hours all the three young ladies with mademoiselle linon drove in the coach to the tverskoy boulevard dressed in their satin cloaks dolly in a long one natalie in a one and kitty in one so short that her shapely legs in red stockings were visible to all beholders why it was they had to walk about the tverskoy boulevard escorted by a footman with a gold cockade in his hat all this and much more that was done in their mysterious world he did not understand but he was sure that everything that was done there was very good and he was in love precisely with the mystery of the proceedings 
 in his student days he had all but been in love with the eldest dolly but she was soon married to oblonsky then he began being in love with the second he felt as it were that he had to be in love with one of the sisters only he could not quite make out which but natalie too had hardly made her appearance in the world when she married the diplomat lvov kitty was still a child when levin left the university young shcherbatsky went into the navy was drowned in the baltic and visits to the shcherbatskys despite his friendship with oblonsky became less frequent but when early in the winter of this year levin came to moscow after a year in the country and saw the shcherbatskys he realized which of the three sisters he was indeed destined to love 
 one would have thought that nothing could be simpler than for him a man of good family rather rich than poor and years old to make the young princess shcherbatskaia an offer of marriage in all likelihood he would at once have been looked upon as a good match but levin was in love and so it seemed to him that kitty was so perfect in every respect a creature so far above everything earthly while he was a creature so low and so earthly that it could not even be conceived that other people and she herself could regard him as worthy of her 
 after spending two months in moscow in a state of befuddlement seeing kitty almost every day in society into which he went so as to meet her he abruptly decided that it could not be and went back to the country 
 conviction that it could not be was founded on the idea that in the eyes of her family he was a disadvantageous and worthless match for the charming kitty and that kitty herself could not love him in her eyes he had no ordinary definite career and position in society while his comrades by this time when he was were already one a colonel and another a professor another director of a bank and railways or chairman of a board like oblonsky but he he knew very well how he must appear to others was a country gentleman occupied in breeding cattle shooting game and building barns in other words a fellow of no ability who had not turned out well and who was doing just what according to the ideas of the world is done by people fit for nothing else 
 the mysterious enchanting kitty herself could not love such an ugly person as he conceived himself to be and above all such an ordinary in no way striking person moreover his attitude to kitty in the past the attitude of a person to a child arising from his friendship with her brother seemed to him yet another obstacle to love an ugly man as he considered himself might he supposed be liked as a friend but to be loved with such a love as that with which he loved kitty one would need to be handsome and still more a distinguished man 
 he had heard that women often did care for ugly and ordinary men but he did not believe it for he judged by himself and he could not himself have loved any but beautiful mysterious and exceptional women 
 but after spending two months alone in the country he was convinced that this was not one of those passions of which he had had experience in his early youth that this feeling gave him not an rest that he could not live without deciding the question as to whether she would or would not be his wife that his despair had arisen only from his own imaginings and that he had no sort of proof that he would be rejected so he had now come to moscow with a firm determination to make a proposal and get married if he were accepted or he could not conceive what would become of him if he were rejected

 but after spending two months alone in the country he was convinced that this was not one of those passions of which he had had experience in his early youth that this feeling gave him not an rest that he could not live without deciding the question as to whether she would or would not be his wife that his despair had arisen only from his own imaginings and that he had no sort of proof that he would be rejected so he had now come to moscow with a firm determination to make a proposal and get married if he were accepted or he could not conceive what would become of him if he were rejected

 on arriving in moscow by a morning train levin had put up at the house of his elder koznishev after changing his clothes he went down to his study intending to talk to him at once about the object of his visit and to ask his advice but his brother was not alone with him there was a professor of philosophy who had come from charkov expressly to clear up a difference that had arisen between them on a very important philosophical question the professor was carrying on a hot crusade against materialists sergei koznishev had been following this crusade with interest and after reading the last article had written him a letter stating his objections he accused the professor of making too great concessions to the materialists and the professor had promptly appeared to argue the matter out the point in discussion was the question then in vogue is there a line to be drawn between psychical and physiological phenomena in man and if so where 
 sergei ivanovich met his brother with the smile of chilly friendliness he always had for everyone and introducing him to the professor went on with the conversation 
 a little man in spectacles with a narrow forehead tore himself from the discussion for an instant to greet levin and then went on talking without paying any further attention to him levin sat down to wait till the professor should go but he soon began to get interested in the subject under discussion 
 levin had come across the magazine articles about which they were disputing and had read them interested in them as a development of the first principles of science familiar to him when a natural science student at the university but he had never connected these scientific deductions as to the origin of man as an animal as to reflex action biology and sociology with those questions as to the meaning to himself of life and death which had of late been more and more often in his mind 
 as he listened to his argument with the professor he noticed that they connected these scientific questions with those spiritual problems that at times they almost touched on the latter but every time they were close upon what seemed to him the chief point they promptly beat a hasty retreat and plunged again into a sea of subtle distinctions reservations quotations allusions and appeals to authorities and it was with difficulty that he understood what they were talking about 
 i cannot admit it said sergei ivanovich with his habitual clearness and distinctness of expression and elegance of diction i cannot in any case agree with keiss that my whole conception of the external world has been derived from impressions the most fundamental idea the idea of existence has not been received by me through sensation indeed there is no special sense organ for the transmission of such an idea 
 yes but they wurst and knaust and pripassov would answer that your consciousness of existence is derived from the conjunction of all your sensations that that consciousness of existence is the result of your sensations wurst indeed says plainly that assuming there are no sensations it follows that there is no idea of existence 
 i maintain the contrary began sergei ivanovich 
 but here it seemed again to levin that just as they were close upon the real point of the matter they were again retreating and he made up his mind to put a question to the professor 
 according to that if my senses are annihilated if my body is dead i can have no existence of any sort he queried 
 the professor in annoyance and as it were mental suffering at the interruption looked round at the strange inquirer more like a hauler of a barge than a philosopher and turned his eyes upon sergei ivanovich as though to ask one to say to him but sergei ivanovich who had been talking with far less stress and than the professor and who had sufficient breadth of mind to answer the professor and at the same time to comprehend the simple and natural point of view from which the question was put smiled and said 
 that question we have no right to answer as yet 
 we have not the requisite data confirmed the professor and he went back to his argument no he said i would point out the fact that if as pripassov directly asserts sensation is based on impression then we are bound to distinguish sharply between these two conceptions 
 levin listened no more and simply waited for the professor to go

 when the professor had gone sergei ivanovich turned to his brother 
 delighted that come for how long your farming getting on 
 levin knew that his elder brother took little interest in farming and only put the question in deference to him and therefore he told him only about the sale of his wheat and money matters 
 levin had meant to tell his brother of his determination to get married and to ask his advice he had indeed firmly resolved to do so but after seeing his brother listening to his conversation with the professor hearing afterward the unconsciously patronizing tone in which his brother questioned him about agricultural matters their property had not been divided and levin took charge of both their shares levin felt that he could not for some reason broach to him his intention of marrying he felt that his brother would not look on it as he would have wished him 
 well how is your zemstvo doing asked sergei ivanovich who was greatly interested in zemstvo establishments and attached great importance to them 
 i really know 
 what but surely a member of the board 
 no not a member now resigned answered levin and i no longer attend the sessions 
 what a pity commented sergei ivanovich frowning 
 levin in began to describe what took place at the sessions in his district 
 how it always is sergei ivanovich interrupted him we russians are always like that perhaps our strong point really this faculty of seeing our own shortcomings but we overdo it we comfort ourselves with irony which we always have on the tip of our tongues all i say is give such rights as our zemstvo establishments to any other european people and why the germans or the english would have worked their way to freedom with them while we simply turn them into ridicule 
 but how can it be helped said levin penitently it was my last trial and i did try with all my soul i no good at it 
 not that no good at it said sergei ivanovich it is that you look at it as you should 
 perhaps not levin answered dejectedly 
 oh do you know brother turned up again 
 this brother nikolai was the elder brother of constantin levin and of sergei ivanovich a man who was done for who had dissipated the greater part of his fortune was living in the strangest and lowest company and had quarreled with his brothers 
 what did you say levin cried with horror how do you know 
 procophii saw him in the street 
 here in moscow where is he do you know levin got up from his chair as though on the point of starting off at once 
 sorry i told you said sergei ivanovich shaking his head at his younger excitement i sent to find out where he is living and sent him his i o u to trubin which i paid this is the answer he sent me 
 and sergei ivanovich took a note from under a paperweight and handed it to his brother 
 levin read in the queer familiar handwriting i humbly beg you to leave me in peace the only favor i ask of my gracious brothers nikolai levin 
 levin read it and without raising his head stood with the note in his hands opposite sergei ivanovich 
 there was a struggle in his heart between the desire to forget his unhappy brother for the time and the consciousness that it would be base to do so 
 he obviously wants to offend me pursued sergei ivanovich but he cannot offend me and i should have wished with all my heart to assist him but i know impossible to do that 
 yes yes repeated levin i understand and appreciate your attitude to him but i shall go and see him 
 if you want to do but i advise it said sergei ivanovich as regards myself i have no fear of your doing so he will not make you quarrel with me but for your own sake i should say you would do better not to go you do him any good still do as you please 
 very likely i do any good but i feel especially at such a moment but another thing i feel i could not be at peace 
 well something i understand said sergei ivanovich one thing i do understand he added a lesson in humility i have come to look very differently and more indulgently on what is called infamy since brother nikolai has become what he is you know what he did 
 oh awful awful repeated levin 
 after obtaining his address from sergei footman levin was on the point of setting off at once to see him but on second thought he decided to put off his visit till the evening the thing to do to set his heart at rest was to accomplish what he had come to moscow for from his levin went to office and on getting news of the shcherbatskys from him he drove to the place where he had been told he might find kitty

 at four conscious of his throbbing heart levin stepped out of a hired sleigh at the zoological gardens and turned along the path to the frozen mounds and the skating ground knowing that he would certainly find her there as he had seen the carriage at the entrance 
 it was a bright frosty day rows of carriages sleighs drivers and gendarmes were standing in the approach crowds of people with hats bright in the sun swarmed about the entrance and along the paths between the little houses adorned with carving in the russian style the old curly birches of the gardens all their twigs laden with snow looked as though freshly decked in sacred vestments 
 he walked along the path toward the skating ground and kept saying to himself you be excited you must be calm the matter with you what do you want be still foolish one he conjured his heart and the more he tried to compose himself the more breathless he found himself an acquaintance met him and called him by his name but levin did not even recognize him he went toward the mounds whence came the clank of the chains of sleighs as they slipped down or were dragged up the rumble of the sliding sleighs and the sounds of merry voices he walked on a few steps and the skating ground lay open before him and at once amid all the skaters he recognized her 
 he knew she was there by the rapture and the terror that seized his heart she was standing talking to a lady at the opposite end of the ground there was apparently nothing striking either in her dress or her attitude but for levin she was as easy to find in that crowd as a rose among nettles everything was made bright by her she was the smile that shed light on all around her is it possible i can go over there on the ice approach her he thought the place where she stood seemed to him a holy shrine unapproachable and there was one moment when he was almost retreating so overwhelmed was he with terror he had to make an effort to master himself and to remind himself that people of all sorts were moving about her and that he too might have come there to skate he descended for a long while avoiding looking at her as at the sun yet seeing her as one does the sun without looking 
 on that day of the week and at that time of day people of one set all acquainted with one another used to meet on the ice there were skillful skaters there showing off their skill and beginners clinging to chairs with timid awkward movements and boys and elderly people skating with hygienic motives they seemed to levin an elect band of blissful beings because they were here near her all the skaters it seemed with perfect skated toward her skated by her even spoke to her and were happy quite apart from her enjoying the capital ice and the fine weather 
 nikolai shcherbatsky cousin in a short jacket and tight trousers was sitting on a bench with his skates on seeing levin he shouted to him 
 ah the first skater in russia been here long ice do put your skates on 
 i got my skates levin answered marveling at this boldness and ease in her presence and not for one second losing sight of her though he did not look at her he felt as though the sun were coming near him she was in a corner and turning out her slender feet in their high boots she with obvious timidity skated toward him a boy in russian dress desperately waving his arms and bending down to the ground overtook her she skated a little uncertainly taking her hands out of the little muff that hung on a cord she held them ready for emergency and looking toward levin whom she had recognized she smiled at him and at her own fears when she had got round the turn she got a start with one foot and skated straight up to shcherbatsky clutching at his arm she nodded with a smile to levin she was more beautiful than he had imagined her 
 when he thought of her he could call up a vivid picture of her to himself especially the charm of that little fair head so freely set on the shapely girlish shoulders and so full of childish brightness and kindness her childish countenance together with the delicate beauty of her figure made up that special charm of hers which he appreciated so well but what always struck him in her as something unlooked for was the expression of her eyes soft serene and truthful and above all her smile which always transported levin to an enchanted world where he felt moved and tender as he remembered himself during certain rare days of his early childhood 
 have you been here long she said giving him her hand thank you she added as he picked up the handkerchief that had fallen out of her muff 
 i not long ago yesterday i mean i arrived today answered levin in his emotion not comprehending her question immediately i meant to come and see you he said and then recollecting what his intention was in seeking her he was promptly overcome with confusion and blushed i know you could skate and skate so well 
 she looked at him attentively as though wishing to make out the cause of his confusion 
 your praise is worth having the tradition is kept up here that you are the best of skaters she said with her little hand brushing some needles of hoarfrost off her muff 
 yes i used to skate with passion once upon a time i wanted to attain perfection 
 you do everything with passion i think she said smiling i should so like to see how you skate do put on skates and skate together 
 skate together can that be possible thought levin gazing at her 
 put them on directly he said 
 and he went off to get skates 
 a long while since seen you here sir said the attendant supporting his foot and screwing on the heel of the skate except you none of the gentlemen skaters will that be all right said he tightening the strap 
 oh yes yes make haste please answered levin with difficulty restraining the smile of rapture which would overspread his face yes he thought this is life this is happiness together she said let us skate together speak to her now but just why afraid to speak because happy now happy even though only in hope and then but i must i must i must away faintheartedness 
 levin rose to his feet took off his overcoat and gaining speed over the rough ice round the pavilion came out on the smooth ice and skated without effort as it were by simple exercise of will increasing and slackening speed and turning his course he approached her with timidity but again her smile reassured him 
 she gave him her hand and they set off side by side going faster and faster and the more rapidly they moved the more tightly she grasped his hand 
 with you i should soon learn i somehow feel confidence in you she said to him 
 and i have confidence in myself when you are leaning on me he said but was at once frightened at what he had said and blushed and indeed no sooner had he uttered these words than all at once like the sun going behind a cloud her face lost all its tenderness and levin detected the familiar change in her expression that denoted mental concentration a tiny wrinkle came upon her smooth brow 
 is there anything troubling you however no right to ask such a question he said hurriedly 
 oh why so no i have nothing to trouble me she responded coldly and immediately added you seen mlle linon have you 
 not yet 
 go and speak to her she likes you so much 
 wrong i have offended her lord help me thought levin and he flew towards the old frenchwoman with the gray ringlets who was sitting on a bench smiling and showing her false teeth she greeted him as an old friend 
 yes you see growing up she said to him glancing toward kitty and growing old tiny bear has grown big now pursued the frenchwoman laughing and she reminded him of his joke about the three young ladies whom he had compared to the three bears in the english nursery tale do you remember what you used to call them 
 he remembered absolutely nothing but she had been laughing at the joke for ten years now and was fond of it 
 now go and skate go and skate our kitty has learned to skate nicely she 
 when levin darted up to kitty her face was no longer stern her eyes looked at him with the same sincerity and tenderness but levin fancied that in her tenderness there was a certain note of deliberate composure and he felt depressed after talking a little of her old governess and her peculiarities she questioned him about his life 
 surely you must feel dull in the country in the winter she said 
 no not dull i am very busy he said feeling that she was making him submit to her composed tone which he would not have the strength to break through just as had been the case at the beginning of the winter 
 are you going to stay in town long kitty questioned him 
 i know he answered not thinking of what he was saying the thought came into his mind that if he were held in submission by her tone of quiet friendliness he would end by going back again without deciding anything and he resolved to mutiny against it 
 how is it you know 
 i know it depends upon you he said and was immediately at his own words 
 whether it was that she did not hear his words or that she did not want to hear them she made a sort of stumble twice struck out and hurriedly skated away from him she skated up to mlle linon said something to her and went toward the pavilion where the ladies took off their skates 
 my god what have i done merciful god help me guide me said levin praying inwardly and at the same time feeling a need of violent exercise he skated about describing concentric and eccentric circles 
 at that moment one of the young men the best of the skaters of the day came out of the coffeehouse on his skates with a cigarette in his mouth taking a run he dashed down the steps on his skates crashing and leaping he flew down and without even changing the position of his hands skated away over the ice 
 ah a new trick said levin and he promptly ran up to the top to perform this new trick 
 break your neck this needs practice nikolai shcherbatsky shouted after him 
 levin went to the steps took a run from above as best he could and dashed down preserving his balance in this unwonted movement with his hands on the last step he stumbled but barely touching the ice with his hand with a violent effort recovered himself and skated off laughing 
 what a fine darling chap he is kitty was thinking at that moment as she came out of the pavilion with mlle linon and looked toward him with a smile of quiet kindness as though he were a favorite brother and can it be my fault can i have done anything wrong they talk of coquetry i know not he that i love but still i am happy with him and so nice only why did he say that she mused 
 catching sight of kitty going away and her mother meeting her at the steps levin flushed from his rapid exercise stood still and pondered a minute he took off his skates and overtook the mother and daughter at the entrance of the gardens 
 delighted to see you said princess shcherbatskaia on thursdays we are home as always 
 today then 
 we shall be pleased to see you the princess said stiffly 
 this stiffness hurt kitty and she could not resist the desire to smooth over her coldness she turned her head and with a smile said 
 till this evening 
 at that moment stepan arkadyevich his hat cocked on one side with beaming face and eyes strode into the garden like a buoyant conqueror but as he approached his he responded to her inquiries about health with a mournful and guilty countenance after a little subdued and dejected conversation with her he set straight his chest again and took levin by the arm 
 well shall we set off he asked been thinking about you all this time and very very glad come he said looking him in the face with a significant air 
 yes come along answered levin in ecstasy hearing unceasingly the sound of that voice saying till this evening and seeing the smile with which it was said 
 to england or the hermitage 
 all the same to me 
 well then england it is said stepan arkadyevich selecting that restaurant because he owed more there than at the hermitage and consequently considered it mean to avoid it have you got a sleigh fine for i sent my carriage home 
 the friends hardly spoke all the way levin was wondering what that change in expression had meant and alternately assuring himself that there was hope and falling into despair seeing clearly that his hopes were insane and yet all the while he felt himself quite another man utterly unlike what he had been before her smile and those words till this evening 
 stepan arkadyevich was absorbed during the drive in composing the menu of the dinner 
 you like turbot you he said to levin as they were arriving 
 eh responded levin turbot yes awfully fond of turbot

 at four conscious of his throbbing heart levin stepped out of a hired sleigh at the zoological gardens and turned along the path to the frozen mounds and the skating ground knowing that he would certainly find her there as he had seen the carriage at the entrance 
 it was a bright frosty day rows of carriages sleighs drivers and gendarmes were standing in the approach crowds of people with hats bright in the sun swarmed about the entrance and along the paths between the little houses adorned with carving in the russian style the old curly birches of the gardens all their twigs laden with snow looked as though freshly decked in sacred vestments 
 he walked along the path toward the skating ground and kept saying to himself you be excited you must be calm the matter with you what do you want be still foolish one he conjured his heart and the more he tried to compose himself the more breathless he found himself an acquaintance met him and called him by his name but levin did not even recognize him he went toward the mounds whence came the clank of the chains of sleighs as they slipped down or were dragged up the rumble of the sliding sleighs and the sounds of merry voices he walked on a few steps and the skating ground lay open before him and at once amid all the skaters he recognized her 
 he knew she was there by the rapture and the terror that seized his heart she was standing talking to a lady at the opposite end of the ground there was apparently nothing striking either in her dress or her attitude but for levin she was as easy to find in that crowd as a rose among nettles everything was made bright by her she was the smile that shed light on all around her is it possible i can go over there on the ice approach her he thought the place where she stood seemed to him a holy shrine unapproachable and there was one moment when he was almost retreating so overwhelmed was he with terror he had to make an effort to master himself and to remind himself that people of all sorts were moving about her and that he too might have come there to skate he descended for a long while avoiding looking at her as at the sun yet seeing her as one does the sun without looking 
 on that day of the week and at that time of day people of one set all acquainted with one another used to meet on the ice there were skillful skaters there showing off their skill and beginners clinging to chairs with timid awkward movements and boys and elderly people skating with hygienic motives they seemed to levin an elect band of blissful beings because they were here near her all the skaters it seemed with perfect skated toward her skated by her even spoke to her and were happy quite apart from her enjoying the capital ice and the fine weather 
 nikolai shcherbatsky cousin in a short jacket and tight trousers was sitting on a bench with his skates on seeing levin he shouted to him 
 ah the first skater in russia been here long ice do put your skates on 
 i got my skates levin answered marveling at this boldness and ease in her presence and not for one second losing sight of her though he did not look at her he felt as though the sun were coming near him she was in a corner and turning out her slender feet in their high boots she with obvious timidity skated toward him a boy in russian dress desperately waving his arms and bending down to the ground overtook her she skated a little uncertainly taking her hands out of the little muff that hung on a cord she held them ready for emergency and looking toward levin whom she had recognized she smiled at him and at her own fears when she had got round the turn she got a start with one foot and skated straight up to shcherbatsky clutching at his arm she nodded with a smile to levin she was more beautiful than he had imagined her 
 when he thought of her he could call up a vivid picture of her to himself especially the charm of that little fair head so freely set on the shapely girlish shoulders and so full of childish brightness and kindness her childish countenance together with the delicate beauty of her figure made up that special charm of hers which he appreciated so well but what always struck him in her as something unlooked for was the expression of her eyes soft serene and truthful and above all her smile which always transported levin to an enchanted world where he felt moved and tender as he remembered himself during certain rare days of his early childhood 
 have you been here long she said giving him her hand thank you she added as he picked up the handkerchief that had fallen out of her muff 
 i not long ago yesterday i mean i arrived today answered levin in his emotion not comprehending her question immediately i meant to come and see you he said and then recollecting what his intention was in seeking her he was promptly overcome with confusion and blushed i know you could skate and skate so well 
 she looked at him attentively as though wishing to make out the cause of his confusion 
 your praise is worth having the tradition is kept up here that you are the best of skaters she said with her little hand brushing some needles of hoarfrost off her muff 
 yes i used to skate with passion once upon a time i wanted to attain perfection 
 you do everything with passion i think she said smiling i should so like to see how you skate do put on skates and skate together 
 skate together can that be possible thought levin gazing at her 
 put them on directly he said 
 and he went off to get skates 
 a long while since seen you here sir said the attendant supporting his foot and screwing on the heel of the skate except you none of the gentlemen skaters will that be all right said he tightening the strap 
 oh yes yes make haste please answered levin with difficulty restraining the smile of rapture which would overspread his face yes he thought this is life this is happiness together she said let us skate together speak to her now but just why afraid to speak because happy now happy even though only in hope and then but i must i must i must away faintheartedness 
 levin rose to his feet took off his overcoat and gaining speed over the rough ice round the pavilion came out on the smooth ice and skated without effort as it were by simple exercise of will increasing and slackening speed and turning his course he approached her with timidity but again her smile reassured him 
 she gave him her hand and they set off side by side going faster and faster and the more rapidly they moved the more tightly she grasped his hand 
 with you i should soon learn i somehow feel confidence in you she said to him 
 and i have confidence in myself when you are leaning on me he said but was at once frightened at what he had said and blushed and indeed no sooner had he uttered these words than all at once like the sun going behind a cloud her face lost all its tenderness and levin detected the familiar change in her expression that denoted mental concentration a tiny wrinkle came upon her smooth brow 
 is there anything troubling you however no right to ask such a question he said hurriedly 
 oh why so no i have nothing to trouble me she responded coldly and immediately added you seen mlle linon have you 
 not yet 
 go and speak to her she likes you so much 
 wrong i have offended her lord help me thought levin and he flew towards the old frenchwoman with the gray ringlets who was sitting on a bench smiling and showing her false teeth she greeted him as an old friend 
 yes you see growing up she said to him glancing toward kitty and growing old tiny bear has grown big now pursued the frenchwoman laughing and she reminded him of his joke about the three young ladies whom he had compared to the three bears in the english nursery tale do you remember what you used to call them 
 he remembered absolutely nothing but she had been laughing at the joke for ten years now and was fond of it 
 now go and skate go and skate our kitty has learned to skate nicely she 
 when levin darted up to kitty her face was no longer stern her eyes looked at him with the same sincerity and tenderness but levin fancied that in her tenderness there was a certain note of deliberate composure and he felt depressed after talking a little of her old governess and her peculiarities she questioned him about his life 
 surely you must feel dull in the country in the winter she said 
 no not dull i am very busy he said feeling that she was making him submit to her composed tone which he would not have the strength to break through just as had been the case at the beginning of the winter 
 are you going to stay in town long kitty questioned him 
 i know he answered not thinking of what he was saying the thought came into his mind that if he were held in submission by her tone of quiet friendliness he would end by going back again without deciding anything and he resolved to mutiny against it 
 how is it you know 
 i know it depends upon you he said and was immediately at his own words 
 whether it was that she did not hear his words or that she did not want to hear them she made a sort of stumble twice struck out and hurriedly skated away from him she skated up to mlle linon said something to her and went toward the pavilion where the ladies took off their skates 
 my god what have i done merciful god help me guide me said levin praying inwardly and at the same time feeling a need of violent exercise he skated about describing concentric and eccentric circles 
 at that moment one of the young men the best of the skaters of the day came out of the coffeehouse on his skates with a cigarette in his mouth taking a run he dashed down the steps on his skates crashing and leaping he flew down and without even changing the position of his hands skated away over the ice 
 ah a new trick said levin and he promptly ran up to the top to perform this new trick 
 break your neck this needs practice nikolai shcherbatsky shouted after him 
 levin went to the steps took a run from above as best he could and dashed down preserving his balance in this unwonted movement with his hands on the last step he stumbled but barely touching the ice with his hand with a violent effort recovered himself and skated off laughing 
 what a fine darling chap he is kitty was thinking at that moment as she came out of the pavilion with mlle linon and looked toward him with a smile of quiet kindness as though he were a favorite brother and can it be my fault can i have done anything wrong they talk of coquetry i know not he that i love but still i am happy with him and so nice only why did he say that she mused 
 catching sight of kitty going away and her mother meeting her at the steps levin flushed from his rapid exercise stood still and pondered a minute he took off his skates and overtook the mother and daughter at the entrance of the gardens 
 delighted to see you said princess shcherbatskaia on thursdays we are home as always 
 today then 
 we shall be pleased to see you the princess said stiffly 
 this stiffness hurt kitty and she could not resist the desire to smooth over her coldness she turned her head and with a smile said 
 till this evening 
 at that moment stepan arkadyevich his hat cocked on one side with beaming face and eyes strode into the garden like a buoyant conqueror but as he approached his he responded to her inquiries about health with a mournful and guilty countenance after a little subdued and dejected conversation with her he set straight his chest again and took levin by the arm 
 well shall we set off he asked been thinking about you all this time and very very glad come he said looking him in the face with a significant air 
 yes come along answered levin in ecstasy hearing unceasingly the sound of that voice saying till this evening and seeing the smile with which it was said 
 to england or the hermitage 
 all the same to me 
 well then england it is said stepan arkadyevich selecting that restaurant because he owed more there than at the hermitage and consequently considered it mean to avoid it have you got a sleigh fine for i sent my carriage home 
 the friends hardly spoke all the way levin was wondering what that change in expression had meant and alternately assuring himself that there was hope and falling into despair seeing clearly that his hopes were insane and yet all the while he felt himself quite another man utterly unlike what he had been before her smile and those words till this evening 
 stepan arkadyevich was absorbed during the drive in composing the menu of the dinner 
 you like turbot you he said to levin as they were arriving 
 eh responded levin turbot yes awfully fond of turbot

 chapter 
 
 when levin went into the restaurant with oblonsky he could not help noticing a certain peculiarity of expression as it were a restrained radiance about the face and whole figure of stepan arkadyevich oblonsky took off his overcoat and with his hat over one ear walked into the dining room giving directions to the tatar waiters who were clustered about him in evening coats and with napkins under their arms bowing right and left to acquaintances who here as everywhere greeted him joyously he went up to the bar took a little wineglass of vodka and a snack of fish and said to the painted frenchwoman decked in ribbons lace and ringlets behind the desk something so amusing that even that frenchwoman was moved to genuine laughter levin for his part refrained from taking any vodka only because he found most offensive this frenchwoman all made up it seemed of false hair poudre de riz and vinaigre de toilette he made haste to move away from her as from a dirty place his whole soul was filled with memories of kitty and there was a smile of triumph and happiness shining in his eyes 
 this way your excellency please your excellency be disturbed here said a particularly pertinacious old tatar with immense hips and coattails gaping widely behind walk in your excellency he said to levin being attentive to his guest as well by way of showing his respect to stepan arkadyevich 
 instantly flinging a fresh cloth over the round table under the bronze sconce though it already had a tablecloth on it he pushed up velvet chairs and came to a standstill before stepan arkadyevich with a napkin and a bill of fare in his hands awaiting his commands 
 if you prefer it your excellency a private room will be free directly prince golitsin with a lady fresh oysters have come in 
 ah oysters stepan arkadyevich became thoughtful 
 how if we were to change our program levin he said keeping his finger on the bill of fare and his face expressed serious hesitation are the oysters good mind now 
 flensburg your excellency no ostend 
 flensburg will do but are they fresh 
 only arrived yesterday 
 well then how if we were to begin with oysters and so change the whole program eh 
 all the same to me i should like cabbage soup and porridge better than anything but of course nothing like that here 
 porridge la russe your honor would like said the tatar bending down to levin like a nurse speaking to a child 
 no joking apart whatever you choose is sure to be good been skating and hungry and imagine he added detecting a look of dissatisfaction on face that i appreciate your choice i object to a good dinner 
 i should hope so after all one of the pleasures of life said stepan arkadyevich well then my friend you give us two or better say three dozen oysters clear soup with vegetables 
 printaniere prompted the tatar but stepan arkadyevich apparently did not care to allow him the satisfaction of giving the french names of the dishes 
 with vegetables in it you know then turbot with thick sauce then roast beef and mind good yes and capons perhaps and then stewed fruit 
 the tatar recollecting that it was stepan way not to call the dishes by the names in the french bill of fare did not repeat them after him but could not resist rehearsing the whole menu to himself according to the bill soupe printaniere turbot sauce beaumarchais poulard macdoine de fruits and then instantly as though worked by springs laying down one bound bill of fare he took up another the list of wines and submitted it to stepan arkadyevich 
 what shall we drink 
 what you like only not too much champagne said levin 
 what to start with right though i dare say do you like the white seal 
 cachet blanc prompted the tatar 
 very well then give us that brand with the oysters and then see 
 yes sir and what table wine 
 you can give us nuits oh no better the classic chablis 
 yes sir and your cheese your excellency 
 oh yes parmesan or would you like another 
 no all the same to me said levin unable to suppress a smile 
 and the tatar ran off with flying coattails and in five minutes darted in with a dish of opened oysters in their nacreous shells and a bottle between his fingers 
 stepan arkadyevich crushed the starchy napkin tucked it into his waistcoat and settling his arms comfortably started on the oysters 
 not bad he said detaching the jellied oysters from their pearly shells with a small silver fork and swallowing them one after another not bad he repeated turning his dewy brilliant eyes now upon levin now upon the tatar 
 levin ate the oysters too though white bread and cheese pleased him better but he was admiring oblonsky even the tatar uncorking the bottle and pouring the sparkling wine into the delicate glasses and adjusting his white cravat kept on glancing at stepan arkadyevich with a perceptible smile of satisfaction 
 you care much for oysters do you said stepan arkadyevich emptying his wineglass or are you worried about something eh 
 he wanted levin to be in good spirits but it was not that levin was not in good spirits he was ill at ease with what he had in his soul he felt hard and awkward in the restaurant in the midst of private rooms where men were dining with ladies in all this fuss and bustle the surroundings of bronzes looking glasses gas and tatars all of this was offensive to him he was afraid of sullying what his soul was brimful of 
 i yes i am worried but besides that all this bothers me he said you conceive how queer it all seems to a countryman like me as queer as that nails i saw at your office 
 yes i saw how much interested you were in poor nails said stepan arkadyevich laughing 
 too much for me responded levin do try now to put yourself in my place take the point of view of a countryman we in the country try to bring our hands into such a state as will be most convenient for working with so we cut our nails sometimes we tuck up our sleeves and here people purposely let their nails grow as long as possible and link on small saucers by way of studs so that they can do nothing with their hands 
 stepan arkadyevich smiled gaily 
 oh yes just a sign that he has no need to do coarse work his work is with the mind 
 maybe but still queer to me just as at this moment it seems queer to me that we countryfolks try to satiate ourselves as soon as we can so as to be ready for work while here are we trying to delay satiety as long as possible and with that object are eating oysters 
 why of course objected stepan arkadyevich but just the aim of culture to make everything a source of enjoyment 
 well if its aim rather be a savage 
 you are a savage as it is all you levins are savages 
 levin sighed he remembered his brother nikolai and felt ashamed and pained and he scowled but oblonsky began speaking of a subject which at once drew his attention 
 oh i say are you going tonight to our people the i mean he said his eyes sparkling significantly as he pushed away the empty rough shells and drew the cheese toward him 
 yes i shall certainly go replied levin though i fancied the princess was not very warm in her invitation 
 what nonsense her manner come boy the soup her manner grande dame said stepan arkadyevich coming too but i have to go to the countess rehearsal come it true that a savage how do you explain the sudden way in which you vanished from moscow the shcherbatskys were continually asking me about you as though i ought to know the only thing i know is that you always do what no one else does 
 yes said levin slowly and with emotion right i am a savage only my savageness is not in having gone away but in coming now now i have come 
 oh what a lucky fellow you are broke in stepan arkadyevich looking into eyes 
 why 
 i can tell the gallant steeds by some i know what i can tell youths by their faces declaimed stepan arkadyevich everything is before you 
 why is it over for you already 
 no not over exactly but the future is yours and the present is mine and the present well only fair to middling 
 how so 
 oh things right but i want to talk of myself besides i explain it all said stepan arkadyevich well why have you come to moscow then hi clear the table he called to the tatar 
 are you trying to surmise responded levin his eyes gleaming in their depth fixed on stepan arkadyevich 
 i am but i be the first to talk about it you can see by that whether i surmise right or wrong said stepan arkadyevich gazing at levin with a subtle smile 
 well and what have you to say to me said levin in a quivering voice feeling that all the muscles of his face were quivering too how do you look at it 
 stepan arkadyevich slowly emptied his glass of chablis never taking his eyes off levin 
 i said stepan arkadyevich nothing i desire so much as that nothing it would be the best thing that could happen 
 but not making a mistake you know what speaking of said levin piercing him with his eyes you think possible 
 i think possible why not 
 no do you really think possible no tell me all you think oh but if if in store for me indeed i feel sure 
 what makes you think so said stepan arkadyevich smiling at his excitement 
 it seems so to me sometimes that will be awful for me and for her too 
 oh well anyway nothing awful in it for a girl every proud of a proposal 
 yes every girl but not she 
 stepan arkadyevich smiled he so well knew that feeling of that for him all the girls in the world were divided into two classes one class all the girls in the world except her and those girls with all sorts of human failings and very ordinary girls the other class she alone having no failings of any sort and higher than all humanity 
 stay take some sauce he said holding back hand who was pushing the sauce away 
 levin obediently helped himself to sauce but would not let stepan arkadyevich go on with his dinner 
 no stop a minute stop a minute he said you must understand that a question of life and death for me i have never spoken to anyone of this and no one to whom i could speak of it except yourself you know utterly unlike each other different in tastes and views and everything but i know fond of me and understand me and why i like you awfully but for sake be quite straightforward with me 
 i tell you what i think said stepan arkadyevich smiling but say more my wife is a wonderful woman stepan arkadyevich sighed recalling his relations with his wife and after a silence resumed she has a gift of foreseeing things she sees right through people but not all she knows what will come to pass especially in the way of marriages she foretold for instance that princess shahovskaia would marry brenteln no one would believe it but it came to pass and on your side 
 how do you mean 
 not only that she likes you she says that kitty is certain to be your wife 
 at these words face suddenly lighted up with a smile a smile not far from touching tears 
 she says that cried out levin i always said she was charming your wife there enough said about it he said getting up from his seat 
 well but do sit down 
 but levin could not sit down he walked with his firm tread twice up and down the little cage of a room blinked his eyelids that his tears might not fall and only then sat down to the table 
 you must understand said he not love been in love but not that not my feeling but a sort of force outside me that has taken possession of me i went away you see because i made up my mind that it could never be you understand like a happiness which is not of this earth but struggled with myself and i see no living without it and it must be settled 
 what did you go away for 
 ah stop a minute ah the thoughts that come crowding on one the questions one must ask oneself listen you imagine what done for me by what you said so happy that become positively hateful forgotten everything i heard today that my brother nikolai you know here i had forgotten even him it seems to me that happy too a sort of madness but one awful here been married you know the feeling awful that we fully mature with a past a past not of love but of sins are brought all at once so near to a creature pure and innocent loathsome and why one help feeling oneself unworthy 
 oh well you many sins on your conscience 
 ah still said levin when with loathing i go my life i shudder and i curse and bitterly regret yes 
 what would you have the way of the world said stepan arkadyevich 
 one comfort like that of the prayer which i always liked forgive me not according to my deeds but according to thy the only way she can forgive me

 when levin went into the restaurant with oblonsky he could not help noticing a certain peculiarity of expression as it were a restrained radiance about the face and whole figure of stepan arkadyevich oblonsky took off his overcoat and with his hat over one ear walked into the dining room giving directions to the tatar waiters who were clustered about him in evening coats and with napkins under their arms bowing right and left to acquaintances who here as everywhere greeted him joyously he went up to the bar took a little wineglass of vodka and a snack of fish and said to the painted frenchwoman decked in ribbons lace and ringlets behind the desk something so amusing that even that frenchwoman was moved to genuine laughter levin for his part refrained from taking any vodka only because he found most offensive this frenchwoman all made up it seemed of false hair poudre de riz and vinaigre de toilette he made haste to move away from her as from a dirty place his whole soul was filled with memories of kitty and there was a smile of triumph and happiness shining in his eyes 
 this way your excellency please your excellency be disturbed here said a particularly pertinacious old tatar with immense hips and coattails gaping widely behind walk in your excellency he said to levin being attentive to his guest as well by way of showing his respect to stepan arkadyevich 
 instantly flinging a fresh cloth over the round table under the bronze sconce though it already had a tablecloth on it he pushed up velvet chairs and came to a standstill before stepan arkadyevich with a napkin and a bill of fare in his hands awaiting his commands 
 if you prefer it your excellency a private room will be free directly prince golitsin with a lady fresh oysters have come in 
 ah oysters stepan arkadyevich became thoughtful 
 how if we were to change our program levin he said keeping his finger on the bill of fare and his face expressed serious hesitation are the oysters good mind now 
 flensburg your excellency no ostend 
 flensburg will do but are they fresh 
 only arrived yesterday 
 well then how if we were to begin with oysters and so change the whole program eh 
 all the same to me i should like cabbage soup and porridge better than anything but of course nothing like that here 
 porridge la russe your honor would like said the tatar bending down to levin like a nurse speaking to a child 
 no joking apart whatever you choose is sure to be good been skating and hungry and imagine he added detecting a look of dissatisfaction on face that i appreciate your choice i object to a good dinner 
 i should hope so after all one of the pleasures of life said stepan arkadyevich well then my friend you give us two or better say three dozen oysters clear soup with vegetables 
 printaniere prompted the tatar but stepan arkadyevich apparently did not care to allow him the satisfaction of giving the french names of the dishes 
 with vegetables in it you know then turbot with thick sauce then roast beef and mind good yes and capons perhaps and then stewed fruit 
 the tatar recollecting that it was stepan way not to call the dishes by the names in the french bill of fare did not repeat them after him but could not resist rehearsing the whole menu to himself according to the bill soupe printaniere turbot sauce beaumarchais poulard macdoine de fruits and then instantly as though worked by springs laying down one bound bill of fare he took up another the list of wines and submitted it to stepan arkadyevich 
 what shall we drink 
 what you like only not too much champagne said levin 
 what to start with right though i dare say do you like the white seal 
 cachet blanc prompted the tatar 
 very well then give us that brand with the oysters and then see 
 yes sir and what table wine 
 you can give us nuits oh no better the classic chablis 
 yes sir and your cheese your excellency 
 oh yes parmesan or would you like another 
 no all the same to me said levin unable to suppress a smile 
 and the tatar ran off with flying coattails and in five minutes darted in with a dish of opened oysters in their nacreous shells and a bottle between his fingers 
 stepan arkadyevich crushed the starchy napkin tucked it into his waistcoat and settling his arms comfortably started on the oysters 
 not bad he said detaching the jellied oysters from their pearly shells with a small silver fork and swallowing them one after another not bad he repeated turning his dewy brilliant eyes now upon levin now upon the tatar 
 levin ate the oysters too though white bread and cheese pleased him better but he was admiring oblonsky even the tatar uncorking the bottle and pouring the sparkling wine into the delicate glasses and adjusting his white cravat kept on glancing at stepan arkadyevich with a perceptible smile of satisfaction 
 you care much for oysters do you said stepan arkadyevich emptying his wineglass or are you worried about something eh 
 he wanted levin to be in good spirits but it was not that levin was not in good spirits he was ill at ease with what he had in his soul he felt hard and awkward in the restaurant in the midst of private rooms where men were dining with ladies in all this fuss and bustle the surroundings of bronzes looking glasses gas and tatars all of this was offensive to him he was afraid of sullying what his soul was brimful of 
 i yes i am worried but besides that all this bothers me he said you conceive how queer it all seems to a countryman like me as queer as that nails i saw at your office 
 yes i saw how much interested you were in poor nails said stepan arkadyevich laughing 
 too much for me responded levin do try now to put yourself in my place take the point of view of a countryman we in the country try to bring our hands into such a state as will be most convenient for working with so we cut our nails sometimes we tuck up our sleeves and here people purposely let their nails grow as long as possible and link on small saucers by way of studs so that they can do nothing with their hands 
 stepan arkadyevich smiled gaily 
 oh yes just a sign that he has no need to do coarse work his work is with the mind 
 maybe but still queer to me just as at this moment it seems queer to me that we countryfolks try to satiate ourselves as soon as we can so as to be ready for work while here are we trying to delay satiety as long as possible and with that object are eating oysters 
 why of course objected stepan arkadyevich but just the aim of culture to make everything a source of enjoyment 
 well if its aim rather be a savage 
 you are a savage as it is all you levins are savages 
 levin sighed he remembered his brother nikolai and felt ashamed and pained and he scowled but oblonsky began speaking of a subject which at once drew his attention 
 oh i say are you going tonight to our people the i mean he said his eyes sparkling significantly as he pushed away the empty rough shells and drew the cheese toward him 
 yes i shall certainly go replied levin though i fancied the princess was not very warm in her invitation 
 what nonsense her manner come boy the soup her manner grande dame said stepan arkadyevich coming too but i have to go to the countess rehearsal come it true that a savage how do you explain the sudden way in which you vanished from moscow the shcherbatskys were continually asking me about you as though i ought to know the only thing i know is that you always do what no one else does 
 yes said levin slowly and with emotion right i am a savage only my savageness is not in having gone away but in coming now now i have come 
 oh what a lucky fellow you are broke in stepan arkadyevich looking into eyes 
 why 
 i can tell the gallant steeds by some i know what i can tell youths by their faces declaimed stepan arkadyevich everything is before you 
 why is it over for you already 
 no not over exactly but the future is yours and the present is mine and the present well only fair to middling 
 how so 
 oh things right but i want to talk of myself besides i explain it all said stepan arkadyevich well why have you come to moscow then hi clear the table he called to the tatar 
 are you trying to surmise responded levin his eyes gleaming in their depth fixed on stepan arkadyevich 
 i am but i be the first to talk about it you can see by that whether i surmise right or wrong said stepan arkadyevich gazing at levin with a subtle smile 
 well and what have you to say to me said levin in a quivering voice feeling that all the muscles of his face were quivering too how do you look at it 
 stepan arkadyevich slowly emptied his glass of chablis never taking his eyes off levin 
 i said stepan arkadyevich nothing i desire so much as that nothing it would be the best thing that could happen 
 but not making a mistake you know what speaking of said levin piercing him with his eyes you think possible 
 i think possible why not 
 no do you really think possible no tell me all you think oh but if if in store for me indeed i feel sure 
 what makes you think so said stepan arkadyevich smiling at his excitement 
 it seems so to me sometimes that will be awful for me and for her too 
 oh well anyway nothing awful in it for a girl every proud of a proposal 
 yes every girl but not she 
 stepan arkadyevich smiled he so well knew that feeling of that for him all the girls in the world were divided into two classes one class all the girls in the world except her and those girls with all sorts of human failings and very ordinary girls the other class she alone having no failings of any sort and higher than all humanity 
 stay take some sauce he said holding back hand who was pushing the sauce away 
 levin obediently helped himself to sauce but would not let stepan arkadyevich go on with his dinner 
 no stop a minute stop a minute he said you must understand that a question of life and death for me i have never spoken to anyone of this and no one to whom i could speak of it except yourself you know utterly unlike each other different in tastes and views and everything but i know fond of me and understand me and why i like you awfully but for sake be quite straightforward with me 
 i tell you what i think said stepan arkadyevich smiling but say more my wife is a wonderful woman stepan arkadyevich sighed recalling his relations with his wife and after a silence resumed she has a gift of foreseeing things she sees right through people but not all she knows what will come to pass especially in the way of marriages she foretold for instance that princess shahovskaia would marry brenteln no one would believe it but it came to pass and on your side 
 how do you mean 
 not only that she likes you she says that kitty is certain to be your wife 
 at these words face suddenly lighted up with a smile a smile not far from touching tears 
 she says that cried out levin i always said she was charming your wife there enough said about it he said getting up from his seat 
 well but do sit down 
 but levin could not sit down he walked with his firm tread twice up and down the little cage of a room blinked his eyelids that his tears might not fall and only then sat down to the table 
 you must understand said he not love been in love but not that not my feeling but a sort of force outside me that has taken possession of me i went away you see because i made up my mind that it could never be you understand like a happiness which is not of this earth but struggled with myself and i see no living without it and it must be settled

 levin emptied his glass and they were silent for a while 
 one other thing i ought to tell you do you know vronsky stepan arkadyevich asked levin 
 no i why do you ask 
 give us another bottle stepan arkadyevich directed the tatar who was filling up their glasses and fidgeting round them just when he was least wanted 
 why you ought to know vronsky because one of your rivals 
 vronsky said levin and his face was suddenly transformed from the look of childlike ecstasy which oblonsky had just been admiring to an angry and unpleasant expression 
 vronsky is one of the sons of count kirill ivanovich vronsky and one of the finest specimens of the gilded youth of peterburg i made his acquaintance in tver when i was there on official business and he came there for the levy of recruits fearfully rich handsome great connections an and with all that a very fine fellow but more than simply a fellow as found out here a cultured man too and very intelligent a man make his mark 
 levin scowled and kept silent 
 well he turned up here soon after gone and as i can see over head and ears in love with kitty and you know that her mother 
 excuse me but i know nothing said levin frowning gloomily and immediately he recalled his brother nikolai and how vile he was to have been able to forget him 
 you wait a bit wait a bit said stepan arkadyevich smiling and touching his hand told you what i know and i repeat that in this delicate and tender matter as far as one can conjecture i believe the chances are in your favor 
 levin dropped back in his chair his face was pale 
 but i would advise you to settle the thing as soon as possible pursued oblonsky filling up his glass 
 no thanks i drink any more said levin pushing away his glass i shall get drunk come tell me how are you getting on he went on obviously anxious to change the conversation 
 one word more in any case i advise you to settle the question soon tonight i advise you to speak said stepan arkadyevich go round tomorrow morning make a proposal in classic form and god bless you 
 oh do you still think of coming to me for some shooting come next spring do said levin 
 now his whole soul was full of remorse that he had begun this conversation with stepan arkadyevich his peculiar feeling was profaned by talk of the rivalry of some peterburg officer of the suppositions and the counsels of stepan arkadyevich 
 stepan arkadyevich smiled he knew what was passing in soul 
 come some day he said yes my dear women the pivot everything turns upon things are in a bad way with me very bad and all through women tell me frankly now he pursued picking up a cigar and keeping one hand on his glass give me your advice 
 why what is it 
 tell you suppose married you love your wife but are fascinated by another woman 
 excuse me but absolutely unable to comprehend how just as i comprehend how i could now after my dinner go straight to a shop and steal a loaf 
 stepan eyes sparkled more than usual 
 why not a loaf will sometimes smell so good that one resist it 
 himmlisch wenn ich bezwungen 
 meine irdische begier 
 aber doch nicht gelungen 
 hatt ich auch recht hbsch plaisir 
 as he said this stepan arkadyevich smiled subtly levin too could not help smiling 
 yes but joking apart resumed oblonsky you must understand that the woman a sweet gentle loving creature poor and lonely has sacrificed everything now when the done you see can one possibly cast her off even supposing one parts from her so as not to break up family life still can one help feeling for her setting her on her feet lightening her lot 
 well you must excuse me there you know to me all women are divided into two classes well no it would be truer to say there are women and there are never seen charming fallen beings and i never shall see them but such creatures as that painted frenchwoman at the counter with the ringlets are vermin to my mind and all fallen women are like her 
 but the magdalen 
 ah drop that christ would never have said those words if he had known how they would be abused of all the gospel those words are the only ones remembered however not saying so much what i think as what i feel i have a loathing for fallen women afraid of spiders and i of these vermin most likely not made a study of spiders and know their character and so it is with me 
 very well for you to talk like that very much like that gentleman in dickens who used to fling all difficult questions over his right shoulder with his left hand but denying the facts is no answer to be done you tell me that to be done your wife gets older while full of life before time to look round you feel that you love your wife with love however much you may esteem her and then all at once love turns up and done for done for stepan arkadyevich said with weary despair 
 levin smiled slightly 
 yes done for resumed oblonsky but to be done 
 steal loaves 
 stepan arkadyevich laughed outright 
 oh moralist but you must understand there are two women one insists only on her rights and those rights are your love which you give her while the other sacrifices everything for you and asks for nothing what are you to do how are you to act a fearful tragedy in it 
 if you care for my profession of faith as regards that tell you that i believe there was any tragedy about it and this is why to my mind love both sorts of love which you remember plato defines in his banquet serve as the touchstone of men some men only understand one sort and some only the other and those who only know the nonplatonic love talk in vain of tragedy in such love there can be no sort of tragedy much obliged for the gratification my humble respects all the tragedy and in platonic love there can be no tragedy because in that love all is clear and pure because 
 at that instant levin recollected his own sins and the inner conflict he had lived through and he added unexpectedly 
 but perhaps you are right very likely i know i positively know 
 you see said stepan arkadyevich very much all of a piece your quality and your failing you have a character all of a piece and you want the whole of life to be of a piece too but not how it is you despise public official work because you want the reality to be constantly corresponding with the aim and not how it is you want a work too always to have a defined aim and love and family life always to be undivided and not how it is all the variety all the charm all the beauty of life is made up of light and shadow 
 levin sighed and made no reply he was thinking of his own affairs and was not listening to oblonsky 
 and suddenly both of them felt that though they were friends though they had been dining together and drunk wine which should have drawn them closer yet each was thinking only of his own affairs and they had nothing to do with one another oblonsky had more than once experienced this extreme sense of aloofness instead of intimacy coming on after dinner and he knew what to do in such cases 
 have the check he called and he went into the next room where he promptly came across an of his acquaintance and dropped into conversation with him about an actress and her protector and at once in this conversation with the oblonsky had a sense of relaxation and relief after his conversation with levin which always put him to too great a mental and spiritual strain 
 when the tatar appeared with a check of roubles and some kopecks besides a tip for himself levin who would another time have been horrified like anyone from the country at his share of fourteen roubles did not notice it paid and set off homeward to dress and go to the where his fate was to be decided

 you wait a bit wait a bit said stepan arkadyevich smiling and touching his hand told you what i know and i repeat that in this delicate and tender matter as far as one can conjecture i believe the chances are in your favor 
 levin dropped back in his chair his face was pale 
 but i would advise you to settle the thing as soon as possible pursued oblonsky filling up his glass 
 no thanks i drink any more said levin pushing away his glass i shall get drunk come tell me how are you getting on he went on obviously anxious to change the conversation 
 one word more in any case i advise you to settle the question soon tonight i advise you to speak said stepan arkadyevich go round tomorrow morning make a proposal in classic form and god bless you 
 oh do you still think of coming to me for some shooting come next spring do said levin 
 now his whole soul was full of remorse that he had begun this conversation with stepan arkadyevich his peculiar feeling was profaned by talk of the rivalry of some peterburg officer of the suppositions and the counsels of stepan arkadyevich 
 stepan arkadyevich smiled he knew what was passing in soul 
 come some day he said yes my dear women the pivot everything turns upon things are in a bad way with me very bad and all through women tell me frankly now he pursued picking up a cigar and keeping one hand on his glass give me your advice 
 why what is it 
 tell you suppose married you love your wife but are fascinated by another woman 
 excuse me but absolutely unable to comprehend how just as i comprehend how i could now after my dinner go straight to a shop and steal a loaf 
 stepan eyes sparkled more than usual 
 why not a loaf will sometimes smell so good that one resist it 
 himmlisch wenn ich bezwungen 
 meine irdische begier 
 aber doch nicht gelungen 
 hatt ich auch recht hbsch plaisir 
 as he said this stepan arkadyevich smiled subtly levin too could not help smiling 
 yes but joking apart resumed oblonsky you must understand that the woman a sweet gentle loving creature poor and lonely has sacrificed everything now when the done you see can one possibly cast her off even supposing one parts from her so as not to break up family life still can one help feeling for her setting her on her feet lightening her lot 
 well you must excuse me there you know to me all women are divided into two classes well no it would be truer to say there are women and there are never seen charming fallen beings and i never shall see them but such creatures as that painted frenchwoman at the counter with the ringlets are vermin to my mind and all fallen women are like her 
 but the magdalen 
 ah drop that christ would never have said those words if he had known how they would be abused of all the gospel those words are the only ones remembered however not saying so much what i think as what i feel i have a loathing for fallen women afraid of spiders and i of these vermin most likely not made a study of spiders and know their character and so it is with me 
 very well for you to talk like that very much like that gentleman in dickens who used to fling all difficult questions over his right shoulder with his left hand but denying the facts is no answer to be done you tell me that to be done your wife gets older while full of life before time to look round you feel that you love your wife with love however much you may esteem her and then all at once love turns up and done for done for stepan arkadyevich said with weary despair 
 levin smiled slightly 
 yes done for resumed oblonsky but to be done 
 steal loaves 
 stepan arkadyevich laughed outright 
 oh moralist but you must understand there are two women one insists only on her rights and those rights are your love which you give her while the other sacrifices everything for you and asks for nothing what are you to do how are you to act a fearful tragedy in it 
 if you care for my profession of faith as regards that tell you that i believe there was any tragedy about it and this is why to my mind love both sorts of love which you remember plato defines in his banquet serve as the touchstone of men some men only understand one sort and some only the other and those who only know the nonplatonic love talk in vain of tragedy in such love there can be no sort of tragedy much obliged for the gratification my humble respects all the tragedy and in platonic love there can be no tragedy because in that love all is clear and pure because 
 at that instant levin recollected his own sins and the inner conflict he had lived through and he added unexpectedly 
 but perhaps you are right very likely i know i positively know 
 you see said stepan arkadyevich very much all of a piece your quality and your failing you have a character all of a piece and you want the whole of life to be of a piece too but not how it is you despise public official work because you want the reality to be constantly corresponding with the aim and not how it is you want a work too always to have a defined aim and love and family life always to be undivided and not how it is all the variety all the charm all the beauty of life is made up of light and shadow 
 levin sighed and made no reply he was thinking of his own affairs and was not listening to oblonsky 
 and suddenly both of them felt that though they were friends though they had been dining together and drunk wine which should have drawn them closer yet each was thinking only of his own affairs and they had nothing to do with one another oblonsky had more than once experienced this extreme sense of aloofness instead of intimacy coming on after dinner and he knew what to do in such cases 
 have the check he called and he went into the next room where he promptly came across an of his acquaintance and dropped into conversation with him about an actress and her protector and at once in this conversation with the oblonsky had a sense of relaxation and relief after his conversation with levin which always put him to too great a mental and spiritual strain 
 when the tatar appeared with a check of roubles and some kopecks besides a tip for himself levin who would another time have been horrified like anyone from the country at his share of fourteen roubles did not notice it paid and set off homeward to dress and go to the where his fate was to be decided

 levin emptied his glass and they were silent for a while 
 one other thing i ought to tell you do you know vronsky stepan arkadyevich asked levin 
 no i why do you ask

 why you ought to know vronsky because one of your rivals 
 vronsky said levin and his face was suddenly transformed from the look of childlike ecstasy which oblonsky had just been admiring to an angry and unpleasant expression 
 vronsky is one of the sons of count kirill ivanovich vronsky and one of the finest specimens of the gilded youth of peterburg i made his acquaintance in tver when i was there on official business and he came there for the levy of recruits fearfully rich handsome great connections an and with all that a very fine fellow but more than simply a fellow as found out here a cultured man too and very intelligent a man make his mark

 the young princess kitty shcherbatskaia was eighteen it was the first winter that she had been out in the world her success in society had been greater than that of either of her elder sisters and greater even than her mother had anticipated to say nothing of the young men who danced at the moscow balls being almost all in love with kitty two serious suitors had already the first winter made their appearance levin and immediately after his departure count vronsky 
 appearance at the beginning of the winter his frequent visits and evident love for kitty had led to the first serious conversations between parents as to her future and to disputes between them the prince was on side he said he wished for nothing better for kitty the princess for her part going round the question in the manner peculiar to women maintained that kitty was too young that levin had done nothing to prove that he had serious intentions that kitty felt no great attraction to him and there were some other reasons too but she did not state the principal point which was that she looked for a better match for her daughter that levin was not to her liking and that she did not understand him when levin had abruptly departed the princess was delighted and said to her husband triumphantly you see i was right when vronsky appeared on the scene she was still more delighted confirmed in her opinion that kitty was to make not simply a good but a brilliant match 
 in the eyes there could be no comparison between vronsky and levin the mother disliked in levin his strange and uncompromising opinions and his shyness in society founded on his pride as she supposed and his queer sort of life as she considered it absorbed in cattle and peasants she did not very much like it that he who was in love with her daughter had kept coming to the house for six weeks as though he were waiting for something inspecting as though he were afraid he might be doing them too great an honor by making a proposal and did not realize that a man who continually visits at a house where there is a young unmarried girl is bound to make his intentions clear and suddenly without doing so he disappeared as well not attractive enough for kitty to have fallen in love with him thought the mother 
 vronsky satisfied all the desires very wealthy clever of aristocratic family on the highroad to a brilliant career in the army and at court and a fascinating man nothing better could be wished for 
 vronsky openly flirted with kitty at balls danced with her and came continually to the house consequently there could be no doubt of the seriousness of his intentions but in spite of that the mother had spent the whole of that winter in a state of terrible anxiety and agitation 
 princess shcherbatskaia had herself been married thirty years ago her aunt arranging the match the wooer about whom everything was well known beforehand had come looked at his intended and been looked at the matchmaking aunt had ascertained and communicated their mutual impression that impression had been favorable afterward on a day fixed beforehand the expected proposal was made to her parents and accepted all had passed very simply and easily so it seemed at least to the princess but over her own daughters she had felt how far from simple and easy is the business apparently so commonplace of marrying off daughters the panics that had been lived through the thoughts that had been brooded over the money that had been wasted and the disputes with her husband over marrying the two elder girls darya and natalya now since the youngest began to come out in the world the princess was going through the same terrors the same doubts and still more violent quarrels with her husband than she had over the elder girls the old prince like all fathers indeed was exceedingly scrupulous on the score of the honor and reputation of his daughters he was unreasonably jealous over his daughters especially over kitty who was his favorite and at every turn he had scenes with the princess for compromising her daughter the princess had grown accustomed to this already with her other daughters but now she felt that there was more ground for the scrupulousness she saw that of late years much was changed in the manners of society that a duties had become still more difficult she saw that girls of age formed some sort of clubs went to some sort of lectures mixed freely in society drove about the streets alone many of them did not curtsy and what was the most important thing all of them were firmly convinced that to choose their husband was their own affair and not their marriages made nowadays as they used to be was thought and said by all these young girls and even by their elders but just how marriages were made nowadays the princess could not learn from anyone the french fashion of the parents arranging their future was not accepted it was condemned the english fashion of the complete independence of girls was also not accepted and not possible in russian society the russian fashion of matchmaking was considered unseemly it was ridiculed by everyone even by the princess herself but how girls were to be married and how parents were to marry them no one knew everyone with whom the princess had chanced to discuss the matter said the same thing mercy on us high time in our day to cast off all that business the young people have to marry and not their parents and so we ought to leave the young people to arrange it as they choose it was very easy for anyone to say who had no daughters but the princess realized that in the process of getting to know each other her daughter might fall in love and fall in love with someone who did not care to marry her or who was quite unfit to be her husband and however much it was instilled into the princess that in our times young people ought to arrange their lives for themselves she was unable to believe it just as she would have been unable to believe that at any time whatever loaded pistols were the most suitable playthings for children five years old and so the princess was more uneasy over kitty than she had been over the elder daughters 
 now she was afraid that vronsky might confine himself to simply flirting with her daughter she saw that her daughter was in love with him but tried to comfort herself with the thought that he was an honorable man and would not do this but at the same time she knew how easy it is with the freedom of manners of today to turn a head and how lightly men generally regard such a crime the week before kitty had told her mother of a conversation she had with vronsky during a mazurka this conversation had partly reassured the princess yet her assurance could not be perfect vronsky had told kitty that both he and his brother were so used to obeying their mother that they never made up their minds to any important undertaking without consulting her and just now i am impatiently awaiting my coming from peterburg as a peculiar piece of luck he had told her 
 kitty had repeated this without attaching any significance to the words but her mother saw them in a different light she knew that the old lady was expected from day to day that she would be pleased at her choice and she felt it strange that he should not make his proposal through fear of vexing his mother however she was so anxious for the marriage itself and still more for relief from her fears that she believed it was so bitter as it was for the princess to see the unhappiness of her eldest daughter dolly on the point of leaving her husband her anxiety over the decision of her youngest fate engrossed all her feelings today with reappearance a fresh source of anxiety arose she was afraid that her daughter who had at one time as she fancied a feeling for levin might from an extreme sense of honesty refuse vronsky and that arrival might generally complicate and delay the affair now so near conclusion 
 why has he been here long the princess asked about levin as they returned home 
 he came today maman 
 one thing i want to say began the princess and from her serious and alert face kitty guessed what it would be 
 mamma she said flushing hotly and turning quickly to her please please say anything about that i know i know all about it 
 she wished what her mother wished for but the motives of her wishes hurt her 
 i only want to say that to raise hopes 
 mamma darling for sake talk about it so horrible to talk about it 
 i said her mother seeing the tears in her eyes but one thing my love you promised me you would have no secrets from me you 
 never mamma none answered kitty flushing and looking her mother straight in the face but i have nothing to tell you now and i i if i wanted to i know what to say or how i know 
 no she could not tell an untruth with those eyes thought the mother smiling at her agitation and happiness the princess smiled so immense and so important seemed to the poor child everything that was taking place just now in her soul

 kitty had repeated this without attaching any significance to the words but her mother saw them in a different light she knew that the old lady was expected from day to day that she would be pleased at her choice and she felt it strange that he should not make his proposal through fear of vexing his mother however she was so anxious for the marriage itself and still more for relief from her fears that she believed it was so bitter as it was for the princess to see the unhappiness of her eldest daughter dolly on the point of leaving her husband her anxiety over the decision of her youngest fate engrossed all her feelings today with reappearance a fresh source of anxiety arose she was afraid that her daughter who had at one time as she fancied a feeling for levin might from an extreme sense of honesty refuse vronsky and that arrival might generally complicate and delay the affair now so near conclusion 
 why has he been here long the princess asked about levin as they returned home 
 he came today maman 
 one thing i want to say began the princess and from her serious and alert face kitty guessed what it would be 
 mamma she said flushing hotly and turning quickly to her please please say anything about that i know i know all about it 
 she wished what her mother wished for but the motives of her wishes hurt her 
 i only want to say that to raise hopes 
 mamma darling for sake talk about it so horrible to talk about it 
 i said her mother seeing the tears in her eyes but one thing my love you promised me you would have no secrets from me you 
 never mamma none answered kitty flushing and looking her mother straight in the face but i have nothing to tell you now and i i if i wanted to i know what to say or how i know 
 no she could not tell an untruth with those eyes thought the mother smiling at her agitation and happiness the princess smiled so immense and so important seemed to the poor child everything that was taking place just now in her soul

 the young princess kitty shcherbatskaia was eighteen it was the first winter that she had been out in the world her success in society had been greater than that of either of her elder sisters and greater even than her mother had anticipated to say nothing of the young men who danced at the moscow balls being almost all in love with kitty two serious suitors had already the first winter made their appearance levin and immediately after his departure count vronsky 
 appearance at the beginning of the winter his frequent visits and evident love for kitty had led to the first serious conversations between parents as to her future and to disputes between them the prince was on side he said he wished for nothing better for kitty the princess for her part going round the question in the manner peculiar to women maintained that kitty was too young that levin had done nothing to prove that he had serious intentions that kitty felt no great attraction to him and there were some other reasons too but she did not state the principal point which was that she looked for a better match for her daughter that levin was not to her liking and that she did not understand him when levin had abruptly departed the princess was delighted and said to her husband triumphantly you see i was right when vronsky appeared on the scene she was still more delighted confirmed in her opinion that kitty was to make not simply a good but a brilliant match 
 in the eyes there could be no comparison between vronsky and levin the mother disliked in levin his strange and uncompromising opinions and his shyness in society founded on his pride as she supposed and his queer sort of life as she considered it absorbed in cattle and peasants she did not very much like it that he who was in love with her daughter had kept coming to the house for six weeks as though he were waiting for something inspecting as though he were afraid he might be doing them too great an honor by making a proposal and did not realize that a man who continually visits at a house where there is a young unmarried girl is bound to make his intentions clear and suddenly without doing so he disappeared as well not attractive enough for kitty to have fallen in love with him thought the mother 
 vronsky satisfied all the desires very wealthy clever of aristocratic family on the highroad to a brilliant career in the army and at court and a fascinating man nothing better could be wished for 
 vronsky openly flirted with kitty at balls danced with her and came continually to the house consequently there could be no doubt of the seriousness of his intentions but in spite of that the mother had spent the whole of that winter in a state of terrible anxiety and agitation

 after dinner and till the beginning of the evening kitty was experiencing a sensation akin to that of a young man before a battle her heart throbbed violently and her thoughts would not rest on anything 
 she felt that this evening when both these men would meet for the first time would be a turning point in her life and she was continually picturing them to herself at one moment each individually and then both together when she mused on the past she dwelt with pleasure with tenderness on the memories of her relations with levin the memories of childhood and of friendship with her dead brother have a special poetic charm to her relations with him his love for her of which she felt certain was flattering and delightful to her and it was easy for her to think of levin in her memories of vronsky there always entered a certain element of awkwardness though he was in the highest degree a fashionable and man as though there were some false note not in vronsky he was very simple and charming but in herself while with levin she felt herself perfectly simple and clear but on the other hand directly she thought of the future with vronsky there arose before her a perspective of brilliant happiness with levin the future seemed misty 
 when she went upstairs to dress and looked into the looking glass she noticed with joy that it was one of her good days and that she was in complete possession of all her forces she needed this so for what lay before her she was conscious of external composure and free grace in her movements 
 at seven she had only just gone down into the drawing room when the footman announced constantin dmitrievich levin the princess was still in her room and the prince had not come in so it is to be thought kitty and all the blood seemed to rush to her heart she was horrified at her paleness as she glanced into the looking glass 
 at that moment she knew beyond doubt that he had come early on purpose to find her alone and to propose to her and only then for the first time the whole thing presented itself in a new different aspect only then she realized that the question did not affect her only with whom she would be happy and whom she loved but that she would have that moment to wound a man whom she liked and to wound him cruelly wherefore because he dear fellow loved her was in love with her but there was no help for it it must be so it would have to be so 
 my god shall i myself really have to say it to him she thought can i tell him i love him that will be a lie what am i to say to him that i love someone else no impossible going away going away 
 she had reached the door when she heard his step no not honest what have i to be afraid of i have done nothing wrong what is to be will be tell the truth and with him one be ill at ease here he is she said to herself seeing his powerful and timid figure with his shining eyes fixed on her she looked straight into his face as though imploring him to spare her and gave him her hand 
 not time yet i think too early he said glancing round the empty drawing room when he saw that his expectations were realized that there was nothing to prevent him from speaking his face became somber 
 oh no said kitty and sat down at a table 
 but this was just what i wanted to find you alone he began without sitting down and not looking at her so as not to lose courage 
 mamma will be down directly she was very much tired yesterday yesterday 
 she talked on not knowing what her lips were uttering and not taking her supplicating and caressing eyes off him 
 he glanced at her she blushed and ceased speaking 
 i told you i did not know whether i should be here long that it depended on you 
 she dropped her head lower and lower not knowing herself what answer she should make to what was coming 
 that it depended on you he repeated i meant to say i meant to say i came for this to have you be my wife he blurted out not knowing what he was saying but feeling that the most terrible thing was said he stopped short and looked at her 
 she was breathing heavily without looking at him she was feeling ecstasy her soul was flooded with happiness she had never anticipated that his utterance of love would produce such a powerful effect on her but it lasted only an instant she remembered vronsky she lifted her clear truthful eyes and seeing desperate face she answered hastily 
 that cannot be forgive me 
 a moment ago and how close she had been to him of what importance in his life and how aloof and remote from him she had become now 
 it could not have been otherwise he said without looking at her he bowed and was about to leave

 when she went upstairs to dress and looked into the looking glass she noticed with joy that it was one of her good days and that she was in complete possession of all her forces she needed this so for what lay before her she was conscious of external composure and free grace in her movements 
 at seven she had only just gone down into the drawing room when the footman announced constantin dmitrievich levin the princess was still in her room and the prince had not come in so it is to be thought kitty and all the blood seemed to rush to her heart she was horrified at her paleness as she glanced into the looking glass 
 at that moment she knew beyond doubt that he had come early on purpose to find her alone and to propose to her and only then for the first time the whole thing presented itself in a new different aspect only then she realized that the question did not affect her only with whom she would be happy and whom she loved but that she would have that moment to wound a man whom she liked and to wound him cruelly wherefore because he dear fellow loved her was in love with her but there was no help for it it must be so it would have to be so 
 my god shall i myself really have to say it to him she thought can i tell him i love him that will be a lie what am i to say to him that i love someone else no impossible going away going away 
 she had reached the door when she heard his step no not honest what have i to be afraid of i have done nothing wrong what is to be will be tell the truth and with him one be ill at ease here he is she said to herself seeing his powerful and timid figure with his shining eyes fixed on her she looked straight into his face as though imploring him to spare her and gave him her hand 
 not time yet i think too early he said glancing round the empty drawing room when he saw that his expectations were realized that there was nothing to prevent him from speaking his face became somber 
 oh no said kitty and sat down at a table 
 but this was just what i wanted to find you alone he began without sitting down and not looking at her so as not to lose courage 
 mamma will be down directly she was very much tired yesterday yesterday 
 she talked on not knowing what her lips were uttering and not taking her supplicating and caressing eyes off him 
 he glanced at her she blushed and ceased speaking 
 i told you i did not know whether i should be here long that it depended on you 
 she dropped her head lower and lower not knowing herself what answer she should make to what was coming 
 that it depended on you he repeated i meant to say i meant to say i came for this to have you be my wife he blurted out not knowing what he was saying but feeling that the most terrible thing was said he stopped short and looked at her 
 she was breathing heavily without looking at him she was feeling ecstasy her soul was flooded with happiness she had never anticipated that his utterance of love would produce such a powerful effect on her but it lasted only an instant she remembered vronsky she lifted her clear truthful eyes and seeing desperate face she answered hastily 
 that cannot be forgive me 
 a moment ago and how close she had been to him of what importance in his life and how aloof and remote from him she had become now 
 it could not have been otherwise he said without looking at her he bowed and was about to leave

 but at that very moment the princess came in there was a look of horror on her face when she beheld them alone and saw their disturbed faces levin bowed to her and said nothing kitty neither spoke nor lifted her eyes thank god she has refused him thought the mother and her face lighted up with the habitual smile with which she greeted her guests on thursdays she sat down and began questioning levin about his life in the country he sat down again waiting for other visitors to arrive in order to go off unnoticed 
 five minutes later there came in a friend of married the preceding winter countess nordstone 
 she was a thin sallow sickly and nervous woman with brilliant black eyes she was fond of kitty and her affection for her showed itself as the affection of married women for girls always does in the desire to make a match for kitty after her own ideal of married happiness she wanted her to marry vronsky levin she had often met at the early in the winter and she had always disliked him her invariable and favorite pursuit when they met consisted in making fun of him 
 i do like it when he looks down at me from the height of his grandeur or breaks off his wise conversation with me because a fool or is condescending to me i like that so to see him condescending i am so glad he bear me she used to say of him 
 she was right for levin actually could not bear her and despised her for what she was proud of and regarded as a fine characteristic her nervousness her refined contempt and indifference for everything coarse and earthly 
 the countess nordstone and levin had got into that mutual relation not infrequently seen in society when two persons who remain externally on friendly terms despise each other to such a degree that they cannot even take each other seriously and cannot even be offended by each other 
 the countess nordstone pounced upon levin at once 
 ah constantin dmitrievich so come back to our corrupt babylon she said giving him her tiny yellow hand and recalling what he had chanced to say early in the winter that moscow was a babylon come is babylon reformed or have you degenerated she added glancing with a simper at kitty 
 very flattering for me countess that you remember my words so well responded levin who had succeeded in recovering his composure and at once from habit dropped into his tone of joking hostility to the countess nordstone they must certainly make a great impression on you 
 oh i should think so i always note everything down well kitty have you been skating again 
 and she began talking to kitty awkward as it was for levin to withdraw now it would still have been easier for him to perpetrate this awkwardness than to remain all the evening and see kitty who glanced at him now and then and avoided his eyes he was on the point of getting up when the princess noticing that he was silent addressed him 
 shall you be long in moscow busy with the zemstvo though you and be away for long 
 no princess no longer a member of the board he said i have come up for a few days 
 something the matter with him thought countess nordstone glancing at his stern serious face he in his old argumentative mood but draw him out i do love making a fool of him before kitty and do it 
 constantin dmitrievich she said to him do explain to me please what does it mean you know all about such things in our village of kaluga all the peasants and all the women have drunk up all they possessed and now they pay us any rent the meaning of that you always praise the mouzhiks so 
 at that instant another lady came into the room and levin got up 
 excuse me countess but i really know nothing about it and tell you anything he said and looked round at the officer who came in behind the lady 
 that must be vronsky thought levin and to be sure of it glanced at kitty she had already had time to look at vronsky and looked round at levin and simply from the look in her eyes that grew unconsciously brighter levin knew that she loved this man knew it as surely as if she had told him in so many words but what sort of a man was he 
 now whether for good or for ill levin could not choose but remain he must find out what the man was like whom she loved 
 there are people who on meeting a successful rival no matter in what are at once disposed to turn their backs on everything good in him and to see only what is bad there are people who on the contrary desire above all to find in that successful rival the qualities by which he has worsted them and seek with a throbbing ache at heart only what is good levin belonged to the second class but he had no difficulty in finding what was good and attractive in vronsky it was apparent at the first glance vronsky was a squarely built dark man not very tall with a handsome and exceedingly calm and firm face everything about his face and figure from his black hair and freshly shaven chin down to his loosely fitting uniform was simple and at the same time elegant making way for the lady who had come in vronsky went up to the princess and then to kitty 
 as he approached her his beautiful eyes shone with an especially tender light and with a faint happy and modestly triumphant smile so it seemed to levin bowing carefully and respectfully over her he held out his small broad hand to her 
 greeting and saying a few words to everyone he sat down without once glancing at levin who had never taken his eyes off him 
 let me introduce you said the princess indicating levin constantin dmitrievich levin count alexei kirillovich vronsky 
 vronsky got up and looking cordially at levin shook hands with him 
 i believe i was to have dined with you this winter he said smiling his simple and open smile but you had unexpectedly left for the country 
 constantin dmitrievich despises and hates the town and us townspeople said countess nordstone 
 my words must make a deep impression on you since you remember them so well said levin and suddenly becoming conscious that he had said just the same thing before he reddened 
 vronsky looked at levin and countess nordstone and smiled 
 are you always in the country he inquired i should think it must be dull in the winter 
 not dull if one has work to do besides not dull by oneself levin replied abruptly 
 i am fond of the country said vronsky noticing yet affecting not to notice tone 
 but i hope count you would not consent to live in the country always said countess nordstone 
 i know i have never tried for long i experienced a queer feeling once he went on i never longed so for the country russian country with bast shoes and peasants as when i was spending a winter with my mother in nice nice itself is dull enough you know and indeed naples and sorrento are only pleasant for a short time and just there that russia comes back to mind most vividly and especially the country as though 
 he talked on addressing both kitty and levin turning his serene friendly eyes from one to the other and saying obviously just what came into his head 
 noticing that countess nordstone wanted to say something he stopped short without finishing what he had begun and listened attentively to her 
 the conversation did not flag for an instant so that the old princess who always kept in reserve in case a subject should be lacking two heavy guns the classical and professional education and universal military service had not to move out either of them while countess nordstone had no chance of chaffing levin 
 levin wanted to and could not take part in the general conversation saying to himself every instant now go he still did not go as though waiting for something 
 the conversation fell upon table turning and spirits and countess nordstone who believed in spiritualism began to describe the miracles she had seen 
 ah countess you really must take me for sake do take me to see them i have never seen anything extraordinary though i am always on the lookout for it everywhere said vronsky smiling 
 very well next saturday answered countess nordstone but you constantin dmitrievich are you a believer she asked levin 
 why do you ask me you know what i shall say 
 but i want to hear your opinion 
 my opinion answered levin is merely that this table turning proves that educated society so called is no higher than the peasants they believe in the evil eye and in witchcraft and conjurations while we 
 oh then you a believer 
 i believe countess 
 but if seen for myself 
 the peasant women too tell us they have seen hobgoblins 
 then you think i tell a lie 
 and she laughed a mirthless laugh 
 oh no masha constantin dmitrievich merely said he could not believe said kitty blushing for levin and levin saw this and still more exasperated would have answered but vronsky with his bright frank smile rushed to the support of the conversation which was threatening to become disagreeable 
 you do not admit the possibility at all he queried but why not we admit the existence of electricity of which we know nothing why should there not be some new force still unknown to us which 
 when electricity was discovered levin interrupted hurriedly it was only the phenomenon that was discovered and it was unknown from what it proceeded and what were its effects and ages passed before its applications were conceived but the spiritualists on the contrary have begun with tables writing for them and spirits appearing to them and have only later started saying that it is an unknown force 
 vronsky listened attentively to levin as he always did listen obviously interested in his words 
 yes but the spiritualists say we know at present what this force is but there is a force and these are the conditions in which it acts let the scientific men find out what the force consists of no i see why there should not be a new force if it 
 why because with electricity levin interrupted again every time you rub tar against wool a certain phenomenon is manifested but in this case it does not happen every time and so it follows it is not a natural phenomenon 
 feeling probably that the conversation was taking a tone too serious for a drawing room vronsky made no rejoinder but by way of trying to change the conversation he smiled brightly and turned to the ladies 
 do let us try at once countess he said but levin would finish saying what he thought 
 i think he went on that this attempt of the spiritualists to explain their miracles as some sort of new natural force is most futile they boldly talk of spiritual force and then try to subject it to material experiment 
 everyone was waiting for him to finish and he felt this 
 why i think you would be a medium said countess nordstone something enthusiastic about you 
 levin opened his mouth was about to say something reddened and said nothing 
 do let us try table turning at once please said vronsky princess will you allow it 
 and vronsky stood up looking about for a little table 
 kitty got up to fetch a table and as she passed her eyes met she felt for him with her whole heart the more because she was pitying him for a suffering of which she was herself the cause if you can forgive me forgive me said her eyes i am so happy 
 i hate them all and you and myself his eyes responded and he took up his hat but he was not destined to escape just as they were arranging themselves round the table and levin was on the point of retiring the old prince came in and after greeting the ladies addressed levin 
 ah he began joyously been here long my boy i even know you were in town very glad to see you the old prince embraced levin and talking to him did not observe vronsky who had risen and was calmly waiting till the prince should turn to him 
 kitty felt how grievous her cordiality was to levin after what had happened she saw too how coldly her father responded at last to bow and how vronsky looked with amiable perplexity at her father trying and failing to understand how and why anyone could be hostilely disposed toward him and she flushed 
 prince let us have constantin dmitrievich said countess nordstone we want to try an experiment 
 what experiment table turning well you must excuse me ladies and gentlemen but to my mind it is better fun to play the ring game said the old prince looking at vronsky and guessing that it had been his suggestion some sense in that anyway 
 vronsky looked wonderingly at the prince with his firm eyes and with a faint smile began immediately talking to countess nordstone of the great ball that was to come off next week 
 i hope you will be there he said to kitty as soon as the old prince turned away from him levin slipped out unnoticed and the last impression he carried away with him of that evening was the smiling happy face of kitty answering inquiry about the ball

 levin wanted to and could not take part in the general conversation saying to himself every instant now go he still did not go as though waiting for something 
 the conversation fell upon table turning and spirits and countess nordstone who believed in spiritualism began to describe the miracles she had seen 
 ah countess you really must take me for sake do take me to see them i have never seen anything extraordinary though i am always on the lookout for it everywhere said vronsky smiling 
 very well next saturday answered countess nordstone but you constantin dmitrievich are you a believer she asked levin 
 why do you ask me you know what i shall say 
 but i want to hear your opinion 
 my opinion answered levin is merely that this table turning proves that educated society so called is no higher than the peasants they believe in the evil eye and in witchcraft and conjurations while we 
 oh then you a believer 
 i believe countess 
 but if seen for myself 
 the peasant women too tell us they have seen hobgoblins 
 then you think i tell a lie 
 and she laughed a mirthless laugh 
 oh no masha constantin dmitrievich merely said he could not believe said kitty blushing for levin and levin saw this and still more exasperated would have answered but vronsky with his bright frank smile rushed to the support of the conversation which was threatening to become disagreeable 
 you do not admit the possibility at all he queried but why not we admit the existence of electricity of which we know nothing why should there not be some new force still unknown to us which 
 when electricity was discovered levin interrupted hurriedly it was only the phenomenon that was discovered and it was unknown from what it proceeded and what were its effects and ages passed before its applications were conceived but the spiritualists on the contrary have begun with tables writing for them and spirits appearing to them and have only later started saying that it is an unknown force 
 vronsky listened attentively to levin as he always did listen obviously interested in his words 
 yes but the spiritualists say we know at present what this force is but there is a force and these are the conditions in which it acts let the scientific men find out what the force consists of no i see why there should not be a new force if it 
 why because with electricity levin interrupted again every time you rub tar against wool a certain phenomenon is manifested but in this case it does not happen every time and so it follows it is not a natural phenomenon 
 feeling probably that the conversation was taking a tone too serious for a drawing room vronsky made no rejoinder but by way of trying to change the conversation he smiled brightly and turned to the ladies 
 do let us try at once countess he said but levin would finish saying what he thought 
 i think he went on that this attempt of the spiritualists to explain their miracles as some sort of new natural force is most futile they boldly talk of spiritual force and then try to subject it to material experiment 
 everyone was waiting for him to finish and he felt this 
 why i think you would be a medium said countess nordstone something enthusiastic about you 
 levin opened his mouth was about to say something reddened and said nothing 
 do let us try table turning at once please said vronsky princess will you allow it 
 and vronsky stood up looking about for a little table 
 kitty got up to fetch a table and as she passed her eyes met she felt for him with her whole heart the more because she was pitying him for a suffering of which she was herself the cause if you can forgive me forgive me said her eyes i am so happy 
 i hate them all and you and myself his eyes responded and he took up his hat but he was not destined to escape just as they were arranging themselves round the table and levin was on the point of retiring the old prince came in and after greeting the ladies addressed levin 
 ah he began joyously been here long my boy i even know you were in town very glad to see you the old prince embraced levin and talking to him did not observe vronsky who had risen and was calmly waiting till the prince should turn to him 
 kitty felt how grievous her cordiality was to levin after what had happened she saw too how coldly her father responded at last to bow and how vronsky looked with amiable perplexity at her father trying and failing to understand how and why anyone could be hostilely disposed toward him and she flushed 
 prince let us have constantin dmitrievich said countess nordstone we want to try an experiment 
 what experiment table turning well you must excuse me ladies and gentlemen but to my mind it is better fun to play the ring game said the old prince looking at vronsky and guessing that it had been his suggestion some sense in that anyway 
 vronsky looked wonderingly at the prince with his firm eyes and with a faint smile began immediately talking to countess nordstone of the great ball that was to come off next week 
 i hope you will be there he said to kitty as soon as the old prince turned away from him levin slipped out unnoticed and the last impression he carried away with him of that evening was the smiling happy face of kitty answering inquiry about the ball

 but at that very moment the princess came in there was a look of horror on her face when she beheld them alone and saw their disturbed faces levin bowed to her and said nothing kitty neither spoke nor lifted her eyes thank god she has refused him thought the mother and her face lighted up with the habitual smile with which she greeted her guests on thursdays she sat down and began questioning levin about his life in the country he sat down again waiting for other visitors to arrive in order to go off unnoticed 
 five minutes later there came in a friend of married the preceding winter countess nordstone 
 she was a thin sallow sickly and nervous woman with brilliant black eyes she was fond of kitty and her affection for her showed itself as the affection of married women for girls always does in the desire to make a match for kitty after her own ideal of married happiness she wanted her to marry vronsky levin she had often met at the early in the winter and she had always disliked him her invariable and favorite pursuit when they met consisted in making fun of him 
 i do like it when he looks down at me from the height of his grandeur or breaks off his wise conversation with me because a fool or is condescending to me i like that so to see him condescending i am so glad he bear me she used to say of him 
 she was right for levin actually could not bear her and despised her for what she was proud of and regarded as a fine characteristic her nervousness her refined contempt and indifference for everything coarse and earthly 
 the countess nordstone and levin had got into that mutual relation not infrequently seen in society when two persons who remain externally on friendly terms despise each other to such a degree that they cannot even take each other seriously and cannot even be offended by each other 
 the countess nordstone pounced upon levin at once 
 ah constantin dmitrievich so come back to our corrupt babylon she said giving him her tiny yellow hand and recalling what he had chanced to say early in the winter that moscow was a babylon come is babylon reformed or have you degenerated she added glancing with a simper at kitty 
 very flattering for me countess that you remember my words so well responded levin who had succeeded in recovering his composure and at once from habit dropped into his tone of joking hostility to the countess nordstone they must certainly make a great impression on you 
 oh i should think so i always note everything down well kitty have you been skating again 
 and she began talking to kitty awkward as it was for levin to withdraw now it would still have been easier for him to perpetrate this awkwardness than to remain all the evening and see kitty who glanced at him now and then and avoided his eyes he was on the point of getting up when the princess noticing that he was silent addressed him 
 shall you be long in moscow busy with the zemstvo though you and be away for long 
 no princess no longer a member of the board he said i have come up for a few days 
 something the matter with him thought countess nordstone glancing at his stern serious face he in his old argumentative mood but draw him out i do love making a fool of him before kitty and do it 
 constantin dmitrievich she said to him do explain to me please what does it mean you know all about such things in our village of kaluga all the peasants and all the women have drunk up all they possessed and now they pay us any rent the meaning of that you always praise the mouzhiks so 
 at that instant another lady came into the room and levin got up 
 excuse me countess but i really know nothing about it and tell you anything he said and looked round at the officer who came in behind the lady 
 that must be vronsky thought levin and to be sure of it glanced at kitty she had already had time to look at vronsky and looked round at levin and simply from the look in her eyes that grew unconsciously brighter levin knew that she loved this man knew it as surely as if she had told him in so many words but what sort of a man was he 
 now whether for good or for ill levin could not choose but remain he must find out what the man was like whom she loved 
 there are people who on meeting a successful rival no matter in what are at once disposed to turn their backs on everything good in him and to see only what is bad there are people who on the contrary desire above all to find in that successful rival the qualities by which he has worsted them and seek with a throbbing ache at heart only what is good levin belonged to the second class but he had no difficulty in finding what was good and attractive in vronsky it was apparent at the first glance vronsky was a squarely built dark man not very tall with a handsome and exceedingly calm and firm face everything about his face and figure from his black hair and freshly shaven chin down to his loosely fitting uniform was simple and at the same time elegant making way for the lady who had come in vronsky went up to the princess and then to kitty 
 as he approached her his beautiful eyes shone with an especially tender light and with a faint happy and modestly triumphant smile so it seemed to levin bowing carefully and respectfully over her he held out his small broad hand to her 
 greeting and saying a few words to everyone he sat down without once glancing at levin who had never taken his eyes off him 
 let me introduce you said the princess indicating levin constantin dmitrievich levin count alexei kirillovich vronsky 
 vronsky got up and looking cordially at levin shook hands with him 
 i believe i was to have dined with you this winter he said smiling his simple and open smile but you had unexpectedly left for the country 
 constantin dmitrievich despises and hates the town and us townspeople said countess nordstone 
 my words must make a deep impression on you since you remember them so well said levin and suddenly becoming conscious that he had said just the same thing before he reddened 
 vronsky looked at levin and countess nordstone and smiled 
 are you always in the country he inquired i should think it must be dull in the winter 
 not dull if one has work to do besides not dull by oneself levin replied abruptly 
 i am fond of the country said vronsky noticing yet affecting not to notice tone 
 but i hope count you would not consent to live in the country always said countess nordstone 
 i know i have never tried for long i experienced a queer feeling once he went on i never longed so for the country russian country with bast shoes and peasants as when i was spending a winter with my mother in nice nice itself is dull enough you know and indeed naples and sorrento are only pleasant for a short time and just there that russia comes back to mind most vividly and especially the country as though 
 he talked on addressing both kitty and levin turning his serene friendly eyes from one to the other and saying obviously just what came into his head 
 noticing that countess nordstone wanted to say something he stopped short without finishing what he had begun and listened attentively to her 
 the conversation did not flag for an instant so that the old princess who always kept in reserve in case a subject should be lacking two heavy guns the classical and professional education and universal military service had not to move out either of them while countess nordstone had no chance of chaffing levin

 at the end of the evening kitty told her mother of her conversation with levin and in spite of all the pity she felt for levin she was glad at the thought that she had received a proposal she had no doubt that she had acted rightly but after she had gone to bed she could not sleep for a long while one impression pursued her relentlessly it was face with his scowling brows and his kind eyes looking out in dark dejection below them as he stood listening to her father and glancing at her and at vronsky and she felt so sorry for him that tears came into her eyes but immediately she thought of the man for whom she had given him up she vividly recalled his manly firm face his noble calmness and the good nature so conspicuous toward everyone she remembered the love for her of the man she loved and once more all was gladness in her soul and she lay on the pillow smiling with happiness sorry sorry but what could i do not my fault she said to herself but an inner voice told her otherwise whether she felt remorse at having captivated levin or at having refused him she did not know but her happiness was poisoned by doubts lord have pity on us lord have pity lord have pity she said over to herself till she fell asleep

 what have you done tell you what first of all trying to allure an eligible gentleman and all moscow will be talking of it and with good reason if you have evening parties invite everyone pick out the possible suitors invite all these whelps so the prince styled the youths of moscow engage a piano player and let them dance and not as you did tonight only the wooers and doing your matching it makes me sick sick to see it and gone on till turned the poor head a thousand times the better man as for this peterburg swell turned out by machinery all on one pattern and all precious rubbish but if he were a prince of the blood my daughter need not run after anyone

 i know if one were to listen to you interrupted the princess we should never marry off our daughter if to be so better go into the country 
 well we had better 
 but do wait a minute do i wheedle them i wheedle them in the least a young man and a very nice one has fallen in love with her and she i fancy 
 oh yes you fancy and how if she really is in love and no more thinking of marriage than i am oh that i should live to see it ah spiritualism ah nice ah the ball and the prince imagining that he was mimicking his wife made a mincing curtsy at each word and this is how we prepare wretchedness for katenka and really got the notion into her head

 next day at eleven in the morning vronsky drove to the station of the peterburg railway to meet his mother and the first person he came across on the great flight of steps was oblonsky who was expecting his sister by the same train 
 ah your excellency cried oblonsky whom are you meeting 
 my mother vronsky responded smiling as everyone did who met oblonsky he shook hands with him and together they ascended the steps she is to be here from peterburg today 
 i was looking out for you till two last night where did you go from the 
 home answered vronsky i must own i felt so well content yesterday after the that i care to go anywhere 
 i can tell the gallant by some i know what i can tell youths by their faces declaimed stepan arkadyevich just as he had done before to levin 
 vronsky smiled with a look that seemed to say that he did not deny it but he promptly changed the subject 
 and whom are you meeting he asked 
 i come to meet a pretty woman said oblonsky 
 so it 
 honi soit qui mal y pense my sister anna 
 ah madame karenina said vronsky 
 you know her no doubt 
 i think i do or perhaps not i really am not sure vronsky answered heedlessly with a vague recollection of something stiff and tedious evoked by the name karenina 
 but alexei alexandrovich my celebrated you surely must know all the world knows him 
 i know him by reputation and by sight i know that clever learned religious somewhat but you know not not in my line said vronsky in english 
 yes a very remarkable man rather a conservative but a very nice man observed stepan arkadyevich a very nice man 
 oh well so much the better for him said vronsky smiling oh come he said addressing a tall old footman of his standing at the door come here 
 besides the charm oblonsky had in general for everyone vronsky had felt of late specially drawn to him by the fact that in his imagination he was associated with kitty 
 well what do you say shall we give a supper on sunday for the diva he said to him with a smile taking his arm 
 of course collecting subscriptions oh did you make the acquaintance of my friend levin asked stepan arkadyevich 
 yes but he left rather early 
 a capital fellow pursued oblonsky he 
 i know why it is responded vronsky in all moscow people present company of course excepted he put in jestingly something uncompromising they are all on the defensive lose their tempers as though they all want to make one feel something 
 yes true so said stepan arkadyevich laughing cheerfully 
 will the train be in soon vronsky asked a railway official 
 the signaled answered the man 
 the approach of the train was more and more evident by the preparatory bustle in the station the rush of porters the movement of gendarmes and attendants and crowding people meeting the train through the frosty vapor could be seen workmen in short sheepskins and soft felt boots crossing the rails of the curving line the hiss of the boiler could be heard on the distant rails and the rumble of something heavy 
 no said stepan arkadyevich who felt a great inclination to tell vronsky of intentions in regard to kitty no you got a true impression of levin a very nervous man and is sometimes out of humor true but then he is often very charming he has such a true honest nature and a heart of gold but yesterday there were special reasons pursued stepan arkadyevich with a meaning smile totally oblivious of the genuine sympathy he had felt the day before for his friend and feeling the same sympathy now only for vronsky yes there were reasons why he could not help being either particularly happy or particularly unhappy 
 vronsky stood still and asked directly how so do you mean he proposed to your yesterday 
 maybe said stepan arkadyevich i fancied something of the sort yesterday yes if he went away early and was out of humor too such must be the case been so long in love and very sorry for him 
 so it i should imagine though she might reckon on a better match said vronsky setting his chest straight and walking about again though i know him of course he added yes that is a hateful position why most fellows prefer to have to do with the claras if you succeed with them it only proves that not enough cash but in this case dignity is in the balance but the train 
 the engine had already whistled in the distance a few instants later the platform began to shake and with puffs of steam hanging low in the air from the frost the engine rolled up with the rod of the middle wheel rhythmically moving up and down and the bowed muffled figure of the engine driver covered with hoarfrost behind the tender setting the platform more and more slowly and more powerfully shaking came the luggage van with a dog whining in it at last the passenger carriages rolled in quivering before coming to a standstill 
 a smart guard jumped out giving a whistle and after him one by one the impatient passengers began to get down an officer of the guards holding himself erect and looking severely about him a nimble young merchant with a bag smiling gaily a peasant with a sack over his shoulder 
 vronsky standing beside oblonsky watched the carriages and the passengers totally oblivious of his mother what he had just heard about kitty excited and delighted him unconsciously he straightened his chest and his eyes flashed he felt himself a conqueror 
 countess vronskaia is in that compartment said the smart guard going up to vronsky 
 the words roused him and forced him to think of his mother and his approaching meeting with her he did not in his heart respect his mother and without acknowledging it to himself he did not love her though in accordance with the ideas of the set in which he lived and with his own upbringing he could not have conceived of any behavior to his mother not in the highest degree respectful and obedient and the more externally obedient and respectful the less in his heart he respected and loved her

 so it i should imagine though she might reckon on a better match said vronsky setting his chest straight and walking about again though i know him of course he added yes that is a hateful position why most fellows prefer to have to do with the claras if you succeed with them it only proves that not enough cash but in this case dignity is in the balance but the train 
 the engine had already whistled in the distance a few instants later the platform began to shake and with puffs of steam hanging low in the air from the frost the engine rolled up with the rod of the middle wheel rhythmically moving up and down and the bowed muffled figure of the engine driver covered with hoarfrost behind the tender setting the platform more and more slowly and more powerfully shaking came the luggage van with a dog whining in it at last the passenger carriages rolled in quivering before coming to a standstill 
 a smart guard jumped out giving a whistle and after him one by one the impatient passengers began to get down an officer of the guards holding himself erect and looking severely about him a nimble young merchant with a bag smiling gaily a peasant with a sack over his shoulder 
 vronsky standing beside oblonsky watched the carriages and the passengers totally oblivious of his mother what he had just heard about kitty excited and delighted him unconsciously he straightened his chest and his eyes flashed he felt himself a conqueror 
 countess vronskaia is in that compartment said the smart guard going up to vronsky 
 the words roused him and forced him to think of his mother and his approaching meeting with her he did not in his heart respect his mother and without acknowledging it to himself he did not love her though in accordance with the ideas of the set in which he lived and with his own upbringing he could not have conceived of any behavior to his mother not in the highest degree respectful and obedient and the more externally obedient and respectful the less in his heart he respected and loved her

 vronsky followed the guard to the carriage and at the door of the compartment he stopped short to make room for a lady who was getting out 
 with the habitual feeling of a man of the world from one glance at this appearance vronsky classified her as belonging to the best society he begged pardon and was getting into the carriage but felt he must glance at her once more not because she was very beautiful not because of that elegance and modest grace which were apparent in her whole figure but because in the expression of her charming face as she passed close by him there was something peculiarly caressing and soft as he looked round she too turned her head her shining gray eyes that looked dark because of her thick lashes rested with friendly attention on his face as though she were recognizing him and then promptly turned away to the passing crowd as though seeking someone in that brief look vronsky had time to notice the suppressed animation which played over her face and flitted between the brilliant eyes and the faint smile that curved her red lips it was as though her nature were so brimming over with something that against her will it showed itself now in the flash of her eyes and now in her smile deliberately she shrouded the light in her eyes but it shone against her will in her faintly perceptible smile 
 vronsky stepped into the carriage his mother a old lady with black eyes and ringlets screwed up her eyes scanning her son and smiled slightly with her thin lips getting up from the seat and handing her maid a handbag she gave her little wrinkled hand to her son to kiss and lifting his head from her hand kissed him on the cheek 
 you got my telegram quite well thank god 
 you had a good journey said her son sitting down beside her and involuntarily listening to a voice outside the door he knew it was the voice of the lady he had met at the door

 the peterburg view madame 
 not peterburg but simply feminine she responded 
 well well allow me to kiss your hand 
 ivan petrovich and would you see if my brother is here and send him to me said the lady in the doorway and stepped back again into the compartment 
 well have you found your brother said countess vronskaia addressing the lady 
 vronsky understood now that this was madame karenina 
 your brother is here he said standing up excuse me i did not know you and indeed our acquaintance was so slight said vronsky bowing that no doubt you do not remember me 
 oh no said she i should have known you because your mother and i have been talking i think of nothing but you all the way as she spoke she let the animation that would insist on coming out show itself in her smile and still no sign of my brother 
 do call him aliosha said the old countess 
 vronsky stepped out onto the platform and shouted oblonsky here 
 madame karenina however did not wait for her brother but catching sight of him she stepped out with her light resolute step and as soon as her brother had reached her with a gesture that struck vronsky by its decision and its grace she flung her left arm around his neck drew him rapidly to her and kissed him warmly vronsky looked on never taking his eyes from her and smiled he could not have said why but recollecting that his mother was waiting for him he went back again into the carriage 
 
 very sweet she said the countess of madame karenina her husband put her with me and i was delighted to have her been talking all the way and so you i hear vous filez le parfait amour tant mieux mon cher tant mieux 
 i know what you are referring to maman he answered coldly come maman let us go 
 madame karenina entered the carriage again to say to the countess 
 well countess you have met your son and i my brother she said gaily and all my stories are exhausted i should have nothing more to tell you 
 oh no said the countess taking her hand i could go all around the world with you and never be dull you are one of those delightful women in whose company sweet either to be silent or to chat now please fret over your son you expect never to be parted 
 madame karenina stood quite still holding herself very erect and her eyes were smiling 
 anna arkadyevna the countess said in explanation to her son has a little son eight years old i believe and she has never been parted from him before and she keeps fretting over leaving him 
 yes the countess and i have been talking all the time i of my son and she of hers said madame karenina and again a smile lighted up her face a caressing smile intended for him 
 i am afraid that you must have been dreadfully bored he said promptly catching the ball of coquetry she had flung him but apparently she did not care to pursue the conversation in that strain and she turned to the old countess 
 thank you so much the time has passed so quickly countess 
 my love answered the countess let me kiss your pretty face i speak plainly at my age and i tell you simply that lost my heart to you 
 stereotyped as the phrase was madame karenina obviously believed it and was delighted by it she flushed bent down slightly and put her cheek to the lips drew herself up again and with the same smile fluttering between her lips and her eyes she gave her hand to vronsky he pressed the little hand she gave him and was delighted as though at something special by the energetic squeeze with which she freely and vigorously shook his hand she went out with the rapid step which bore her rather fully developed figure with such strange lightness 
 very charming said the countess 
 that was precisely what her son was thinking his eyes followed her till her graceful figure was out of sight and then the smile remained on his face he saw out of the window how she went up to her brother put her arm in his and began telling him something animatedly obviously something that had nothing to do with him vronsky and at that he felt annoyed 
 well maman are you perfectly well he repeated turning to his mother 
 everything has been delightful alexandre has been very good and marie has grown very pretty very interesting 
 and she began telling him again of what interested her most the christening of her grandson for which she had been staying in peterburg and the special favor shown her elder son by the czar 
 lavrentii said vronsky looking out of the window now we can go if you like

 stepan arkadyevich with his sister on his arm turned back they too looked scared and stopped at the carriage door to avoid the crowd 
 the ladies got in while vronsky and stepan arkadyevich followed the crowd to find out details of the disaster 
 a watchman either drunk or too much muffled up in the bitter frost had not heard the train moving back and had been crushed 
 before vronsky and oblonsky came back the ladies heard the facts from the butler 
 oblonsky and vronsky had both seen the mutilated corpse oblonsky was evidently distressed he frowned and seemed ready to cry 
 ah how awful ah anna if you had seen it ah how awful he kept repeating 
 vronsky did not speak his handsome face was serious but perfectly calm 
 ah if you had seen it countess said stepan arkadyevich and his wife was there it was awful to see her she flung herself on the body they say he was the only support of an immense family how awful 
 one do anything for her said madame karenina in an agitated whisper 
 vronsky glanced at her and immediately got out of the carriage

 oh no said the countess taking her hand i could go all around the world with you and never be dull you are one of those delightful women in whose company sweet either to be silent or to chat now please fret over your son you expect never to be parted 
 madame karenina stood quite still holding herself very erect and her eyes were smiling 
 anna arkadyevna the countess said in explanation to her son has a little son eight years old i believe and she has never been parted from him before and she keeps fretting over leaving him 
 yes the countess and i have been talking all the time i of my son and she of hers said madame karenina and again a smile lighted up her face a caressing smile intended for him 
 i am afraid that you must have been dreadfully bored he said promptly catching the ball of coquetry she had flung him but apparently she did not care to pursue the conversation in that strain and she turned to the old countess 
 thank you so much the time has passed so quickly countess 
 my love answered the countess let me kiss your pretty face i speak plainly at my age and i tell you simply that lost my heart to you 
 stereotyped as the phrase was madame karenina obviously believed it and was delighted by it she flushed bent down slightly and put her cheek to the lips drew herself up again and with the same smile fluttering between her lips and her eyes she gave her hand to vronsky he pressed the little hand she gave him and was delighted as though at something special by the energetic squeeze with which she freely and vigorously shook his hand she went out with the rapid step which bore her rather fully developed figure with such strange lightness 
 very charming said the countess 
 that was precisely what her son was thinking his eyes followed her till her graceful figure was out of sight and then the smile remained on his face he saw out of the window how she went up to her brother put her arm in his and began telling him something animatedly obviously something that had nothing to do with him vronsky and at that he felt annoyed 
 well maman are you perfectly well he repeated turning to his mother 
 everything has been delightful alexandre has been very good and marie has grown very pretty very interesting 
 and she began telling him again of what interested her most the christening of her grandson for which she had been staying in peterburg and the special favor shown her elder son by the czar 
 lavrentii said vronsky looking out of the window now we can go if you like 
 the old butler who had traveled with the countess came to the carriage to announce that everything was ready and the countess got up to go 
 come not such a crowd now said vronsky 
 the maid took a handbag and the lap dog the butler and a porter the other baggage vronsky gave his mother his arm but just as they were getting out of the carriage several men ran suddenly by with faces the stationmaster too ran by in his extraordinarily colored cap obviously something unusual had happened the crowd was running to the tail end of the train 
 what what where flung himself crushed was heard among the crowd 
 stepan arkadyevich with his sister on his arm turned back they too looked scared and stopped at the carriage door to avoid the crowd 
 the ladies got in while vronsky and stepan arkadyevich followed the crowd to find out details of the disaster 
 a watchman either drunk or too much muffled up in the bitter frost had not heard the train moving back and had been crushed 
 before vronsky and oblonsky came back the ladies heard the facts from the butler 
 oblonsky and vronsky had both seen the mutilated corpse oblonsky was evidently distressed he frowned and seemed ready to cry 
 ah how awful ah anna if you had seen it ah how awful he kept repeating 
 vronsky did not speak his handsome face was serious but perfectly calm 
 ah if you had seen it countess said stepan arkadyevich and his wife was there it was awful to see her she flung herself on the body they say he was the only support of an immense family how awful 
 one do anything for her said madame karenina in an agitated whisper 
 vronsky glanced at her and immediately got out of the carriage 
 be back directly maman he remarked turning round in the doorway 
 when he came back a few minutes later stepan arkadyevich was already in conversation with the countess about a new singer while she was impatiently looking toward the door waiting for her son 
 now let us be off said vronsky coming in 
 they went out together vronsky was in front with his mother behind walked madame karenina with her brother just as they were going out of the station the stationmaster overtook vronsky 
 you gave my assistant two hundred roubles would you kindly explain for whose benefit you intend them 
 for the widow said vronsky shrugging his shoulders i should have thought there was no need to ask 
 you gave that cried oblonsky behind and pressing his hand he added most charming most charming he a fine fellow countess 
 and he and his sister stood still looking for her maid 
 when they went out the carriage had already driven away people coming in were still talking of what had happened 
 what a horrible death said a gentleman passing by they say he was cut in two 
 on the contrary i think the easiest instantaneous observed another 
 how is it they take proper precautions a third was saying 
 madame karenina seated herself in the carriage and stepan arkadyevich saw with surprise that her lips were quivering and that she was with difficulty restraining her tears 
 what is it anna he asked when they had driven a few hundred sagenes 
 an omen of evil she said 
 what nonsense said stepan arkadyevich come the chief thing you conceive how resting my hopes on you 
 have you known vronsky long she asked 
 yes you know hoping he will marry kitty 
 yes said anna softly come now let us talk of you she added tossing her head as though she would physically shake off something superfluous oppressing her let us talk of your affairs i got your letter and here i am 
 yes all my hopes are in you said stepan arkadyevich 
 well tell me all about it 
 and stepan arkadyevich began his story 
 on reaching home oblonsky helped his sister out sighed pressed her hand and set off to his office

 when anna entered the tiny drawing room she found dolly sitting there with a plump little boy already resembling his father she was listening to a lesson in french reading as the boy read he kept twisting and trying to tear off a button that was nearly off his jacket his mother had several times taken his hand from it but the plump little hand went back to the button again his mother pulled the button off and put it in her pocket 
 keep your hands still grisha she said and she took up her work a coverlet she had long been making she always set to work on it at depressed moments and now she knitted at it nervously twitching her fingers and counting the stitches though she had sent word the day before to her husband that it was nothing to her whether his sister came or not she had made everything ready for her arrival and was expecting her with agitation 
 dolly was crushed by her sorrow utterly swallowed up by it still she did not forget that anna her was the wife of one of the most important personages in peterburg and was a peterburg grande dame and thanks to this circumstance she did not carry out her threat to her husband that is to say she had not forgotten that her was coming and after all anna is in no wise to blame thought dolly i know nothing save the very best about her and i have seen nothing but kindness and affection from her toward myself it was true that as far as she could recall her impressions at peterburg at the she did not like their household itself there was something artificial about the whole arrangement of their family life but why should i not receive her if only she take it into her head to console me thought dolly all consolations and exhortations and christian forgiveness i have thought all this over a thousand times and all no use 
 all these days dolly had been alone with her children she did not want to talk of her sorrow but with that sorrow in her heart she could not talk of outside matters 
 she knew that in one way or another she would tell anna everything and she was alternately glad at the thought of speaking freely and angry at the necessity of speaking of her humiliation with her his sister and of hearing her phrases of exhortation and consolation 
 she had been on the lookout for her glancing at her watch every minute and as often happens let slip that precise minute when her visitor arrived so that she did not hear the bell 
 catching the sound of skirts and of light steps at the door she looked round and her careworn face unconsciously expressed not gladness but wonder she got up and embraced her 
 what here already she said as she kissed her 
 dolly how glad i am to see you 
 i am glad too said dolly faintly smiling and trying by the expression of face to find out whether she knew most likely she knows she thought noticing the sympathy in face well come along take you to your room she went on trying to defer as long as possible the time of explanation 
 is this grisha heavens how grown said anna and kissing him never taking her eyes off dolly she stood still and flushed no please let us stay here 
 she took off her shawl and her hat and catching it in a lock of her black hair which was a mass of curls she tossed her head and shook her hair down 
 you are radiant with health and happiness said dolly almost with envy 
 i yes said anna merciful heavens tania the same age as my seriozha she added addressing the little girl as she ran in she took her in her arms and kissed her delightful child delightful show me them all 
 she mentioned them not only remembering the names but the years months characters illnesses of all the children and dolly could not but appreciate that 
 very well we will go to them she said a pity asleep 
 after seeing the children they sat down alone now in the drawing room to coffee anna took the tray and then pushed it away from her 
 dolly she said he has told me 
 dolly looked coldly at anna she was waiting now for hypocritically sympathetic phrases but anna said nothing of the sort 
 dolly darling she said i want to intercede for him nor to try to comfort you impossible but my dearest simply sorry sorry from my heart for you 
 under the thick lashes of her shining eyes tears suddenly glittered she moved nearer to her and took her hand in her own vigorous and little dolly did not shrink away but her face did not lose its frigid expression she said 
 to comfort me is impossible lost after what has happened over 
 and directly she had said this her face suddenly softened anna lifted the wasted thin hand of dolly kissed it and said 
 but dolly to be done to be done how is it best to act in this awful position what you must think of 
 over and nothing more said dolly and the worst of it all is you see that i cast him off there are the children my hands are tied and i live with him a torture for me to see him 
 dolly darling he has spoken to me but i want to hear it from you tell me all about it 
 dolly looked at her inquiringly 
 sympathy and love unfeigned were apparent on face 
 very well she suddenly said but i will begin at the beginning you know how i was married with the education maman gave us i was more than innocent i was foolish i knew nothing they say i know men tell their wives of their former lives but stiva she corrected herself stepan arkadyevich told me nothing hardly believe it but till now i imagined that i was the only woman he had known so i lived eight years you must understand that i was not only far from suspecting infidelity but i regarded it as impossible and then try to imagine it with such conceptions to find out suddenly all the horror all the loathsomeness you must try and understand me to be fully convinced of happiness and all at once continued dolly holding back her sobs to get a letter his letter to his mistress a governess in my employ no too awful she hastily pulled out her handkerchief and hid her face in it i can understand if it were passion she went on after a brief silence but to deceive me deliberately slyly and with whom to go on being my husband while he and she awful you understand 
 oh yes i understand i understand dolly dearest i do understand said anna pressing her hand 
 and do you imagine he realizes all the awfulness of my position dolly resumed not in the slightest happy and contented 
 oh no anna interposed quickly to be pitied weighed down by remorse 
 is he capable of remorse dolly interrupted gazing intently into her face 
 yes i know him i could not look at him without feeling sorry for him we both know him but proud and now so humiliated what touched me most and here anna guessed what would touch dolly most tortured by two things that ashamed for the sake and that loving you yes yes loving you beyond everything on earth she hurriedly interrupted dolly who would have rejoined he has hurt you pierced you to the heart no no she cannot forgive me he keeps on saying 
 dolly looked pensively past her as she listened to her words 
 yes i can see that his position is awful worse for the guilty than the innocent she said if he feels that all the misery comes from his fault but how am i to forgive him how am i to be his wife again after her for me to live with him now would be torture just because i love my past love for him 
 and sobs cut short her words 
 but as though of set design each time she was softened she began to speak again of what exasperated her 
 young you see pretty she went on do you know anna my youth and my beauty are gone taken by whom by him and his children i have worked for him and all i had has gone in his service and now of course any fresh vulgar creature has more charm for him no doubt they talked of me together or worse still they were silent about me do you understand 
 again her eyes glowed with hatred 
 and after that he will tell me what am i to believe him never no everything is over everything that once constituted my comfort the reward of my work and of my sufferings would you believe it i was teaching grisha just now once this was a joy to me now it is a torture what have i to strive and toil for why to have children so awful is that all at once my turned and instead of love and tenderness i have nothing but hatred for him yes hatred i could kill him and 
 darling dolly i understand but torture yourself you are so insulted so excited that you look at many things mistakenly 
 dolly grew calmer and for two minutes both were silent 
 to be done think for me anna help me i have thought over everything and i see nothing 
 anna could not find anything but her heart echoed instantly to each word to each change of expression on her face 
 one thing i would say began anna i am his sister i know his character that faculty of forgetting everything everything she waved her hand before her forehead that faculty for being completely carried away but for completely repenting too he cannot believe it he cannot comprehend now how he could have acted as he did 
 no he understands and understood dolly broke in but i you are forgetting me does that make it easier for me 
 wait a minute when he told me i will own i did not realize all the horror of your position i saw nothing but him and that the family was broken up i felt sorry for him but after talking to you i see it as a woman quite differently i see your agony and i tell you how sorry i am for you but dolly darling while i fully realize your sufferings there is one thing i know i know i know how much love there is still in your heart for him that you know whether there is enough for you to be able to forgive him if there is forgive him 
 no dolly was beginning but anna cut her short kissing her hand once more 
 i know more of the world than you do she said i know how men like stiva look at it you speak of his talking of you with her that never happened such men are unfaithful but their own home and wife are sacred to them somehow or other these women are still looked on with contempt by them and do not touch on their feeling for their family they draw a sort of line that be crossed between them and their families i understand it but it is so 
 yes but he has kissed her 
 dolly hush darling i saw stiva when he was in love with you i remember the time when he came to me and cried talking of you and of what a poetry and loftiness you were for him and i know that the longer he has lived with you the loftier you have been in his eyes you know we have sometimes laughed at him for putting in at every word a marvelous woman have always been a divinity for him and you are that still and this has not been a passion of the heart 
 but if it be repeated 
 it cannot be as i understand it 
 yes but could you forgive it 
 i know i judge no i can judge said anna thinking a moment and grasping the position in her thought and weighing it in her inner balance she added yes i can i can i can yes i could forgive i could not be the same no but i could forgive and forgive as though it had never been never been at all 
 oh of course dolly interposed quickly as though saying what she had more than once thought else it would not be forgiveness if one forgives it must be completely completely come let us go take you to your room she said getting up and on the way she embraced anna my dear how glad i am you came it has made things better ever so much better

 anna could not find anything but her heart echoed instantly to each word to each change of expression on her face 
 one thing i would say began anna i am his sister i know his character that faculty of forgetting everything everything she waved her hand before her forehead that faculty for being completely carried away but for completely repenting too he cannot believe it he cannot comprehend now how he could have acted as he did 
 no he understands and understood dolly broke in but i you are forgetting me does that make it easier for me 
 wait a minute when he told me i will own i did not realize all the horror of your position i saw nothing but him and that the family was broken up i felt sorry for him but after talking to you i see it as a woman quite differently i see your agony and i tell you how sorry i am for you but dolly darling while i fully realize your sufferings there is one thing i know i know i know how much love there is still in your heart for him that you know whether there is enough for you to be able to forgive him if there is forgive him 
 no dolly was beginning but anna cut her short kissing her hand once more 
 i know more of the world than you do she said i know how men like stiva look at it you speak of his talking of you with her that never happened such men are unfaithful but their own home and wife are sacred to them somehow or other these women are still looked on with contempt by them and do not touch on their feeling for their family they draw a sort of line that be crossed between them and their families i understand it but it is so 
 yes but he has kissed her 
 dolly hush darling i saw stiva when he was in love with you i remember the time when he came to me and cried talking of you and of what a poetry and loftiness you were for him and i know that the longer he has lived with you the loftier you have been in his eyes you know we have sometimes laughed at him for putting in at every word a marvelous woman have always been a divinity for him and you are that still and this has not been a passion of the heart 
 but if it be repeated 
 it cannot be as i understand it 
 yes but could you forgive it 
 i know i judge no i can judge said anna thinking a moment and grasping the position in her thought and weighing it in her inner balance she added yes i can i can i can yes i could forgive i could not be the same no but i could forgive and forgive as though it had never been never been at all 
 oh of course dolly interposed quickly as though saying what she had more than once thought else it would not be forgiveness if one forgives it must be completely completely come let us go take you to your room she said getting up and on the way she embraced anna my dear how glad i am you came it has made things better ever so much better

 when anna entered the tiny drawing room she found dolly sitting there with a plump little boy already resembling his father she was listening to a lesson in french reading as the boy read he kept twisting and trying to tear off a button that was nearly off his jacket his mother had several times taken his hand from it but the plump little hand went back to the button again his mother pulled the button off and put it in her pocket 
 keep your hands still grisha she said and she took up her work a coverlet she had long been making she always set to work on it at depressed moments and now she knitted at it nervously twitching her fingers and counting the stitches though she had sent word the day before to her husband that it was nothing to her whether his sister came or not she had made everything ready for her arrival and was expecting her with agitation 
 dolly was crushed by her sorrow utterly swallowed up by it still she did not forget that anna her was the wife of one of the most important personages in peterburg and was a peterburg grande dame and thanks to this circumstance she did not carry out her threat to her husband that is to say she had not forgotten that her was coming and after all anna is in no wise to blame thought dolly i know nothing save the very best about her and i have seen nothing but kindness and affection from her toward myself it was true that as far as she could recall her impressions at peterburg at the she did not like their household itself there was something artificial about the whole arrangement of their family life but why should i not receive her if only she take it into her head to console me thought dolly all consolations and exhortations and christian forgiveness i have thought all this over a thousand times and all no use 
 all these days dolly had been alone with her children she did not want to talk of her sorrow but with that sorrow in her heart she could not talk of outside matters 
 she knew that in one way or another she would tell anna everything and she was alternately glad at the thought of speaking freely and angry at the necessity of speaking of her humiliation with her his sister and of hearing her phrases of exhortation and consolation 
 she had been on the lookout for her glancing at her watch every minute and as often happens let slip that precise minute when her visitor arrived so that she did not hear the bell 
 catching the sound of skirts and of light steps at the door she looked round and her careworn face unconsciously expressed not gladness but wonder she got up and embraced her 
 what here already she said as she kissed her 
 dolly how glad i am to see you 
 i am glad too said dolly faintly smiling and trying by the expression of face to find out whether she knew most likely she knows she thought noticing the sympathy in face well come along take you to your room she went on trying to defer as long as possible the time of explanation 
 is this grisha heavens how grown said anna and kissing him never taking her eyes off dolly she stood still and flushed no please let us stay here 
 she took off her shawl and her hat and catching it in a lock of her black hair which was a mass of curls she tossed her head and shook her hair down 
 you are radiant with health and happiness said dolly almost with envy 
 i yes said anna merciful heavens tania the same age as my seriozha she added addressing the little girl as she ran in she took her in her arms and kissed her delightful child delightful show me them all 
 she mentioned them not only remembering the names but the years months characters illnesses of all the children and dolly could not but appreciate that 
 very well we will go to them she said a pity asleep 
 after seeing the children they sat down alone now in the drawing room to coffee anna took the tray and then pushed it away from her 
 dolly she said he has told me 
 dolly looked coldly at anna she was waiting now for hypocritically sympathetic phrases but anna said nothing of the sort 
 dolly darling she said i want to intercede for him nor to try to comfort you impossible but my dearest simply sorry sorry from my heart for you 
 under the thick lashes of her shining eyes tears suddenly glittered she moved nearer to her and took her hand in her own vigorous and little dolly did not shrink away but her face did not lose its frigid expression she said 
 to comfort me is impossible lost after what has happened over 
 and directly she had said this her face suddenly softened anna lifted the wasted thin hand of dolly kissed it and said 
 but dolly to be done to be done how is it best to act in this awful position what you must think of 
 over and nothing more said dolly and the worst of it all is you see that i cast him off there are the children my hands are tied and i live with him a torture for me to see him 
 dolly darling he has spoken to me but i want to hear it from you tell me all about it 
 dolly looked at her inquiringly 
 sympathy and love unfeigned were apparent on face 
 very well she suddenly said but i will begin at the beginning you know how i was married with the education maman gave us i was more than innocent i was foolish i knew nothing they say i know men tell their wives of their former lives but stiva she corrected herself stepan arkadyevich told me nothing hardly believe it but till now i imagined that i was the only woman he had known so i lived eight years you must understand that i was not only far from suspecting infidelity but i regarded it as impossible and then try to imagine it with such conceptions to find out suddenly all the horror all the loathsomeness you must try and understand me to be fully convinced of happiness and all at once continued dolly holding back her sobs to get a letter his letter to his mistress a governess in my employ no too awful she hastily pulled out her handkerchief and hid her face in it i can understand if it were passion she went on after a brief silence but to deceive me deliberately slyly and with whom to go on being my husband while he and she awful you understand 
 oh yes i understand i understand dolly dearest i do understand said anna pressing her hand 
 and do you imagine he realizes all the awfulness of my position dolly resumed not in the slightest happy and contented 
 oh no anna interposed quickly to be pitied weighed down by remorse 
 is he capable of remorse dolly interrupted gazing intently into her face 
 yes i know him i could not look at him without feeling sorry for him we both know him but proud and now so humiliated what touched me most and here anna guessed what would touch dolly most tortured by two things that ashamed for the sake and that loving you yes yes loving you beyond everything on earth she hurriedly interrupted dolly who would have rejoined he has hurt you pierced you to the heart no no she cannot forgive me he keeps on saying 
 dolly looked pensively past her as she listened to her words 
 yes i can see that his position is awful worse for the guilty than the innocent she said if he feels that all the misery comes from his fault but how am i to forgive him how am i to be his wife again after her for me to live with him now would be torture just because i love my past love for him 
 and sobs cut short her words 
 but as though of set design each time she was softened she began to speak again of what exasperated her 
 young you see pretty she went on do you know anna my youth and my beauty are gone taken by whom by him and his children i have worked for him and all i had has gone in his service and now of course any fresh vulgar creature has more charm for him no doubt they talked of me together or worse still they were silent about me do you understand 
 again her eyes glowed with hatred 
 and after that he will tell me what am i to believe him never no everything is over everything that once constituted my comfort the reward of my work and of my sufferings would you believe it i was teaching grisha just now once this was a joy to me now it is a torture what have i to strive and toil for why to have children so awful is that all at once my turned and instead of love and tenderness i have nothing but hatred for him yes hatred i could kill him and 
 darling dolly i understand but torture yourself you are so insulted so excited that you look at many things mistakenly 
 dolly grew calmer and for two minutes both were silent 
 to be done think for me anna help me i have thought over everything and i see nothing 
 anna could not find anything but her heart echoed instantly to each word to each change of expression on her face 
 one thing i would say began anna i am his sister i know his character that faculty of forgetting everything everything she waved her hand before her forehead that faculty for being completely carried away but for completely repenting too he cannot believe it he cannot comprehend now how he could have acted as he did

 the whole of that day anna spent at home that is at the and received no one though some of her acquaintances had already heard of her arrival and came to call the same day anna spent the whole morning with dolly and the children she merely sent a brief note to her brother to tell him that he must not fail to dine at home come god is merciful she wrote 
 oblonsky did dine at home the conversation was general and his wife speaking to him addressed him as stiva as she had not done for some time past in the relations of husband and wife the same estrangement still remained but there was no talk of separation and stepan arkadyevich saw the possibility of explanation and reconciliation 
 immediately after dinner kitty came in she knew anna arkadyevna but only very slightly and she came now to her with some trepidation at the prospect of meeting this fashionable peterburg lady of whom everyone spoke so highly but she made a favorable impression on anna arkadyevna she perceived that at once anna was unmistakably admiring her loveliness and her youth before kitty knew where she was she found herself not merely under sway but in love with her as young girls do fall in love with older and married women anna did not resemble a fashionable lady or the mother of a boy eight years old in the elasticity of her movements the freshness and the animation which persisted in her face and broke out in her smile and her glance she would rather have passed for a girl of twenty had it not been for a serious and at times a mournful look in her eyes which struck and attracted kitty kitty felt that anna was perfectly simple and was concealing nothing but that she had another higher world of interests complex and poetic which were inaccessible to kitty 
 after dinner when dolly withdrew to her own room anna rose quickly and went up to her brother who was just lighting a cigar 
 stiva she said to him winking gaily making the sign of the cross over him and glancing toward the door go and god help you 
 he tossed away his cigar having understood her and departed through the doorway 
 when stepan arkadyevich had disappeared she went back to the sofa where she had been sitting surrounded by the children either because the children saw that their mother was fond of this aunt or that they themselves sensed a special charm in her the two elder ones and the younger following their lead as children so often do had clung about their new aunt since before dinner and would not leave her side and it had become a sort of game among them to sit as close as possible to their aunt to touch her hold her little hand kiss it play with her ring or even touch the flounce of her skirt 
 come come as we were sitting before said anna arkadyevna sitting down in her place 
 and again grisha poked his little face under her arm and nestled with his head on her gown beaming with pride and happiness 
 and when is your next ball she asked kitty 
 next week and a splendid ball one of those balls where one always enjoys oneself 
 why are there balls where one always enjoys oneself anna said with tender irony 
 strange but there are at the one always enjoys oneself and at the too while at the always dull you noticed it 
 no my dear for me there are no balls now where one enjoys oneself said anna and kitty detected in her eyes that peculiar world which was not revealed to her for me there are some which are less dull and tiresome than others 
 how can you be dull at a ball 
 why should not i be dull at a ball inquired anna 
 kitty perceived that anna knew what answer would follow 
 because you always look the loveliest of all 
 anna had the faculty of blushing she blushed and said 
 in the first place never so and secondly if it were what difference would it make to me

 i imagine it be possible to avoid going here take it she said to tania who was pulling the loosely fitting ring off her white finger 
 i shall be so glad if you go i should so like to see you at a ball

 how do you know yes 
 oh what a happy time you are at pursued anna i remember and i know this blue haze like the mist on the mountains in switzerland this mist which covers everything in that blissful time when childhood is just ending and out of that vast circle happy and gay there is a path growing narrower and narrower and it is delightful and alarming to enter the ballroom bright and splendid as it is who has not been through it 
 kitty smiled without speaking but how did she go through it how i should like to know all her love story thought kitty recalling the unromantic appearance of alexei alexandrovich her husband 
 i know something stiva told me and i congratulate you i liked him so much anna continued i met vronsky at the railway station

 and again grisha poked his little face under her arm and nestled with his head on her gown beaming with pride and happiness 
 and when is your next ball she asked kitty 
 next week and a splendid ball one of those balls where one always enjoys oneself 
 why are there balls where one always enjoys oneself anna said with tender irony 
 strange but there are at the one always enjoys oneself and at the too while at the always dull you noticed it 
 no my dear for me there are no balls now where one enjoys oneself said anna and kitty detected in her eyes that peculiar world which was not revealed to her for me there are some which are less dull and tiresome than others 
 how can you be dull at a ball 
 why should not i be dull at a ball inquired anna 
 kitty perceived that anna knew what answer would follow 
 because you always look the loveliest of all 
 anna had the faculty of blushing she blushed and said 
 in the first place never so and secondly if it were what difference would it make to me 
 are you coming to this ball asked kitty 
 i imagine it be possible to avoid going here take it she said to tania who was pulling the loosely fitting ring off her white finger 
 i shall be so glad if you go i should so like to see you at a ball 
 anyway if i do go i shall comfort myself with the thought that a pleasure to you grisha pull my hair untidy enough without that she said putting up a straying lock which grisha had been playing with 
 i imagine you at the ball in lilac 
 and why in lilac precisely asked anna smiling now children run along run along do you hear miss hoole is calling you to tea she said tearing the children from her and sending them off to the dining room 
 i know why you press me to come to the ball you expect a great deal of this ball and you want everyone to be there and take part in it 
 how do you know yes 
 oh what a happy time you are at pursued anna i remember and i know this blue haze like the mist on the mountains in switzerland this mist which covers everything in that blissful time when childhood is just ending and out of that vast circle happy and gay there is a path growing narrower and narrower and it is delightful and alarming to enter the ballroom bright and splendid as it is who has not been through it 
 kitty smiled without speaking but how did she go through it how i should like to know all her love story thought kitty recalling the unromantic appearance of alexei alexandrovich her husband 
 i know something stiva told me and i congratulate you i liked him so much anna continued i met vronsky at the railway station 
 oh was he there asked kitty blushing what was it stiva told you 
 stiva blabbed about it all and i should be so glad i traveled yesterday with mother she went on and his mother talked without a pause of him her favorite i know mothers are partial but 
 what did his mother tell you 
 oh a great deal and although i know that her favorite one can still see how chivalrous he is well for instance she told me that he had wanted to give up all his property to his brother that he had done something extraordinary when he was quite a child saved a woman from the water a hero in fact said anna smiling and recollecting the two hundred roubles he had given at the station 
 but she did not tell kitty about the two hundred roubles for some reason it was disagreeable to her to think of it she felt that there was something that had to do with her in it and something that ought not to have been 
 she pressed me very much to go and see her anna went on and i shall be glad to go to see her tomorrow stiva is staying a long while in room thank god anna added changing the subject and getting up kitty fancied displeased with something 
 no first no i screamed the children who had finished tea running up to their aunt anna 
 all together said anna and she ran laughing to meet them and embracing them threw all the children shrieking with delight into a swarming heap

 dolly came out of her room to the tea of the grownups stepan arkadyevich did not come out he must have left his room by a back door 
 i am afraid be cold upstairs observed dolly addressing anna i want to move you downstairs and we shall be nearer 
 oh please trouble about me answered anna looking intently into face trying to make out whether there had been a reconciliation or not 
 it will be lighter for you here answered her 
 i assure you that i can sleep like a marmot anywhere and any time 
 all this inquired stepan arkadyevich coming out of his room and addressing his wife 
 from his tone both kitty and anna at once gathered that a reconciliation had taken place 
 i want to move anna downstairs but we must hang up blinds no one knows how to do it i must see to it myself answered dolly addressing him 
 god knows whether they are fully reconciled thought anna hearing her tone cold and composed 
 come dolly why be always making difficulties answered her husband there do it all if you like 
 i know how you do everything answered dolly you tell matvei to do what be done and go away yourself leaving him to make a muddle of everything and her habitual mocking smile curved the corners of lips as she spoke 
 full full reconciliation full thought anna thank god and rejoicing that she was the cause of it she went up to dolly and kissed her 
 not at all why do you always look down on me and matvei said stepan arkadyevich smiling hardly perceptibly and addressing his wife 
 the whole evening dolly was as always a little mocking in her tone to her husband while stepan arkadyevich was happy and cheerful yet not so as to seem as if having been forgiven he had forgotten his fault 
 at nine a particularly joyful and pleasant family conversation over the tea table at the was broken up by an apparently simple incident but this simple incident for some reason struck everyone as strange having begun talking about common acquaintances in peterburg anna got up quickly 
 she is in my album she said and by the way show you my seriozha she added with a smile of pride 
 toward ten when she usually said good night to her son and often before going to a ball put him to bed herself she felt depressed at being so far from him and whatever she was talking about she kept coming back in thought to her seriozha she longed to look at his photograph and talk of him seizing the first pretext she got up and with her light resolute step went for her album the stairs up to her room came out on the landing of the great warm main staircase 
 just as she was leaving the drawing room a ring was heard in the hall 
 who can that be said dolly 
 too early for me to be fetched and for anyone else too late observed kitty 
 sure to be someone with papers for me put in stepan arkadyevich when anna was passing the top of the staircase a servant was running up to announce the visitor while the visitor himself was standing under a lamp anna glancing down at once recognized vronsky and a strange feeling of pleasure and at the same time of some dread stirred in her heart he stood there without taking off his coat and pulling something out of his pocket at the instant when she was just halfway up the stairs he raised his eyes caught sight of her and the expression of his face changed to embarrassment and dismay with a slight inclination of her head she passed hearing behind her stepan loud voice calling him to come up and the quiet soft and calm voice of vronsky refusing 
 when anna returned with the album he was already gone and stepan arkadyevich was telling them that he had called to inquire about the dinner they were giving next day to a foreign celebrity 
 and nothing would induce him to come up what a queer fellow he is added stepan arkadyevich 
 kitty blushed she thought that she was the only person who knew why he had come and why he would not come up he has been at home she thought and find me and thought i should be here but he did not come up because he thought it late and here 
 all of them looked at each other saying nothing and began to look at album 
 there was nothing either exceptional or strange in a calling at nine on a friend to inquire details of a proposed dinner party and not coming in yet it seemed strange to all of them and to anna it seemed stranger and more unpleasant than to any of the others

 the ball was only just beginning as kitty and her mother walked up the great staircase flooded with light and lined with flowers and footmen in powder and red coats from the rooms came a constant steady noise like that of a hive aswarm and as they were giving the final little touches to hair and dresses before a mirror on the landing between potted trees they heard coming from the ballroom the gently distinct notes of the fiddles of the orchestra beginning the first waltz a little ancient in civilian dress arranging his gray curls before another mirror and diffusing an odor of scent stumbled against them on the stairs and stood aside evidently admiring kitty whom he did not know a beardless youth one of those society youths whom the old prince shcherbatsky called whelps in an exceedingly open waistcoat straightening his white tie as he went bowed to them and after running by came back to ask kitty for a quadrille as the first quadrille had already been given to vronsky she had to promise this youth the second an officer buttoning his glove stood aside in the doorway and stroking his mustache admired the rosy kitty 
 although her dress her coiffure and all the preparations for the ball had cost kitty much trouble and planning at this moment she walked into the ballroom in the elaborate tulle dress over a pink slip as unconcernedly and simply as though all the rosettes and lace all the minute details of her attire had not cost her or her family a attention as though she had been born in this tulle and lace with this towering coiffure surmounted by a rose and two small leaves 
 when just before entering the ballroom the old princess tried to adjust a sash ribbon that had become twisted kitty had drawn back a little she felt that everything must be right of itself and graceful and that nothing could need setting straight 
 
 kitty had one of her good days her dress was not uncomfortable anywhere her lace bertha did not droop anywhere her rosettes were neither crushed nor torn off her pink slippers with high curving heels did not pinch but gladdened her tiny feet and the thick bandeaux of fair hair kept up on her head all the three buttons buttoned up without tearing on the long glove that covered her hand without concealing its lines the black velvet ribbon of her locket nestled with special tenderness round her neck this velvet ribbon was a darling at home regarding her neck in the looking glass kitty had felt that that velvet was speaking about all the rest there might be a doubt but the velvet ribbon was a darling kitty smiled here too at the ball when she glanced at it in the glass her bare shoulders and arms gave kitty a sensation of chill marble a sensation she particularly liked her eyes sparkled and her rosy lips could not help but smile from the consciousness of their own attractiveness she had scarcely entered the ballroom and reached the throng of ladies waiting to be asked to dance kitty was never one of that throng when she was asked for a waltz and asked by the best partner the first star in the hierarchy of the ballroom a renowned conductor of the dances and master of ceremonies married man handsome and well built iegorushka korsunsky he had only just left the countess banina with whom he had danced the first turn of the waltz and scanning his demesne that is to say a few couples who had started dancing he caught sight of kitty entering and flew up to her with that peculiar easy amble which is confined to conductors of the dances bowing and without even asking her if she cared to dance he put out his arm to encircle her slender waist she looked round for someone to give her fan to and their hostess smiling to her took it 
 how good of you to come in good time he said to her embracing her waist such a bad habit to be late 
 bending her left arm she laid it on his shoulder and her little feet in their pink slippers began swiftly lightly and rhythmically moving over the slippery floor in time to the music 
 a rest to waltz with you he said to her as they fell into the first slow steps of the waltz charming such lightness precision he said to her the same thing he said to almost all his partners whom he knew well 
 she smiled at his praise and continued to look about the room over his shoulder she was not like a girl at her first ball for whom all faces in the ballroom melt into one vision of fairyland and she was not a girl who had gone the stale round of balls till every face in the ballroom was familiar and tiresome but she was in the middle stage between these two she was excited and at the same time she had sufficient to be able to observe in the left corner of the ballroom she saw the very flower of society grouped together there impossibly naked was the beauty liddy wife there was the lady of the house there shone the bald pate of krivin always to be found wherever the best people were in that direction gazed the young men not venturing to approach there too she descried stiva and there she saw the charming figure and head of anna in a black velvet gown and he was there kitty had not seen him since the evening she refused levin with her farsighted eyes knew him at once and was even aware that he was looking at her 
 another turn eh not tired said korsunsky a little out of breath 
 no thank you 
 where shall i take you 
 madame here i think take me to her 
 wherever you command 
 and korsunsky began waltzing with measured steps straight toward the group in the left corner continually saying pardon mesdames pardon pardon mesdames and steering his course through the sea of lace tulle and ribbon and not disarranging a feather he turned his partner sharply round so that her slim ankles in light transparent stockings were exposed to view and her train floated out in fan shape and covered knees korsunsky bowed set straight his open shirt front and gave her his arm to conduct her to anna arkadyevna kitty flushed took her train from knees and a little giddy looked round seeking anna anna was not in lilac as kitty had so urgently wished but in a black velvet gown showing her full shoulders and bosom that looked as though carved in old ivory and her rounded arms with tiny slender hands the whole gown was trimmed with venetian guipure on her head among her black hair her own with no false additions was a little wreath of pansies and a similar one on the black ribbon of her sash among white lace her coiffure was not striking all that was noticeable was the little willful tendrils of her curly hair that persisted in escaping on the nape of her neck and on her temples encircling her sculptured strong neck was a thread of pearls 
 kitty had been seeing anna every day she adored her and had pictured her invariably in lilac but now seeing her in black she felt that she had not fully perceived her charm she saw her now as someone quite new and surprising to her now she understood that anna could not have been in lilac and that her charm was precisely in that she always stood out against her attire that her dress could never be noticeable on her and her black dress with its sumptuous lace was not noticeable on her it was only the frame and all that was seen was she simple natural elegant and at the same time gay and animated 
 she was standing as always very erect and when kitty drew near the group she was speaking to the master of the house her head slightly turned toward him 
 no i cast a stone she was saying in answer to something though i understand it she went on shrugging her shoulders and she turned at once with a soft smile of protection toward kitty with a cursory feminine glance she scanned her attire and made a movement of her head hardly perceptible but understood by kitty signifying approval of her dress and her looks you came into the room dancing she added 
 this is one of my most faithful supporters said korsunsky bowing to anna arkadyevna whom he had not yet seen the princess helps to make any ball festive and successful anna arkadyevna a waltz he said bending down to her 
 why have you met inquired their host 
 is there anyone we have not met my wife and i are like white wolves everyone knows us answered korsunsky a waltz anna arkadyevna 
 i dance whenever possible not to she said 
 but tonight impossible answered korsunsky 
 during the conversation vronsky was approaching them 
 well since impossible tonight let us start she said not noticing bow and hastily put her hand on shoulder 
 what is she vexed with him about thought kitty discerning that anna had intentionally not responded to bow vronsky went up to kitty reminding her of the first quadrille and expressing his regret at not having seen her all this time kitty gazed in admiration at anna waltzing as she listened to him she expected him to ask her for a waltz but he did not and she glanced wonderingly at him he flushed and hurriedly asked her to waltz but he had barely put his arm round her slender waist and taken the first step when the music suddenly stopped kitty looked into his face which was so close to her own and long afterward for several years this look full of love to which he made no response cut her to the heart with an agony of shame 
 pardon pardon waltz waltz shouted korsunsky from the other side of the room and seizing the first young lady he came across he began dancing

 and korsunsky began waltzing with measured steps straight toward the group in the left corner continually saying pardon mesdames pardon pardon mesdames and steering his course through the sea of lace tulle and ribbon and not disarranging a feather he turned his partner sharply round so that her slim ankles in light transparent stockings were exposed to view and her train floated out in fan shape and covered knees korsunsky bowed set straight his open shirt front and gave her his arm to conduct her to anna arkadyevna kitty flushed took her train from knees and a little giddy looked round seeking anna anna was not in lilac as kitty had so urgently wished but in a black velvet gown showing her full shoulders and bosom that looked as though carved in old ivory and her rounded arms with tiny slender hands the whole gown was trimmed with venetian guipure on her head among her black hair her own with no false additions was a little wreath of pansies and a similar one on the black ribbon of her sash among white lace her coiffure was not striking all that was noticeable was the little willful tendrils of her curly hair that persisted in escaping on the nape of her neck and on her temples encircling her sculptured strong neck was a thread of pearls 
 kitty had been seeing anna every day she adored her and had pictured her invariably in lilac but now seeing her in black she felt that she had not fully perceived her charm she saw her now as someone quite new and surprising to her now she understood that anna could not have been in lilac and that her charm was precisely in that she always stood out against her attire that her dress could never be noticeable on her and her black dress with its sumptuous lace was not noticeable on her it was only the frame and all that was seen was she simple natural elegant and at the same time gay and animated 
 she was standing as always very erect and when kitty drew near the group she was speaking to the master of the house her head slightly turned toward him 
 no i cast a stone she was saying in answer to something though i understand it she went on shrugging her shoulders and she turned at once with a soft smile of protection toward kitty with a cursory feminine glance she scanned her attire and made a movement of her head hardly perceptible but understood by kitty signifying approval of her dress and her looks you came into the room dancing she added 
 this is one of my most faithful supporters said korsunsky bowing to anna arkadyevna whom he had not yet seen the princess helps to make any ball festive and successful anna arkadyevna a waltz he said bending down to her

 during the conversation vronsky was approaching them 
 well since impossible tonight let us start she said not noticing bow and hastily put her hand on shoulder 
 what is she vexed with him about thought kitty discerning that anna had intentionally not responded to bow vronsky went up to kitty reminding her of the first quadrille and expressing his regret at not having seen her all this time kitty gazed in admiration at anna waltzing as she listened to him she expected him to ask her for a waltz but he did not and she glanced wonderingly at him he flushed and hurriedly asked her to waltz but he had barely put his arm round her slender waist and taken the first step when the music suddenly stopped kitty looked into his face which was so close to her own and long afterward for several years this look full of love to which he made no response cut her to the heart with an agony of shame

 the ball was only just beginning as kitty and her mother walked up the great staircase flooded with light and lined with flowers and footmen in powder and red coats from the rooms came a constant steady noise like that of a hive aswarm and as they were giving the final little touches to hair and dresses before a mirror on the landing between potted trees they heard coming from the ballroom the gently distinct notes of the fiddles of the orchestra beginning the first waltz a little ancient in civilian dress arranging his gray curls before another mirror and diffusing an odor of scent stumbled against them on the stairs and stood aside evidently admiring kitty whom he did not know a beardless youth one of those society youths whom the old prince shcherbatsky called whelps in an exceedingly open waistcoat straightening his white tie as he went bowed to them and after running by came back to ask kitty for a quadrille as the first quadrille had already been given to vronsky she had to promise this youth the second an officer buttoning his glove stood aside in the doorway and stroking his mustache admired the rosy kitty 
 although her dress her coiffure and all the preparations for the ball had cost kitty much trouble and planning at this moment she walked into the ballroom in the elaborate tulle dress over a pink slip as unconcernedly and simply as though all the rosettes and lace all the minute details of her attire had not cost her or her family a attention as though she had been born in this tulle and lace with this towering coiffure surmounted by a rose and two small leaves 
 when just before entering the ballroom the old princess tried to adjust a sash ribbon that had become twisted kitty had drawn back a little she felt that everything must be right of itself and graceful and that nothing could need setting straight 
 
 kitty had one of her good days her dress was not uncomfortable anywhere her lace bertha did not droop anywhere her rosettes were neither crushed nor torn off her pink slippers with high curving heels did not pinch but gladdened her tiny feet and the thick bandeaux of fair hair kept up on her head all the three buttons buttoned up without tearing on the long glove that covered her hand without concealing its lines the black velvet ribbon of her locket nestled with special tenderness round her neck this velvet ribbon was a darling at home regarding her neck in the looking glass kitty had felt that that velvet was speaking about all the rest there might be a doubt but the velvet ribbon was a darling kitty smiled here too at the ball when she glanced at it in the glass her bare shoulders and arms gave kitty a sensation of chill marble a sensation she particularly liked her eyes sparkled and her rosy lips could not help but smile from the consciousness of their own attractiveness she had scarcely entered the ballroom and reached the throng of ladies waiting to be asked to dance kitty was never one of that throng when she was asked for a waltz and asked by the best partner the first star in the hierarchy of the ballroom a renowned conductor of the dances and master of ceremonies married man handsome and well built iegorushka korsunsky he had only just left the countess banina with whom he had danced the first turn of the waltz and scanning his demesne that is to say a few couples who had started dancing he caught sight of kitty entering and flew up to her with that peculiar easy amble which is confined to conductors of the dances bowing and without even asking her if she cared to dance he put out his arm to encircle her slender waist she looked round for someone to give her fan to and their hostess smiling to her took it 
 how good of you to come in good time he said to her embracing her waist such a bad habit to be late 
 bending her left arm she laid it on his shoulder and her little feet in their pink slippers began swiftly lightly and rhythmically moving over the slippery floor in time to the music 
 a rest to waltz with you he said to her as they fell into the first slow steps of the waltz charming such lightness precision he said to her the same thing he said to almost all his partners whom he knew well 
 she smiled at his praise and continued to look about the room over his shoulder she was not like a girl at her first ball for whom all faces in the ballroom melt into one vision of fairyland and she was not a girl who had gone the stale round of balls till every face in the ballroom was familiar and tiresome but she was in the middle stage between these two she was excited and at the same time she had sufficient to be able to observe in the left corner of the ballroom she saw the very flower of society grouped together there impossibly naked was the beauty liddy wife there was the lady of the house there shone the bald pate of krivin always to be found wherever the best people were in that direction gazed the young men not venturing to approach there too she descried stiva and there she saw the charming figure and head of anna in a black velvet gown and he was there kitty had not seen him since the evening she refused levin with her farsighted eyes knew him at once and was even aware that he was looking at her

 vronsky and kitty waltzed several times round the room after the waltz kitty went to her mother and she had hardly time to say a few words to countess nordstone when vronsky came up again for the first quadrille during the quadrille nothing of any significance was said there was disjointed talk between them of the korsunskys husband and wife whom he described very amusingly as delightful children at forty and of the future popular theater and only once did the conversation touch her to the quick when he asked her whether levin were here and added that he liked him very much but kitty did not expect much from the quadrille she looked forward with a sinking heart to the mazurka she fancied that the mazurka would decide everything the fact that he did not during the quadrille ask her for the mazurka did not trouble her she felt sure she would dance it with him as she had done at former balls and refused five young men saying she was engaged for the mazurka the whole ball up to the last quadrille was for kitty an enchanted vision of delightful colors sounds and motions she only sat down when she felt too tired and begged for a rest but as she was dancing the last quadrille with one of the tiresome young men whom she could not refuse she chanced to be with vronsky and anna she had not been near anna since the beginning of the evening and now she again suddenly saw her as quite new and surprising she saw in her the signs of that excitement of success she knew so well in herself she saw that she was intoxicated with the delighted admiration she was exciting she knew that feeling and knew its signs and saw them in anna saw the quivering flashing light in her eyes and the smile of happiness and excitement unconsciously curving her lips and the distinct grace precision and lightness of her movements 
 who is it she asked herself all or one and without keeping up her end of the conversation the thread of which the harassed young man she was dancing with lost and could not pick up again she obeyed with external liveliness the peremptory shouts of korsunsky starting them all into the grand rond and then into the chaine and at the same time she kept watch with a growing pang at her heart no not admiration of the crowd that has intoxicated her but the adoration of one and that one can it be he every time he spoke to anna the joyous light flashed into her eyes and the smile of happiness curved her red lips she seemed to make an effort to control herself in order not to show these signs of delight but they appeared on her face of themselves but what of him kitty looked at him and was horrified what was pictured so clearly to kitty in the mirror of face she saw in him what had become of his always calm firm manner and the carelessly calm expression of his face now every time he turned to her he bent his head as though he would have fallen at her feet and in his eyes there was nothing but humble submission and dread i would not offend you his eyes seemed to be saying each time but i want to save myself and i know how on his face was a look such as kitty had never seen before 
 they were speaking of common acquaintances keeping up the smallest of small talk but to kitty it seemed that every word they said was determining their fate and hers and strangely enough although they were actually talking of how absurd ivan ivanovich was with his french and how the eletsky girl might have made a better match these words were yet fraught with significance for them and they sensed this as much as kitty did the whole ball the whole world everything seemed screened by a fog within soul nothing but the stern discipline of her supported her and forced her to do what was expected of her that is to dance to answer questions to talk even to smile but before the mazurka when they were beginning to rearrange the chairs and a few couples moved out of the smaller rooms into the big room a moment of despair and horror came for kitty she had refused five partners and now she was not dancing the mazurka she had not even a hope of being asked for it because she was so successful in society that the idea would never occur to anyone that she had remained disengaged till now she would have to tell her mother she felt ill and go home yet she had not the strength to do this she felt crushed 
 she went to the farthest end of the second drawing room and sank into a low chair her light transparent skirts rose like a cloud about her slender waist one bare thin soft girlish arm hanging listlessly was lost in the folds of her pink tunic in the other she held her fan and with rapid short strokes fanned her burning face yet while she looked like a butterfly clinging to a blade of grass and just about to open its rainbow wings for fresh flight her heart ached with a horrible despair 
 but perhaps i am wrong perhaps it was not so and again she recalled all she had seen 
 kitty what is it said countess nordstone stepping noiselessly over the carpet toward her i understand it 
 lower lip began to quiver she got up quickly 
 kitty not dancing the mazurka 
 no no said kitty in a voice shaking with tears 
 he asked her for the mazurka in my presence said countess nordstone knowing kitty would understand who he and her were she said why you going to dance it with princess shcherbatskaia 
 oh it matter to me answered kitty 
 no one but she herself understood her position no one knew that she had refused yesterday the man whom perhaps she loved and refused him because she had put her faith in another 
 countess nordstone found korsunsky with whom she was to dance the mazurka and told him to ask kitty 
 kitty danced in the first couple and luckily for her she had not to talk because korsunsky was all the time running about overseeing his demesne vronsky and anna were sitting almost opposite her she saw them with her farsighted eyes and saw them too close by when they met in the figures and the more she saw of them the more convinced was she that her unhappiness was consummated she saw that they felt themselves alone in this crowded room and on face always so firm and independent she saw the look that had struck her of bewilderment and humble submissiveness like the expression of an intelligent dog when it has done wrong 
 anna smiled and her smile was reflected by him she grew thoughtful and he became serious some supernatural force drew eyes to face she was charming in her simple black dress charming were her round arms with their bracelets charming was her firm neck with its thread of pearls charming the straying curls of her loose hair charming the graceful light movements of her little feet and hands charming was that lovely face in its animation yet there was something terrible and cruel in her charm 
 kitty admired her more than ever and more and more acute did her suffering grow kitty felt crushed and her face showed it when vronsky caught sight of her coming upon her in the mazurka he did not at once recognize her so changed was she 
 delightful ball he said to her merely for the sake of saying something 
 yes she answered 
 in the middle of the mazurka repeating a complicated figure newly invented by korsunsky anna came forward into the center of the circle chose two gentlemen and summoned kitty and another lady kitty gazed at her in dismay as she went up anna looked at her with drooping eyelids and smiled pressing her hand but noticing that kitty only responded to her smile by a look of despair and amazement she turned away from her and began gaily talking to the other lady 
 yes there is something uncanny devilish and charming about her said kitty to herself 
 anna did not want to stay for supper but the master of the house began urging her 
 nonsense anna arkadyevna said korsunsky placing her bare hand upon his coat sleeve such an idea for a cotillon un bijou 
 and he moved gradually on trying to draw her along with him their host smiled approvingly 
 no not going to stay answered anna smiling but in spite of her smile both korsunsky and the master of the house saw from her resolute tone that she would not stay 
 no why as it is i have danced more at your ball in moscow than i have all the winter in peterburg said anna looking round at vronsky who stood near her i must rest a little before my journey 
 are you definitely going tomorrow then asked vronsky 
 yes i suppose so answered anna as though wondering at the boldness of his question but the irrepressible quivering brilliance of her eyes and her smile set him on fire as she said it 
 anna arkadyevna did not stay to supper but went home

 vronsky and kitty waltzed several times round the room after the waltz kitty went to her mother and she had hardly time to say a few words to countess nordstone when vronsky came up again for the first quadrille during the quadrille nothing of any significance was said there was disjointed talk between them of the korsunskys husband and wife whom he described very amusingly as delightful children at forty and of the future popular theater and only once did the conversation touch her to the quick when he asked her whether levin were here and added that he liked him very much but kitty did not expect much from the quadrille she looked forward with a sinking heart to the mazurka she fancied that the mazurka would decide everything the fact that he did not during the quadrille ask her for the mazurka did not trouble her she felt sure she would dance it with him as she had done at former balls and refused five young men saying she was engaged for the mazurka the whole ball up to the last quadrille was for kitty an enchanted vision of delightful colors sounds and motions she only sat down when she felt too tired and begged for a rest but as she was dancing the last quadrille with one of the tiresome young men whom she could not refuse she chanced to be with vronsky and anna she had not been near anna since the beginning of the evening and now she again suddenly saw her as quite new and surprising she saw in her the signs of that excitement of success she knew so well in herself she saw that she was intoxicated with the delighted admiration she was exciting she knew that feeling and knew its signs and saw them in anna saw the quivering flashing light in her eyes and the smile of happiness and excitement unconsciously curving her lips and the distinct grace precision and lightness of her movements 
 who is it she asked herself all or one and without keeping up her end of the conversation the thread of which the harassed young man she was dancing with lost and could not pick up again she obeyed with external liveliness the peremptory shouts of korsunsky starting them all into the grand rond and then into the chaine and at the same time she kept watch with a growing pang at her heart no not admiration of the crowd that has intoxicated her but the adoration of one and that one can it be he every time he spoke to anna the joyous light flashed into her eyes and the smile of happiness curved her red lips she seemed to make an effort to control herself in order not to show these signs of delight but they appeared on her face of themselves but what of him kitty looked at him and was horrified what was pictured so clearly to kitty in the mirror of face she saw in him what had become of his always calm firm manner and the carelessly calm expression of his face now every time he turned to her he bent his head as though he would have fallen at her feet and in his eyes there was nothing but humble submission and dread i would not offend you his eyes seemed to be saying each time but i want to save myself and i know how on his face was a look such as kitty had never seen before 
 they were speaking of common acquaintances keeping up the smallest of small talk but to kitty it seemed that every word they said was determining their fate and hers and strangely enough although they were actually talking of how absurd ivan ivanovich was with his french and how the eletsky girl might have made a better match these words were yet fraught with significance for them and they sensed this as much as kitty did the whole ball the whole world everything seemed screened by a fog within soul nothing but the stern discipline of her supported her and forced her to do what was expected of her that is to dance to answer questions to talk even to smile but before the mazurka when they were beginning to rearrange the chairs and a few couples moved out of the smaller rooms into the big room a moment of despair and horror came for kitty she had refused five partners and now she was not dancing the mazurka she had not even a hope of being asked for it because she was so successful in society that the idea would never occur to anyone that she had remained disengaged till now she would have to tell her mother she felt ill and go home yet she had not the strength to do this she felt crushed 
 she went to the farthest end of the second drawing room and sank into a low chair her light transparent skirts rose like a cloud about her slender waist one bare thin soft girlish arm hanging listlessly was lost in the folds of her pink tunic in the other she held her fan and with rapid short strokes fanned her burning face yet while she looked like a butterfly clinging to a blade of grass and just about to open its rainbow wings for fresh flight her heart ached with a horrible despair 
 but perhaps i am wrong perhaps it was not so and again she recalled all she had seen 
 kitty what is it said countess nordstone stepping noiselessly over the carpet toward her i understand it 
 lower lip began to quiver she got up quickly 
 kitty not dancing the mazurka 
 no no said kitty in a voice shaking with tears 
 he asked her for the mazurka in my presence said countess nordstone knowing kitty would understand who he and her were she said why you going to dance it with princess shcherbatskaia 
 oh it matter to me answered kitty 
 no one but she herself understood her position no one knew that she had refused yesterday the man whom perhaps she loved and refused him because she had put her faith in another 
 countess nordstone found korsunsky with whom she was to dance the mazurka and told him to ask kitty 
 kitty danced in the first couple and luckily for her she had not to talk because korsunsky was all the time running about overseeing his demesne vronsky and anna were sitting almost opposite her she saw them with her farsighted eyes and saw them too close by when they met in the figures and the more she saw of them the more convinced was she that her unhappiness was consummated she saw that they felt themselves alone in this crowded room and on face always so firm and independent she saw the look that had struck her of bewilderment and humble submissiveness like the expression of an intelligent dog when it has done wrong 
 anna smiled and her smile was reflected by him she grew thoughtful and he became serious some supernatural force drew eyes to face she was charming in her simple black dress charming were her round arms with their bracelets charming was her firm neck with its thread of pearls charming the straying curls of her loose hair charming the graceful light movements of her little feet and hands charming was that lovely face in its animation yet there was something terrible and cruel in her charm 
 kitty admired her more than ever and more and more acute did her suffering grow kitty felt crushed and her face showed it when vronsky caught sight of her coming upon her in the mazurka he did not at once recognize her so changed was she 
 delightful ball he said to her merely for the sake of saying something 
 yes she answered 
 in the middle of the mazurka repeating a complicated figure newly invented by korsunsky anna came forward into the center of the circle chose two gentlemen and summoned kitty and another lady kitty gazed at her in dismay as she went up anna looked at her with drooping eyelids and smiled pressing her hand but noticing that kitty only responded to her smile by a look of despair and amazement she turned away from her and began gaily talking to the other lady 
 yes there is something uncanny devilish and charming about her said kitty to herself 
 anna did not want to stay for supper but the master of the house began urging her 
 nonsense anna arkadyevna said korsunsky placing her bare hand upon his coat sleeve such an idea for a cotillon un bijou

 yes there must be something disgusting repulsive about me reflected levin as he left the and set out on foot for his lodgings and i get on with other people pride they say no i even pride if i had any pride i should not have put myself in such a position and he pictured to himself vronsky happy clever and calm certainly never placed in the awful position in which he had been that evening yes she was bound to choose him it must be so and i cannot complain of anyone or anything i am myself to blame what right had i to imagine she would care to join her life to mine who am i and what am i a nobody not wanted by anyone nor of use to anybody and he recalled his brother nikolai and dwelt with pleasure on the thought of him he right in saying that everything in the world is bad and vile and are we fair in our judgment present and past of brother nikolai of course from the point of view of procophii seeing him in a torn cloak and tipsy a despicable person but i know him differently i know his soul and know that we are alike and i instead of going to seek him out went out to dinner and then came here levin walked up to a lamppost read his address which was in his pocketbook and called a cabby all the long way to his levin vividly recalled all the facts familiar to him of his brother life he remembered how his brother while at the university and for a year afterward had in spite of the jeers of his companions lived like a monk strictly observing all religious rites services and fasts and avoiding every sort of pleasure especially women and now afterward he had all at once broken out had associated with the most horrible people and rushed into the most senseless debauchery he remembered later the scandal over a boy whom he had taken from the country to bring up and in a fit of rage had so violently beaten that proceedings were brought against him for personal injury then he remembered the scandal with a sharper to whom he had lost money and given a promissory note and against whom he had himself lodged a complaint asserting that he had cheated him this was the money sergei ivanovich had paid then he remembered how he had spent a night in a police station for disorderly conduct in the street he remembered the shameful proceedings he had instituted against his brother sergei ivanovich accusing him of not having paid him apparently his share of his estate and the last scandal when he had gone to a western province in an official capacity and there had got into trouble for assaulting a village elder it was all horribly vile yet to levin it appeared not at all as vile as it inevitably would to those who did not know nikolai did not know all his story did not know his heart 
 levin remembered that when nikolai had been in the devout stage the period of fasts and monks and church services when he was seeking in religion a support and a curb for his passionate temperament everyone far from encouraging him had jeered at him and levin had too with the others they had teased him calling him noah and monk yet when he had broken out no one had helped him but had all turned away from him with horror and loathing 
 levin felt that brother nikolai in spite of all the ugliness of his life in his soul in the very depths of his soul was no more in the wrong than the people who despised him he was not to blame for having been born with his unbridled character and some pressure upon his intellect for he had always wanted to be good i will tell him everything without reserve and i will make him speak without reserve too and show him that i love him and therefore understand him levin resolved to himself as toward eleven he reached the hotel of which he had the address 
 at the top twelve and thirteen the porter answered inquiry 
 at home 
 probably he is at home 
 the door of no was half open and together with a streak of light there issued thick fumes of cheap poor tobacco and the sound of a voice unknown to levin but he knew at once that his brother was there he recognized his cough 
 as he went in at the door the unknown voice was saying 
 it all depends with how much judgment and knowledge the done 
 konstantin levin looked in at the door and saw that the speaker was a young man with an immense shock of hair wearing a russian coat and that a young woman in a woollen gown without collar or cuffs was sitting on the sofa his brother was not to be seen konstantin felt a sharp pang at his heart at the thought of the strange company in which his brother spent his life no one had heard him and konstantin taking off his galoshes listened to what the gentleman in the russian coat was saying he was speaking of some enterprise 
 well the devil flay them these privileged classes his voice responded with a cough masha get us some supper and serve up some wine if any left or else send for some 
 the woman rose came out from behind the partition and saw konstantin 
 some gentleman here nikolai dmitrievich she said 
 whom do you want said the voice of nikolai levin angrily 
 i answered konstantin levin coming forward into the light 
 i voice said again still more angrily he could be heard getting up hurriedly stumbling against something and levin saw facing him in the doorway the big scared eyes and the huge gaunt stooping figure of his brother so familiar and yet astonishing in its oddity and sickliness 
 he was even thinner than three years before when konstantin levin had seen him last he was wearing a short coat and his hands and big bones seemed huger than ever his hair had grown thinner the same straight mustache hid his lips the same eyes gazed strangely and naively at his visitor 
 ah kostia he exclaimed suddenly recognizing his brother and his eyes lighted up with joy but the same second he looked round at the young man and gave the nervous jerk of his head and neck that konstantin knew so well as if his cravat were choking him and a quite different expression wild suffering and cruel rested on his emaciated face 
 i wrote to you and sergei ivanovich both that i know you and want to know you what is it you want 
 he was not at all the same as konstantin had been fancying him the worst and most oppressive part of his character which made all relations with him so difficult had been forgotten by konstantin levin when he thought of him and now when he saw his face and especially that nervous twitching of his head he remembered it all 
 i want to see you for anything he answered timidly simply come to see you 
 his timidity obviously softened nikolai his lips twitched 
 oh so it he said well come in sit down like some supper masha bring supper for three no stop a minute do you know who this is he said addressing his brother and indicating the gentleman in the russian coat this is mr kritsky a friend of my kiev days a very remarkable man persecuted by the police of course since not a scoundrel 
 and he surveyed as it was a habit of his everyone in the room seeing that the woman standing in the doorway was starting to go he shouted to her wait a minute i said and with that inability to express himself the incoherence that konstantin knew so well he began with another look round at everyone to tell story to his brother how he had been expelled from the university for starting a benevolent society for the poor students and classes on sunday and how he had afterward been a teacher in a rural school and had been driven out of that too and had afterward been on trial for something or other 
 of the kiev university said konstantin levin to kritsky to break the awkward silence that followed 
 yes i was in kiev kritsky replied angrily his face darkening 
 and this woman nikolai levin interrupted him pointing to her is my lifemate marya nikolaevna i took her out of a dive and he jerked his neck as he said it but i love her and respect her and anyone who wants to know me he added raising his voice and knitting his brows is requested to love her and respect her precisely the same as a wife to me precisely so now you know whom got to do with and if you think lowering yourself well the door and god speed thee 
 and again his eyes traveled inquiringly over all of them 
 but how will i lower myself i understand 
 then masha tell them to bring supper three portions and vodka and wine no wait a minute no it matter go ahead

 levin felt that brother nikolai in spite of all the ugliness of his life in his soul in the very depths of his soul was no more in the wrong than the people who despised him he was not to blame for having been born with his unbridled character and some pressure upon his intellect for he had always wanted to be good i will tell him everything without reserve and i will make him speak without reserve too and show him that i love him and therefore understand him levin resolved to himself as toward eleven he reached the hotel of which he had the address 
 at the top twelve and thirteen the porter answered inquiry 
 at home 
 probably he is at home 
 the door of no was half open and together with a streak of light there issued thick fumes of cheap poor tobacco and the sound of a voice unknown to levin but he knew at once that his brother was there he recognized his cough 
 as he went in at the door the unknown voice was saying 
 it all depends with how much judgment and knowledge the done 
 konstantin levin looked in at the door and saw that the speaker was a young man with an immense shock of hair wearing a russian coat and that a young woman in a woollen gown without collar or cuffs was sitting on the sofa his brother was not to be seen konstantin felt a sharp pang at his heart at the thought of the strange company in which his brother spent his life no one had heard him and konstantin taking off his galoshes listened to what the gentleman in the russian coat was saying he was speaking of some enterprise 
 well the devil flay them these privileged classes his voice responded with a cough masha get us some supper and serve up some wine if any left or else send for some 
 the woman rose came out from behind the partition and saw konstantin 
 some gentleman here nikolai dmitrievich she said 
 whom do you want said the voice of nikolai levin angrily 
 i answered konstantin levin coming forward into the light 
 i voice said again still more angrily he could be heard getting up hurriedly stumbling against something and levin saw facing him in the doorway the big scared eyes and the huge gaunt stooping figure of his brother so familiar and yet astonishing in its oddity and sickliness 
 he was even thinner than three years before when konstantin levin had seen him last he was wearing a short coat and his hands and big bones seemed huger than ever his hair had grown thinner the same straight mustache hid his lips the same eyes gazed strangely and naively at his visitor 
 ah kostia he exclaimed suddenly recognizing his brother and his eyes lighted up with joy but the same second he looked round at the young man and gave the nervous jerk of his head and neck that konstantin knew so well as if his cravat were choking him and a quite different expression wild suffering and cruel rested on his emaciated face 
 i wrote to you and sergei ivanovich both that i know you and want to know you what is it you want 
 he was not at all the same as konstantin had been fancying him the worst and most oppressive part of his character which made all relations with him so difficult had been forgotten by konstantin levin when he thought of him and now when he saw his face and especially that nervous twitching of his head he remembered it all 
 i want to see you for anything he answered timidly simply come to see you 
 his timidity obviously softened nikolai his lips twitched 
 oh so it he said well come in sit down like some supper masha bring supper for three no stop a minute do you know who this is he said addressing his brother and indicating the gentleman in the russian coat this is mr kritsky a friend of my kiev days a very remarkable man persecuted by the police of course since not a scoundrel 
 and he surveyed as it was a habit of his everyone in the room seeing that the woman standing in the doorway was starting to go he shouted to her wait a minute i said and with that inability to express himself the incoherence that konstantin knew so well he began with another look round at everyone to tell story to his brother how he had been expelled from the university for starting a benevolent society for the poor students and classes on sunday and how he had afterward been a teacher in a rural school and had been driven out of that too and had afterward been on trial for something or other 
 of the kiev university said konstantin levin to kritsky to break the awkward silence that followed 
 yes i was in kiev kritsky replied angrily his face darkening 
 and this woman nikolai levin interrupted him pointing to her is my lifemate marya nikolaevna i took her out of a dive and he jerked his neck as he said it but i love her and respect her and anyone who wants to know me he added raising his voice and knitting his brows is requested to love her and respect her precisely the same as a wife to me precisely so now you know whom got to do with and if you think lowering yourself well the door and god speed thee 
 and again his eyes traveled inquiringly over all of them 
 but how will i lower myself i understand 
 then masha tell them to bring supper three portions and vodka and wine no wait a minute no it matter go ahead

 chapter 
 
 so you see pursued nikolai levin painfully wrinkling his forehead and twitching 
 it was obviously difficult for him to think of what to say and do 
 here do you see he pointed to some sort of short iron bars fastened together with twine lying in a corner of the room do you see that the beginning of a new enterprise going into this enterprise will be an industrial association 
 konstantin scarcely heard him he looked into his sickly consumptive face and he was more and more sorry for him and he could not force himself to listen to what his brother was telling him about the association he saw that this association was a mere anchor to save him from nikolai levin went on talking 
 you know that capital oppresses the worker our workers the mouzhiks bear all the burden of labor and are so placed that no matter how much they work they escape from their position of beasts of burden all the profits of labor on which they might improve their position and gain leisure for themselves and after that education all the surplus values are taken from them by the capitalists and society is so constituted that the harder they work the greater the profit of the merchants and landowners while they stay beasts of burden to the end and that state of things must be changed he finished up and looked questioningly at his brother 
 yes of course said konstantin looking at the patch of red that had come out on his projecting cheekbones 
 and so founding a association where all the production and profit and the chief instruments of production everything will be in common 
 where is the association to be asked konstantin levin 
 in the village of vozdrem government of kazan 
 but why in a village in the villages i think there is plenty of work as it is why a association in a village 
 why because the peasants are just as much slaves as they ever were and why you and sergei ivanovich like people to try and get them out of their slavery said nikolai levin exasperated by the objection 
 konstantin levin sighed looking meanwhile about the cheerless and dirty room this sigh seemed to exasperate nikolai still more 
 i know sergei and your aristocratic views i know that he applies all the power of his intellect to justify existing evils 
 i say why do you talk of sergei ivanovich levin let drop smiling 
 sergei ivanovich tell you why nikolai levin shrieked suddenly at the name of sergei ivanovich tell you why but the use of talking only one thing what did you come to me for you look down on all this very well then but go away in name go away he shrieked getting up from his chair go away go away 
 i look down on it at all said konstantin levin timidly i even dispute it 
 at that instant marya nikolaevna came back nikolai levin looked round angrily at her she went quickly to him and whispered something 
 not well grown irritable said nikolai levin getting calmer and breathing painfully and then you talk to me of sergei ivanovich and his essay such rubbish such lying such what can a man write about justice who knows nothing of it have you read his essay he turned to kritsky sitting down again at the table and clearing a space for himself by pushing back some cigarettes 
 i kritsky responded gloomily obviously not desiring to enter into the conversation 
 why not said nikolai levin now turning with exasperation upon kritsky 
 because i see the use of wasting my time over it 
 oh if you please how did you know it would be wasting your time that too deep for many people that is to say over their heads but different with me i see through his ideas and i know wherein the weakness lies 
 they all fell silent kritsky got up sluggishly and reached for his cap 
 you have supper all right come round tomorrow with the locksmith 
 kritsky had hardly gone out when nikolai levin smiled and winked 
 he too is poor stuff he said for i can see 
 but at that instant kritsky at the door called him 
 what do you want now he said and went out to him in the passage left alone with marya nikolaevna levin turned to her 
 have you been long with my brother he said to her 
 yes more than a year his health has become very poor he drinks a great deal she said 
 just how 
 he drinks vodka and bad for him 
 and a great deal whispered levin 
 yes she said looking timidly toward the doorway where nikolai levin had reappeared 
 what were you talking about he said knitting his brows and turning his scared eyes from one to the other what was it 
 oh nothing konstantin answered in confusion 
 oh if you want to say only no good your talking to her a wench and a gentleman he said with a jerk of the neck you understand everything i see and have taken stock of everything and look with commiseration on my transgressions he began again raising his voice 
 nikolai dmitrich nikolai dmitrich whispered marya nikolaevna again going up to him 
 oh very well very well but the supper ah here it is he said seeing a waiter with a tray here set it here he added angrily and promptly seizing the vodka he poured out a pony and drank it greedily like a drink he turned to his brother and at once became well enough of sergei ivanovich glad to see you anyway after said and done not strangers come have a drink tell me what doing he went on greedily munching a piece of bread and pouring out another pony how are things with you 
 i live alone in the country as i always have busy looking after the land answered konstantin watching with horror the greediness with which his brother ate and drank and trying to conceal that he noticed it 
 why you get married 
 no opportunity has presented itself konstantin answered reddening 
 why not for me now at an end made a mess of my life but this said and i say still that if my share had been given me when i needed it my whole life would have been different 
 konstantin made haste to change the conversation 
 do you know your little with me a clerk in the countinghouse at pokrovskoe 
 nikolai jerked his neck and sank into thought 
 yes tell me going on at pokrovskoe is the house still standing and the birch trees and our schoolroom and philip the gardener is he living how i remember the summerhouse and the sofa now mind and alter anything in the house but make haste and get married and make everything as it used to be again then come and see you if your wife is a fine woman 
 why come to me now said levin how snugly we could settle down 
 come and see you if i were sure i find sergei ivanovich 
 you find him there i live quite independently of him 
 yes but say what you like you have to choose between me and him he said looking timidly into his face 
 this timidity touched konstantin 
 if you want to hear my confession of faith on the subject i tell you that in your quarrel with sergei ivanovich i take neither side both wrong rather wrong outwardly and he rather inwardly 
 ah ah you see that you see that nikolai shouted joyfully 
 but i personally value friendly relations with you more because 
 why why 
 konstantin could not say that he valued it more because nikolai was unhappy and needed affection but nikolai knew that this was just what he meant to say and scowling he took to the vodka again 
 enough nikolai dmitrich said marya nikolaevna stretching out her plump bare arm toward the decanter 
 let it be annoy me beat you he shouted 
 marya nikolaevna smiled a sweet and smile which was at once reflected on face and whisked the decanter off 
 and do you suppose she understands nothing said nikolai she understands everything better than all of us tell the truth there something good and sweet about her 
 were you never before in moscow konstantin said to her for the sake of saying something 
 only you be formal with her it frightens her no one ever spoke to her so but the justice of the peace who tried her for trying to get out of a house of ill fame my god what senselessness there is in this world he cried suddenly these new institutions these justices of the peace these zemstvo what hideousness it all is 
 and he began to enlarge on his encounters with the new institutions 
 konstantin levin listened to him and that disbelief in the sense of all public institutions which he shared with him and often expressed was now distasteful to him coming from his lips 
 in the other world we shall understand it all he said lightly 
 in the other world ah i like that other world i like it he said letting his scared wild eyes rest on his face here one would think that to get out of all the baseness and the mess own and other would be a good thing and yet afraid of death awfully afraid of death he shuddered but do drink something would you like some champagne or shall we go somewhere go to the gypsies do you know gotten very fond of the gypsies and of russian songs 
 his speech had begun to falter and he skipped at random from one subject to another konstantin with the help of masha persuaded him not to go out anywhere and got him to bed hopelessly drunk 
 masha promised to write to konstantin in case of need and to persuade nikolai to go and stay with his brother

 because i see the use of wasting my time over it 
 oh if you please how did you know it would be wasting your time that too deep for many people that is to say over their heads but different with me i see through his ideas and i know wherein the weakness lies

 kritsky had hardly gone out when nikolai levin smiled and winked

 this timidity touched konstantin

 ah ah you see that you see that nikolai shouted joyfully 
 but i personally value friendly relations with you more because 
 why why 
 konstantin could not say that he valued it more because nikolai was unhappy and needed affection but nikolai knew that this was just what he meant to say and scowling he took to the vodka again 
 enough nikolai dmitrich said marya nikolaevna stretching out her plump bare arm toward the decanter 
 let it be annoy me beat you he shouted 
 marya nikolaevna smiled a sweet and smile which was at once reflected on face and whisked the decanter off

 and he began to enlarge on his encounters with the new institutions 
 konstantin levin listened to him and that disbelief in the sense of all public institutions which he shared with him and often expressed was now distasteful to him coming from his lips 
 in the other world we shall understand it all he said lightly 
 in the other world ah i like that other world i like it he said letting his scared wild eyes rest on his face here one would think that to get out of all the baseness and the mess own and other would be a good thing and yet afraid of death awfully afraid of death he shuddered but do drink something would you like some champagne or shall we go somewhere go to the gypsies do you know gotten very fond of the gypsies and of russian songs 
 his speech had begun to falter and he skipped at random from one subject to another konstantin with the help of masha persuaded him not to go out anywhere and got him to bed hopelessly drunk

 so you see pursued nikolai levin painfully wrinkling his forehead and twitching 
 it was obviously difficult for him to think of what to say and do 
 here do you see he pointed to some sort of short iron bars fastened together with twine lying in a corner of the room do you see that the beginning of a new enterprise going into this enterprise will be an industrial association 
 konstantin scarcely heard him he looked into his sickly consumptive face and he was more and more sorry for him and he could not force himself to listen to what his brother was telling him about the association he saw that this association was a mere anchor to save him from nikolai levin went on talking 
 you know that capital oppresses the worker our workers the mouzhiks bear all the burden of labor and are so placed that no matter how much they work they escape from their position of beasts of burden all the profits of labor on which they might improve their position and gain leisure for themselves and after that education all the surplus values are taken from them by the capitalists and society is so constituted that the harder they work the greater the profit of the merchants and landowners while they stay beasts of burden to the end and that state of things must be changed he finished up and looked questioningly at his brother 
 yes of course said konstantin looking at the patch of red that had come out on his projecting cheekbones 
 and so founding a association where all the production and profit and the chief instruments of production everything will be in common 
 where is the association to be asked konstantin levin 
 in the village of vozdrem government of kazan 
 but why in a village in the villages i think there is plenty of work as it is why a association in a village

 in the morning konstantin levin left moscow and toward evening he reached home on the journey in the train he talked to his fellow travelers about politics and the new railways and just as in moscow he was overcome by a sense of confusion of ideas by dissatisfaction with himself and shame of something or other but when he got out at his own station when he saw his coachman ignat with the collar of his coat turned up when in the dim light falling through the station windows he saw his own carpeted sledge his own horses with their tails up in their harness trimmed with rings and tassels when the coachman ignat as he put in his luggage told him the village news that the contractor had arrived and that pava had calved he felt that little by little the confusion was clearing up and the shame and were passing away he felt this at the mere sight of ignat and the horses but he began to see what had happened to him in quite a different light when he had put on the sheepskin coat brought for him and all muffled up had taken his seat in the sleigh and started off pondering on the work that lay before him in the village and staring at the off horse that had been formerly his saddle horse overridden but a spirited animal from the don he felt himself and did not want to be anyone else all he wanted now was to be better than before in the first place he resolved that from that day on he would give up hoping for the extraordinary happiness which the marriage was to afford him and consequently he would not disdain the present so in the second place he would never again let himself give way to low passion the memory of which had so tortured him when he had been making up his mind to propose then remembering his brother nikolai he resolved that he would never allow himself to forget him that he would watch him and not lose sight of him so as to be ready to help should things go ill with him and that would be soon he felt then too his talk of communism which he had treated so lightly at the time now made him reflect he considered an alteration in economic conditions nonsense yet he had always felt the injustice of his own abundance in comparison with the poverty of the common folk and he now determined that in order to feel quite in the right though he had worked hard and lived by no means luxuriously before he would now work still harder and would allow himself even less luxury and all this seemed to him so easy a conquest over himself that he spent the whole drive in most pleasant reveries with a lively feeling of hope in a new better life he drove up to his house about nine at night

 soon returned my dear said agathya mikhailovna 
 i grew homesick agathya mikhailovna east or west home is best he answered and went into his study 
 the study was gradually lit up as the candle was brought in the familiar details came out the horns the bookshelves the plain stove with its which had long wanted mending his sofa a large table and on the table an open book a broken ash tray a notebook with his handwriting as he saw all this there came over him for an instant a doubt of the possibility of arranging the new life of which he had been dreaming on the road all these traces of his life seemed to clutch him and to say to him no not going to get away from us and not going to be different but going to be the same as always been with doubts everlasting dissatisfaction with yourself vain efforts to amend and lapses and everlasting expectation of a happiness which you get and which possible for you 
 but it was his things that said this to him while another voice in his heart was telling him that he must not fall under the sway of the past and that one can do anything with oneself and hearing that voice he went into the corner where stood his two dumbbells of one pood each and began jerking and pushing them up trying to induce a state of there was a creak of steps at the door he hastily put down the dumbbells

 in the morning konstantin levin left moscow and toward evening he reached home on the journey in the train he talked to his fellow travelers about politics and the new railways and just as in moscow he was overcome by a sense of confusion of ideas by dissatisfaction with himself and shame of something or other but when he got out at his own station when he saw his coachman ignat with the collar of his coat turned up when in the dim light falling through the station windows he saw his own carpeted sledge his own horses with their tails up in their harness trimmed with rings and tassels when the coachman ignat as he put in his luggage told him the village news that the contractor had arrived and that pava had calved he felt that little by little the confusion was clearing up and the shame and were passing away he felt this at the mere sight of ignat and the horses but he began to see what had happened to him in quite a different light when he had put on the sheepskin coat brought for him and all muffled up had taken his seat in the sleigh and started off pondering on the work that lay before him in the village and staring at the off horse that had been formerly his saddle horse overridden but a spirited animal from the don he felt himself and did not want to be anyone else all he wanted now was to be better than before in the first place he resolved that from that day on he would give up hoping for the extraordinary happiness which the marriage was to afford him and consequently he would not disdain the present so in the second place he would never again let himself give way to low passion the memory of which had so tortured him when he had been making up his mind to propose then remembering his brother nikolai he resolved that he would never allow himself to forget him that he would watch him and not lose sight of him so as to be ready to help should things go ill with him and that would be soon he felt then too his talk of communism which he had treated so lightly at the time now made him reflect he considered an alteration in economic conditions nonsense yet he had always felt the injustice of his own abundance in comparison with the poverty of the common folk and he now determined that in order to feel quite in the right though he had worked hard and lived by no means luxuriously before he would now work still harder and would allow himself even less luxury and all this seemed to him so easy a conquest over himself that he spent the whole drive in most pleasant reveries with a lively feeling of hope in a new better life he drove up to his house about nine at night 
 the snow of the little quadrangle before the house was lit up by light falling from the windows in the room of his old nurse agathya mikhailovna who performed the duties of housekeeper in his house she was not yet asleep kouzma awakened by her sleepy and barefooted ran out onto the steps a setter bitch laska leaped out too almost upsetting kouzma and whining rubbed against knees jumping up and longing yet not daring to put her forepaws on his chest 
 soon returned my dear said agathya mikhailovna 
 i grew homesick agathya mikhailovna east or west home is best he answered and went into his study 
 the study was gradually lit up as the candle was brought in the familiar details came out the horns the bookshelves the plain stove with its which had long wanted mending his sofa a large table and on the table an open book a broken ash tray a notebook with his handwriting as he saw all this there came over him for an instant a doubt of the possibility of arranging the new life of which he had been dreaming on the road all these traces of his life seemed to clutch him and to say to him no not going to get away from us and not going to be different but going to be the same as always been with doubts everlasting dissatisfaction with yourself vain efforts to amend and lapses and everlasting expectation of a happiness which you get and which possible for you 
 but it was his things that said this to him while another voice in his heart was telling him that he must not fall under the sway of the past and that one can do anything with oneself and hearing that voice he went into the corner where stood his two dumbbells of one pood each and began jerking and pushing them up trying to induce a state of there was a creak of steps at the door he hastily put down the dumbbells 
 the bailiff came in and said that everything thank god was well but also informed him that the buckwheat in the new drying machine had been a little scorched this piece of news irritated levin the new drying machine had been constructed and partly invented by levin the bailiff had always been against this drying machine and now it was with suppressed triumph that he announced that the buckwheat had been scorched levin was firmly convinced that if the buckwheat had been scorched it was only because precautions had not been taken for which he had hundreds of times given orders he was annoyed and reprimanded the bailiff but there had been an important and joyful event pava his best cow an expensive beast bought at a show had calved 
 kouzma give me my sheepskin coat and you do tell them to fetch a lantern going to have a look at her he said to the bailiff 
 the cowhouse for the more valuable cows was just behind the house walking across the yard passing a snowdrift by the lilac tree he went into the cowhouse there came a warm steamy smell of dung when the frozen door was opened and the cows astonished at the unfamiliar light of the lantern stirred on their fresh straw he caught a glimpse of the broad smooth black and piebald back of a dutch cow berkoot the bull was lying down with his ring in his lip and seemed about to get up but thought better of it and only gave two snorts as they passed by him pava the reddish beauty huge as a hippopotamus with her back turned to them screened her calf from the arrivals and sniffed it all over 
 levin went into the stall looked pava over and hefted the reddish and calf up on its unsteady spindly legs pava uneasy began lowing but when levin put the calf close to her she was soothed and sighing heavily began licking her with her rough tongue the calf fumbling poked its nose under its groin and twirled its tiny tail 
 bring the light here fiodor bring the lantern here said levin examining the heifer like the dam though the color takes after the sire a perfect beauty long and broad in the haunch she a beauty now vassilii fiodorovich he addressed the bailiff quite forgiving him for the buckwheat under the influence of his delight in the heifer 
 what bad blood could she take after semion the contractor came the day after you left you must settle with him konstantin dmitrich said the bailiff and i have already told you about the machine 
 this matter alone was enough to bring levin back to all the details of his estate which was on a large scale and complicated he went straight from the cowhouse to the countinghouse and after a short talk with the bailiff and semion the contractor he went back to the house and straight upstairs to the drawing room

 no i must go i must go she explained the change in her plans to her in a tone that suggested that she had to remember so many things that there was no enumerating them no really it had better be today 
 stepan arkadyevich was not dining at home but he promised to come and see his sister off at seven 
 kitty too did not come sending a note that she had a headache dolly and anna dined alone with the children and the english governess whether it was because children are fickle or because they have acute senses and they felt that anna was quite different that day from what she had been when they had taken such a fancy to her that she was not now interested in them they had abruptly dropped their play with their aunt and their love for her and were quite indifferent to her leaving anna was absorbed the whole morning in preparations for her departure she wrote notes to her moscow acquaintances jotted down her accounts and packed altogether dolly fancied she was not in a placid state of mind but in that worried mood which dolly knew so well in her own case and which does not come without cause and for the most part covers dissatisfaction with oneself after dinner anna went up to her room to dress and dolly followed her 
 how queer you are today dolly said to her 
 i do you think so not queer but nasty i am like that sometimes i keep feeling as if i could cry very stupid but pass off said anna quickly and she bent her flushed face over a tiny bag in which she was packing a nightcap and some cambric handkerchiefs her eyes were particularly bright and were continually dimmed with tears in the same way i want to leave peterburg and now i want to go away from here 
 you came here and did a good deed said dolly looking intently at her 
 eyes were wet with tears as she looked at her 
 say that dolly done nothing and could do nothing i often wonder why people are all in league to spoil me what have i done and what could i do in your heart there was found love enough to forgive 
 if it had not been for you god knows what would have happened how happy you are anna said dolly everything is clear and good in your heart 
 every heart has its own skeleton as the english say 
 you have no sort of skeleton have you everything is so clear in you 
 i have said anna suddenly and unexpectedly after her tears a sly mocking smile puckered her lips 
 come amusing anyway your skeleton and not depressing said dolly smiling 
 no he is depressing do you know why going today instead of tomorrow this is a confession that weighs on me i want to make you its recipient said anna resolutely letting herself drop into an armchair and looking straight into face 
 and to her surprise dolly saw that anna was blushing up to her ears up to the curly black ringlets on her neck 
 yes anna went on do you know why kitty come to dinner jealous of me i have spoiled been the cause of that ball being a torture to her instead of a pleasure but truly truly not my fault or only my fault a little bit she said daintily drawling the words a little bit 
 oh how like stiva you said that said dolly laughing 
 anna was hurt 
 oh no oh no not stiva she said knitting her brows why telling you just because i do not even for an instant permit myself to doubt about myself said anna 
 but at the very moment she was uttering the words she felt that they were not true she was not merely doubting about herself she felt emotion at the thought of vronsky and was going away sooner than she had meant solely to avoid meeting him 
 yes stiva told me you danced the mazurka with him and that he 
 you imagine how absurdly it all came about i only meant to be matchmaking and all at once it turned out quite differently possibly against my own will 
 she flushed and stopped 
 oh they feel it immediately said dolly 
 but i should be in despair if there were anything serious in it on his side anna interrupted her and certain it will all be forgotten and kitty will leave off hating me 
 all the same anna to tell you the truth not very anxious for this marriage for kitty and better it should come to nothing if he vronsky is capable of falling in love with you in a single day 
 oh heavens that would be too silly said anna and again a deep flush of pleasure appeared on her face as she heard the idea that absorbed her put into words and so here i am going away having made an enemy of kitty whom i liked so much ah how sweet she is but make it right dolly eh 
 dolly could scarcely suppress a smile she loved anna but she was pleased to see that she too had her weaknesses 
 an enemy that be 
 i did so want you all to care for me as i do for you and now i care for you more than ever said anna with tears in her eyes ah how silly i am today 
 she passed her handkerchief over her face and began dressing 
 at the very moment of starting stepan arkadyevich arrived late rosy and smelling of wine and cigars 
 emotionalism infected dolly and when she embraced her for the last time she whispered 
 remember anna what done for me i shall never forget and remember that i love you and shall always love you as my dearest friend 
 i know why said anna kissing her and hiding her tears 
 you understand me and still understand my darling

 after the ball early next morning anna arkadyevna sent her husband a telegram that she was leaving moscow the same day 
 no i must go i must go she explained the change in her plans to her in a tone that suggested that she had to remember so many things that there was no enumerating them no really it had better be today 
 stepan arkadyevich was not dining at home but he promised to come and see his sister off at seven 
 kitty too did not come sending a note that she had a headache dolly and anna dined alone with the children and the english governess whether it was because children are fickle or because they have acute senses and they felt that anna was quite different that day from what she had been when they had taken such a fancy to her that she was not now interested in them they had abruptly dropped their play with their aunt and their love for her and were quite indifferent to her leaving anna was absorbed the whole morning in preparations for her departure she wrote notes to her moscow acquaintances jotted down her accounts and packed altogether dolly fancied she was not in a placid state of mind but in that worried mood which dolly knew so well in her own case and which does not come without cause and for the most part covers dissatisfaction with oneself after dinner anna went up to her room to dress and dolly followed her 
 how queer you are today dolly said to her 
 i do you think so not queer but nasty i am like that sometimes i keep feeling as if i could cry very stupid but pass off said anna quickly and she bent her flushed face over a tiny bag in which she was packing a nightcap and some cambric handkerchiefs her eyes were particularly bright and were continually dimmed with tears in the same way i want to leave peterburg and now i want to go away from here 
 you came here and did a good deed said dolly looking intently at her 
 eyes were wet with tears as she looked at her 
 say that dolly done nothing and could do nothing i often wonder why people are all in league to spoil me what have i done and what could i do in your heart there was found love enough to forgive 
 if it had not been for you god knows what would have happened how happy you are anna said dolly everything is clear and good in your heart 
 every heart has its own skeleton as the english say 
 you have no sort of skeleton have you everything is so clear in you 
 i have said anna suddenly and unexpectedly after her tears a sly mocking smile puckered her lips 
 come amusing anyway your skeleton and not depressing said dolly smiling 
 no he is depressing do you know why going today instead of tomorrow this is a confession that weighs on me i want to make you its recipient said anna resolutely letting herself drop into an armchair and looking straight into face 
 and to her surprise dolly saw that anna was blushing up to her ears up to the curly black ringlets on her neck 
 yes anna went on do you know why kitty come to dinner jealous of me i have spoiled been the cause of that ball being a torture to her instead of a pleasure but truly truly not my fault or only my fault a little bit she said daintily drawling the words a little bit 
 oh how like stiva you said that said dolly laughing 
 anna was hurt 
 oh no oh no not stiva she said knitting her brows why telling you just because i do not even for an instant permit myself to doubt about myself said anna 
 but at the very moment she was uttering the words she felt that they were not true she was not merely doubting about herself she felt emotion at the thought of vronsky and was going away sooner than she had meant solely to avoid meeting him 
 yes stiva told me you danced the mazurka with him and that he 
 you imagine how absurdly it all came about i only meant to be matchmaking and all at once it turned out quite differently possibly against my own will 
 she flushed and stopped 
 oh they feel it immediately said dolly 
 but i should be in despair if there were anything serious in it on his side anna interrupted her and certain it will all be forgotten and kitty will leave off hating me

 now all over god be praised was the first thought that came to anna arkadyevna when she had said for the last time to her brother who had stood blocking up the entrance to the carriage till the third bell rang she sat down on her lounge beside annushka and looked about her in the twilight of the sleeping carriage thank god tomorrow i shall see seriozha and alexei alexandrovich and my life good and familiar will go on in the old way 
 still in the same anxious frame of mind in which she had been all that day anna took a meticulous pleasure in making herself comfortable for the journey with her tiny deft hands she opened and shut her little red bag took out a cushion laid it on her knees and carefully wrapping up her feet settled herself comfortably an invalid lady had already lain down to sleep two other ladies began talking to anna and a stout elderly lady tucked up her feet and made observations about the heating of the train anna answered the ladies in a few words but not foreseeing any entertainment from the conversation she asked annushka to get a small lantern hooked it on the arm of her seat and took from her bag a paper knife and an english novel at first she could not get interested in her reading the fuss and stir were disturbing then when the train had started she could not help listening to the noises then the snow beating on the left window and sticking to the pane and the sight of the muffled guard passing by covered with snow on one side and the conversations about the terrible blizzard raging outside distracted her attention and after that everything was the same and the same the same jouncing and rattling the same snow lashing the window the same rapid transitions from steaming heat to cold and back again to heat the same flitting of the same faces in the and the same voices and then anna began to read and to grasp what she read annushka was already dozing the red bag on her lap clutched by her broad hands in gloves of which one was torn anna arkadyevna read and grasped the sense yet it was annoying to her to read that is to follow the reflection of other lives she had too great a desire to live herself if she read that the heroine of the novel were nursing a sick man she longed to move with noiseless steps about his sickroom if she read of a member of parliament delivering a speech she longed to deliver it if she read of how lady mary had ridden after the hounds and had provoked her and had surprised everyone by her daring she too longed to be doing the same but there was no chance of doing anything and her little hands toying with the smooth paper knife she forced herself to read 
 the hero of the novel was already beginning to attain his english happiness a baronetcy and an estate and anna was feeling a desire to go with him to his estate when she suddenly felt that he ought to feel ashamed and that she was ashamed of the same thing but what was it he was ashamed of what have i to be ashamed of she asked herself in injured surprise she abandoned the book and sank against the back of her chair tightly gripping the paper knife in both hands there was nothing to be ashamed of she went over all her moscow recollections all were fine pleasant she recalled the ball recalled vronsky and his enamored submissive face she recalled all her conduct with him there was nothing shameful yet with all that at this very point in her reminiscences the feeling of shame was intensified as though some inner voice precisely here when she recalled vronsky were saying to her warm very warm hot well what is it she said to herself resolutely shifting on her seat what does it mean am i afraid to look at this without blinking well what is it can it be that between me and this there exist or can exist any other relations than such as are common with every acquaintance she laughed contemptuously and took up her book again but now she was absolutely unable to make sense of what she read she passed the paper knife over the windowpane then laid its smooth cool surface to her cheek and almost laughed aloud at the unreasoning joy that all at once possessed her she felt that her nerves like strings were being tautened more and more upon some kind of tightening peg she felt her eyes opening wider and wider her fingers and toes twitching nervously something within stopping her breathing while all images and sounds seemed in the swaying to strike her with extraordinary vividness moments of doubt were continually besetting her was the car going forward or back or was it standing absolutely still was it really annushka at her side or a stranger that on the arm of the chair a fur cloak or some beast and what am i myself is it i or some other woman she was afraid of yielding to this trance but something was drawing her into it and at will she could yield to it or resist it she got up to rouse herself and slipped off her plaid and the cape of warm dress for a moment she regained her and realized that the thin peasant who had come in wearing a long nankeen overcoat with a button missing from it was the fireman that he was looking at the thermometer that the wind and snow had burst in after him through the door but then everything grew confused again that peasant with the long waist took to gnawing something within the wall the little crone started stretching her legs the whole length of the car and filled it with a black cloud then there was a dreadful screeching and banging as though someone were being rent into pieces then a red blaze blinded her eyes and at last everything was screened by a wall anna felt that she had plunged downward yet all this was not terrible but joyful the voice of a man muffled up and covered with snow shouted something in her very ear she arose and came to realizing that they had come to a station and that this was the conductor she requested annushka to hand her the cape she had taken off and her shawl put them on and went toward the door 
 do you wish to get out asked annushka 
 yes i want to get a breath of air very hot in here

 and she opened the door the blizzard and the wind rushed to meet her and began to contend with her for the door and even this seemed joyful to her she opened the door and stepped out this seemed to be all that the wind had been lying in wait for it set up a gleeful whistle and was about to snatch her up and whirl her away but she clutched the cold doorpost and holding on to her shawl descended to the platform and the shelter of the car the wind had been mighty on the steps but on the platform in the lee of the train there was a lull with enjoyment she drew deep breaths of the snowy frosty air and standing near the car looked about the platform and the lighted station

 the frightful storm raged and whistled between the wheels of the cars along the posts around the corner of the station the cars posts people everything in sight were covered with snow on one side and were getting more and more snowed under for a moment there would come a lull in the storm but then it would again swoop down with such gusts that it seemed impossible to withstand it meanwhile some men or other were dashing about gaily talking to one another making the boards of the platform creak and ceaselessly opening and shutting the big doors a stooping human shadow glided by at her feet and she heard a hammer tapping upon iron have the telegram came an angry voice out of the stormy murk on the other side this way no other voices were also shouting and muffled figures scurried by plastered with snow two gentlemen passed by her cigarettes glowing in their mouths she drew in one more deep breath and had just taken her hand out of her muff to grasp the doorpost and enter the car when still another man in a military overcoat quite close beside her stepped between her and the flickering light of a lantern she looked round and the same instant recognized face putting his hand to the peak of his cap he bowed to her and asked if there anything she wanted whether he could not be of some service to her she gazed rather long at him without any answer and in spite of the shadow in which he was standing she saw or fancied she saw the expression both of his face and his eyes it was again that expression of reverent rapture which had affected her so yesterday more than once she had told herself during the past few days and only just now that vronsky was for her only one of the hundreds of young men forever exactly the same that one meets everywhere that she would never permit herself even to think of him yet now at the first flush of meeting him she was seized by an emotion of joyous pride she had no need to ask why he was here she knew as surely as if he had told her that he was here only to be where she was 
 i know you were going and why are you going she said letting fall the hand which had grasped the doorpost and irrepressible joy and animation shone in her face 
 why am i going he repeated looking straight into her eyes you know that i am going to be where you are he said i cannot do otherwise 
 and at this very point as though it had overcome all obstacles the wind scattered the snow from the car roofs and began to flutter some sheet of iron it had torn off while the whistle of the engine set up a roar in front dismal and lamenting all the awesomeness of the blizzard now seemed still more splendid to her he had uttered precisely what her soul yearned for but which her reason dreaded she made no answer and in her face he beheld a struggle 
 forgive me if what i have said displeases you he said humbly 
 he had spoken courteously deferentially yet so firmly so obdurately that for long she could find no answer 
 what you say is wrong and i beg of you if you are a good man to forget what you have said even as i shall forget it she said at last 
 not a single word of yours nor a single gesture shall i ever forget nor could i forget 
 enough enough she cried vainly attempting to give a stern expression to her face which he was avidly scrutinizing clutching at the cold doorpost she clambered up the steps and quickly entered the corridor of the car but in this little corridor she paused reviewing in her imagination all that had occurred without recalling her own words or his she realized instinctively that that conversation had brought them fearfully closer and she was both frightened and made happy thereby after standing thus a few seconds she went into the car and sat down in her place that tensed state which had tormented her at first was not only renewed but grew greater and reached such a pitch that she was afraid that at any moment something would snap within her from the excessive tension she did not sleep all night but in that nervous tension and in the reveries that filled her imagination there was nothing unpleasant or gloomy on the contrary there was something joyous glowing and exhilarating toward morning anna dozed off as she sat and when she awoke it was already light and the train was nearing peterburg at once thoughts of home of her husband and son and the details of the day ahead and days to follow came thronging upon her 
 at peterburg as soon as the train stopped and she got out the first face that attracted her attention was that of her husband oh my god what has happened to his ears she thought looking at his frigid and imposing figure and especially the ears that struck her so now as they propped up the brim of his round hat catching sight of her he went to meet her pursing his lips into their habitual mocking smile and fixing her with his big tired eyes some unpleasant sensation contracted her heart as she met his obdurate and tired glance as though she had expected to see him a different man she was particularly struck by that feeling of dissatisfaction with herself which she experienced on meeting him this was an intimate familiar feeling like that state of dissimulation which she experienced in her relations with her husband but hitherto she had not taken note of the feeling now she was clearly and painfully aware of it 
 yes as you see your tender spouse as devoted as he was during the second year after marriage was consumed by the desire of seeing you he said in his dilatory voice and in that tone which he almost always used to her a tone of bantering at anyone who should speak thus in earnest 
 is seriozha quite well she asked 
 and is this all the reward said he for my ardor well quite well

 vronsky had not even attempted to fall asleep all that night he sat in his armchair his eyes fixed before him or scanning the people who got in and out and if he had indeed on previous occasions struck and aroused people who did not know him by his air of unshakable calmness he now seemed prouder and more than ever he regarded people as if they were things a nervous young man a clerk in a law court who had the seat opposite his conceived a hatred for him because of this air the young man asked him for a light and entered into conversation with him and even jostled him to make him feel that he was not a thing but a man but vronsky kept on regarding him as if he were a lamppost and the young man grimaced feeling that he was losing his under the oppressiveness of this refusal to recognize him as a human being 
 vronsky saw nothing and no one he felt himself a king not because he believed that he had made any impression on anna he did not yet believe that but because the impression she had made on him afforded him happiness and pride 
 what would come of it all he did not know or even think he felt that all his forces hitherto dissolute scattered were centered on one thing and bent with fearful energy toward one blissful goal and therein lay his happiness he did but know that he had told her the truth that he had come where she was that all the happiness of life the sole meaning in life for him now lay in seeing her and hearing her voice and when he got out of his car at bologovo to get some seltzer water and had caught sight of anna his very first word had involuntarily told her his very thoughts and he was glad he had told her that she knew now and was thinking of it he did not sleep all night back in his compartment he incessantly kept ruminating upon every posture in which he had seen her every word she had uttered and in his imagination making his heart swoon floated pictures of a possible future 
 when he got out of the train at peterburg he felt after his sleepless night as lively and fresh as after a cold bath he paused near his car waiting for her to emerge once more he said to himself smiling unconsciously once more i shall see her walk her face she may say something turn her head glance smile perhaps but before he caught sight of her he saw her husband whom the stationmaster was deferentially escorting through the crowd ah yes the husband only now for the first time did vronsky realize clearly the fact that there was someone attached to her a husband he had known that she had a husband but had hardly believed in his existence and only now when he saw him did he fully believe in him with his head and shoulders and his legs especially when he saw this husband placidly take her arm with a consciousness of proprietorship 
 seeing alexei alexandrovich with his peterburg face and austerely figure in his round hat with his rather prominent spine he believed in him and was aware of a disagreeable sensation such as might be felt by a man who tortured by thirst finds on reaching a spring a dog a sheep or a pig therein that has not only drunk of it but also muddied the water alexei manner of walking gyrating his whole pelvis and his flat feet was especially offensive to vronsky he could recognize in no one but himself an indubitable right to love her but she was still the same and the sight of her affected him the same way physically reviving him stirring him and filling his soul with happiness he told his german valet who ran up to him from the second class to take his things and go on he himself went up to her he saw the first meeting between the husband and wife and noted with a insight the sign of the slight embarrassment with which she spoke to her husband no she does not love him and cannot love him he decided to himself 
 at the very moment that he was approaching anna arkadyevna from the back he noticed with joy that she was conscious of his drawing near and that she looked round after which seeing him she turned again to her husband 
 have you had a good night he said bowing both to her and to her husband and leaving it to alexei alexandrovich to accept the bow on his own account and to return it or not as he might see fit 
 thank you a very good one she answered 
 her face seemed tired and lacking in that play of animation which usually hovered between her smile and her eyes but for a single instant as she glanced at him something flashed in her eyes and although this flash died away at once he was made happy by that moment she glanced at her husband to find out whether he knew vronsky alexei alexandrovich was regarding vronsky with displeasure trying to recall who he was calmness and had here run up like a scythe against a stone on the frigid of alexei alexandrovich 
 count vronsky said anna 
 ah we are acquainted i believe said alexei alexandrovich apathetically proffering his hand you set out with the mother and return with the son he said to anna articulating distinctly as though each word were a coin of high value bestowed by him on his hearers back from leave i suppose he said and without waiting for a reply he addressed his wife in his bantering tone well were a great many tears shed in moscow at parting 
 by addressing his wife thus he meant vronsky to perceive that he wished to be left alone and turning slightly toward him he touched his hat but vronsky turned to anna arkadyevna 
 i hope to have the honor of calling on you he said 
 alexei alexandrovich glanced with his weary eyes at vronsky 
 delighted he said coldly at home mondays then dismissing vronsky entirely he said to his wife i am rather lucky to have just half an hour to meet you so that i can prove to you my fondness he went on in the same bantering tone 
 you lay too great a stress on your fondness for me to value it very much she responded in the same bantering tone involuntarily listening to the sound of steps behind them but what have i to do with that she said to herself and began questioning her husband as to how seriozha had got on without her 
 oh capitally mariette says he has been a very darling boy and i must disappoint you but he has not languished for you as your husband has but once more merci my dear for bestowing a whole day upon me our dear samovar will be enraptured he called the countess lidia ivanovna well known in society a samovar because she was bubbling over with excitement on any and every occasion she has been asking for you and know if i may venture to advise you you ought to go to see her today you know how she takes everything to heart just now with all her own cares anxious about the reconciliation of the oblonskys 
 the countess lidia ivanovna was a friend of her and the center of that one of the coteries of the peterburg beau monde with which anna was through her husband in the closest rapport 
 but i wrote to her 
 yes but she must have full details go to see her if not too tired my dear well kondratii will take you in the carriage while i go to my committee once more i shall not be alone at dinner alexei alexandrovich continued but no longer in a jesting tone you believe how grown used to you 
 and with a prolonged pressure of her hand and a particular smile he helped her into her carriage

 vronsky had not even attempted to fall asleep all that night he sat in his armchair his eyes fixed before him or scanning the people who got in and out and if he had indeed on previous occasions struck and aroused people who did not know him by his air of unshakable calmness he now seemed prouder and more than ever he regarded people as if they were things a nervous young man a clerk in a law court who had the seat opposite his conceived a hatred for him because of this air the young man asked him for a light and entered into conversation with him and even jostled him to make him feel that he was not a thing but a man but vronsky kept on regarding him as if he were a lamppost and the young man grimaced feeling that he was losing his under the oppressiveness of this refusal to recognize him as a human being 
 vronsky saw nothing and no one he felt himself a king not because he believed that he had made any impression on anna he did not yet believe that but because the impression she had made on him afforded him happiness and pride 
 what would come of it all he did not know or even think he felt that all his forces hitherto dissolute scattered were centered on one thing and bent with fearful energy toward one blissful goal and therein lay his happiness he did but know that he had told her the truth that he had come where she was that all the happiness of life the sole meaning in life for him now lay in seeing her and hearing her voice and when he got out of his car at bologovo to get some seltzer water and had caught sight of anna his very first word had involuntarily told her his very thoughts and he was glad he had told her that she knew now and was thinking of it he did not sleep all night back in his compartment he incessantly kept ruminating upon every posture in which he had seen her every word she had uttered and in his imagination making his heart swoon floated pictures of a possible future 
 when he got out of the train at peterburg he felt after his sleepless night as lively and fresh as after a cold bath he paused near his car waiting for her to emerge once more he said to himself smiling unconsciously once more i shall see her walk her face she may say something turn her head glance smile perhaps but before he caught sight of her he saw her husband whom the stationmaster was deferentially escorting through the crowd ah yes the husband only now for the first time did vronsky realize clearly the fact that there was someone attached to her a husband he had known that she had a husband but had hardly believed in his existence and only now when he saw him did he fully believe in him with his head and shoulders and his legs especially when he saw this husband placidly take her arm with a consciousness of proprietorship 
 seeing alexei alexandrovich with his peterburg face and austerely figure in his round hat with his rather prominent spine he believed in him and was aware of a disagreeable sensation such as might be felt by a man who tortured by thirst finds on reaching a spring a dog a sheep or a pig therein that has not only drunk of it but also muddied the water alexei manner of walking gyrating his whole pelvis and his flat feet was especially offensive to vronsky he could recognize in no one but himself an indubitable right to love her but she was still the same and the sight of her affected him the same way physically reviving him stirring him and filling his soul with happiness he told his german valet who ran up to him from the second class to take his things and go on he himself went up to her he saw the first meeting between the husband and wife and noted with a insight the sign of the slight embarrassment with which she spoke to her husband no she does not love him and cannot love him he decided to himself 
 at the very moment that he was approaching anna arkadyevna from the back he noticed with joy that she was conscious of his drawing near and that she looked round after which seeing him she turned again to her husband 
 have you had a good night he said bowing both to her and to her husband and leaving it to alexei alexandrovich to accept the bow on his own account and to return it or not as he might see fit 
 thank you a very good one she answered 
 her face seemed tired and lacking in that play of animation which usually hovered between her smile and her eyes but for a single instant as she glanced at him something flashed in her eyes and although this flash died away at once he was made happy by that moment she glanced at her husband to find out whether he knew vronsky alexei alexandrovich was regarding vronsky with displeasure trying to recall who he was calmness and had here run up like a scythe against a stone on the frigid of alexei alexandrovich 
 count vronsky said anna 
 ah we are acquainted i believe said alexei alexandrovich apathetically proffering his hand you set out with the mother and return with the son he said to anna articulating distinctly as though each word were a coin of high value bestowed by him on his hearers back from leave i suppose he said and without waiting for a reply he addressed his wife in his bantering tone well were a great many tears shed in moscow at parting 
 by addressing his wife thus he meant vronsky to perceive that he wished to be left alone and turning slightly toward him he touched his hat but vronsky turned to anna arkadyevna 
 i hope to have the honor of calling on you he said 
 alexei alexandrovich glanced with his weary eyes at vronsky 
 delighted he said coldly at home mondays then dismissing vronsky entirely he said to his wife i am rather lucky to have just half an hour to meet you so that i can prove to you my fondness he went on in the same bantering tone 
 you lay too great a stress on your fondness for me to value it very much she responded in the same bantering tone involuntarily listening to the sound of steps behind them but what have i to do with that she said to herself and began questioning her husband as to how seriozha had got on without her 
 oh capitally mariette says he has been a very darling boy and i must disappoint you but he has not languished for you as your husband has but once more merci my dear for bestowing a whole day upon me our dear samovar will be enraptured he called the countess lidia ivanovna well known in society a samovar because she was bubbling over with excitement on any and every occasion she has been asking for you and know if i may venture to advise you you ought to go to see her today you know how she takes everything to heart just now with all her own cares anxious about the reconciliation of the oblonskys 
 the countess lidia ivanovna was a friend of her and the center of that one of the coteries of the peterburg beau monde with which anna was through her husband in the closest rapport 
 but i wrote to her 
 yes but she must have full details go to see her if not too tired my dear well kondratii will take you in the carriage while i go to my committee once more i shall not be alone at dinner alexei alexandrovich continued but no longer in a jesting tone you believe how grown used to you 
 and with a prolonged pressure of her hand and a particular smile he helped her into her carriage

 chapter 
 
 alexei alexandrovich came back from the ministry at four but as often happened had no chance to drop in at her room he went into his study to see the people waiting for him with petitions and to sign certain papers brought him by his head clerk at dinnertime there were always at least three people dining with the karenins there arrived an old lady a cousin of alexei alexandrovich the director of the department and his wife and a young man who had been recommended to alexei alexandrovich for a post anna went into the drawing room to entertain these guests precisely at five before the bronze peter the first clock had finished the fifth stroke alexei alexandrovich made his entry in white tie and evening coat with two stars as he had to go out directly after dinner every minute of alexei life was taken up and apportioned and in order to accomplish all that each day held for him he adhered to the strictest orderliness nor haste nor rest was his device he entered the dining hall bowed to all and hurriedly sat down smiling to his wife 
 yes my solitude is over you believe how uncomfortable he laid stress on the word uncomfortable it is to dine alone 
 at dinner he chatted with his wife about things at moscow and asked with his mocking smile about stepan arkadyevich but the conversation was for the most part general dealing with the official and public news of peterburg after dinner he spent half an hour with his guests and again with a smile pressed his hand withdrew and drove off to the council anna went that evening neither to the princess betsy tverskaia who hearing of her return had invited her nor to the theater where she had a box for that evening her principal reason for not going out was because the dress she had expected to wear was not ready all in all anna was exceedingly annoyed when she started to dress for the evening after the departure of her guests before her departure for moscow she who was generally a mistress of the art of dressing well yet inexpensively had given her dressmaker three dresses to make over the dresses were to be made over so that their old selves would be unrecognizable and they should have been ready three days ago it turned out that two dresses were nowhere near ready while the other one had not been made over to liking the dressmaker came to explain asserting that her way was best and anna had become so heated that she blushed at the recollection to regain her composure fully she went into the nursery and spent the whole evening with her son putting him to bed herself making the sign of the cross over him and tucking him in she was glad she had not gone out anywhere and had spent the evening so well she felt so lighthearted and calm she saw so clearly that all that had seemed to her so significant on her railway journey was merely one of the ordinary trivial incidents of fashionable life and that she had no cause to feel ashamed before anyone else or before herself anna sat down near the fireplace with an english novel and waited for her husband exactly at nine she heard his ring and he entered the room 
 here you are at last she observed extending her hand to him 
 he kissed her hand and sat down beside her 
 all in all i can see your trip was a success he said to her 
 yes very much so said she and she began telling him everything from the beginning her journey with countess vronskaia her arrival the accident at the station then she described the pity she had felt first for her brother and afterward for dolly 
 i do not suppose there is any excuse for such a man even though he is your brother said alexei alexandrovich sternly 
 anna smiled she knew that he said this precisely to show that family considerations could not prevent him from expressing his sincere opinion she knew this trait in her husband and liked it 
 i am glad everything has ended so well and that you have returned he went on well and what do they say there about the new bill i have got passed in the council 
 anna had heard nothing of this bill and she felt that she could so readily forget what was to him of such importance 
 here on the other hand this has created a great deal of talk said he with a smile 
 she saw that alexei alexandrovich wanted to tell her something that pleased him about it and she brought him by questions to telling it with the same smile he told her of the ovations he had received as a consequence of the bill he had passed 
 i was very very happy it shows that at last an intelligent and firm view of the matter is forming among us 
 after his second cup of tea with cream and bread alexei alexandrovich got up and went toward his study 
 and you went nowhere this evening you really bored he said 
 oh no she answered getting up after him and accompanying him across the room to his study what are you reading now she asked

 alexei alexandrovich came back from the ministry at four but as often happened had no chance to drop in at her room he went into his study to see the people waiting for him with petitions and to sign certain papers brought him by his head clerk at dinnertime there were always at least three people dining with the karenins there arrived an old lady a cousin of alexei alexandrovich the director of the department and his wife and a young man who had been recommended to alexei alexandrovich for a post anna went into the drawing room to entertain these guests precisely at five before the bronze peter the first clock had finished the fifth stroke alexei alexandrovich made his entry in white tie and evening coat with two stars as he had to go out directly after dinner every minute of alexei life was taken up and apportioned and in order to accomplish all that each day held for him he adhered to the strictest orderliness nor haste nor rest was his device he entered the dining hall bowed to all and hurriedly sat down smiling to his wife 
 yes my solitude is over you believe how uncomfortable he laid stress on the word uncomfortable it is to dine alone 
 at dinner he chatted with his wife about things at moscow and asked with his mocking smile about stepan arkadyevich but the conversation was for the most part general dealing with the official and public news of peterburg after dinner he spent half an hour with his guests and again with a smile pressed his hand withdrew and drove off to the council anna went that evening neither to the princess betsy tverskaia who hearing of her return had invited her nor to the theater where she had a box for that evening her principal reason for not going out was because the dress she had expected to wear was not ready all in all anna was exceedingly annoyed when she started to dress for the evening after the departure of her guests before her departure for moscow she who was generally a mistress of the art of dressing well yet inexpensively had given her dressmaker three dresses to make over the dresses were to be made over so that their old selves would be unrecognizable and they should have been ready three days ago it turned out that two dresses were nowhere near ready while the other one had not been made over to liking the dressmaker came to explain asserting that her way was best and anna had become so heated that she blushed at the recollection to regain her composure fully she went into the nursery and spent the whole evening with her son putting him to bed herself making the sign of the cross over him and tucking him in she was glad she had not gone out anywhere and had spent the evening so well she felt so lighthearted and calm she saw so clearly that all that had seemed to her so significant on her railway journey was merely one of the ordinary trivial incidents of fashionable life and that she had no cause to feel ashamed before anyone else or before herself anna sat down near the fireplace with an english novel and waited for her husband exactly at nine she heard his ring and he entered the room 
 here you are at last she observed extending her hand to him 
 he kissed her hand and sat down beside her 
 all in all i can see your trip was a success he said to her 
 yes very much so said she and she began telling him everything from the beginning her journey with countess vronskaia her arrival the accident at the station then she described the pity she had felt first for her brother and afterward for dolly 
 i do not suppose there is any excuse for such a man even though he is your brother said alexei alexandrovich sternly 
 anna smiled she knew that he said this precisely to show that family considerations could not prevent him from expressing his sincere opinion she knew this trait in her husband and liked it 
 i am glad everything has ended so well and that you have returned he went on well and what do they say there about the new bill i have got passed in the council 
 anna had heard nothing of this bill and she felt that she could so readily forget what was to him of such importance 
 here on the other hand this has created a great deal of talk said he with a smile 
 she saw that alexei alexandrovich wanted to tell her something that pleased him about it and she brought him by questions to telling it with the same smile he told her of the ovations he had received as a consequence of the bill he had passed 
 i was very very happy it shows that at last an intelligent and firm view of the matter is forming among us 
 after his second cup of tea with cream and bread alexei alexandrovich got up and went toward his study

 upon his departure from peterburg vronsky had left his large apartments on morskaia to his friend and favorite comrade petritsky 
 petritsky was a young lieutenant not particularly and not merely not wealthy but in debt all around toward evening he was always drunk and he had often found himself in the guardhouse because of sorts of ludicrous and disgraceful scrapes but he was a favorite both of his comrades and his superior officers at twelve as vronsky was driving up from the station to his quarters he saw near the entrance of the house a hired carriage familiar to him even as he rang he heard beyond the door masculine laughter the twitter of a feminine voice and shout if one of the villains let him in vronsky told the servant not to announce him and slipped noiselessly into the first room baroness shilton a friend of with a rosy little face and resplendent in a lilac satin gown and filling the whole room like a canary with her parisian accents sat at a round table brewing coffee petritsky in his overcoat and the cavalry captain kamerovsky in full uniform probably just come from duty were sitting near her 
 bravo vronsky shouted petritsky jumping up scraping his chair our host himself baroness some coffee for him out of the new coffeepot there we expect you i hope satisfied with the adornment of your study he said indicating the baroness you know each other of course 
 i should say so said vronsky with a bright smile squeezing the little hand why old friends 
 just returned after traveling said the baroness so run along oh be off this minute if in the way 
 home wherever you are baroness said vronsky how do you do kamerovsky he added coldly shaking hands with kamerovsky 
 there you can never say such charming things said the baroness turning to petritsky 
 no why not after dinner even i can say things quite as good 
 after dinner no merit in them well then give you some coffee go wash and tidy up said the baroness sitting down again and anxiously turning a gadget in the new coffee urn pierre give me the coffee she said addressing petritsky whom she called pierre playing on his surname making no secret of her relations with him i want to put some more in 
 spoil it 
 no i spoil it well and how is your wife said the baroness suddenly interrupting conversation with his comrade been marrying you off here have you brought your wife along 
 no baroness i was born a gypsy and a gypsy die 
 so much the better so much the better shake hands on it 
 and the baroness detaining vronsky began telling him interspersing her story with many jokes about her latest plans of life and seeking his counsel 
 he persists in refusing to give me a divorce well what am i to do he was her husband now i want to begin a suit against him what would you advise kamerovsky look after the coffee boiled out you can see taken up with business i want a lawsuit because i must have my property you can understand the stupidity of his saying that i am unfaithful to him she said contemptuously yet through it he wants to get the benefit of my fortune 
 vronsky heard with pleasure this lighthearted prattle of a pretty woman said yes to everything gave her counsel and altogether dropped at once into the tone habitual to him in talking to such women in his peterburg world all people were divided into two utterly opposed kinds one the lower consisted of vulgar stupid and above all ridiculous people who believe that one husband ought to live with the one wife whom he has lawfully wedded that a girl should be innocent a woman modest and a man manly and strong that one ought to bring up children earn bread and pay debts and various similar absurdities those people were of an and ridiculous kind but there was another kind of people real people to which they all belonged and here the chief thing was to be elegant magnanimous daring gay and to abandon oneself without a blush to every passion and to laugh at everything else 
 for the first moment only vronsky was startled after the impressions of a quite different world that he had brought with him from moscow but immediately as though he had thrust his feet into old slippers he stepped into his former lighthearted pleasant world 
 the coffee was really never made but spluttered over everyone and boiled away doing just what was required of it that is providing cause for much noise and laughter and spoiling a costly rug and the gown 
 well now or else never get washed and i shall have on my conscience the worst offense any decent person can commit uncleanliness so you would advise a knife at his throat 
 absolutely and in such a way that your little hand may not be far from his lips kiss it and all will end well answered vronsky 
 so the tonight and with a rustle of her skirts she vanished 
 kamerovsky got up too and vronsky without waiting for him to go shook hands and went off to his dressing room while he was washing petritsky briefly outlined to him his position as far as it had changed since departure from peterburg no money whatsoever his father said he give him any nor pay his debts his tailor was trying to get him locked up and another fellow too was threatening to do so without fail the colonel of his regiment had announced that if these scandals did not cease a resignation would be inevitable as for the baroness he was fed up with her particularly because she was forever wanting to give him money but there was another girl he intended showing her to vronsky a marvel exquisite in the strict oriental style genre of the slave rebecca you see he had had a row too with berkoshev and the latter intended sending seconds but of course it would all come to nothing altogether everything was going splendidly and was most jolly and without letting his comrade enter into further details of his position petritsky proceeded to tell him all the interesting news as he listened to familiar stories in the familiar setting of the rooms he had spent the last three years in vronsky felt the delightful sensation of coming back to the insouciant and customary life of peterburg 
 impossible he cried releasing the pedal of the wash basin in which he had been sousing his stalwart red neck impossible he cried at the news that laura had dropped fertinghof and had tied up with mileev and is he as stupid and satisfied as ever well and buzulukov doing 
 oh buzulukov got into a scrape simply lovely cried petritsky you know his passion for balls and he never misses a single one at court he went to a big ball in a new casque have you seen the new casques very good and lighter well standing no do listen 
 i am listening answered vronsky rubbing himself with a rough towel 
 the grand duchess passes by with some ambassador or other and as ill luck would have it their talk veers to the new casques and so the grand duchess wanted to show the new casque to the ambassador just then they catch sight of our dear boy standing there petritsky mimicked him standing with his casque the grand duchess requested him to give her the casque he do so up well they all wink at him and nod and frown give it to her do he still just stands there you can picture it to yourself well this his name tries to take the casque from him he give it up this chap tore it from him and hands it to the grand duchess this is the new casque says the grand duchess she turned the casque over and just picture it bang went a pear and candy out of it two pounds of candy collected all that our dear boy 
 vronsky rolled with laughter and long afterward even when he was talking of other things he would go off into peals of his hearty laughter baring his strong closely set teeth whenever he thought of the casque 
 having learned all the news vronsky with the assistance of his valet got into his uniform and went off to report himself he intended afterward to go to his brother and to betsy and to pay several visits as an entering wedge into that society where he might meet madame karenina as always in peterburg he left home without any intention of returning before very late at night

 book of the promise made to the dead woman 
 chapter vi 
 
 which possibly proves intelligence 
 on the afternoon of that same christmas day a man had walked for rather a long time in the most deserted part of the boulevard de in paris 
 this man had the air of a person who is seeking lodgings and he seemed to halt by preference at the most modest houses on that dilapidated border of the faubourg 
 we shall see further on that this man had in fact hired a chamber in that isolated quarter 
 this man in his attire as in all his person realized the type of what may be called the wretchedness combined with extreme cleanliness 
 this is a very rare mixture which inspires intelligent hearts with that double respect which one feels for the man who is very poor and for the man who is very worthy he wore a very old and very well brushed round hat a coarse coat worn perfectly threadbare of an ochre yellow a color that was not in the least eccentric at that epoch a large waistcoat with pockets of a venerable cut black breeches worn gray at the knee stockings of black worsted and thick shoes with copper buckles he would have been pronounced a preceptor in some good family returned from the emigration 
 he would have been taken for more than sixty years of age from his perfectly white hair his wrinkled brow his livid lips and his countenance where everything breathed depression and weariness of life 
 judging from his firm tread from the singular vigor which stamped all his movements he would have hardly been thought fifty 
 the wrinkles on his brow were well placed and would have disposed in his favor any one who observed him attentively 
 his lip contracted with a strange fold which seemed severe and which was humble 
 there was in the depth of his glance an indescribable melancholy serenity in his left hand he carried a little bundle tied up in a handkerchief in his right he leaned on a sort of a cudgel cut from some hedge this stick had been carefully trimmed and had an air that was not too threatening the most had been made of its knots and it had received a head made from red wax 
 it was a cudgel and it seemed to be a cane 
 there are but few on that boulevard particularly in the winter 
 the man seemed to avoid them rather than to seek them but this without any affectation 
 at that epoch king louis xviii 
 went nearly every day to it was one of his favorite excursions 
 towards two almost invariably the royal carriage and cavalcade was seen to pass at full speed along the boulevard de 
 this served in lieu of a watch or clock to the poor women of the quarter who said it is two there he is returning to the tuileries 
 and some rushed forward and others drew up in line for a passing king always creates a tumult besides the appearance and disappearance of louis xviii 
 produced a certain effect in the streets of paris it was rapid but majestic 
 this impotent king had a taste for a fast gallop as he was not able to walk he wished to run 
 that cripple would gladly have had himself drawn by the lightning 
 he passed pacific and severe in the midst of naked swords 
 his massive couch all covered with gilding with great branches of lilies painted on the panels thundered noisily along 
 there was hardly time to cast a glance upon it 
 in the rear angle on the right there was visible on tufted cushions of white satin a large firm and ruddy face a brow freshly powdered a royal a proud hard crafty eye the smile of an educated man two great epaulets with bullion fringe floating over a bourgeois coat the golden fleece the cross of saint louis the cross of the legion of honor the silver plaque of the a huge belly and a wide blue ribbon it was the king 
 outside of paris he held his hat decked with white ostrich plumes on his knees enwrapped in high english gaiters when he the city he put on his hat and saluted rarely he stared coldly at the people and they returned it in kind when he appeared for the first time in the quarter the whole success which he produced is contained in this remark of an inhabitant of the faubourg to his comrade that big fellow yonder is the government 
 this infallible passage of the king at the same hour was therefore the daily event of the boulevard de 
 the promenader in the yellow coat evidently did not belong in the quarter and probably did not belong in paris for he was ignorant as to this detail 
 when at two the royal carriage surrounded by a squadron of the all covered with silver lace debouched on the boulevard after having made the turn of the salpetriere he appeared surprised and almost alarmed there was no one but himself in this he drew up hastily behind the corner of the wall of an enclosure though this did not prevent m le duc de havre from spying him out 
 m le duc de havre as captain of the guard on duty that day was seated in the carriage opposite the king 
 he said to his majesty yonder is an man 
 members of the police who were clearing the route took equal note of him one of them received an order to follow him 
 but the man plunged into the deserted little streets of the faubourg and as twilight was beginning to fall the agent lost trace of him as is stated in a report addressed that same evening to m le comte minister of state prefect of police 
 when the man in the yellow coat had thrown the agent off his track he redoubled his pace not without turning round many a time to assure himself that he was not being followed 
 at a four that is to say when night was fully come he passed in front of the theatre of the porte where the two convicts was being played that day 
 this poster illuminated by the theatre lanterns struck him for although he was walking rapidly he halted to read it an instant later he was in the blind alley of la planchette and he entered the plat the pewter platter where the office of the coach for lagny was then situated 
 this coach set out at four 
 the horses were harnessed and the travellers summoned by the coachman were hastily climbing the lofty iron ladder of the vehicle 
 the man inquired 
 have you a place 
 only me on the box said the coachman 
 i will take it 
 climb up 
 nevertheless before setting out the coachman cast a glance at the shabby dress at the diminutive size of his bundle and made him pay his fare 
 are you going as far as lagny demanded the coachman 
 yes said the man 
 the traveller paid to lagny 
 they started 
 when they had passed the barrier the coachman tried to enter into conversation but the traveller only replied in monosyllables 
 the coachman took to whistling and swearing at his horses 
 the coachman wrapped himself up in his cloak 
 it was cold the man did not appear to be thinking of that 
 thus they passed gournay and 
 towards six in the evening they reached chelles 
 the coachman drew up in front of the carters inn installed in the ancient buildings of the royal abbey to give his horses a breathing spell 
 i get down here said the man 
 he took his bundle and his cudgel and jumped down from the vehicle 
 an instant later he had disappeared 
 he did not enter the inn 
 when the coach set out for lagny a few minutes later it did not encounter him in the principal street of chelles 
 the coachman turned to the inside travellers 
 there said he is a man who does not belong here for i do not know him 
 he had not the air of owning a sou but he does not consider money he pays to lagny and he goes only as far as chelles it is night all the houses are shut he does not enter the inn and he is not to be found 
 so he has dived through the earth 
 the man had not plunged into the earth but he had gone with great strides through the dark down the principal street of chelles then he had turned to the right before reaching the church into the leading to montfermeil like a person who was acquainted with the country and had been there before 
 he followed this road rapidly 
 at the spot where it is intersected by the ancient road which runs from gagny to lagny he heard people coming 
 he concealed himself precipitately in a ditch and there waited until the were at a distance the precaution was nearly superfluous however for as we have already said it was a very dark december night 
 not more than two or three stars were visible in the sky 
 it is at this point that the ascent of the hill begins 
 the man did not return to the road to montfermeil he struck across the fields to the right and entered the forest with long strides 
 once in the forest he slackened his pace and began a careful examination of all the trees advancing step by step as though seeking and following a mysterious road known to himself alone there came a moment when he appeared to lose himself and he paused in indecision 
 at last he arrived by dint of feeling his way inch by inch at a clearing where there was a great heap of whitish stones he stepped up briskly to these stones and examined them attentively through the mists of night as though he were passing them in review a large tree covered with those excrescences which are the warts of vegetation stood a few paces distant from the pile of stones he went up to this tree and passed his hand over the bark of the trunk as though seeking to recognize and count all the warts 
 opposite this tree which was an ash there was a suffering from a peeling of the bark to which a band of zinc had been nailed by way of dressing 
 he raised himself on tiptoe and touched this band of zinc 
 then he trod about for awhile on the ground comprised in the space between the tree and the heap of stones like a person who is trying to assure himself that the soil has not recently been disturbed 
 that done he took his bearings and resumed his march through the forest 
 it was the man who had just met cosette 
 as he walked through the thicket in the direction of montfermeil he had espied that tiny shadow moving with a groan depositing a burden on the ground then taking it up and setting out again he drew near and perceived that it was a very young child laden with an enormous bucket of water 
 then he approached the child and silently grasped the handle of the bucket

 the man had not plunged into the earth but he had gone with great strides through the dark down the principal street of chelles then he had turned to the right before reaching the church into the leading to montfermeil like a person who was acquainted with the country and had been there before 
 he followed this road rapidly 
 at the spot where it is intersected by the ancient road which runs from gagny to lagny he heard people coming 
 he concealed himself precipitately in a ditch and there waited until the were at a distance the precaution was nearly superfluous however for as we have already said it was a very dark december night 
 not more than two or three stars were visible in the sky 
 it is at this point that the ascent of the hill begins 
 the man did not return to the road to montfermeil he struck across the fields to the right and entered the forest with long strides 
 once in the forest he slackened his pace and began a careful examination of all the trees advancing step by step as though seeking and following a mysterious road known to himself alone there came a moment when he appeared to lose himself and he paused in indecision 
 at last he arrived by dint of feeling his way inch by inch at a clearing where there was a great heap of whitish stones he stepped up briskly to these stones and examined them attentively through the mists of night as though he were passing them in review a large tree covered with those excrescences which are the warts of vegetation stood a few paces distant from the pile of stones he went up to this tree and passed his hand over the bark of the trunk as though seeking to recognize and count all the warts 
 opposite this tree which was an ash there was a suffering from a peeling of the bark to which a band of zinc had been nailed by way of dressing 
 he raised himself on tiptoe and touched this band of zinc 
 then he trod about for awhile on the ground comprised in the space between the tree and the heap of stones like a person who is trying to assure himself that the soil has not recently been disturbed 
 that done he took his bearings and resumed his march through the forest 
 it was the man who had just met cosette 
 as he walked through the thicket in the direction of montfermeil he had espied that tiny shadow moving with a groan depositing a burden on the ground then taking it up and setting out again he drew near and perceived that it was a very young child laden with an enormous bucket of water 
 then he approached the child and silently grasped the handle of the bucket

 chapter xvi 
 
 in april the troops were enlivened by news of the arrival but rostov had no chance of being present at the review he held at bartenstein as the pavlograds were at the outposts far beyond that place 
 they were bivouacking denisov and rostov were living in an earth hut dug out for them by the soldiers and roofed with branches and turf the hut was made in the following manner which had then come into vogue a trench was dug three and a half feet wide four feet eight inches deep and eight feet long at one end of the trench steps were cut out and these formed the entrance and vestibule the trench itself was the room in which the lucky ones such as the squadron commander had a board lying on piles at the end opposite the entrance to serve as a table on each side of the trench the earth was cut out to a breadth of about two and a half feet and this did duty for bedsteads and couches the roof was so constructed that one could stand up in the middle of the trench and could even sit up on the beds if one drew close to the table denisov who was living luxuriously because the soldiers of his squadron liked him had also a board in the roof at the farther end with a piece of broken but mended glass in it for a window when it was very cold embers from the soldiers campfire were placed on a bent sheet of iron on the steps in the reception room as denisov called that part of the hut and it was then so warm that the officers of whom there were always some with denisov and rostov sat in their shirt sleeves 
 in april rostov was on orderly duty one morning between seven and eight returning after a sleepless night he sent for embers changed his underclothes said his prayers drank tea got warm then tidied up the things on the table and in his own corner and his face glowing from exposure to the wind and with nothing on but his shirt lay down on his back putting his arms under his head he was pleasantly considering the probability of being promoted in a few days for his last reconnoitering expedition and was awaiting denisov who had gone out somewhere and with whom he wanted a talk 
 suddenly he heard denisov shouting in a vibrating voice behind the hut evidently much excited rostov moved to the window to see whom he was speaking to and saw the quartermaster topcheenko 
 i ordered you not to let them that mashka woot stuff denisov was shouting and i saw with my own eyes how lazarchuk bwought some fwom the fields 
 i have given the order again and again your honor but they obey answered the quartermaster 
 rostov lay down again on his bed and thought complacently let him fuss and bustle now my done and lying down capitally he could hear that lavrushka that sly bold orderly of was talking as well as the quartermaster lavrushka was saying something about loaded wagons biscuits and oxen he had seen when he had gone out for provisions 
 then voice was heard shouting farther and farther away saddle second platoon 
 where are they off to now thought rostov 
 five minutes later denisov came into the hut climbed with muddy boots on the bed lit his pipe furiously scattered his things about took his leaded whip buckled on his saber and went out again in answer to inquiry where he was going he answered vaguely and crossly that he had some business 
 let god and our gweat monarch judge me afterwards said denisov going out and rostov heard the hoofs of several horses splashing through the mud he did not even trouble to find out where denisov had gone having got warm in his corner he fell asleep and did not leave the hut till toward evening denisov had not yet returned the weather had cleared up and near the next hut two officers and a cadet were playing svayka laughing as they threw their missiles which buried themselves in the soft mud rostov joined them in the middle of the game the officers saw some wagons approaching with fifteen hussars on their skinny horses behind them the wagons escorted by the hussars drew up to the picket ropes and a crowd of hussars surrounded them 
 there now denisov has been worrying said rostov and here are the provisions 
 so they are said the officers the soldiers be glad 
 a little behind the hussars came denisov accompanied by two infantry officers with whom he was talking 
 rostov went to meet them 
 i warn you captain one of the officers a short thin man evidently very angry was saying 
 i told you i give them up replied denisov 
 you will answer for it captain it is mutiny seizing the transport of own army our men have had nothing to eat for two days 
 and mine have had nothing for two weeks said denisov 
 it is robbery answer for it sir said the infantry officer raising his voice 
 now what are you pestewing me for cried denisov suddenly losing his temper i shall answer for it and not you and better not buzz about here till you get hurt be off go he shouted at the officers 
 very well then shouted the little officer undaunted and not riding away if you are determined to rob 
 go to the devil quick while safe and sound and denisov turned his horse on the officer 
 very well very well muttered the officer threateningly and turning his horse he trotted away jolting in his saddle 
 a dog astwide a fence a weal dog astwide a fence shouted denisov after him the most insulting expression a cavalryman can address to a mounted infantryman and riding up to rostov he burst out laughing 
 taken twansports from the infantwy by force he said after all let our men starve 
 the wagons that had reached the hussars had been consigned to an infantry regiment but learning from lavrushka that the transport was unescorted denisov with his hussars had seized it by force the soldiers had biscuits dealt out to them freely and they even shared them with the other squadrons 
 the next day the regimental commander sent for denisov and holding his fingers spread out before his eyes said 
 this is how i look at this affair i know nothing about it and begin proceedings but i advise you to ride over to the staff and settle the business there in the commissariat department and if possible sign a receipt for such and such stores received if not as the demand was booked against an infantry regiment there will be a row and the affair may end badly 
 from the regimental denisov rode straight to the staff with a sincere desire to act on this advice in the evening he came back to his dugout in a state such as rostov had never yet seen him in denisov could not speak and gasped for breath when rostov asked what was the matter he only uttered some incoherent oaths and threats in a hoarse feeble voice 
 alarmed at condition rostov suggested that he should undress drink some water and send for the doctor 
 twy me for wobbewy oh some more water let them twy me but always thwash scoundwels and tell the empewo ice he muttered 
 the regimental doctor when he came said it was absolutely necessary to bleed denisov a deep saucer of black blood was taken from his hairy arm and only then was he able to relate what had happened to him 
 i get there began denisov now then your quarters they were pointed out please to wait widden twenty miles and have duties to attend to and no time to wait announce me vewy well so out comes their head chief also took it into his head to lecture me wobbewy wobbewy i say is not done by man who seizes pwovisions to feed his soldiers but by him who takes them to fill his own pockets will you please be silent vewy good then he says go and give a weceipt to the commissioner but your affair will be passed on to headquarters i go to the commissioner i enter and at the table who do you think no but wait a bit who is it starving us shouted denisov hitting the table with the fist of his newly bled arm so violently that the table nearly broke down and the tumblers on it jumped about telyanin what so you starving us to death is it take this and this and i hit him so pat stwaight on his snout ah what a what and i fwashing him well had a bit of fun i can tell you cried denisov gleeful and yet angry his showing under his black mustache have killed him if they taken him away 
 but what are you shouting for calm yourself said rostov set your arm bleeding afresh wait we must tie it up again 
 denisov was bandaged up again and put to bed next day he woke calm and cheerful 
 but at noon the adjutant of the regiment came into and dugout with a grave and serious face and regretfully showed them a paper addressed to major denisov from the regimental commander in which inquiries were made about occurrence the adjutant told them that the affair was likely to take a very bad turn that a had been appointed and that in view of the severity with which marauding and insubordination were now regarded degradation to the ranks would be the best that could be hoped for 
 the case as represented by the offended parties was that after seizing the transports major denisov being drunk went to the chief quartermaster and without any provocation called him a thief threatened to strike him and on being led out had rushed into the office and given two officials a thrashing and dislocated the arm of one of them 
 in answer to renewed questions denisov said laughing that he thought he remembered that some other fellow had got mixed up in it but that it was all nonsense and rubbish and he did not in the least fear any kind of trial and that if those scoundrels dared attack him he would give them an answer that they would not easily forget 
 denisov spoke contemptuously of the whole matter but rostov knew him too well not to detect that while hiding it from others at heart he feared a and was worried over the affair which was evidently taking a bad turn every day letters of inquiry and notices from the court arrived and on the first of may denisov was ordered to hand the squadron over to the next in seniority and appear before the staff of his division to explain his violence at the commissariat office on the previous day platov reconnoitered with two cossack regiments and two squadrons of hussars denisov as was his wont rode out in front of the outposts parading his courage a bullet fired by a french sharpshooter hit him in the fleshy part of his leg perhaps at another time denisov would not have left the regiment for so slight a wound but now he took advantage of it to excuse himself from appearing at the staff and went into hospital

 cosette side by side with the stranger in the dark 
 cosette as we have said was not frightened 
 the man accosted her 
 he spoke in a voice that was grave and almost bass 
 my child what you are carrying is very heavy for you 
 cosette raised her head and replied 
 yes sir

 cosette let go of the the man walked along beside her 
 it really is very heavy he muttered between his teeth then he added 
 how old are you little one 
 eight sir 
 and have you come from far like this 
 from the spring in the forest 
 are you going far 
 a good quarter of an walk from here 
 the man said nothing for a moment then he remarked abruptly 
 so you have no mother 
 i know answered the child 
 before the man had time to speak again she added 
 i think so 
 other people have mothers 
 i have none 
 and after a silence she went on 
 i think that i never had any 
 the man halted he set the bucket on the ground bent down and placed both hands on the shoulders making an effort to look at her and to see her face in the dark 
 thin and sickly face was vaguely outlined by the livid light in the sky 
 what is your name said the man 
 cosette 
 the man seemed to have received an electric shock 
 he looked at her once more then he removed his hands from shoulders seized the bucket and set out again 
 after a moment he inquired 
 where do you live little one 
 at montfermeil if you know where that is 
 that is where we are going 
 yes sir 
 he paused then began again 
 who sent you at such an hour to get water in the forest 
 it was madame thenardier 
 the man resumed in a voice which he strove to render indifferent but in which there was nevertheless a singular tremor 
 what does your madame thenardier do 
 she is my mistress said the child 
 she keeps the inn 
 the inn said the man 
 well i am going to lodge there show me the way 
 we are on the way there said the child 
 the man walked tolerably fast 
 cosette followed him without difficulty she no longer felt any fatigue 
 from time to time she raised her eyes towards the man with a sort of tranquillity and an indescribable confidence 
 she had never been taught to turn to providence and to pray nevertheless she felt within her something which resembled hope and joy and which mounted towards heaven 
 several minutes elapsed 
 the man resumed 
 is there no servant in madame house 
 no sir 
 are you alone there 
 yes sir 
 another pause ensued 
 cosette lifted up her voice 
 that is to say there are two little girls 
 what little girls 
 ponine and zelma 
 this was the way the child simplified the romantic names so dear to the female thenardier 
 who are ponine and zelma 
 they are madame young ladies her daughters as you would say 
 and what do those girls do 
 oh said the child they have beautiful dolls things with gold in them all full of affairs 
 they play they amuse themselves 
 all day long 
 yes sir 
 and you 
 i 
 i work 
 all day long 
 the child raised her great eyes in which hung a tear which was not visible because of the darkness and replied gently 
 yes sir 
 after an interval of silence she went on 
 sometimes when i have finished my work and they let me i amuse myself too 
 how do you amuse yourself 
 in the best way i can 
 they let me alone but i have not many playthings 
 ponine and zelma will not let me play with their dolls 
 i have only a little lead sword no longer than that 
 the child held up her tiny finger 
 and it will not cut 
 yes sir said the child it cuts salad and the heads of flies 
 they reached the village 
 cosette guided the stranger through the streets 
 they passed the bakeshop but cosette did not think of the bread which she had been ordered to fetch 
 the man had ceased to ply her with questions and now preserved a gloomy silence 
 when they had left the church behind them the man on perceiving all the booths asked cosette 
 so there is a fair going on here 
 no sir it is christmas 
 as they approached the tavern cosette timidly touched his arm 
 monsieur 
 what my child 
 we are quite near the house 
 well 
 will you let me take my bucket now 
 why 
 if madame sees that some one has carried it for me she will beat me 
 the man handed her the bucket 
 an instant later they were at the tavern door

 book five 
 chapter xvii 
 
 in june the battle of friedland was fought in which the pavlograds did not take part and after that an armistice was proclaimed rostov who felt his absence very much having no news of him since he left and feeling very anxious about his wound and the progress of his affairs took advantage of the armistice to get leave to visit denisov in hospital 
 the hospital was in a small prussian town that had been twice devastated by russian and french troops because it was summer when it is so beautiful out in the fields the little town presented a particularly dismal appearance with its broken roofs and fences its foul streets tattered inhabitants and the sick and drunken soldiers wandering about 
 the hospital was in a brick building with some of the window frames and panes broken and a courtyard surrounded by the remains of a wooden fence that had been pulled to pieces several bandaged soldiers with pale swollen faces were sitting or walking about in the sunshine in the yard 
 directly rostov entered the door he was enveloped by a smell of putrefaction and hospital air on the stairs he met a russian army doctor smoking a cigar the doctor was followed by a russian assistant 
 i tear myself to pieces the doctor was saying come to makar alexeevich in the evening i shall be there 
 the assistant asked some further questions 
 oh do the best you can it all the same the doctor noticed rostov coming upstairs 
 what do you want sir said the doctor what do you want the bullets having spared you do you want to try typhus this is a pesthouse sir 
 how so asked rostov 
 typhus sir death to go in only we two makeev and i he pointed to the assistant keep on here some five of us doctors have died in this place when a new one comes he is done for in a week said the doctor with evident satisfaction prussian doctors have been invited here but our allies like it at all 
 rostov explained that he wanted to see major denisov of the hussars who was wounded 
 i know i tell you sir only think i am alone in charge of three hospitals with more than four hundred patients well that the charitable prussian ladies send us two pounds of coffee and some lint each month or we should be lost he laughed four hundred sir and always sending me fresh ones there are four hundred eh he asked turning to the assistant 
 the assistant looked fagged out he was evidently vexed and impatient for the talkative doctor to go 
 major denisov rostov said again he was wounded at molliten 
 dead i fancy eh makeev queried the doctor in a tone of indifference 
 the assistant however did not confirm the words 
 is he tall and with reddish hair asked the doctor 
 rostov described appearance 
 there was one like that said the doctor as if pleased that one is dead i fancy however look up our list we had a list have you got it makeev 
 makar alexeevich has the list answered the assistant but if step into the officers wards see for yourself he added turning to rostov 
 ah better not go sir said the doctor or you may have to stay here yourself 
 but rostov bowed himself away from the doctor and asked the assistant to show him the way 
 only blame me the doctor shouted up after him 
 rostov and the assistant went into the dark corridor the smell was so strong there that rostov held his nose and had to pause and collect his strength before he could go on a door opened to the right and an emaciated sallow man on crutches barefoot and in underclothing limped out and leaning against the doorpost looked with glittering envious eyes at those who were passing glancing in at the door rostov saw that the sick and wounded were lying on the floor on straw and overcoats 
 may i go in and look 
 what is there to see said the assistant 
 but just because the assistant evidently did not want him to go in rostov entered the soldiers ward the foul air to which he had already begun to get used in the corridor was still stronger here it was a little different more pungent and one felt that this was where it originated 
 in the long room brightly lit up by the sun through the large windows the sick and wounded lay in two rows with their heads to the walls and leaving a passage in the middle most of them were unconscious and paid no attention to the newcomers those who were conscious raised themselves or lifted their thin yellow faces and all looked intently at rostov with the same expression of hope of relief reproach and envy of health rostov went to the middle of the room and looking through the open doors into the two adjoining rooms saw the same thing there he stood still looking silently around he had not at all expected such a sight just before him almost across the middle of the passage on the bare floor lay a sick man probably a cossack to judge by the cut of his hair the man lay on his back his huge arms and legs outstretched his face was purple his eyes were rolled back so that only the whites were seen and on his bare legs and arms which were still red the veins stood out like cords he was knocking the back of his head against the floor hoarsely uttering some word which he kept repeating rostov listened and made out the word it was drink drink a drink rostov glanced round looking for someone who would put this man back in his place and bring him water 
 who looks after the sick here he asked the assistant 
 just then a commissariat soldier a hospital orderly came in from the next room marching stiffly and drew up in front of rostov 
 good day your honor he shouted rolling his eyes at rostov and evidently mistaking him for one of the hospital authorities 
 get him to his place and give him some water said rostov pointing to the cossack 
 yes your honor the soldier replied complacently and rolling his eyes more than ever he drew himself up still straighter but did not move 
 no impossible to do anything here thought rostov lowering his eyes and he was going out but became aware of an intense look fixed on him on his right and he turned close to the corner on an overcoat sat an old unshaven soldier as thin as a skeleton with a stern sallow face and eyes intently fixed on rostov the neighbor on one side whispered something to him pointing at rostov who noticed that the old man wanted to speak to him he drew nearer and saw that the old man had only one leg bent under him the other had been amputated above the knee his neighbor on the other side who lay motionless some distance from him with his head thrown back was a young soldier with a snub nose his pale waxen face was still freckled and his eyes were rolled back rostov looked at the young soldier and a cold chill ran down his back 
 why this one seems he began turning to the assistant 
 and how been begging your honor said the old soldier his jaw quivering been dead since morning after all men not dogs 
 send someone at once he shall be taken away taken away at once said the assistant hurriedly let us go your honor 
 yes yes let us go said rostov hastily and lowering his eyes and shrinking he tried to pass unnoticed between the rows of reproachful envious eyes that were fixed upon him and went out of the room

 book five 
 chapter xvii 
 
 in june the battle of friedland was fought in which the pavlograds did not take part and after that an armistice was proclaimed rostov who felt his absence very much having no news of him since he left and feeling very anxious about his wound and the progress of his affairs took advantage of the armistice to get leave to visit denisov in hospital 
 the hospital was in a small prussian town that had been twice devastated by russian and french troops because it was summer when it is so beautiful out in the fields the little town presented a particularly dismal appearance with its broken roofs and fences its foul streets tattered inhabitants and the sick and drunken soldiers wandering about 
 the hospital was in a brick building with some of the window frames and panes broken and a courtyard surrounded by the remains of a wooden fence that had been pulled to pieces several bandaged soldiers with pale swollen faces were sitting or walking about in the sunshine in the yard 
 directly rostov entered the door he was enveloped by a smell of putrefaction and hospital air on the stairs he met a russian army doctor smoking a cigar the doctor was followed by a russian assistant 
 i tear myself to pieces the doctor was saying come to makar alexeevich in the evening i shall be there 
 the assistant asked some further questions 
 oh do the best you can it all the same the doctor noticed rostov coming upstairs 
 what do you want sir said the doctor what do you want the bullets having spared you do you want to try typhus this is a pesthouse sir 
 how so asked rostov 
 typhus sir death to go in only we two makeev and i he pointed to the assistant keep on here some five of us doctors have died in this place when a new one comes he is done for in a week said the doctor with evident satisfaction prussian doctors have been invited here but our allies like it at all 
 rostov explained that he wanted to see major denisov of the hussars who was wounded 
 i know i tell you sir only think i am alone in charge of three hospitals with more than four hundred patients well that the charitable prussian ladies send us two pounds of coffee and some lint each month or we should be lost he laughed four hundred sir and always sending me fresh ones there are four hundred eh he asked turning to the assistant 
 the assistant looked fagged out he was evidently vexed and impatient for the talkative doctor to go 
 major denisov rostov said again he was wounded at molliten 
 dead i fancy eh makeev queried the doctor in a tone of indifference

 book of the promise made to the dead woman 
 chapter viii 
 
 the unpleasantness of receiving into house a poor man who may be a rich man 
 cosette could not refrain from casting a sidelong glance at the big doll which was still displayed at the then she knocked the door opened 
 the thenardier appeared with a candle in her hand 
 ah so you you little wretch good mercy but taken your time 
 the hussy has been amusing herself 
 madame said cosette trembling all over a gentleman who wants a lodging 
 the thenardier speedily replaced her gruff air by her amiable grimace a change of aspect common to and eagerly sought the with her eyes 
 this is the gentleman said she 
 yes madame replied the man raising his hand to his hat 
 wealthy travellers are not so polite 
 this gesture and an inspection of the costume and baggage which the thenardier passed in review with one glance caused the amiable grimace to vanish and the gruff mien to reappear 
 she resumed dryly 
 enter my good man 
 the good man entered 
 the thenardier cast a second glance at him paid particular attention to his which was absolutely threadbare and to his hat which was a little battered and tossing her head wrinkling her nose and screwing up her eyes she consulted her husband who was still drinking with the carters the husband replied by that imperceptible movement of the forefinger which backed up by an inflation of the lips signifies in such cases a regular beggar 
 thereupon the thenardier exclaimed 
 ah see here my good man i am very sorry but i have no room left 
 put me where you like said the man in the attic in the stable i will pay as though i occupied a room 
 forty sous 
 forty sous agreed 
 very well then 
 forty sous said a carter in a low tone to the thenardier woman why the charge is only twenty sous 
 it is forty in his case retorted the thenardier in the same tone i lodge poor folks for less 
 true added her husband gently it ruins a house to have such people in it 
 in the meantime the man laying his bundle and his cudgel on a bench had seated himself at a table on which cosette made haste to place a bottle of wine and a glass 
 the merchant who had demanded the bucket of water took it to his horse himself cosette resumed her place under the kitchen table and her knitting 
 the man who had barely moistened his lips in the wine which he had poured out for himself observed the child with peculiar attention 
 cosette was ugly 
 if she had been happy she might have been pretty we have already given a sketch of that sombre little figure cosette was thin and pale she was nearly eight years old but she seemed to be hardly six 
 her large eyes sunken in a sort of shadow were almost put out with weeping 
 the corners of her mouth had that curve of habitual anguish which is seen in condemned persons and desperately sick people 
 her hands were as her mother had divined ruined with chilblains 
 the fire which illuminated her at that moment brought into relief all the angles of her bones and rendered her thinness frightfully apparent 
 as she was always shivering she had acquired the habit of pressing her knees one against the other her entire clothing was but a rag which would have inspired pity in summer and which inspired horror in winter 
 all she had on was linen not a scrap of woollen 
 her skin was visible here and there and everywhere black and blue spots could be descried which marked the places where the thenardier woman had touched her her naked legs were thin and red 
 the hollows in her neck were enough to make one weep 
 this whole person her mien her attitude the sound of her voice the intervals which she allowed to elapse between one word and the next her glance her silence her slightest gesture expressed and betrayed one sole 
 fear was diffused all over her she was covered with it so to speak fear drew her elbows close to her hips withdrew her heels under her petticoat made her occupy as little space as possible allowed her only the breath that was absolutely necessary and had become what might be called the habit of her body admitting of no possible variation except an increase 
 in the depths of her eyes there was an astonished nook where terror lurked 
 her fear was such that on her arrival wet as she was cosette did not dare to approach the fire and dry herself but sat silently down to her work again 
 the expression in the glance of that child of eight years was habitually so gloomy and at times so tragic that it seemed at certain moments as though she were on the verge of becoming an idiot or a demon 
 as we have stated she had never known what it is to pray she had never set foot in a church 
 have i the time said the thenardier 
 the man in the yellow coat never took his eyes from cosette 
 all at once the thenardier exclaimed 
 by the way that bread 
 cosette according to her custom whenever the thenardier uplifted her voice emerged with great haste from beneath the table 
 she had completely forgotten the bread 
 she had recourse to the expedient of children who live in a constant state of fear she lied 
 madame the shop was shut 
 you should have knocked 
 i did knock madame 
 well 
 he did not open the door 
 find out whether that is true said the thenardier and if you are telling me a lie lead you a pretty dance in the meantime give me back my piece 
 cosette plunged her hand into the pocket of her apron and turned green the piece was not there 
 ah come now said madame thenardier did you hear me 
 cosette turned her pocket inside out there was nothing in it what could have become of that money 
 the unhappy little creature could not find a word to say 
 she was petrified 
 have you lost that piece screamed the thenardier hoarsely or do you want to rob me of it 
 at the same time she stretched out her arm towards the which hung on a nail in the 
 this formidable gesture restored to cosette sufficient strength to shriek 
 mercy madame madame 
 i will not do so any more 
 the thenardier took down the whip 
 in the meantime the man in the yellow coat had been fumbling in the fob of his waistcoat without any one having noticed his movements besides the other travellers were drinking or playing cards and were not paying attention to anything 
 cosette contracted herself into a ball with anguish within the angle of the chimney endeavoring to gather up and conceal her poor limbs 
 the thenardier raised her arm 
 pardon me madame said the man but just now i caught sight of something which had fallen from this little apron pocket and rolled aside 
 perhaps this is it 
 at the same time he bent down and seemed to be searching on the floor for a moment 
 exactly here it is he went on straightening himself up 
 and he held out a silver coin to the thenardier 
 yes it said she 
 it was not it for it was a piece but the thenardier found it to her advantage 
 she put the coin in her pocket and confined herself to casting a fierce glance at the child accompanied with the remark let this ever happen again 
 cosette returned to what the thenardier called her kennel and her large eyes which were riveted on the traveller began to take on an expression such as they had never worn before thus far it was only an innocent amazement but a sort of stupefied confidence was mingled with it 
 by the way would you like some supper the thenardier inquired of the traveller 
 he made no reply 
 he appeared to be absorbed in thought 
 what sort of a man is that she muttered between her teeth some frightfully poor wretch 
 he a sou to pay for a supper 
 will he even pay me for his lodging 
 very lucky all the same that it did not occur to him to steal the money that was on the floor 
 in the meantime a door had opened and eponine and azelma entered 
 they were two really pretty little girls more bourgeois than peasant in looks and very charming the one with shining chestnut tresses the other with long black braids hanging down her back both vivacious neat plump rosy and healthy and a delight to the eye 
 they were warmly clad but with so much maternal art that the thickness of the stuffs did not detract from the coquetry of arrangement 
 there was a hint of winter though the springtime was not wholly effaced 
 light emanated from these two little beings besides this they were on the throne 
 in their toilettes in their gayety in the noise which they made there was sovereignty when they entered the thenardier said to them in a grumbling tone which was full of adoration ah there you are you children 
 then drawing them one after the other to her knees smoothing their hair tying their ribbons afresh and then releasing them with that gentle manner of shaking off which is peculiar to mothers she exclaimed what frights they are 
 they went and seated themselves in the they had a doll which they turned over and over on their knees with all sorts of joyous chatter 
 from time to time cosette raised her eyes from her knitting and watched their play with a melancholy air 
 eponine and azelma did not look at cosette 
 she was the same as a dog to them 
 these three little girls did not yet reckon up four and twenty years between them but they already represented the whole society of man envy on the one side disdain on the other 
 the doll of the thenardier sisters was very much faded very old and much broken but it seemed none the less admirable to cosette who had never had a doll in her life a real doll to make use of the expression which all children will understand 
 all at once the thenardier who had been going back and forth in the room perceived that mind was distracted and that instead of working she was paying attention to the little ones at their play 
 ah 
 caught you at it she cried 
 so the way you work make you work to the tune of the whip that i will 
 the stranger turned to the thenardier without quitting his chair 
 bah madame he said with an almost timid air let her play 
 such a wish expressed by a traveller who had eaten a slice of mutton and had drunk a couple of bottles of wine with his supper and who had not the air of being frightfully poor would have been equivalent to an order 
 but that a man with such a hat should permit himself such a desire and that a man with such a coat should permit himself to have a will was something which madame thenardier did not intend to tolerate 
 she retorted with acrimony 
 she must work since she eats 
 i feed her to do nothing 
 what is she making went on the stranger in a gentle voice which contrasted strangely with his beggarly garments and his shoulders 
 the thenardier deigned to reply 
 stockings if you please 
 stockings for my little girls who have none so to speak and who are absolutely barefoot just now 
 the man looked at poor little red feet and continued 
 when will she have finished this pair of stockings 
 she has at least three or four good days work on them still the lazy creature 
 and how much will that pair of stockings be worth when she has finished them 
 the thenardier cast a glance of disdain on him 
 thirty sous at least 
 will you sell them for five francs went on the man 
 good heavens exclaimed a carter who was listening with a loud laugh five francs the deuce i should think so five balls 
 thenardier thought it time to strike in 
 yes sir if such is your fancy you will be allowed to have that pair of stockings for five francs 
 we can refuse nothing to travellers 
 you must pay on the spot said the thenardier in her curt and peremptory fashion 
 i will buy that pair of stockings replied the man and he added drawing a piece from his pocket and laying it on the table i will pay for them 
 then he turned to cosette 
 now i own your work play my child 
 the carter was so much touched by the piece that he abandoned his glass and hastened up 
 but true he cried examining it 
 a real hind wheel and not counterfeit 
 thenardier approached and silently put the coin in his pocket 
 the thenardier had no reply to make 
 she bit her lips and her face assumed an expression of hatred 
 in the meantime cosette was trembling 
 she ventured to ask 
 is it true madame 
 may i play 
 play said the thenardier in a terrible voice 
 thanks madame said cosette 
 and while her mouth thanked the thenardier her whole little soul thanked the traveller 
 thenardier had resumed his drinking his wife whispered in his ear 
 who can this yellow man be 
 i have seen millionaires with coats like that replied thenardier in a sovereign manner 
 cosette had dropped her knitting but had not left her seat cosette always moved as little as possible 
 she picked up some old rags and her little lead sword from a box behind her 
 eponine and azelma paid no attention to what was going on they had just executed a very important operation they had just got hold of the cat 
 they had thrown their doll on the ground and eponine who was the elder was swathing the little cat in spite of its mewing and its contortions in a quantity of clothes and red and blue scraps 
 while performing this serious and difficult work she was saying to her sister in that sweet and adorable language of children whose grace like the splendor of the wing vanishes when one essays to fix it fast 
 you see sister this doll is more amusing than the other she twists she cries she is warm 
 see sister let us play with her she shall be my little girl 
 i will be a lady 
 i will come to see you and you shall look at her 
 gradually you will perceive her whiskers and that will surprise you 
 and then you will see her ears and then you will see her tail and it will amaze you and you will say to me ah mon dieu and i will say to you yes madame it is my little girl 
 little girls are made like that just at present 
 azelma listened admiringly to eponine 
 in the meantime the drinkers had begun to sing an obscene song and to laugh at it until the ceiling shook 
 thenardier accompanied and encouraged them 
 as birds make nests out of everything so children make a doll out of anything which comes to hand 
 while eponine and azelma were bundling up the cat cosette on her side had dressed up her sword that done she laid it in her arms and sang to it softly to lull it to sleep 
 the doll is one of the most imperious needs and at the same time one of the most charming instincts of feminine childhood to care for to clothe to deck to dress to undress to redress to teach scold a little to rock to dandle to lull to sleep to imagine that something is some lies the whole future 
 while dreaming and chattering making tiny outfits and baby clothes while sewing little gowns and corsages and bodices the child grows into a young girl the young girl into a big girl the big girl into a woman 
 the first child is the continuation of the last doll 
 a little girl without a doll is almost as unhappy and quite as impossible as a woman without children 
 so cosette had made herself a doll out of the sword 
 madame thenardier approached the yellow man my husband is right she thought perhaps it is m laffitte there are such queer rich men 
 she came and set her elbows on the table 
 monsieur said she 
 at this word monsieur the man turned up to that time the thenardier had addressed him only as brave homme or bonhomme 
 you see sir she pursued assuming a sweetish air that was even more repulsive to behold than her fierce mien i am willing that the child should play i do not oppose it but it is good for once because you are generous 
 you see she has nothing she must needs work 
 then this child is not yours demanded the man 
 oh mon dieu no sir she is a little beggar whom we have taken in through charity a sort of imbecile child 
 she must have water on the brain she has a large head as you see 
 we do what we can for her for we are not rich we have written in vain to her native place and have received no reply these six months it must be that her mother is dead 
 ah said the man and fell into his revery once more 
 her mother amount to much added the thenardier she abandoned her child 
 during the whole of this conversation cosette as though warned by some instinct that she was under discussion had not taken her eyes from the face she listened vaguely she caught a few words here and there 
 meanwhile the drinkers all intoxicated were repeating their unclean refrain with redoubled gayety it was a highly spiced and wanton song in which the virgin and the infant jesus were introduced 
 the thenardier went off to take part in the shouts of laughter 
 cosette from her post under the table gazed at the fire which was reflected from her fixed eyes 
 she had begun to rock the sort of baby which she had made and as she rocked it she sang in a low voice my mother is dead my mother is dead my mother is dead 
 on being urged afresh by the hostess the yellow man the millionaire consented at last to take supper 
 what does monsieur wish 
 bread and cheese said the man 
 decidedly he is a beggar thought madame thenardier 
 the drunken men were still singing their song and the child under the table was singing hers 
 all at once cosette paused she had just turned round and caught sight of the little thenardiers doll which they had abandoned for the cat and had left on the floor a few paces from the kitchen table 
 then she dropped the swaddled sword which only half met her needs and cast her eyes slowly round the room 
 madame thenardier was whispering to her husband and counting over some money ponine and zelma were playing with the cat the travellers were eating or drinking or singing not a glance was fixed on her she had not a moment to lose she crept out from under the table on her hands and knees made sure once more that no one was watching her then she slipped quickly up to the doll and seized it 
 an instant later she was in her place again seated motionless and only turned so as to cast a shadow on the doll which she held in her arms the happiness of playing with a doll was so rare for her that it contained all the violence of voluptuousness 
 no one had seen her except the traveller who was slowly devouring his meagre supper 
 this joy lasted about a quarter of an hour 
 but with all the precautions that cosette had taken she did not perceive that one of the legs stuck out and that the fire on the hearth lighted it up very vividly 
 that pink and shining foot projecting from the shadow suddenly struck the eye of azelma who said to eponine look sister 
 the two little girls paused in stupefaction cosette had dared to take their doll 
 eponine rose and without releasing the cat she ran to her mother and began to tug at her skirt 
 let me alone said her mother what do you want 
 mother said the child look there 
 and she pointed to cosette 
 cosette absorbed in the ecstasies of possession no longer saw or heard anything 
 madame countenance assumed that peculiar expression which is composed of the terrible mingled with the trifles of life and which has caused this style of woman to be named megaeras 
 on this occasion wounded pride exasperated her wrath still further cosette had overstepped all bounds cosette had laid violent hands on the doll belonging to these young ladies 
 a czarina who should see a muzhik trying on her imperial blue ribbon would wear no other face 
 she shrieked in a voice rendered hoarse with indignation 
 cosette 
 cosette started as though the earth had trembled beneath her she turned round 
 cosette repeated the thenardier 
 cosette took the doll and laid it gently on the floor with a sort of veneration mingled with despair then without taking her eyes from it she clasped her hands and what is terrible to relate of a child of that age she wrung them one of the emotions of the day neither the trip to the forest nor the weight of the bucket of water nor the loss of the money nor the sight of the whip nor even the sad words which she had heard madame thenardier utter had been able to wring this from her she wept she burst out sobbing 
 meanwhile the traveller had risen to his feet 
 what is the matter he said to the thenardier 
 you see said the thenardier pointing to the corpus delicti which lay at feet 
 well what of it resumed the man 
 that beggar replied the thenardier has permitted herself to touch the doll 
 all this noise for that said the man well what if she did play with that doll 
 she touched it with her dirty hands pursued the thenardier with her frightful hands 
 here cosette redoubled her sobs 
 will you stop your noise screamed the thenardier 
 the man went straight to the street door opened it and stepped out 
 as soon as he had gone the thenardier profited by his absence to give cosette a hearty kick under the table which made the child utter loud cries 
 the door opened again the man he carried in both hands the fabulous doll which we have mentioned and which all the village brats had been staring at ever since the morning and he set it upright in front of cosette saying 
 
 here this is for you 
 it must be supposed that in the course of the hour and more which he had spent there he had taken confused notice through his revery of that toy shop lighted up by and candles so splendidly that it was visible like an illumination through the window of the 
 cosette raised her eyes she gazed at the man approaching her with that doll as she might have gazed at the sun she heard the unprecedented words it is for you she stared at him she stared at the doll then she slowly retreated and hid herself at the extreme end under the table in a corner of the wall 
 she no longer cried she no longer wept she had the appearance of no longer daring to breathe 
 the thenardier eponine and azelma were like statues also the very drinkers had paused a solemn silence reigned through the whole room 
 madame thenardier petrified and mute recommenced her conjectures who is that old fellow 
 is he a poor man 
 is he a millionaire perhaps he is both that is to say a thief 
 the face of the male thenardier presented that expressive fold which accentuates the human countenance whenever the dominant instinct appears there in all its bestial force 
 the stared alternately at the doll and at the traveller he seemed to be scenting out the man as he would have scented out a bag of money this did not last longer than the space of a flash of lightning he stepped up to his wife and said to her in a low voice 
 that machine costs at least thirty francs 
 no nonsense down on your belly before that man 
 gross natures have this in common with naive natures that they possess no transition state 
 well cosette said the thenardier in a voice that strove to be sweet and which was composed of the bitter honey of malicious women you going to take your doll 
 cosette ventured to emerge from her hole 
 the gentleman has given you a doll my little cosette said thenardier with a caressing air 
 take it it is yours 
 cosette gazed at the marvellous doll in a sort of terror her face was still flooded with tears but her eyes began to fill like the sky at daybreak with strange beams of joy 
 what she felt at that moment was a little like what she would have felt if she had been abruptly told little one you are the queen of france 
 it seemed to her that if she touched that doll lightning would dart from it 
 this was true up to a certain point for she said to herself that the thenardier would scold and beat her 
 nevertheless the attraction carried the day 
 she ended by drawing near and murmuring timidly as she turned towards madame thenardier 
 may i madame 
 no words can render that air at once despairing terrified and ecstatic 
 pardi cried the thenardier it is yours 
 the gentleman has given it to you 
 truly sir said cosette 
 is it true 
 is the lady mine 
 the eyes seemed to be full of tears 
 he appeared to have reached that point of emotion where a man does not speak for fear lest he should weep 
 he nodded to cosette and placed the hand in her tiny hand 
 cosette hastily withdrew her hand as though that of the lady scorched her and began to stare at the floor 
 we are forced to add that at that moment she stuck out her tongue immoderately all at once she wheeled round and seized the doll in a transport 
 i shall call her catherine she said 
 it was an odd moment when rags met and clasped the ribbons and fresh pink muslins of the doll 
 madame she resumed may i put her on a chair 
 yes my child replied the thenardier 
 it was now the turn of eponine and azelma to gaze at cosette with envy 
 cosette placed catherine on a chair then seated herself on the floor in front of her and remained motionless without uttering a word in an attitude of contemplation 
 play cosette said the stranger 
 oh 
 i am playing returned the child 
 this stranger this unknown individual who had the air of a visit which providence was making on cosette was the person whom the thenardier hated worse than any one in the world at that moment 
 however it was necessary to control herself habituated as she was to dissimulation through endeavoring to copy her husband in all his actions these emotions were more than she could endure 
 she made haste to send her daughters to bed then she asked the permission to send cosette off also for she has worked hard all day she added with a maternal air cosette went off to bed carrying catherine in her arms 
 from time to time the thenardier went to the other end of the room where her husband was to relieve her soul as she said she exchanged with her husband words which were all the more furious because she dared not utter them aloud 
 old beast 
 what has he got in his belly to come and upset us in this manner 
 to want that little monster to play to give away dolls to a jade that i would sell for forty sous so i would 
 a little more and he will be saying your majesty to her as though to the duchess de berry 
 is there any sense in it is he mad then that mysterious old fellow 
 why it is perfectly simple replied thenardier if that amuses him it amuses you to have the little one work it amuses him to have her play 
 all right 
 a traveller can do what he pleases when he pays for it 
 if the old fellow is a philanthropist what is that to you 
 if he is an imbecile it does not concern you what are you worrying for so long as he has money 
 the language of a master and the reasoning of an innkeeper neither of which admitted of any reply 
 the man had placed his elbows on the table and resumed his thoughtful attitude 
 all the other travellers both pedlers and carters had withdrawn a little and had ceased singing they were staring at him from a distance with a sort of respectful awe this poorly dressed man who drew from his pocket with so much ease and who lavished gigantic dolls on dirty little brats in wooden shoes was certainly a magnificent fellow and one to be feared 
 many hours passed 
 the midnight mass was over the chimes had ceased the drinkers had taken their departure the was closed the public room was deserted the fire extinct the stranger still remained in the same place and the same attitude 
 from time to time he changed the elbow on which he leaned 
 that was all but he had not said a word since cosette had left the room 
 the thenardiers alone out of politeness and curiosity had remained in the room 
 is he going to pass the night in that fashion grumbled the thenardier when two in the morning struck she declared herself vanquished and said to her husband going to bed 
 do as you like her husband seated himself at a table in the corner lighted a candle and began to read the courrier francais 
 a good hour passed thus 
 the worthy had perused the courrier francais at least three times from the date of the number to the name 
 the stranger did not stir 
 thenardier fidgeted coughed spit blew his nose and creaked his chair 
 not a movement on the part 
 is he asleep thought thenardier 
 the man was not asleep but nothing could arouse him 
 at last thenardier took off his cap stepped gently up to him and ventured to say 
 is not monsieur going to his repose 
 not going to bed would have seemed to him excessive and familiar to repose smacked of luxury and respect 
 these words possess the mysterious and admirable property of swelling the bill on the following day 
 a chamber where one sleeps costs twenty sous a chamber in which one reposes costs twenty francs 
 well said the stranger you are right 
 where is your stable 
 sir exclaimed thenardier with a smile i will conduct you sir 
 he took the candle the man picked up his bundle and cudgel and thenardier conducted him to a chamber on the first floor which was of rare splendor all furnished in mahogany with a low bedstead curtained with red calico 
 what is this said the traveller 
 it is really our bridal chamber said the my wife and i occupy another 
 this is only entered three or four times a year 
 i should have liked the stable quite as well said the man abruptly 
 thenardier pretended not to hear this unamiable remark 
 he lighted two perfectly fresh wax candles which figured on the a very good fire was flickering on the hearth 
 on the under a glass globe stood a in silver wire and orange flowers 
 and what is this resumed the stranger 
 that sir said thenardier is my wedding bonnet 
 the traveller surveyed the object with a glance which seemed to say there really was a time then when that monster was a maiden 
 thenardier lied however 
 when he had leased this paltry building for the purpose of converting it into a tavern he had found this chamber decorated in just this manner and had purchased the furniture and obtained the orange flowers at second hand with the idea that this would cast a graceful shadow on his spouse and would result in what the english call respectability for his house 
 when the traveller turned round the host had disappeared thenardier had withdrawn discreetly without venturing to wish him a good night as he did not wish to treat with disrespectful cordiality a man whom he proposed to fleece royally the following morning 
 the retired to his room 
 his wife was in bed but she was not asleep 
 when she heard her step she turned over and said to him 
 do you know going to turn cosette out of doors 
 thenardier replied coldly 
 how you do go on 
 they exchanged no further words and a few moments later their candle was extinguished 
 as for the traveller he had deposited his cudgel and his bundle in a corner 
 the landlord once gone he threw himself into an and remained for some time buried in thought then he removed his shoes took one of the two candles blew out the other opened the door and quitted the room gazing about him like a person who is in search of something he traversed a corridor and came upon a staircase 
 there he heard a very faint and gentle sound like the breathing of a child he followed this sound and came to a sort of triangular recess built under the staircase or rather formed by the staircase itself this recess was nothing else than the space under the steps there in the midst of all sorts of old papers and potsherds among dust and spiders webs was a one can call by the name of bed a straw pallet so full of holes as to display the straw and a coverlet so tattered as to show the pallet 
 no sheets this was placed on the floor 
 in this bed cosette was sleeping 
 the man approached and gazed down upon her 
 cosette was in a profound sleep she was fully dressed 
 in the winter she did not undress in order that she might not be so cold 
 against her breast was pressed the doll whose large eyes wide open glittered in the dark 
 from time to time she gave vent to a deep sigh as though she were on the point of waking and she strained the doll almost convulsively in her arms 
 beside her bed there was only one of her wooden shoes 
 a door which stood open near pallet permitted a view of a rather large dark room 
 the stranger stepped into it at the further extremity through a glass door he saw two small very white beds 
 they belonged to eponine and azelma behind these beds and half hidden stood an uncurtained wicker cradle in which the little boy who had cried all the evening lay asleep 
 the stranger conjectured that this chamber connected with that of the thenardier pair 
 he was on the point of retreating when his eye fell upon the of those vast tavern chimneys where there is always so little fire when there is any fire at all and which are so cold to look at 
 there was no fire in this one there was not even ashes but there was something which attracted the gaze nevertheless 
 it was two tiny shoes coquettish in shape and unequal in size 
 the traveller recalled the graceful and immemorial custom in accordance with which children place their shoes in the chimney on christmas eve there to await in the darkness some sparkling gift from their good fairy eponine and azelma had taken care not to omit this and each of them had set one of her shoes on the hearth 
 the traveller bent over them 
 the fairy that is to say their mother had already paid her visit and in each he saw a and shining piece 
 the man straightened himself up and was on the point of withdrawing when far in in the darkest corner of the hearth he caught sight of another object 
 he looked at it and recognized a wooden shoe a frightful shoe of the coarsest description half dilapidated and all covered with ashes and dried mud 
 it was sabot cosette with that touching trust of childhood which can always be deceived yet never discouraged had placed her shoe on the also 
 hope in a child who has never known anything but despair is a sweet and touching thing 
 there was nothing in this wooden shoe 
 the stranger fumbled in his waistcoat bent over and placed a louis in shoe 
 then he regained his own chamber with the stealthy tread of a wolf

 book of the promise made to the dead woman 
 chapter viii 
 
 the unpleasantness of receiving into house a poor man who may be a rich man 
 cosette could not refrain from casting a sidelong glance at the big doll which was still displayed at the then she knocked the door opened 
 the thenardier appeared with a candle in her hand 
 ah so you you little wretch good mercy but taken your time 
 the hussy has been amusing herself 
 madame said cosette trembling all over a gentleman who wants a lodging 
 the thenardier speedily replaced her gruff air by her amiable grimace a change of aspect common to and eagerly sought the with her eyes 
 this is the gentleman said she 
 yes madame replied the man raising his hand to his hat 
 wealthy travellers are not so polite 
 this gesture and an inspection of the costume and baggage which the thenardier passed in review with one glance caused the amiable grimace to vanish and the gruff mien to reappear 
 she resumed dryly 
 enter my good man 
 the good man entered 
 the thenardier cast a second glance at him paid particular attention to his which was absolutely threadbare and to his hat which was a little battered and tossing her head wrinkling her nose and screwing up her eyes she consulted her husband who was still drinking with the carters the husband replied by that imperceptible movement of the forefinger which backed up by an inflation of the lips signifies in such cases a regular beggar 
 thereupon the thenardier exclaimed 
 ah see here my good man i am very sorry but i have no room left 
 put me where you like said the man in the attic in the stable i will pay as though i occupied a room 
 forty sous 
 forty sous agreed 
 very well then 
 forty sous said a carter in a low tone to the thenardier woman why the charge is only twenty sous 
 it is forty in his case retorted the thenardier in the same tone i lodge poor folks for less 
 true added her husband gently it ruins a house to have such people in it 
 in the meantime the man laying his bundle and his cudgel on a bench had seated himself at a table on which cosette made haste to place a bottle of wine and a glass 
 the merchant who had demanded the bucket of water took it to his horse himself cosette resumed her place under the kitchen table and her knitting 
 the man who had barely moistened his lips in the wine which he had poured out for himself observed the child with peculiar attention 
 cosette was ugly 
 if she had been happy she might have been pretty we have already given a sketch of that sombre little figure cosette was thin and pale she was nearly eight years old but she seemed to be hardly six 
 her large eyes sunken in a sort of shadow were almost put out with weeping 
 the corners of her mouth had that curve of habitual anguish which is seen in condemned persons and desperately sick people 
 her hands were as her mother had divined ruined with chilblains 
 the fire which illuminated her at that moment brought into relief all the angles of her bones and rendered her thinness frightfully apparent 
 as she was always shivering she had acquired the habit of pressing her knees one against the other her entire clothing was but a rag which would have inspired pity in summer and which inspired horror in winter 
 all she had on was linen not a scrap of woollen 
 her skin was visible here and there and everywhere black and blue spots could be descried which marked the places where the thenardier woman had touched her her naked legs were thin and red 
 the hollows in her neck were enough to make one weep 
 this whole person her mien her attitude the sound of her voice the intervals which she allowed to elapse between one word and the next her glance her silence her slightest gesture expressed and betrayed one sole 
 fear was diffused all over her she was covered with it so to speak fear drew her elbows close to her hips withdrew her heels under her petticoat made her occupy as little space as possible allowed her only the breath that was absolutely necessary and had become what might be called the habit of her body admitting of no possible variation except an increase 
 in the depths of her eyes there was an astonished nook where terror lurked 
 her fear was such that on her arrival wet as she was cosette did not dare to approach the fire and dry herself but sat silently down to her work again 
 the expression in the glance of that child of eight years was habitually so gloomy and at times so tragic that it seemed at certain moments as though she were on the verge of becoming an idiot or a demon 
 as we have stated she had never known what it is to pray she had never set foot in a church 
 have i the time said the thenardier 
 the man in the yellow coat never took his eyes from cosette 
 all at once the thenardier exclaimed 
 by the way that bread 
 cosette according to her custom whenever the thenardier uplifted her voice emerged with great haste from beneath the table 
 she had completely forgotten the bread 
 she had recourse to the expedient of children who live in a constant state of fear she lied 
 madame the shop was shut 
 you should have knocked 
 i did knock madame 
 well 
 he did not open the door 
 find out whether that is true said the thenardier and if you are telling me a lie lead you a pretty dance in the meantime give me back my piece 
 cosette plunged her hand into the pocket of her apron and turned green the piece was not there 
 ah come now said madame thenardier did you hear me 
 cosette turned her pocket inside out there was nothing in it what could have become of that money 
 the unhappy little creature could not find a word to say 
 she was petrified 
 have you lost that piece screamed the thenardier hoarsely or do you want to rob me of it 
 at the same time she stretched out her arm towards the which hung on a nail in the 
 this formidable gesture restored to cosette sufficient strength to shriek 
 mercy madame madame 
 i will not do so any more 
 the thenardier took down the whip 
 in the meantime the man in the yellow coat had been fumbling in the fob of his waistcoat without any one having noticed his movements besides the other travellers were drinking or playing cards and were not paying attention to anything 
 cosette contracted herself into a ball with anguish within the angle of the chimney endeavoring to gather up and conceal her poor limbs 
 the thenardier raised her arm 
 pardon me madame said the man but just now i caught sight of something which had fallen from this little apron pocket and rolled aside 
 perhaps this is it 
 at the same time he bent down and seemed to be searching on the floor for a moment 
 exactly here it is he went on straightening himself up 
 and he held out a silver coin to the thenardier 
 yes it said she 
 it was not it for it was a piece but the thenardier found it to her advantage 
 she put the coin in her pocket and confined herself to casting a fierce glance at the child accompanied with the remark let this ever happen again 
 cosette returned to what the thenardier called her kennel and her large eyes which were riveted on the traveller began to take on an expression such as they had never worn before thus far it was only an innocent amazement but a sort of stupefied confidence was mingled with it 
 by the way would you like some supper the thenardier inquired of the traveller 
 he made no reply 
 he appeared to be absorbed in thought 
 what sort of a man is that she muttered between her teeth some frightfully poor wretch 
 he a sou to pay for a supper 
 will he even pay me for his lodging 
 very lucky all the same that it did not occur to him to steal the money that was on the floor 
 in the meantime a door had opened and eponine and azelma entered 
 they were two really pretty little girls more bourgeois than peasant in looks and very charming the one with shining chestnut tresses the other with long black braids hanging down her back both vivacious neat plump rosy and healthy and a delight to the eye 
 they were warmly clad but with so much maternal art that the thickness of the stuffs did not detract from the coquetry of arrangement 
 there was a hint of winter though the springtime was not wholly effaced 
 light emanated from these two little beings besides this they were on the throne 
 in their toilettes in their gayety in the noise which they made there was sovereignty when they entered the thenardier said to them in a grumbling tone which was full of adoration ah there you are you children 
 then drawing them one after the other to her knees smoothing their hair tying their ribbons afresh and then releasing them with that gentle manner of shaking off which is peculiar to mothers she exclaimed what frights they are 
 they went and seated themselves in the they had a doll which they turned over and over on their knees with all sorts of joyous chatter 
 from time to time cosette raised her eyes from her knitting and watched their play with a melancholy air 
 eponine and azelma did not look at cosette 
 she was the same as a dog to them 
 these three little girls did not yet reckon up four and twenty years between them but they already represented the whole society of man envy on the one side disdain on the other 
 the doll of the thenardier sisters was very much faded very old and much broken but it seemed none the less admirable to cosette who had never had a doll in her life a real doll to make use of the expression which all children will understand 
 all at once the thenardier who had been going back and forth in the room perceived that mind was distracted and that instead of working she was paying attention to the little ones at their play 
 ah 
 caught you at it she cried 
 so the way you work make you work to the tune of the whip that i will 
 the stranger turned to the thenardier without quitting his chair 
 bah madame he said with an almost timid air let her play 
 such a wish expressed by a traveller who had eaten a slice of mutton and had drunk a couple of bottles of wine with his supper and who had not the air of being frightfully poor would have been equivalent to an order 
 but that a man with such a hat should permit himself such a desire and that a man with such a coat should permit himself to have a will was something which madame thenardier did not intend to tolerate 
 she retorted with acrimony 
 she must work since she eats 
 i feed her to do nothing 
 what is she making went on the stranger in a gentle voice which contrasted strangely with his beggarly garments and his shoulders 
 the thenardier deigned to reply 
 stockings if you please 
 stockings for my little girls who have none so to speak and who are absolutely barefoot just now 
 the man looked at poor little red feet and continued 
 when will she have finished this pair of stockings 
 she has at least three or four good days work on them still the lazy creature 
 and how much will that pair of stockings be worth when she has finished them 
 the thenardier cast a glance of disdain on him 
 thirty sous at least 
 will you sell them for five francs went on the man 
 good heavens exclaimed a carter who was listening with a loud laugh five francs the deuce i should think so five balls 
 thenardier thought it time to strike in 
 yes sir if such is your fancy you will be allowed to have that pair of stockings for five francs 
 we can refuse nothing to travellers 
 you must pay on the spot said the thenardier in her curt and peremptory fashion 
 i will buy that pair of stockings replied the man and he added drawing a piece from his pocket and laying it on the table i will pay for them 
 then he turned to cosette 
 now i own your work play my child 
 the carter was so much touched by the piece that he abandoned his glass and hastened up 
 but true he cried examining it 
 a real hind wheel and not counterfeit 
 thenardier approached and silently put the coin in his pocket 
 the thenardier had no reply to make 
 she bit her lips and her face assumed an expression of hatred 
 in the meantime cosette was trembling 
 she ventured to ask 
 is it true madame 
 may i play 
 play said the thenardier in a terrible voice 
 thanks madame said cosette 
 and while her mouth thanked the thenardier her whole little soul thanked the traveller 
 thenardier had resumed his drinking his wife whispered in his ear 
 who can this yellow man be 
 i have seen millionaires with coats like that replied thenardier in a sovereign manner 
 cosette had dropped her knitting but had not left her seat cosette always moved as little as possible 
 she picked up some old rags and her little lead sword from a box behind her 
 eponine and azelma paid no attention to what was going on they had just executed a very important operation they had just got hold of the cat 
 they had thrown their doll on the ground and eponine who was the elder was swathing the little cat in spite of its mewing and its contortions in a quantity of clothes and red and blue scraps 
 while performing this serious and difficult work she was saying to her sister in that sweet and adorable language of children whose grace like the splendor of the wing vanishes when one essays to fix it fast 
 you see sister this doll is more amusing than the other she twists she cries she is warm 
 see sister let us play with her she shall be my little girl 
 i will be a lady 
 i will come to see you and you shall look at her 
 gradually you will perceive her whiskers and that will surprise you 
 and then you will see her ears and then you will see her tail and it will amaze you and you will say to me ah mon dieu and i will say to you yes madame it is my little girl 
 little girls are made like that just at present 
 azelma listened admiringly to eponine 
 in the meantime the drinkers had begun to sing an obscene song and to laugh at it until the ceiling shook 
 thenardier accompanied and encouraged them 
 as birds make nests out of everything so children make a doll out of anything which comes to hand 
 while eponine and azelma were bundling up the cat cosette on her side had dressed up her sword that done she laid it in her arms and sang to it softly to lull it to sleep 
 the doll is one of the most imperious needs and at the same time one of the most charming instincts of feminine childhood to care for to clothe to deck to dress to undress to redress to teach scold a little to rock to dandle to lull to sleep to imagine that something is some lies the whole future 
 while dreaming and chattering making tiny outfits and baby clothes while sewing little gowns and corsages and bodices the child grows into a young girl the young girl into a big girl the big girl into a woman 
 the first child is the continuation of the last doll 
 a little girl without a doll is almost as unhappy and quite as impossible as a woman without children 
 so cosette had made herself a doll out of the sword 
 madame thenardier approached the yellow man my husband is right she thought perhaps it is m laffitte there are such queer rich men 
 she came and set her elbows on the table 
 monsieur said she 
 at this word monsieur the man turned up to that time the thenardier had addressed him only as brave homme or bonhomme 
 you see sir she pursued assuming a sweetish air that was even more repulsive to behold than her fierce mien i am willing that the child should play i do not oppose it but it is good for once because you are generous 
 you see she has nothing she must needs work 
 then this child is not yours demanded the man 
 oh mon dieu no sir she is a little beggar whom we have taken in through charity a sort of imbecile child 
 she must have water on the brain she has a large head as you see 
 we do what we can for her for we are not rich we have written in vain to her native place and have received no reply these six months it must be that her mother is dead 
 ah said the man and fell into his revery once more 
 her mother amount to much added the thenardier she abandoned her child 
 during the whole of this conversation cosette as though warned by some instinct that she was under discussion had not taken her eyes from the face she listened vaguely she caught a few words here and there 
 meanwhile the drinkers all intoxicated were repeating their unclean refrain with redoubled gayety it was a highly spiced and wanton song in which the virgin and the infant jesus were introduced 
 the thenardier went off to take part in the shouts of laughter 
 cosette from her post under the table gazed at the fire which was reflected from her fixed eyes 
 she had begun to rock the sort of baby which she had made and as she rocked it she sang in a low voice my mother is dead my mother is dead my mother is dead 
 on being urged afresh by the hostess the yellow man the millionaire consented at last to take supper 
 what does monsieur wish 
 bread and cheese said the man 
 decidedly he is a beggar thought madame thenardier 
 the drunken men were still singing their song and the child under the table was singing hers 
 all at once cosette paused she had just turned round and caught sight of the little thenardiers doll which they had abandoned for the cat and had left on the floor a few paces from the kitchen table 
 then she dropped the swaddled sword which only half met her needs and cast her eyes slowly round the room 
 madame thenardier was whispering to her husband and counting over some money ponine and zelma were playing with the cat the travellers were eating or drinking or singing not a glance was fixed on her she had not a moment to lose she crept out from under the table on her hands and knees made sure once more that no one was watching her then she slipped quickly up to the doll and seized it 
 an instant later she was in her place again seated motionless and only turned so as to cast a shadow on the doll which she held in her arms the happiness of playing with a doll was so rare for her that it contained all the violence of voluptuousness 
 no one had seen her except the traveller who was slowly devouring his meagre supper 
 this joy lasted about a quarter of an hour 
 but with all the precautions that cosette had taken she did not perceive that one of the legs stuck out and that the fire on the hearth lighted it up very vividly 
 that pink and shining foot projecting from the shadow suddenly struck the eye of azelma who said to eponine look sister 
 the two little girls paused in stupefaction cosette had dared to take their doll 
 eponine rose and without releasing the cat she ran to her mother and began to tug at her skirt 
 let me alone said her mother what do you want 
 mother said the child look there 
 and she pointed to cosette 
 cosette absorbed in the ecstasies of possession no longer saw or heard anything 
 madame countenance assumed that peculiar expression which is composed of the terrible mingled with the trifles of life and which has caused this style of woman to be named megaeras 
 on this occasion wounded pride exasperated her wrath still further cosette had overstepped all bounds cosette had laid violent hands on the doll belonging to these young ladies 
 a czarina who should see a muzhik trying on her imperial blue ribbon would wear no other face 
 she shrieked in a voice rendered hoarse with indignation 
 cosette 
 cosette started as though the earth had trembled beneath her she turned round 
 cosette repeated the thenardier 
 cosette took the doll and laid it gently on the floor with a sort of veneration mingled with despair then without taking her eyes from it she clasped her hands and what is terrible to relate of a child of that age she wrung them one of the emotions of the day neither the trip to the forest nor the weight of the bucket of water nor the loss of the money nor the sight of the whip nor even the sad words which she had heard madame thenardier utter had been able to wring this from her she wept she burst out sobbing 
 meanwhile the traveller had risen to his feet 
 what is the matter he said to the thenardier 
 you see said the thenardier pointing to the corpus delicti which lay at feet 
 well what of it resumed the man 
 that beggar replied the thenardier has permitted herself to touch the doll 
 all this noise for that said the man well what if she did play with that doll 
 she touched it with her dirty hands pursued the thenardier with her frightful hands 
 here cosette redoubled her sobs 
 will you stop your noise screamed the thenardier 
 the man went straight to the street door opened it and stepped out 
 as soon as he had gone the thenardier profited by his absence to give cosette a hearty kick under the table which made the child utter loud cries 
 the door opened again the man he carried in both hands the fabulous doll which we have mentioned and which all the village brats had been staring at ever since the morning and he set it upright in front of cosette saying 
 
 here this is for you 
 it must be supposed that in the course of the hour and more which he had spent there he had taken confused notice through his revery of that toy shop lighted up by and candles so splendidly that it was visible like an illumination through the window of the 
 cosette raised her eyes she gazed at the man approaching her with that doll as she might have gazed at the sun she heard the unprecedented words it is for you she stared at him she stared at the doll then she slowly retreated and hid herself at the extreme end under the table in a corner of the wall 
 she no longer cried she no longer wept she had the appearance of no longer daring to breathe 
 the thenardier eponine and azelma were like statues also the very drinkers had paused a solemn silence reigned through the whole room 
 madame thenardier petrified and mute recommenced her conjectures who is that old fellow 
 is he a poor man 
 is he a millionaire perhaps he is both that is to say a thief 
 the face of the male thenardier presented that expressive fold which accentuates the human countenance whenever the dominant instinct appears there in all its bestial force 
 the stared alternately at the doll and at the traveller he seemed to be scenting out the man as he would have scented out a bag of money this did not last longer than the space of a flash of lightning he stepped up to his wife and said to her in a low voice 
 that machine costs at least thirty francs 
 no nonsense down on your belly before that man 
 gross natures have this in common with naive natures that they possess no transition state 
 well cosette said the thenardier in a voice that strove to be sweet and which was composed of the bitter honey of malicious women you going to take your doll 
 cosette ventured to emerge from her hole 
 the gentleman has given you a doll my little cosette said thenardier with a caressing air 
 take it it is yours 
 cosette gazed at the marvellous doll in a sort of terror her face was still flooded with tears but her eyes began to fill like the sky at daybreak with strange beams of joy 
 what she felt at that moment was a little like what she would have felt if she had been abruptly told little one you are the queen of france 
 it seemed to her that if she touched that doll lightning would dart from it 
 this was true up to a certain point for she said to herself that the thenardier would scold and beat her 
 nevertheless the attraction carried the day 
 she ended by drawing near and murmuring timidly as she turned towards madame thenardier 
 may i madame 
 no words can render that air at once despairing terrified and ecstatic 
 pardi cried the thenardier it is yours 
 the gentleman has given it to you 
 truly sir said cosette 
 is it true 
 is the lady mine 
 the eyes seemed to be full of tears 
 he appeared to have reached that point of emotion where a man does not speak for fear lest he should weep 
 he nodded to cosette and placed the hand in her tiny hand 
 cosette hastily withdrew her hand as though that of the lady scorched her and began to stare at the floor 
 we are forced to add that at that moment she stuck out her tongue immoderately all at once she wheeled round and seized the doll in a transport 
 i shall call her catherine she said 
 it was an odd moment when rags met and clasped the ribbons and fresh pink muslins of the doll 
 madame she resumed may i put her on a chair 
 yes my child replied the thenardier 
 it was now the turn of eponine and azelma to gaze at cosette with envy 
 cosette placed catherine on a chair then seated herself on the floor in front of her and remained motionless without uttering a word in an attitude of contemplation 
 play cosette said the stranger 
 oh 
 i am playing returned the child 
 this stranger this unknown individual who had the air of a visit which providence was making on cosette was the person whom the thenardier hated worse than any one in the world at that moment 
 however it was necessary to control herself habituated as she was to dissimulation through endeavoring to copy her husband in all his actions these emotions were more than she could endure 
 she made haste to send her daughters to bed then she asked the permission to send cosette off also for she has worked hard all day she added with a maternal air cosette went off to bed carrying catherine in her arms 
 from time to time the thenardier went to the other end of the room where her husband was to relieve her soul as she said she exchanged with her husband words which were all the more furious because she dared not utter them aloud 
 old beast 
 what has he got in his belly to come and upset us in this manner 
 to want that little monster to play to give away dolls to a jade that i would sell for forty sous so i would 
 a little more and he will be saying your majesty to her as though to the duchess de berry 
 is there any sense in it is he mad then that mysterious old fellow 
 why it is perfectly simple replied thenardier if that amuses him it amuses you to have the little one work it amuses him to have her play 
 all right 
 a traveller can do what he pleases when he pays for it 
 if the old fellow is a philanthropist what is that to you 
 if he is an imbecile it does not concern you what are you worrying for so long as he has money 
 the language of a master and the reasoning of an innkeeper neither of which admitted of any reply 
 the man had placed his elbows on the table and resumed his thoughtful attitude 
 all the other travellers both pedlers and carters had withdrawn a little and had ceased singing they were staring at him from a distance with a sort of respectful awe this poorly dressed man who drew from his pocket with so much ease and who lavished gigantic dolls on dirty little brats in wooden shoes was certainly a magnificent fellow and one to be feared 
 many hours passed 
 the midnight mass was over the chimes had ceased the drinkers had taken their departure the was closed the public room was deserted the fire extinct the stranger still remained in the same place and the same attitude 
 from time to time he changed the elbow on which he leaned 
 that was all but he had not said a word since cosette had left the room 
 the thenardiers alone out of politeness and curiosity had remained in the room 
 is he going to pass the night in that fashion grumbled the thenardier when two in the morning struck she declared herself vanquished and said to her husband going to bed 
 do as you like her husband seated himself at a table in the corner lighted a candle and began to read the courrier francais 
 a good hour passed thus 
 the worthy had perused the courrier francais at least three times from the date of the number to the name 
 the stranger did not stir 
 thenardier fidgeted coughed spit blew his nose and creaked his chair 
 not a movement on the part 
 is he asleep thought thenardier 
 the man was not asleep but nothing could arouse him 
 at last thenardier took off his cap stepped gently up to him and ventured to say 
 is not monsieur going to his repose 
 not going to bed would have seemed to him excessive and familiar to repose smacked of luxury and respect 
 these words possess the mysterious and admirable property of swelling the bill on the following day 
 a chamber where one sleeps costs twenty sous a chamber in which one reposes costs twenty francs 
 well said the stranger you are right 
 where is your stable 
 sir exclaimed thenardier with a smile i will conduct you sir 
 he took the candle the man picked up his bundle and cudgel and thenardier conducted him to a chamber on the first floor which was of rare splendor all furnished in mahogany with a low bedstead curtained with red calico 
 what is this said the traveller 
 it is really our bridal chamber said the my wife and i occupy another 
 this is only entered three or four times a year 
 i should have liked the stable quite as well said the man abruptly 
 thenardier pretended not to hear this unamiable remark 
 he lighted two perfectly fresh wax candles which figured on the a very good fire was flickering on the hearth 
 on the under a glass globe stood a in silver wire and orange flowers 
 and what is this resumed the stranger 
 that sir said thenardier is my wedding bonnet 
 the traveller surveyed the object with a glance which seemed to say there really was a time then when that monster was a maiden 
 thenardier lied however 
 when he had leased this paltry building for the purpose of converting it into a tavern he had found this chamber decorated in just this manner and had purchased the furniture and obtained the orange flowers at second hand with the idea that this would cast a graceful shadow on his spouse and would result in what the english call respectability for his house 
 when the traveller turned round the host had disappeared thenardier had withdrawn discreetly without venturing to wish him a good night as he did not wish to treat with disrespectful cordiality a man whom he proposed to fleece royally the following morning 
 the retired to his room 
 his wife was in bed but she was not asleep 
 when she heard her step she turned over and said to him 
 do you know going to turn cosette out of doors 
 thenardier replied coldly 
 how you do go on 
 they exchanged no further words and a few moments later their candle was extinguished 
 as for the traveller he had deposited his cudgel and his bundle in a corner 
 the landlord once gone he threw himself into an and remained for some time buried in thought then he removed his shoes took one of the two candles blew out the other opened the door and quitted the room gazing about him like a person who is in search of something he traversed a corridor and came upon a staircase 
 there he heard a very faint and gentle sound like the breathing of a child he followed this sound and came to a sort of triangular recess built under the staircase or rather formed by the staircase itself this recess was nothing else than the space under the steps there in the midst of all sorts of old papers and potsherds among dust and spiders webs was a one can call by the name of bed a straw pallet so full of holes as to display the straw and a coverlet so tattered as to show the pallet 
 no sheets this was placed on the floor 
 in this bed cosette was sleeping 
 the man approached and gazed down upon her 
 cosette was in a profound sleep she was fully dressed 
 in the winter she did not undress in order that she might not be so cold 
 against her breast was pressed the doll whose large eyes wide open glittered in the dark 
 from time to time she gave vent to a deep sigh as though she were on the point of waking and she strained the doll almost convulsively in her arms 
 beside her bed there was only one of her wooden shoes 
 a door which stood open near pallet permitted a view of a rather large dark room 
 the stranger stepped into it at the further extremity through a glass door he saw two small very white beds 
 they belonged to eponine and azelma behind these beds and half hidden stood an uncurtained wicker cradle in which the little boy who had cried all the evening lay asleep 
 the stranger conjectured that this chamber connected with that of the thenardier pair 
 he was on the point of retreating when his eye fell upon the of those vast tavern chimneys where there is always so little fire when there is any fire at all and which are so cold to look at 
 there was no fire in this one there was not even ashes but there was something which attracted the gaze nevertheless 
 it was two tiny shoes coquettish in shape and unequal in size 
 the traveller recalled the graceful and immemorial custom in accordance with which children place their shoes in the chimney on christmas eve there to await in the darkness some sparkling gift from their good fairy eponine and azelma had taken care not to omit this and each of them had set one of her shoes on the hearth 
 the traveller bent over them 
 the fairy that is to say their mother had already paid her visit and in each he saw a and shining piece 
 the man straightened himself up and was on the point of withdrawing when far in in the darkest corner of the hearth he caught sight of another object 
 he looked at it and recognized a wooden shoe a frightful shoe of the coarsest description half dilapidated and all covered with ashes and dried mud 
 it was sabot cosette with that touching trust of childhood which can always be deceived yet never discouraged had placed her shoe on the also 
 hope in a child who has never known anything but despair is a sweet and touching thing 
 there was nothing in this wooden shoe 
 the stranger fumbled in his waistcoat bent over and placed a louis in shoe 
 then he regained his own chamber with the stealthy tread of a wolf

 see where met again said the little man tushin tushin you remember who gave you a lift at schon grabern and had a bit cut off you see he went on with a smile pointing to the empty sleeve of his dressing gown looking for vasili dmitrich denisov my neighbor he added when he heard who rostov wanted here here and tushin led him into the next room from whence came sounds of several laughing voices 
 how can they laugh or even live at all here thought rostov still aware of that smell of decomposing flesh that had been so strong in the soldiers ward and still seeming to see fixed on him those envious looks which had followed him out from both sides and the face of that young soldier with eyes rolled back 
 denisov lay asleep on his bed with his head under the blanket though it was nearly noon 
 ah wostov how are you how are you he called out still in the same voice as in the regiment but rostov noticed sadly that under this habitual ease and animation some new sinister hidden feeling showed itself in the expression of face and the intonations of his voice 
 his wound though a slight one had not yet healed even now six weeks after he had been hit his face had the same swollen pallor as the faces of the other hospital patients but it was not this that struck rostov what struck him was that denisov did not seem glad to see him and smiled at him unnaturally he did not ask about the regiment nor about the general state of affairs and when rostov spoke of these matters did not listen 
 rostov even noticed that denisov did not like to be reminded of the regiment or in general of that other free life which was going on outside the hospital he seemed to try to forget that old life and was only interested in the affair with the commissariat officers on inquiry as to how the matter stood he at once produced from under his pillow a paper he had received from the commission and the rough draft of his answer to it he became animated when he began reading his paper and specially drew attention to the stinging rejoinders he made to his enemies his hospital companions who had gathered round rostov a fresh arrival from the world outside gradually began to disperse as soon as denisov began reading his answer rostov noticed by their faces that all those gentlemen had already heard that story more than once and were tired of it only the man who had the next bed a stout uhlan continued to sit on his bed gloomily frowning and smoking a pipe and little tushin still listened shaking his head disapprovingly in the middle of the reading the uhlan interrupted denisov 
 but what i say is he said turning to rostov it would be best simply to petition the emperor for pardon they say great rewards will now be distributed and surely a pardon would be granted 
 me petition the empewo exclaimed denisov in a voice to which he tried hard to give the old energy and fire but which sounded like an expression of irritable impotence what for if i were a wobber i would ask mercy but being for bwinging wobbers to book let them twy me not afwaid of anyone served the tsar and my countwy honowably and have not stolen and am i to be degwaded listen to them stwaight this is what i say if i had wobbed the tweasuwy 
 certainly well written said tushin but not the point vasili dmitrich and he also turned to rostov one has to submit and vasili dmitrich want to you know the auditor told you it was a bad business 
 well let it be bad said denisov 
 the auditor wrote out a petition for you continued tushin and you ought to sign it and ask this gentleman to take it no doubt he indicating rostov has connections on the staff you find a better opportunity 
 i said not going to gwovel denisov interrupted him went on reading his paper 
 rostov had not the courage to persuade denisov though he instinctively felt that the way advised by tushin and the other officers was the safest and though he would have been glad to be of service to denisov he knew his stubborn will and straightforward hasty temper 
 when the reading of virulent reply which took more than an hour was over rostov said nothing and he spent the rest of the day in a most dejected state of mind amid hospital comrades who had round him telling them what he knew and listening to their stories denisov was moodily silent all the evening 
 late in the evening when rostov was about to leave he asked denisov whether he had no commission for him 
 yes wait a bit said denisov glancing round at the officers and taking his papers from under his pillow he went to the window where he had an inkpot and sat down to write 
 it seems no use knocking head against a wall he said coming from the window and giving rostov a large envelope in it was the petition to the emperor drawn up by the auditor in which denisov without alluding to the offenses of the commissariat officials simply asked for pardon 
 hand it in it seems 
 he did not finish but gave a painfully unnatural smile

 book of the promise made to the dead woman 
 chapter ix 
 
 thenardier and his manoeuvres 
 on the following morning two hours at least before thenardier seated beside a candle in the public room of the tavern pen in hand was making out the bill for the traveller with the yellow coat 
 his wife standing beside him and half bent over him was following him with her eyes 
 they exchanged not a word 
 on the one hand there was profound meditation on the other the religious admiration with which one watches the birth and development of a marvel of the human mind 
 a noise was audible in the house it was the lark sweeping the stairs 
 after the lapse of a good quarter of an hour and some erasures thenardier produced the following masterpiece 
 bill of the gentleman in no 
 supper francs 
 chamber 
 candle 
 fire 
 service 
 total francs 
 service was written servisse 
 francs cried the woman with an enthusiasm which was mingled with some hesitation 
 like all great artists thenardier was dissatisfied 
 peuh he exclaimed 
 it was the accent of castlereagh auditing bill at the congress of vienna 
 monsieur thenardier you are right he certainly owes that murmured the wife who was thinking of the doll bestowed on cosette in the presence of her daughters 
 it is just but it is too much he will not pay it 
 thenardier laughed coldly as usual and said 
 he will pay 
 this laugh was the supreme assertion of certainty and authority that which was asserted in this manner must needs be so 
 his wife did not insist 
 she set about arranging the table her husband paced the room a moment later he added 
 i owe full fifteen hundred francs 
 he went and seated himself in the meditating with his feet among the warm ashes 
 ah by the way resumed his wife you forget that going to turn cosette out of doors the monster 
 she breaks my heart with that doll of hers 
 rather marry louis xviii than keep her another day in the house 
 thenardier lighted his pipe and replied between two puffs 
 you will hand that bill to the man 
 then he went out 
 hardly had he left the room when the traveller entered 
 thenardier instantly reappeared behind him and remained motionless in the door visible only to his wife 
 the yellow man carried his bundle and his cudgel in his hand 
 up so early said madame thenardier is monsieur leaving us already 
 as she spoke thus she was twisting the bill about in her hands with an embarrassed air and making creases in it with her nails her hard face presented a shade which was not habitual with it timidity and scruples 
 to present such a bill to a man who had so completely the air of a poor wretch seemed difficult to her 
 the traveller appeared to be preoccupied and he replied 
 yes madame i am going 
 so monsieur has no business in montfermeil 
 no i was passing through 
 that is all 
 what do i owe you madame he added 
 the thenardier silently handed him the folded bill 
 the man unfolded the paper and glanced at it but his thoughts were evidently elsewhere 
 madame he resumed is business good here in montfermeil 
 so so monsieur replied the thenardier stupefied at not witnessing another sort of explosion 
 she continued in a dreary and lamentable tone 
 oh 
 monsieur times are so hard and then we have so few bourgeois in the neighborhood 
 all the people are poor you see 
 if we had not now and then some rich and generous travellers like monsieur we should not get along at all 
 we have so many expenses 
 just see that child is costing us our very eyes 
 what child 
 why the little one you know 
 lark as she is called hereabouts 
 ah said the man 
 she went on 
 how stupid these peasants are with their nicknames 
 she has more the air of a bat than of a lark 
 you see sir we do not ask charity and we cannot bestow it 
 we earn nothing and we have to pay out a great deal 
 the license the imposts the door and window tax the hundredths 
 monsieur is aware that the government demands a terrible deal of money 
 and then i have my daughters i have no need to bring up other children 
 the man resumed in that voice which he strove to render indifferent and in which there lingered a tremor 
 what if one were to rid you of her 
 who 
 cosette 
 yes 
 the red and violent face brightened up hideously 
 ah sir my dear sir take her keep her lead her off carry her away sugar her stuff her with truffles drink her eat her and the blessings of the good holy virgin and of all the saints of paradise be upon you 
 agreed 
 really 
 you will take her away 
 i will take her away 
 immediately 
 immediately 
 call the child 
 cosette screamed the thenardier 
 in the meantime pursued the man i will pay you what i owe you how much is it 
 he cast a glance on the bill and could not restrain a start of surprise 
 francs 
 he looked at the landlady and repeated 
 francs 
 there was in the enunciation of these words thus repeated an accent between an exclamation and an interrogation point 
 the thenardier had had time to prepare herself for the shock she replied with assurance 
 good gracious yes sir it is francs 
 the stranger laid five pieces on the table 
 go and get the child said he 
 at that moment thenardier advanced to the middle of the room and said 
 monsieur owes sous 
 sous exclaimed his wife 
 twenty sous for the chamber resumed thenardier coldly and six sous for his supper 
 as for the child i must discuss that matter a little with the gentleman 
 leave us wife 
 madame thenardier was dazzled as with the shock caused by unexpected lightning flashes of talent 
 she was conscious that a great actor was making his entrance on the stage uttered not a word in reply and left the room 
 as soon as they were alone thenardier offered the traveller a chair the traveller seated himself thenardier remained standing and his face assumed a singular expression of and simplicity 
 sir said he what i have to say to you is this that i adore that child 
 the stranger gazed intently at him 
 what child 
 thenardier continued 
 how strange it is one grows attached 
 what money is that take back your piece 
 i adore the child 
 whom do you mean demanded the stranger 
 eh our little cosette 
 are you not intending to take her away from us 
 well i speak frankly as true as you are an honest man i will not consent to it 
 i shall miss that child 
 i saw her first when she was a tiny thing 
 it is true that she costs us money it is true that she has her faults it is true that we are not rich it is true that i have paid out over four hundred francs for drugs for just one of her illnesses 
 but one must do something for the good sake 
 she has neither father nor mother i have brought her up 
 i have bread enough for her and for myself in truth i think a great deal of that child 
 you understand one conceives an affection for a person i am a good sort of a beast i am i do not reason i love that little girl my wife is but she loves her also 
 you see she is just the same as our own child 
 i want to keep her to babble about the house 
 the stranger kept his eye intently fixed on thenardier the latter continued 
 excuse me sir but one does not give away child to a like that 
 i am right am i not 
 still i say you are rich you have the air of a very good it were for her happiness 
 but one must find out that 
 you understand suppose that i were to let her go and to sacrifice myself i should like to know what becomes of her i should not wish to lose sight of her i should like to know with whom she is living so that i could go to see her from time to time so that she may know that her good is alive that he is watching over her in short there are things which are not possible 
 i do not even know your name 
 if you were to take her away i should say well and the lark what has become of her 
 one must at least see some petty scrap of paper some trifle in the way of a passport you know 
 the stranger still surveying him with that gaze which penetrates as the saying goes to the very depths of the conscience replied in a grave firm voice 
 monsieur thenardier one does not require a passport to travel five leagues from paris 
 if i take cosette away i shall take her away and that is the end of the matter 
 you will not know my name you will not know my residence you will not know where she is and my intention is that she shall never set eyes on you again so long as she lives 
 i break the thread which binds her foot and she departs 
 does that suit you 
 yes or no 
 since geniuses like demons recognize the presence of a superior god by certain signs thenardier comprehended that he had to deal with a very strong person 
 it was like an intuition he comprehended it with his clear and sagacious promptitude 
 while drinking with the carters smoking and singing coarse songs on the preceding evening he had devoted the whole of the time to observing the stranger watching him like a cat and studying him like a mathematician he had watched him both on his own account for the pleasure of the thing and through instinct and had spied upon him as though he had been paid for so doing 
 not a movement not a gesture on the part of the man in the yellow had escaped him even before the stranger had so clearly manifested his interest in cosette thenardier had divined his purpose 
 he had caught the old deep glances returning constantly to the child who was this man 
 why this interest 
 why this hideous costume when he had so much money in his purse 
 questions which he put to himself without being able to solve them and which irritated him he had pondered it all night long 
 he could not be father was he her grandfather 
 then why not make himself known at once when one has a right one asserts it 
 this man evidently had no right over cosette 
 what was it then 
 thenardier lost himself in conjectures 
 he caught glimpses of everything but he saw nothing be that as it may on entering into conversation with the man sure that there was some secret in the case that the latter had some interest in remaining in the shadow he felt himself strong when he perceived from the clear and firm retort that this mysterious personage was mysterious in so simple a way he became conscious that he was weak 
 he had expected nothing of the sort 
 his conjectures were put to the rout 
 he rallied his ideas 
 he weighed everything in the space of a second thenardier was one of those men who take in a situation at a glance he decided that the moment had arrived for proceeding straightforward and quickly at that 
 he did as great leaders do at the decisive moment which they know that they alone recognize he abruptly unmasked his batteries 
 sir said he i am in need of fifteen hundred francs 
 the stranger took from his side pocket an old pocketbook of black leather opened it drew out three which he laid on the table then he placed his large thumb on the notes and said to the 
 go and fetch cosette 
 while this was taking place what had cosette been doing 
 on waking up cosette had run to get her shoe 
 in it she had found the gold piece 
 it was not a napoleon it was one of those perfectly new pieces of the restoration on whose effigy the little prussian queue had replaced the laurel wreath cosette was dazzled 
 her destiny began to intoxicate her she did not know what a gold piece was she had never seen one she hid it quickly in her pocket as though she had stolen it still she felt that it really was hers she guessed whence her gift had come but the joy which she experienced was full of fear she was happy above all she was stupefied 
 such magnificent and beautiful things did not appear real 
 the doll frightened her the gold piece frightened her 
 she trembled vaguely in the presence of this magnificence 
 the stranger alone did not frighten her on the contrary he reassured her 
 ever since the preceding evening amid all her amazement even in her sleep she had been thinking in her little childish mind of that man who seemed to be so poor and so sad and who was so rich and so kind 
 everything had changed for her since she had met that good man in the forest cosette less happy than the most insignificant swallow of heaven had never known what it was to take refuge under a shadow and under a wing 
 for the last five years that is to say as far back as her memory ran the poor child had shivered and trembled she had always been exposed completely naked to the sharp wind of adversity now it seemed to her she was clothed 
 formerly her soul had seemed cold now it was warm 
 cosette was no longer afraid of the thenardier 
 she was no longer alone there was some one there 
 she hastily set about her regular morning duties 
 that louis which she had about her in the very apron pocket whence the piece had fallen on the night before distracted her thoughts she dared not touch it but she spent five minutes in gazing at it with her tongue hanging out if the truth must be told 
 as she swept the staircase she paused remained standing there motionless forgetful of her broom and of the entire universe occupied in gazing at that star which was blazing at the bottom of her pocket 
 it was during one of these periods of contemplation that the thenardier joined her 
 she had gone in search of cosette at her orders 
 what was quite unprecedented she neither struck her nor said an insulting word to her 
 cosette she said almost gently come immediately 
 an instant later cosette entered the public room 
 the stranger took up the bundle which he had brought and untied it this bundle contained a little woollen gown an apron a fustian bodice a kerchief a petticoat woollen stockings complete outfit for a girl of seven years 
 all was black 
 my child said the man take these and go and dress yourself quickly 
 daylight was appearing when those of the inhabitants of montfermeil who had begun to open their doors beheld a poorly clad old man leading a little girl dressed in mourning and carrying a pink doll in her arms pass along the road to paris 
 they were going in the direction of livry 
 it was our man and cosette 
 no one knew the man as cosette was no longer in rags many did not recognize her 
 cosette was going away 
 with whom 
 she did not know 
 whither 
 she knew not 
 all that she understood was that she was leaving the thenardier tavern behind her 
 no one had thought of bidding her farewell nor had she thought of taking leave of any one 
 she was leaving that hated and hating house 
 poor gentle creature whose heart had been repressed up to that hour 
 cosette walked along gravely with her large eyes wide open and gazing at the sky 
 she had put her louis in the pocket of her new apron 
 from time to time she bent down and glanced at it then she looked at the good man 
 she felt something as though she were beside the good god

 thenardier laughed coldly as usual and said 
 he will pay 
 this laugh was the supreme assertion of certainty and authority that which was asserted in this manner must needs be so 
 his wife did not insist 
 she set about arranging the table her husband paced the room a moment later he added 
 i owe full fifteen hundred francs 
 he went and seated himself in the meditating with his feet among the warm ashes 
 ah by the way resumed his wife you forget that going to turn cosette out of doors the monster 
 she breaks my heart with that doll of hers 
 rather marry louis xviii than keep her another day in the house 
 thenardier lighted his pipe and replied between two puffs 
 you will hand that bill to the man 
 then he went out 
 hardly had he left the room when the traveller entered 
 thenardier instantly reappeared behind him and remained motionless in the door visible only to his wife 
 the yellow man carried his bundle and his cudgel in his hand 
 up so early said madame thenardier is monsieur leaving us already 
 as she spoke thus she was twisting the bill about in her hands with an embarrassed air and making creases in it with her nails her hard face presented a shade which was not habitual with it timidity and scruples 
 to present such a bill to a man who had so completely the air of a poor wretch seemed difficult to her 
 the traveller appeared to be preoccupied and he replied 
 yes madame i am going 
 so monsieur has no business in montfermeil 
 no i was passing through 
 that is all 
 what do i owe you madame he added 
 the thenardier silently handed him the folded bill 
 the man unfolded the paper and glanced at it but his thoughts were evidently elsewhere 
 madame he resumed is business good here in montfermeil 
 so so monsieur replied the thenardier stupefied at not witnessing another sort of explosion 
 she continued in a dreary and lamentable tone 
 oh 
 monsieur times are so hard and then we have so few bourgeois in the neighborhood 
 all the people are poor you see 
 if we had not now and then some rich and generous travellers like monsieur we should not get along at all 
 we have so many expenses 
 just see that child is costing us our very eyes 
 what child 
 why the little one you know 
 lark as she is called hereabouts 
 ah said the man 
 she went on 
 how stupid these peasants are with their nicknames 
 she has more the air of a bat than of a lark 
 you see sir we do not ask charity and we cannot bestow it 
 we earn nothing and we have to pay out a great deal 
 the license the imposts the door and window tax the hundredths 
 monsieur is aware that the government demands a terrible deal of money 
 and then i have my daughters i have no need to bring up other children 
 the man resumed in that voice which he strove to render indifferent and in which there lingered a tremor 
 what if one were to rid you of her 
 who 
 cosette 
 yes 
 the red and violent face brightened up hideously 
 ah sir my dear sir take her keep her lead her off carry her away sugar her stuff her with truffles drink her eat her and the blessings of the good holy virgin and of all the saints of paradise be upon you 
 agreed 
 really 
 you will take her away 
 i will take her away 
 immediately 
 immediately 
 call the child 
 cosette screamed the thenardier 
 in the meantime pursued the man i will pay you what i owe you how much is it 
 he cast a glance on the bill and could not restrain a start of surprise 
 francs 
 he looked at the landlady and repeated 
 francs 
 there was in the enunciation of these words thus repeated an accent between an exclamation and an interrogation point 
 the thenardier had had time to prepare herself for the shock she replied with assurance 
 good gracious yes sir it is francs 
 the stranger laid five pieces on the table 
 go and get the child said he 
 at that moment thenardier advanced to the middle of the room and said 
 monsieur owes sous 
 sous exclaimed his wife 
 twenty sous for the chamber resumed thenardier coldly and six sous for his supper 
 as for the child i must discuss that matter a little with the gentleman 
 leave us wife 
 madame thenardier was dazzled as with the shock caused by unexpected lightning flashes of talent 
 she was conscious that a great actor was making his entrance on the stage uttered not a word in reply and left the room 
 as soon as they were alone thenardier offered the traveller a chair the traveller seated himself thenardier remained standing and his face assumed a singular expression of and simplicity 
 sir said he what i have to say to you is this that i adore that child 
 the stranger gazed intently at him 
 what child 
 thenardier continued 
 how strange it is one grows attached 
 what money is that take back your piece 
 i adore the child 
 whom do you mean demanded the stranger 
 eh our little cosette 
 are you not intending to take her away from us 
 well i speak frankly as true as you are an honest man i will not consent to it 
 i shall miss that child 
 i saw her first when she was a tiny thing 
 it is true that she costs us money it is true that she has her faults it is true that we are not rich it is true that i have paid out over four hundred francs for drugs for just one of her illnesses 
 but one must do something for the good sake 
 she has neither father nor mother i have brought her up 
 i have bread enough for her and for myself in truth i think a great deal of that child 
 you understand one conceives an affection for a person i am a good sort of a beast i am i do not reason i love that little girl my wife is but she loves her also 
 you see she is just the same as our own child 
 i want to keep her to babble about the house 
 the stranger kept his eye intently fixed on thenardier the latter continued 
 excuse me sir but one does not give away child to a like that 
 i am right am i not 
 still i say you are rich you have the air of a very good it were for her happiness 
 but one must find out that 
 you understand suppose that i were to let her go and to sacrifice myself i should like to know what becomes of her i should not wish to lose sight of her i should like to know with whom she is living so that i could go to see her from time to time so that she may know that her good is alive that he is watching over her in short there are things which are not possible 
 i do not even know your name 
 if you were to take her away i should say well and the lark what has become of her 
 one must at least see some petty scrap of paper some trifle in the way of a passport you know 
 the stranger still surveying him with that gaze which penetrates as the saying goes to the very depths of the conscience replied in a grave firm voice 
 monsieur thenardier one does not require a passport to travel five leagues from paris 
 if i take cosette away i shall take her away and that is the end of the matter 
 you will not know my name you will not know my residence you will not know where she is and my intention is that she shall never set eyes on you again so long as she lives 
 i break the thread which binds her foot and she departs 
 does that suit you 
 yes or no 
 since geniuses like demons recognize the presence of a superior god by certain signs thenardier comprehended that he had to deal with a very strong person 
 it was like an intuition he comprehended it with his clear and sagacious promptitude 
 while drinking with the carters smoking and singing coarse songs on the preceding evening he had devoted the whole of the time to observing the stranger watching him like a cat and studying him like a mathematician he had watched him both on his own account for the pleasure of the thing and through instinct and had spied upon him as though he had been paid for so doing 
 not a movement not a gesture on the part of the man in the yellow had escaped him even before the stranger had so clearly manifested his interest in cosette thenardier had divined his purpose 
 he had caught the old deep glances returning constantly to the child who was this man 
 why this interest 
 why this hideous costume when he had so much money in his purse 
 questions which he put to himself without being able to solve them and which irritated him he had pondered it all night long 
 he could not be father was he her grandfather 
 then why not make himself known at once when one has a right one asserts it 
 this man evidently had no right over cosette 
 what was it then 
 thenardier lost himself in conjectures 
 he caught glimpses of everything but he saw nothing be that as it may on entering into conversation with the man sure that there was some secret in the case that the latter had some interest in remaining in the shadow he felt himself strong when he perceived from the clear and firm retort that this mysterious personage was mysterious in so simple a way he became conscious that he was weak 
 he had expected nothing of the sort 
 his conjectures were put to the rout 
 he rallied his ideas 
 he weighed everything in the space of a second thenardier was one of those men who take in a situation at a glance he decided that the moment had arrived for proceeding straightforward and quickly at that 
 he did as great leaders do at the decisive moment which they know that they alone recognize he abruptly unmasked his batteries 
 sir said he i am in need of fifteen hundred francs 
 the stranger took from his side pocket an old pocketbook of black leather opened it drew out three which he laid on the table then he placed his large thumb on the notes and said to the 
 go and fetch cosette 
 while this was taking place what had cosette been doing 
 on waking up cosette had run to get her shoe 
 in it she had found the gold piece 
 it was not a napoleon it was one of those perfectly new pieces of the restoration on whose effigy the little prussian queue had replaced the laurel wreath cosette was dazzled 
 her destiny began to intoxicate her she did not know what a gold piece was she had never seen one she hid it quickly in her pocket as though she had stolen it still she felt that it really was hers she guessed whence her gift had come but the joy which she experienced was full of fear she was happy above all she was stupefied 
 such magnificent and beautiful things did not appear real 
 the doll frightened her the gold piece frightened her 
 she trembled vaguely in the presence of this magnificence 
 the stranger alone did not frighten her on the contrary he reassured her 
 ever since the preceding evening amid all her amazement even in her sleep she had been thinking in her little childish mind of that man who seemed to be so poor and so sad and who was so rich and so kind 
 everything had changed for her since she had met that good man in the forest cosette less happy than the most insignificant swallow of heaven had never known what it was to take refuge under a shadow and under a wing 
 for the last five years that is to say as far back as her memory ran the poor child had shivered and trembled she had always been exposed completely naked to the sharp wind of adversity now it seemed to her she was clothed 
 formerly her soul had seemed cold now it was warm 
 cosette was no longer afraid of the thenardier 
 she was no longer alone there was some one there 
 she hastily set about her regular morning duties 
 that louis which she had about her in the very apron pocket whence the piece had fallen on the night before distracted her thoughts she dared not touch it but she spent five minutes in gazing at it with her tongue hanging out if the truth must be told 
 as she swept the staircase she paused remained standing there motionless forgetful of her broom and of the entire universe occupied in gazing at that star which was blazing at the bottom of her pocket 
 it was during one of these periods of contemplation that the thenardier joined her 
 she had gone in search of cosette at her orders 
 what was quite unprecedented she neither struck her nor said an insulting word to her 
 cosette she said almost gently come immediately 
 an instant later cosette entered the public room 
 the stranger took up the bundle which he had brought and untied it this bundle contained a little woollen gown an apron a fustian bodice a kerchief a petticoat woollen stockings complete outfit for a girl of seven years 
 all was black 
 my child said the man take these and go and dress yourself quickly 
 daylight was appearing when those of the inhabitants of montfermeil who had begun to open their doors beheld a poorly clad old man leading a little girl dressed in mourning and carrying a pink doll in her arms pass along the road to paris 
 they were going in the direction of livry 
 it was our man and cosette 
 no one knew the man as cosette was no longer in rags many did not recognize her 
 cosette was going away 
 with whom 
 she did not know 
 whither 
 she knew not 
 all that she understood was that she was leaving the thenardier tavern behind her 
 no one had thought of bidding her farewell nor had she thought of taking leave of any one 
 she was leaving that hated and hating house 
 poor gentle creature whose heart had been repressed up to that hour 
 cosette walked along gravely with her large eyes wide open and gazing at the sky 
 she had put her louis in the pocket of her new apron 
 from time to time she bent down and glanced at it then she looked at the good man 
 she felt something as though she were beside the good god

 having returned to the regiment and told the commander the state of affairs rostov rode to tilsit with the letter to the emperor 
 on the thirteenth of june the french and russian emperors arrived in tilsit boris drubetskoy had asked the important personage on whom he was in attendance to include him in the suite appointed for the stay at tilsit 
 i should like to see the great man he said alluding to napoleon whom hitherto he like everyone else had always called buonaparte 
 you are speaking of buonaparte asked the general smiling 
 boris looked at his general inquiringly and immediately saw that he was being tested 
 i am speaking prince of the emperor napoleon he replied the general patted him on the shoulder with a smile 
 you will go far he said and took him to tilsit with him 
 boris was among the few present at the niemen on the day the two emperors met he saw the raft decorated with monograms saw napoleon pass before the french guards on the farther bank of the river saw the pensive face of the emperor alexander as he sat in silence in a tavern on the bank of the niemen awaiting arrival saw both emperors get into boats and saw how napoleon reaching the raft first stepped quickly forward to meet alexander and held out his hand to him and how they both retired into the pavilion since he had begun to move in the highest circles boris had made it his habit to watch attentively all that went on around him and to note it down at the time of the meeting at tilsit he asked the names of those who had come with napoleon and about the uniforms they wore and listened attentively to words spoken by important personages at the moment the emperors went into the pavilion he looked at his watch and did not forget to look at it again when alexander came out the interview had lasted an hour and minutes he noted this down that same evening among other facts he felt to be of historic importance as the suite was a very small one it was a matter of great importance for a man who valued his success in the service to be at tilsit on the occasion of this interview between the two emperors and having succeeded in this boris felt that henceforth his position was fully assured he had not only become known but people had grown accustomed to him and accepted him twice he had executed commissions to the emperor himself so that the latter knew his face and all those at court far from him as at first when they considered him a newcomer would now have been surprised had he been absent 
 boris lodged with another adjutant the polish count zhilinski zhilinski a pole brought up in paris was rich and passionately fond of the french and almost every day of the stay at tilsit french officers of the guard and from french headquarters were dining and lunching with him and boris 
 on the evening of the of june count zhilinski arranged a supper for his french friends the guest of honor was an of there were also several french officers of the guard and a page of a young lad of an old aristocratic french family that same day rostov profiting by the darkness to avoid being recognized in civilian dress came to tilsit and went to the lodging occupied by boris and zhilinski 
 rostov in common with the whole army from which he came was far from having experienced the change of feeling toward napoleon and the french who from being foes had suddenly become friends that had taken place at headquarters and in boris in the army bonaparte and the french were still regarded with mingled feelings of anger contempt and fear only recently talking with one of cossack officers rostov had argued that if napoleon were taken prisoner he would be treated not as a sovereign but as a criminal quite lately happening to meet a wounded french colonel on the road rostov had maintained with heat that peace was impossible between a legitimate sovereign and the criminal bonaparte rostov was therefore unpleasantly struck by the presence of french officers in boris lodging dressed in uniforms he had been accustomed to see from quite a different point of view from the outposts of the flank as soon as he noticed a french officer who thrust his head out of the door that warlike feeling of hostility which he always experienced at the sight of the enemy suddenly seized him he stopped at the threshold and asked in russian whether drubetskoy lived there boris hearing a strange voice in the anteroom came out to meet him an expression of annoyance showed itself for a moment on his face on first recognizing rostov 
 ah you very glad very glad to see you he said however coming toward him with a smile but rostov had noticed his first impulse 
 come at a bad time i think i should not have come but i have business he said coldly 
 no i only wonder how you managed to get away from your regiment dans un moment je suis a vous he said answering someone who called him 
 in a minute i shall be at your disposal 
 i see intruding rostov repeated 
 the look of annoyance had already disappeared from boris face having evidently reflected and decided how to act he very quietly took both hands and led him into the next room his eyes looking serenely and steadily at rostov seemed to be veiled by something as if screened by blue spectacles of conventionality so it seemed to rostov 
 oh come now as if you could come at a wrong time said boris and he led him into the room where the supper table was laid and introduced him to his guests explaining that he was not a civilian but an hussar officer and an old friend of his 
 count zhilinski le comte n n le capitaine s s said he naming his guests rostov looked frowningly at the frenchmen bowed reluctantly and remained silent 
 zhilinski evidently did not receive this new russian person very willingly into his circle and did not speak to rostov boris did not appear to notice the constraint the newcomer produced and with the same pleasant composure and the same veiled look in his eyes with which he had met rostov tried to enliven the conversation one of the frenchmen with the politeness characteristic of his countrymen addressed the obstinately taciturn rostov saying that the latter had probably come to tilsit to see the emperor 
 no i came on business replied rostov briefly 
 rostov had been out of humor from the moment he noticed the look of dissatisfaction on boris face and as always happens to those in a bad humor it seemed to him that everyone regarded him with aversion and that he was in way he really was in their way for he alone took no part in the conversation which again became general the looks the visitors cast on him seemed to say and what is he sitting here for he rose and went up to boris 
 anyhow in your way he said in a low tone come and talk over my business and go away 
 oh no not at all said boris but if you are tired come and lie down in my room and have a rest 
 yes really 
 they went into the little room where boris slept rostov without sitting down began at once irritably as if boris were to blame in some way telling him about affair asking him whether through his general he could and would intercede with the emperor on behalf and get petition handed in when he and boris were alone rostov felt for the first time that he could not look boris in the face without a sense of awkwardness boris with one leg crossed over the other and stroking his left hand with the slender fingers of his right listened to rostov as a general listens to the report of a subordinate now looking aside and now gazing straight into eyes with the same veiled look each time this happened rostov felt uncomfortable and cast down his eyes 
 i have heard of such cases and know that his majesty is very severe in such affairs i think it would be best not to bring it before the emperor but to apply to the commander of the corps but in general i think 
 so you want to do anything well then say so rostov almost shouted not looking boris in the face 
 boris smiled 
 on the contrary i will do what i can only i thought 
 at that moment voice was heard calling boris 
 well then go go go said rostov and refusing supper and remaining alone in the little room he walked up and down for a long time hearing the lighthearted french conversation from the next room

 book of the promise made to the dead woman 
 chapter x 
 
 he who seeks to better himself may render his situation worse 
 madame thenardier had allowed her husband to have his own way as was her wont 
 she had expected great results 
 when the man and cosette had taken their departure thenardier allowed a full quarter of an hour to elapse then he took her aside and showed her the fifteen hundred francs 
 is that all said she 
 it was the first time since they had set up housekeeping that she had dared to criticise one of the acts 
 the blow told 
 you are right in sooth said he i am a fool 
 give me my hat 
 he folded up the three thrust them into his pocket and ran out in all haste but he made a mistake and turned to the right first some neighbors of whom he made inquiries put him on the track again the lark and the man had been seen going in the direction of livry he followed these hints walking with great strides and talking to himself the while 
 that man is evidently a million dressed in yellow and i am an animal first he gave twenty sous then five francs then fifty francs then fifteen hundred francs all with equal readiness 
 he would have given fifteen thousand francs 
 but i shall overtake him 
 and then that bundle of clothes prepared beforehand for the child all that was singular many mysteries lay concealed under it one does not let mysteries out of hand when one has once grasped them 
 the secrets of the wealthy are sponges of gold one must know how to subject them to pressure 
 all these thoughts whirled through his brain 
 i am an animal said he 
 when one leaves montfermeil and reaches the turn which the road takes that runs to livry it can be seen stretching out before one to a great distance across the plateau 
 on arriving there he calculated that he ought to be able to see the old man and the child 
 he looked as far as his vision reached and saw nothing he made fresh inquiries but he had wasted time 
 some informed him that the man and child of whom he was in search had gone towards the forest in the direction of gagny 
 he hastened in that direction 
 they were far in advance of him but a child walks slowly and he walked fast and then he was well acquainted with the country 
 all at once he paused and dealt himself a blow on his forehead like a man who has forgotten some essential point and who is ready to retrace his steps 
 i ought to have taken my gun said he to himself 
 thenardier was one of those double natures which sometimes pass through our midst without our being aware of the fact and who disappear without our finding them out because destiny has only exhibited one side of them 
 it is the fate of many men to live thus half submerged 
 in a calm and even situation thenardier possessed all that is required to will not say to be what people have agreed to call an honest trader a good bourgeois at the same time certain circumstances being given certain shocks arriving to bring his to the surface he had all the requisites for a blackguard 
 he was a shopkeeper in whom there was some taint of the monster 
 satan must have occasionally crouched down in some corner of the hovel in which thenardier dwelt and have fallen in the presence of this hideous masterpiece 
 after a momentary hesitation 
 bah he thought they will have time to make their escape 
 and he pursued his road walking rapidly straight ahead and with almost an air of certainty with the sagacity of a fox scenting a covey of partridges 
 in truth when he had passed the ponds and had traversed in an oblique direction the large clearing which lies on the right of the avenue de bellevue and reached that turf alley which nearly makes the circuit of the hill and covers the arch of the ancient aqueduct of the abbey of chelles he caught sight over the top of the brushwood of the hat on which he had already erected so many conjectures it was that hat 
 the brushwood was not high 
 thenardier recognized the fact that the man and cosette were sitting there 
 the child could not be seen on account of her small size but the head of her doll was visible 
 thenardier was not mistaken 
 the man was sitting there and letting cosette get somewhat rested 
 the walked round the brushwood and presented himself abruptly to the eyes of those whom he was in search of 
 pardon excuse me sir he said quite breathless but here are your fifteen hundred francs 
 so saying he handed the stranger the three 
 the man raised his eyes 
 what is the meaning of this 
 thenardier replied respectfully 
 
 it means sir that i shall take back cosette 
 cosette shuddered and pressed close to the old man 
 he replied gazing to the very bottom of eyes the while and enunciating every syllable distinctly 
 you are to take back 
 yes sir i am 
 i will tell you i have considered the matter in fact i have not the right to give her to you 
 i am an honest man you see this child does not belong to me she belongs to her mother it was her mother who confided her to me i can only resign her to her mother 
 you will say to me but her mother is dead good in that case i can only give the child up to the person who shall bring me a writing signed by her mother to the effect that i am to hand the child over to the person therein mentioned that is clear 
 the man without making any reply fumbled in his pocket and thenardier beheld the of make its appearance once more 
 the shivered with joy 
 good thought he let us hold firm he is going to bribe me 
 before opening the the traveller cast a glance about him the spot was absolutely deserted there was not a soul either in the woods or in the valley 
 the man opened his once more and drew from it not the handful of bills which thenardier expected but a simple little paper which he unfolded and presented fully open to the saying 
 you are right read 
 thenardier took the paper and read 
 m sur m march 
 monsieur thenardier 
 you will deliver cosette to this person 
 you will be paid for all the little things 
 i have the honor to salute you with respect 
 fantine 
 you know that signature resumed the man 
 it certainly was signature thenardier recognized it 
 there was no reply to make he experienced two violent vexations the vexation of renouncing the bribery which he had hoped for and the vexation of being beaten the man added 
 you may keep this paper as your receipt 
 thenardier retreated in tolerably good order 
 this signature is fairly well imitated he growled between his teeth however let it go 
 then he essayed a desperate effort 
 it is well sir he said since you are the person but i must be paid for all those little things 
 a great deal is owing to me 
 the man rose to his feet filliping the dust from his sleeve 
 monsieur thenardier in january last the mother reckoned that she owed you one hundred and twenty francs 
 in february you sent her a bill of five hundred francs you received three hundred francs at the end of february and three hundred francs at the beginning of march since then nine months have elapsed at fifteen francs a month the price agreed upon which makes one hundred and francs you had received one hundred francs too much that makes still owing you 
 i have just given you fifteen hundred francs 
 sensations were those of the wolf at the moment when he feels himself nipped and seized by the steel jaw of the trap 
 who is this devil of a man he thought 
 he did what the wolf does 
 he shook himself 
 audacity had succeeded with him once 
 he said resolutely and this time casting aside all respectful ceremony i shall take back cosette if you do not give me a thousand crowns 
 the stranger said tranquilly 
 come cosette 
 he took cosette by his left hand and with his right he picked up his cudgel which was lying on the ground 
 thenardier noted the enormous size of the cudgel and the solitude of the spot 
 the man plunged into the forest with the child leaving the motionless and speechless 
 while they were walking away thenardier scrutinized his huge shoulders which were a little rounded and his great fists 
 then bringing his eyes back to his own person they fell upon his feeble arms and his thin hands 
 i really must have been exceedingly stupid not to have thought to bring my gun he said to himself since i was going hunting 
 however the did not give up 
 i want to know where he is going said he and he set out to follow them at a distance 
 two things were left on his hands an irony in the shape of the paper signed fantine and a consolation the fifteen hundred francs 
 the man led cosette off in the direction of livry and bondy he walked slowly with drooping head in an attitude of reflection and sadness 
 the winter had thinned out the forest so that thenardier did not lose them from sight although he kept at a good distance the man turned round from time to time and looked to see if he was being followed 
 all at once he caught sight of thenardier he plunged suddenly into the brushwood with cosette where they could both hide themselves 
 the deuce said thenardier and he redoubled his pace 
 the thickness of the undergrowth forced him to draw nearer to them when the man had reached the densest part of the thicket he wheeled round 
 it was in vain that thenardier sought to conceal himself in the branches he could not prevent the man seeing him the man cast upon him an uneasy glance then elevated his head and continued his course 
 the set out again in pursuit thus they continued for two or three hundred paces 
 all at once the man turned round once more he saw the this time he gazed at him with so sombre an air that thenardier decided that it was useless to proceed further 
 thenardier retraced his steps

 he who seeks to better himself may render his situation worse 
 madame thenardier had allowed her husband to have his own way as was her wont 
 she had expected great results 
 when the man and cosette had taken their departure thenardier allowed a full quarter of an hour to elapse then he took her aside and showed her the fifteen hundred francs 
 is that all said she 
 it was the first time since they had set up housekeeping that she had dared to criticise one of the acts 
 the blow told 
 you are right in sooth said he i am a fool 
 give me my hat 
 he folded up the three thrust them into his pocket and ran out in all haste but he made a mistake and turned to the right first some neighbors of whom he made inquiries put him on the track again the lark and the man had been seen going in the direction of livry he followed these hints walking with great strides and talking to himself the while 
 that man is evidently a million dressed in yellow and i am an animal first he gave twenty sous then five francs then fifty francs then fifteen hundred francs all with equal readiness 
 he would have given fifteen thousand francs 
 but i shall overtake him 
 and then that bundle of clothes prepared beforehand for the child all that was singular many mysteries lay concealed under it one does not let mysteries out of hand when one has once grasped them 
 the secrets of the wealthy are sponges of gold one must know how to subject them to pressure 
 all these thoughts whirled through his brain 
 i am an animal said he 
 when one leaves montfermeil and reaches the turn which the road takes that runs to livry it can be seen stretching out before one to a great distance across the plateau 
 on arriving there he calculated that he ought to be able to see the old man and the child 
 he looked as far as his vision reached and saw nothing he made fresh inquiries but he had wasted time 
 some informed him that the man and child of whom he was in search had gone towards the forest in the direction of gagny 
 he hastened in that direction 
 they were far in advance of him but a child walks slowly and he walked fast and then he was well acquainted with the country 
 all at once he paused and dealt himself a blow on his forehead like a man who has forgotten some essential point and who is ready to retrace his steps 
 i ought to have taken my gun said he to himself 
 thenardier was one of those double natures which sometimes pass through our midst without our being aware of the fact and who disappear without our finding them out because destiny has only exhibited one side of them 
 it is the fate of many men to live thus half submerged 
 in a calm and even situation thenardier possessed all that is required to will not say to be what people have agreed to call an honest trader a good bourgeois at the same time certain circumstances being given certain shocks arriving to bring his to the surface he had all the requisites for a blackguard 
 he was a shopkeeper in whom there was some taint of the monster 
 satan must have occasionally crouched down in some corner of the hovel in which thenardier dwelt and have fallen in the presence of this hideous masterpiece 
 after a momentary hesitation 
 bah he thought they will have time to make their escape 
 and he pursued his road walking rapidly straight ahead and with almost an air of certainty with the sagacity of a fox scenting a covey of partridges 
 in truth when he had passed the ponds and had traversed in an oblique direction the large clearing which lies on the right of the avenue de bellevue and reached that turf alley which nearly makes the circuit of the hill and covers the arch of the ancient aqueduct of the abbey of chelles he caught sight over the top of the brushwood of the hat on which he had already erected so many conjectures it was that hat 
 the brushwood was not high 
 thenardier recognized the fact that the man and cosette were sitting there 
 the child could not be seen on account of her small size but the head of her doll was visible 
 thenardier was not mistaken 
 the man was sitting there and letting cosette get somewhat rested 
 the walked round the brushwood and presented himself abruptly to the eyes of those whom he was in search of 
 pardon excuse me sir he said quite breathless but here are your fifteen hundred francs 
 so saying he handed the stranger the three 
 the man raised his eyes 
 what is the meaning of this 
 thenardier replied respectfully 
 
 it means sir that i shall take back cosette 
 cosette shuddered and pressed close to the old man 
 he replied gazing to the very bottom of eyes the while and enunciating every syllable distinctly 
 you are to take back 
 yes sir i am 
 i will tell you i have considered the matter in fact i have not the right to give her to you 
 i am an honest man you see this child does not belong to me she belongs to her mother it was her mother who confided her to me i can only resign her to her mother 
 you will say to me but her mother is dead good in that case i can only give the child up to the person who shall bring me a writing signed by her mother to the effect that i am to hand the child over to the person therein mentioned that is clear 
 the man without making any reply fumbled in his pocket and thenardier beheld the of make its appearance once more 
 the shivered with joy 
 good thought he let us hold firm he is going to bribe me 
 before opening the the traveller cast a glance about him the spot was absolutely deserted there was not a soul either in the woods or in the valley 
 the man opened his once more and drew from it not the handful of bills which thenardier expected but a simple little paper which he unfolded and presented fully open to the saying 
 you are right read 
 thenardier took the paper and read 
 m sur m march 
 monsieur thenardier 
 you will deliver cosette to this person 
 you will be paid for all the little things 
 i have the honor to salute you with respect 
 fantine 
 you know that signature resumed the man 
 it certainly was signature thenardier recognized it 
 there was no reply to make he experienced two violent vexations the vexation of renouncing the bribery which he had hoped for and the vexation of being beaten the man added

 then he essayed a desperate effort

 rostov had come to tilsit the day least suitable for a petition on behalf he could not himself go to the general in attendance as he was in mufti and had come to tilsit without permission to do so and boris even had he wished to could not have done so on the following day on that day june the preliminaries of peace were signed the emperors exchanged decorations alexander received the cross of the legion of honor and napoleon the order of st andrew of the first degree and a dinner had been arranged for the evening given by a battalion of the french guards to the preobrazhensk battalion the emperors were to be present at that banquet 
 rostov felt so ill at ease and uncomfortable with boris that when the latter looked in after supper he pretended to be asleep and early next morning went away avoiding boris in his civilian clothes and a round hat he wandered about the town staring at the french and their uniforms and at the streets and houses where the russian and french emperors were staying in a square he saw tables being set up and preparations made for the dinner he saw the russian and french colors draped from side to side of the streets with hugh monograms a and n in the windows of the houses also flags and bunting were displayed 
 boris want to help me and i want to ask him settled thought nicholas all is over between us but i leave here without having done all i can for denisov and certainly not without getting his letter to the emperor the emperor he is here thought rostov who had unconsciously returned to the house where alexander lodged 
 saddled horses were standing before the house and the suite were assembling evidently preparing for the emperor to come out 
 i may see him at any moment thought rostov if only i were to hand the letter direct to him and tell him all could they really arrest me for my civilian clothes surely not he would understand on whose side justice lies he understands everything knows everything who can be more just more magnanimous than he and even if they did arrest me for being here what would it matter thought he looking at an officer who was entering the house the emperor occupied after all people do go in all nonsense go in and hand the letter to the emperor myself so much the worse for drubetskoy who drives me to it and suddenly with a determination he himself did not expect rostov felt for the letter in his pocket and went straight to the house 
 no i miss my opportunity now as i did after austerlitz he thought expecting every moment to meet the monarch and conscious of the blood that rushed to his heart at the thought i will fall at his feet and beseech him he will lift me up will listen and will even thank me i am happy when i can do good but to remedy injustice is the greatest happiness rostov fancied the sovereign saying and passing people who looked after him with curiosity he entered the porch of the house 
 a broad staircase led straight up from the entry and to the right he saw a closed door below under the staircase was a door leading to the lower floor 
 whom do you want someone inquired 
 to hand in a letter a petition to his majesty said nicholas with a tremor in his voice 
 a petition this way to the officer the officer on duty he was shown the door leading downstairs only it be accepted 
 on hearing this indifferent voice rostov grew frightened at what he was doing the thought of meeting the emperor at any moment was so fascinating and consequently so alarming that he was ready to run away but the official who had questioned him opened the door and rostov entered 
 a short stout man of about thirty in white breeches and high boots and a batiste shirt that he had evidently only just put on standing in that room and his valet was buttoning on to the back of his breeches a new pair of handsome braces that for some reason attracted attention this man was was speaking to someone in the adjoining room 
 a good figure and in her first bloom he was saying but on seeing rostov he stopped short and frowned 
 what is it a petition 
 what is it asked the person in the other room 
 another petitioner answered the man with the braces 
 tell him to come later be coming out directly we must go 
 later later tomorrow too late 
 rostov turned and was about to go but the man in the braces stopped him 
 whom have you come from who are you 
 i come from major denisov answered rostov 
 are you an officer 
 lieutenant count rostov 
 what audacity hand it in through your commander and go along with you go and he continued to put on the uniform the valet handed him 
 rostov went back into the hall and noticed that in the porch there were many officers and generals in full parade uniform whom he had to pass 
 cursing his temerity his heart sinking at the thought of finding himself at any moment face to face with the emperor and being put to shame and arrested in his presence fully alive now to the impropriety of his conduct and repenting of it rostov with downcast eyes was making his way out of the house through the brilliant suite when a familiar voice called him and a hand detained him 
 what are you doing here sir in civilian dress asked a deep voice 
 it was a cavalry general who had obtained the special favor during this campaign and who had formerly commanded the division in which rostov was serving 
 rostov in dismay began justifying himself but seeing the kindly jocular face of the general he took him aside and in an excited voice told him the whole affair asking him to intercede for denisov whom the general knew having heard rostov to the end the general shook his head gravely 
 sorry sorry for that fine fellow give me the letter 
 hardly had rostov handed him the letter and finished explaining case when hasty steps and the jingling of spurs were heard on the stairs and the general leaving him went to the porch the gentlemen of the suite ran down the stairs and went to their horses hayne the same groom who had been at austerlitz led up the horse and the faint creak of a footstep rostov knew at once was heard on the stairs forgetting the danger of being recognized rostov went close to the porch together with some inquisitive civilians and again after two years saw those features he adored that same face and same look and step and the same union of majesty and mildness and the feeling of enthusiasm and love for his sovereign rose again in soul in all its old force in the uniform of the preobrazhensk regiment white breeches and high boots and wearing a star rostov did not know it was that of the legion the monarch came out into the porch putting on his gloves and carrying his hat under his arm he stopped and looked about him brightening everything around by his glance he spoke a few words to some of the generals and recognizing the former commander of division smiled and beckoned to him 
 all the suite drew back and rostov saw the general talking for some time to the emperor 
 the emperor said a few words to him and took a step toward his horse again the crowd of members of the suite and street gazers among whom was rostov moved nearer to the emperor stopping beside his horse with his hand on the saddle the emperor turned to the cavalry general and said in a loud voice evidently wishing to be heard by all 
 i cannot do it general i cannot because the law is stronger than i and he raised his foot to the stirrup 
 the general bowed his head respectfully and the monarch mounted and rode down the street at a gallop beside himself with enthusiasm rostov ran after him with the crowd

 chapter xxi 
 
 the emperor rode to the square where facing one another a battalion of the preobrazhensk regiment stood on the right and a battalion of the french guards in their bearskin caps on the left 
 as the tsar rode up to one flank of the battalions which presented arms another group of horsemen galloped up to the opposite flank and at the head of them rostov recognized napoleon it could be no one else he came at a gallop wearing a small hat a blue uniform open over a white vest and the st andrew ribbon over his shoulder he was riding a very fine thoroughbred gray arab horse with a crimson saddlecloth on approaching alexander he raised his hat and as he did so rostov with his eye could not help noticing that napoleon did not sit well or firmly in the saddle the battalions shouted hurrah and vive napoleon said something to alexander and both emperors dismounted and took each hands face wore an unpleasant and artificial smile alexander was saying something affable to him 
 in spite of the trampling of the french gendarmes horses which were pushing back the crowd rostov kept his eyes on every movement of alexander and bonaparte it struck him as a surprise that alexander treated bonaparte as an equal and that the latter was quite at ease with the tsar as if such relations with an emperor were an everyday matter to him 
 alexander and napoleon with the long train of their suites approached the right flank of the preobrazhensk battalion and came straight up to the crowd standing there the crowd unexpectedly found itself so close to the emperors that rostov standing in the front row was afraid he might be recognized 
 sire i ask your permission to present the legion of honor to the bravest of your soldiers said a sharp precise voice articulating every letter 
 this was said by the undersized napoleon looking up straight into eyes alexander listened attentively to what was said to him and bending his head smiled pleasantly

 book five 
 chapter xxi 
 
 the emperor rode to the square where facing one another a battalion of the preobrazhensk regiment stood on the right and a battalion of the french guards in their bearskin caps on the left 
 as the tsar rode up to one flank of the battalions which presented arms another group of horsemen galloped up to the opposite flank and at the head of them rostov recognized napoleon it could be no one else he came at a gallop wearing a small hat a blue uniform open over a white vest and the st andrew ribbon over his shoulder he was riding a very fine thoroughbred gray arab horse with a crimson saddlecloth on approaching alexander he raised his hat and as he did so rostov with his eye could not help noticing that napoleon did not sit well or firmly in the saddle the battalions shouted hurrah and vive napoleon said something to alexander and both emperors dismounted and took each hands face wore an unpleasant and artificial smile alexander was saying something affable to him 
 in spite of the trampling of the french gendarmes horses which were pushing back the crowd rostov kept his eyes on every movement of alexander and bonaparte it struck him as a surprise that alexander treated bonaparte as an equal and that the latter was quite at ease with the tsar as if such relations with an emperor were an everyday matter to him 
 alexander and napoleon with the long train of their suites approached the right flank of the preobrazhensk battalion and came straight up to the crowd standing there the crowd unexpectedly found itself so close to the emperors that rostov standing in the front row was afraid he might be recognized 
 sire i ask your permission to present the legion of honor to the bravest of your soldiers said a sharp precise voice articulating every letter 
 this was said by the undersized napoleon looking up straight into eyes alexander listened attentively to what was said to him and bending his head smiled pleasantly 
 to him who has borne himself most bravely in this last war added napoleon accentuating each syllable as with a composure and assurance exasperating to rostov he ran his eyes over the russian ranks drawn up before him who all presented arms with their eyes fixed on their emperor 
 will your majesty allow me to consult the colonel said alexander and took a few hasty steps toward prince kozlovski the commander of the battalion

 book gorbeau hovel 
 chapter i 
 
 master gorbeau 
 forty years ago a rambler who had ventured into that unknown country of the salpetriere and who had mounted to the barriere by way of the boulevard reached a point where it might be said that paris disappeared 
 it was no longer solitude for there were it was not the country for there were houses and streets it was not the city for the streets had ruts like highways and the grass grew in them it was not a village the houses were too lofty 
 what was it then 
 it was an inhabited spot where there was no one it was a desert place where there was some one it was a boulevard of the great city a street of paris more wild at night than the forest more gloomy by day than a cemetery 
 it was the old quarter of the 
 the rambler if he risked himself outside the four decrepit walls of this if he consented even to pass beyond the rue du after leaving on his right a garden protected by high walls then a field in which mills rose like gigantic beaver huts then an enclosure encumbered with timber with a heap of stumps sawdust and shavings on which stood a large dog barking then a long low utterly dilapidated wall with a little black door in mourning laden with mosses which were covered with flowers in the spring then in the most deserted spot a frightful and decrepit building on which ran the inscription in large letters 
 post no daring rambler would have reached little known latitudes at the corner of the rue des there near a factory and between two garden walls there could be seen at that epoch a mean building which at the first glance seemed as small as a thatched hovel and which was in reality as large as a cathedral it presented its side and gable to the public road hence its apparent diminutiveness 
 nearly the whole of the house was hidden only the door and one window could be seen 
 this hovel was only one story high 
 the first detail that struck the observer was that the door could never have been anything but the door of a hovel while the window if it had been carved out of dressed stone instead of being in rough masonry might have been the lattice of a lordly mansion 
 the door was nothing but a collection of planks roughly bound together by which resembled roughly hewn logs it opened directly on a steep staircase of lofty steps muddy chalky dusty steps of the same width as itself which could be seen from the street running straight up like a ladder and disappearing in the darkness between two walls 
 the top of the shapeless bay into which this door shut was masked by a narrow scantling in the centre of which a triangular hole had been sawed which served both as wicket and when the door was closed on the inside of the door the figures had been traced with a couple of strokes of a brush dipped in ink and above the scantling the same hand had daubed the number so that one hesitated where was one 
 above the door it said number the inside replied no number 
 no one knows what figures were suspended like draperies from the triangular opening 
 the window was large sufficiently elevated garnished with venetian blinds and with a frame in large square panes only these large panes were suffering from various wounds which were both concealed and betrayed by an ingenious paper bandage and the blinds dislocated and unpasted threatened rather than screened the occupants 
 the horizontal slats were missing here and there and had been naively replaced with boards nailed on perpendicularly so that what began as a blind ended as a shutter 
 this door with an unclean and this window with an honest though dilapidated air thus beheld on the same house produced the effect of two incomplete beggars walking side by side with different miens beneath the same rags the one having always been a mendicant and the other having once been a gentleman 
 the staircase led to a very vast edifice which resembled a shed which had been converted into a house 
 this edifice had for its intestinal tube a long corridor on which opened to right and left sorts of compartments of varied dimensions which were inhabitable under stress of circumstances and rather more like stalls than cells these chambers received their light from the vague waste grounds in the neighborhood 
 all this was dark disagreeable wan melancholy sepulchral traversed according as the crevices lay in the roof or in the door by cold rays or by icy winds 
 an interesting and picturesque peculiarity of this sort of dwelling is the enormous size of the spiders 
 to the left of the entrance door on the boulevard side at about the height of a man from the ground a small window which had been walled up formed a square niche full of stones which the children had thrown there as they passed by 
 a portion of this building has recently been demolished from what still remains of it one can form a judgment as to what it was in former days 
 as a whole it was not over a hundred years old a hundred years is youth in a church and age in a house it seems as though lodging partook of his ephemeral character and house of his eternity 
 the postmen called the house number but it was known in the neighborhood as the gorbeau house 
 let us explain whence this appellation was derived 
 collectors of petty details who become herbalists of anecdotes and prick slippery dates into their memories with a pin know that there was in paris during the last century about two attorneys at the chatelet named one corbeau raven the other renard fox the two names had been forestalled by la fontaine the opportunity was too fine for the lawyers they made the most of it a parody was immediately put in circulation in the galleries of the in verses that limped a little 
 maitre corbeau sur un dossier perche 
 tenait dans son bee une saisie executoire 
 maitre renard par alleche 
 lui fit a peu pres cette histoire he bonjour 
 etc 
 lawyer corbeau perched on a docket held in his beak a writ of execution lawyer renard attracted by the smell addressed him nearly as follows etc 
 the two honest practitioners embarrassed by the jests and finding the bearing of their heads interfered with by the shouts of laughter which followed them resolved to get rid of their names and hit upon the expedient of applying to the king 
 their petition was presented to louis xv 
 on the same day when the papal nuncio on the one hand and the cardinal de la on the other both devoutly kneeling were each engaged in putting on in his presence a slipper on the bare feet of madame du barry who had just got out of bed 
 the king who was laughing continued to laugh passed gayly from the two bishops to the two lawyers and bestowed on these limbs of the law their former names or nearly so 
 by the kings command maitre corbeau was permitted to add a tail to his initial letter and to call himself gorbeau maitre renard was less lucky all he obtained was leave to place a p in front of his r and to call himself prenard so that the second name bore almost as much resemblance as the first 
 now according to local tradition this maitre gorbeau had been the proprietor of the building numbered on the boulevard de he was even the author of the monumental window 
 hence the edifice bore the name of the gorbeau house 
 opposite this house among the trees of the boulevard rose a great elm which was dead almost directly facing it opens the rue de la barriere des gobelins a street then without houses unpaved planted with unhealthy trees which was green or muddy according to the season and which ended squarely in the exterior wall of paris 
 an odor of copperas issued in puffs from the roofs of the neighboring factory 
 the barrier was close at hand 
 in the city wall was still in existence 
 this barrier itself evoked gloomy fancies in the mind 
 it was the road to bicetre 
 it was through it that under the empire and the restoration prisoners condemned to death paris on the day of their execution 
 it was there that about was committed that mysterious assassination called the assassination of the fontainebleau barrier whose authors justice was never able to discover a melancholy problem which has never been elucidated a frightful enigma which has never been unriddled 
 take a few steps and you come upon that fatal rue croulebarbe where ulbach stabbed the of ivry to the sound of thunder as in the melodramas a few paces more and you arrive at the abominable pollarded elms of the barriere that expedient of the philanthropist to conceal the scaffold that miserable and shameful place de grove of a and bourgeois society which recoiled before the death penalty neither daring to abolish it with grandeur nor to uphold it with authority 
 leaving aside this place which was as it were predestined and which has always been horrible probably the most mournful spot on that mournful boulevard seven and thirty years ago was the spot which even is so unattractive where stood the building number 
 bourgeois houses only began to spring up there years later the place was unpleasant 
 in addition to the gloomy thoughts which assailed one there one was conscious of being between the salpetriere a glimpse of whose dome could be seen and bicetre whose outskirts one was fairly touching that is to say between the madness of women and the madness of men 
 as far as the eye could see one could perceive nothing but the abattoirs the city wall and the fronts of a few factories resembling barracks or monasteries everywhere about stood hovels rubbish ancient walls blackened like cerecloths new white walls like everywhere parallel rows of trees buildings erected on a line flat constructions long cold rows and the melancholy sadness of right angles 
 not an unevenness of the ground not a caprice in the architecture not a fold the ensemble was glacial regular hideous 
 nothing oppresses the heart like symmetry 
 it is because symmetry is ennui and ennui is at the very foundation of grief 
 despair yawns something more terrible than a hell where one suffers may be imagined and that is a hell where one is bored 
 if such a hell existed that bit of the boulevard de might have formed the entrance to it 
 nevertheless at nightfall at the moment when the daylight is vanishing especially in winter at the hour when the twilight breeze tears from the elms their last russet leaves when the darkness is deep and starless or when the moon and the wind are making openings in the clouds and losing themselves in the shadows this boulevard suddenly becomes frightful 
 the black lines sink inwards and are lost in the shades like morsels of the infinite the cannot refrain from recalling the innumerable traditions of the place which are connected with the gibbet the solitude of this spot where so many crimes have been committed had something terrible about it 
 one almost had a presentiment of meeting with traps in that darkness all the confused forms of the darkness seemed suspicious and the long hollow square of which one caught a glimpse between each tree seemed graves by day it was ugly in the evening melancholy by night it was sinister 
 in summer at twilight one saw here and there a few old women seated at the foot of the elm on benches mouldy with rain these good old women were fond of begging 
 however this quarter which had a superannuated rather than an antique air was tending even then to transformation 
 even at that time any one who was desirous of seeing it had to make haste each day some detail of the whole effect was disappearing for the last twenty years the station of the orleans railway has stood beside the old faubourg and distracted it as it does wherever it is placed on the borders of a capital a railway station is the death of a suburb and the birth of a city it seems as though around these great centres of the movements of a people the earth full of germs trembled and yawned to engulf the ancient dwellings of men and to allow new ones to spring forth at the rattle of these powerful machines at the breath of these monstrous horses of civilization which devour coal and vomit fire the old houses crumble and new ones rise 
 since the orleans railway has invaded the region of the salpetriere the ancient narrow streets which adjoin the moats and the jardin des plantes tremble as they are violently traversed three or four times each day by those currents of coach fiacres and omnibuses which in a given time crowd back the houses to the right and the left for there are things which are odd when said that are rigorously exact and just as it is true to say that in large cities the sun makes the southern fronts of houses to vegetate and grow it is certain that the frequent passage of vehicles enlarges streets 
 the symptoms of a new life are evident in this old provincial quarter in the wildest nooks the pavement shows itself the sidewalks begin to crawl and to grow longer even where there are as yet no pedestrians 
 one memorable morning in july black pots of bitumen were seen smoking there on that day it might be said that civilization had arrived in the rue de and that paris had entered the suburb of

 chapter i 
 
 master gorbeau 
 forty years ago a rambler who had ventured into that unknown country of the salpetriere and who had mounted to the barriere by way of the boulevard reached a point where it might be said that paris disappeared 
 it was no longer solitude for there were it was not the country for there were houses and streets it was not the city for the streets had ruts like highways and the grass grew in them it was not a village the houses were too lofty 
 what was it then 
 it was an inhabited spot where there was no one it was a desert place where there was some one it was a boulevard of the great city a street of paris more wild at night than the forest more gloomy by day than a cemetery 
 it was the old quarter of the 
 the rambler if he risked himself outside the four decrepit walls of this if he consented even to pass beyond the rue du after leaving on his right a garden protected by high walls then a field in which mills rose like gigantic beaver huts then an enclosure encumbered with timber with a heap of stumps sawdust and shavings on which stood a large dog barking then a long low utterly dilapidated wall with a little black door in mourning laden with mosses which were covered with flowers in the spring then in the most deserted spot a frightful and decrepit building on which ran the inscription in large letters 
 post no daring rambler would have reached little known latitudes at the corner of the rue des there near a factory and between two garden walls there could be seen at that epoch a mean building which at the first glance seemed as small as a thatched hovel and which was in reality as large as a cathedral it presented its side and gable to the public road hence its apparent diminutiveness 
 nearly the whole of the house was hidden only the door and one window could be seen 
 this hovel was only one story high 
 the first detail that struck the observer was that the door could never have been anything but the door of a hovel while the window if it had been carved out of dressed stone instead of being in rough masonry might have been the lattice of a lordly mansion 
 the door was nothing but a collection of planks roughly bound together by which resembled roughly hewn logs it opened directly on a steep staircase of lofty steps muddy chalky dusty steps of the same width as itself which could be seen from the street running straight up like a ladder and disappearing in the darkness between two walls 
 the top of the shapeless bay into which this door shut was masked by a narrow scantling in the centre of which a triangular hole had been sawed which served both as wicket and when the door was closed on the inside of the door the figures had been traced with a couple of strokes of a brush dipped in ink and above the scantling the same hand had daubed the number so that one hesitated where was one 
 above the door it said number the inside replied no number 
 no one knows what figures were suspended like draperies from the triangular opening 
 the window was large sufficiently elevated garnished with venetian blinds and with a frame in large square panes only these large panes were suffering from various wounds which were both concealed and betrayed by an ingenious paper bandage and the blinds dislocated and unpasted threatened rather than screened the occupants 
 the horizontal slats were missing here and there and had been naively replaced with boards nailed on perpendicularly so that what began as a blind ended as a shutter 
 this door with an unclean and this window with an honest though dilapidated air thus beheld on the same house produced the effect of two incomplete beggars walking side by side with different miens beneath the same rags the one having always been a mendicant and the other having once been a gentleman 
 the staircase led to a very vast edifice which resembled a shed which had been converted into a house 
 this edifice had for its intestinal tube a long corridor on which opened to right and left sorts of compartments of varied dimensions which were inhabitable under stress of circumstances and rather more like stalls than cells these chambers received their light from the vague waste grounds in the neighborhood 
 all this was dark disagreeable wan melancholy sepulchral traversed according as the crevices lay in the roof or in the door by cold rays or by icy winds 
 an interesting and picturesque peculiarity of this sort of dwelling is the enormous size of the spiders 
 to the left of the entrance door on the boulevard side at about the height of a man from the ground a small window which had been walled up formed a square niche full of stones which the children had thrown there as they passed by 
 a portion of this building has recently been demolished from what still remains of it one can form a judgment as to what it was in former days 
 as a whole it was not over a hundred years old a hundred years is youth in a church and age in a house it seems as though lodging partook of his ephemeral character and house of his eternity 
 the postmen called the house number but it was known in the neighborhood as the gorbeau house 
 let us explain whence this appellation was derived 
 collectors of petty details who become herbalists of anecdotes and prick slippery dates into their memories with a pin know that there was in paris during the last century about two attorneys at the chatelet named one corbeau raven the other renard fox the two names had been forestalled by la fontaine the opportunity was too fine for the lawyers they made the most of it a parody was immediately put in circulation in the galleries of the in verses that limped a little 
 maitre corbeau sur un dossier perche 
 tenait dans son bee une saisie executoire 
 maitre renard par alleche 
 lui fit a peu pres cette histoire he bonjour 
 etc 
 lawyer corbeau perched on a docket held in his beak a writ of execution lawyer renard attracted by the smell addressed him nearly as follows etc 
 the two honest practitioners embarrassed by the jests and finding the bearing of their heads interfered with by the shouts of laughter which followed them resolved to get rid of their names and hit upon the expedient of applying to the king 
 their petition was presented to louis xv 
 on the same day when the papal nuncio on the one hand and the cardinal de la on the other both devoutly kneeling were each engaged in putting on in his presence a slipper on the bare feet of madame du barry who had just got out of bed 
 the king who was laughing continued to laugh passed gayly from the two bishops to the two lawyers and bestowed on these limbs of the law their former names or nearly so 
 by the kings command maitre corbeau was permitted to add a tail to his initial letter and to call himself gorbeau maitre renard was less lucky all he obtained was leave to place a p in front of his r and to call himself prenard so that the second name bore almost as much resemblance as the first 
 now according to local tradition this maitre gorbeau had been the proprietor of the building numbered on the boulevard de he was even the author of the monumental window 
 hence the edifice bore the name of the gorbeau house 
 opposite this house among the trees of the boulevard rose a great elm which was dead almost directly facing it opens the rue de la barriere des gobelins a street then without houses unpaved planted with unhealthy trees which was green or muddy according to the season and which ended squarely in the exterior wall of paris 
 an odor of copperas issued in puffs from the roofs of the neighboring factory 
 the barrier was close at hand 
 in the city wall was still in existence 
 this barrier itself evoked gloomy fancies in the mind 
 it was the road to bicetre 
 it was through it that under the empire and the restoration prisoners condemned to death paris on the day of their execution 
 it was there that about was committed that mysterious assassination called the assassination of the fontainebleau barrier whose authors justice was never able to discover a melancholy problem which has never been elucidated a frightful enigma which has never been unriddled 
 take a few steps and you come upon that fatal rue croulebarbe where ulbach stabbed the of ivry to the sound of thunder as in the melodramas a few paces more and you arrive at the abominable pollarded elms of the barriere that expedient of the philanthropist to conceal the scaffold that miserable and shameful place de grove of a and bourgeois society which recoiled before the death penalty neither daring to abolish it with grandeur nor to uphold it with authority
