 despite the fact that he had spent every waking moment of the past few days hoping desperately that dumbledore would indeed come to fetch him harry felt distinctly awkward as they set off down privet drive together he had never had a proper conversation with the headmaster outside of hogwarts before there was usually a desk between them the memory of their last encounter kept intruding too and it rather heightened sense of embarrassment he had shouted a lot on that occasion not to mention done his best to smash several of most prized possessions 
 
 dumbledore however seemed completely relaxed 
 
 keep your wand at the ready harry he said brightly 
 
 but i thought not allowed to use magic outside school sir 
 
 if there is an attack said dumbledore i give you permission to use any or curse that might occur to you however i do not think you need worry about being attacked tonight 
 
 why not sir 
 
 you are with me said dumbledore simply this will do harry 
 
 he came to an abrupt halt at the end of privet drive 
 
 you have not of course passed your apparition test he said 
 
 no said harry i thought you had to be seventeen 
 
 you do said dumbledore so you will need to hold on to my arm very tightly my left if you mindas you have noticed my wand arm is a little fragile at the moment 
 
 harry gripped proffered forearm 
 
 very good said dumbledore well here we go 
 
 harry felt arm twist away from him and redoubled his grip the next thing he knew everything went black he was being pressed very hard from all directions he could not breathe there were iron bands tightening around his chest his eyeballs were being forced back into his head his eardrums were being pushed deeper into his skull and then 
 
 he gulped great lungfulls of cold night air and opened his streaming eyes he felt as though he had just been forced through a very tight rubber tube it was a few seconds before he realized that privet drive had vanished he and dumbledore were now standing in what appeared to be a deserted village square in the center of which stood an old war memorial and a few benches his comprehension catching up with his senses harry realized that he had just apparated for the first time in his life 
 
 are you all right asked dumbledore looking down at him solicitously the sensation does take some getting used to 
 
 fine said harry rubbing his ears which felt as though they had left privet drive rather reluctantly but i think i might prefer brooms 
 
 dumbledore smiled drew his traveling cloak a little more lightly around his neck and said this way 
 
 he set off at a brisk pace past an empty inn and a few houses according to a clock on a nearby church it was almost midnight 
 
 so tell me harry said dumbledore your scar has it been hurting at all 
 
 harry raised a hand unconsciously to his forehead and rubbed the mark 
 
 no he said and been wondering about that i thought it would be burning all the time now getting so powerful again 
 
 he glanced up at dumbledore and saw that he was wearing a satisfied expression 
 
 i on the other hand thought otherwise said dumbledore lord voldemort has finally realized the dangerous access to his thoughts and feelings you have been enjoying it appears that he is now employing occlumency against you 
 
 well not complaining said harry who missed neither the disturbing dreams nor the startling flashes of insight into mind 
 
 they turned a corner passing a telephone box and a bus shelter harry looked sideways at dumbledore again professor 
 
 harry 
 
 erwhere exactly are we 
 
 this harry is the charming village of budleigh babberton 
 
 and what are we doing here 
 
 ah yes of course i told you said dumbledore well i have lost count of the number of times i have said this in recent years but we are once again one member of staff short we are here to persuade an old colleague of mine to come out of retirement and return to hogwarts 
 
 how can i help with that sir 
 
 oh i think find a use for you said dumbledore vaguely left here harry 
 
 they proceeded up a steep narrow street lined with houses all the windows were dark the odd chill that had lain over privet drive for two weeks persisted here too thinking of dementors harry cast a look over his shoulder and grasped his wand reassuringly in his pocket 
 
 professor why we just apparate directly into your old house 
 
 because it would be quite as rude as kicking down the front door said dumbledore courtesy dictates that we offer fellow wizards the opportunity of denying us entry in any case most wizarding dwellings are magically protected from unwanted apparators at hogwarts for instance 
 
 you apparate anywhere inside the buildings or grounds said harry quickly hermione granger told me 
 
 and she is quite right we turn left again 
 
 the church clock chimed midnight behind them harry wondered why dumbledore did not consider it rude to call on his old colleague so late but now that conversation had been established he had more pressing questions to ask 
 
 sir i saw in the daily prophet that fudge has been sacked 
 
 correct said dumbledore now turning up a steep side street he has been replaced as i am sure you also saw by rufus scrimgeour who used to be head of the auror office 
 
 is he do you think good asked harry 
 
 an interesting question said dumbledore he is able certainly a more decisive and forceful personality than cornelius 
 
 yes but i meant 
 
 i know what you meant rufus is a man of action and having fought dark wizards for most of his working life does not underestimate lord voldemort 
 
 harry waited but dumbledore did not say anything about the disagreement with scrimgeour that the daily prophet had reported and he did not have the nerve to pursue the subject so he changed it 
 
 and sir i saw about madam bones 
 
 yes said dumbledore quietly a terrible loss she was a great witch just up here i think ouch 
 
 he had pointed with his injured hand 
 
 professor what happened to your 
 
 i have no time to explain now said dumbledore it is a thrilling tale i wish to do it justice 
 
 he smiled at harry who understood that he was not being snubbed and that he had permission to keep asking questions 
 
 sir i got a ministry of magic leaflet by owl about security measures we should all take against the death eaters 
 
 yes i received one myself said dumbledore still smiling did you find it useful 
 
 not really 
 
 no i thought not you have not asked me for instance what is my favorite flavor of jam to check that i am indeed professor dumbledore and not an impostor 
 
 i harry began not entirely sure whether he was being reprimanded or not 
 
 for future reference harry it is raspberry although of course if i were a death eater i would have been sure to research my own jam preferences before impersonating myself 
 
 er right said harry well on that leaflet it said something about inferi what exactly are they the leaflet very clear 
 
 they are corpses said dumbledore calmly dead bodies that have been bewitched to do a dark bidding inferi have not been seen for a long time however not since voldemort was last powerful he killed enough people to make an army of them of course this is the place harry just here 
 
 they were nearing a small neat stone house set in its own garden harry was too busy digesting the horrible idea of inferi to have much attention left for anything else but as they reached the front gate dumbledore stopped dead and harry walked into him 
 
 oh dear oh dear dear dear 
 
 harry followed his gaze up the carefully tended front path and felt his heart sink the front door was hanging off its hinges 
 
 dumbledore glanced up and down the street it seemed quite deserted 
 
 wand out and follow me harry he said quietly 
 
 he opened the gate and walked swiftly and silently up the garden path harry at his heels then pushed the front door very slowly his wand raised and at the ready 
 
 lumos 
 
 wand tip ignited casting its light up a narrow hallway to the left another door stood open holding his illuminated wand aloft dumbledore walked into the sitting room with harry right behind him 
 
 a scene of total devastation met their eyes a grandfather clock lay splintered at their feet its face cracked its pendulum lying a little farther away like a dropped sword a piano was on its side its keys strewn across the floor the wreckage of a fallen chandelier flittered nearby cushions lay deflated feathers oozing from slashes in their sides fragments of glass and china lay like powder over everything dumbledore raised his wand even higher so that its light was thrown upon the walls where something darkly red and glutinous was spattered over the wallpaper small intake of breath made dumbledore look around 
 
 not pretty is it he said heavily yes something horrible has happened here 
 
 dumbledore moved carefully into the middle of the room scrutinizing the wreckage at his feet harry followed gazing around of what he might see hidden behind the wreck of the piano or the overturned sofa but there was no sign of a body 
 
 maybe there was a fight and and they dragged him off professor harry suggested trying not to imagine how badly wounded a man would have to be to leave those stains spattered halfway up the walls 
 
 i think so said dumbledore quietly peering behind an overstuffed armchair lying on its side 
 
 you mean 
 
 still here somewhere yes 
 
 and without warning dumbledore swooped plunging the tip of his wand into the seat of the overstuffed armchair which yelled ouch 
 
 good evening horace said dumbledore straightening up again 
 
 jaw dropped where a split second before there had been an armchair there now crouched an enormously fat bald old man who was massaging his lower belly and squinting up at dumbledore with an aggrieved and watery eye 
 
 there was no need to stick the wand in that hard he said gruffly clambering to his feet it hurt 
 
 the wandlight sparkled on his shiny pate his prominent eyes his enormous silver walruslike mustache and the highly polished buttons on the maroon velvet jacket he was wearing over a pair of lilac silk pajamas the top of his head barely reached chin 
 
 what gave it away he grunted as he staggered to his feet still rubbing his lower belly he seemed remarkably unabashed for a man who had just been discovered pretending to be an armchair 
 
 my dear horace said dumbledore looking amused if the death eaters really had come to call the dark mark would have been set over the house 
 
 the wizard clapped a pudgy hand to his vast forehead 
 
 the dark mark he muttered knew there was something ah well have had time anyway only just put the finishing touches to my upholstery when you entered the room 
 
 he heaved a great sigh that made the ends of his mustache flutter 
 
 would you like my assistance clearing up asked dumbledore politely 
 
 please said the other 
 
 they stood back to back the tall thin wizard and the short round one and waved their wands in one identical sweeping motion 
 
 the furniture flew back to its original places ornaments in midair feathers zoomed into their cushions torn books repaired themselves as they landed upon their shelves oil lanterns soared onto side tables and reignited avast collection of splintered silver picture frames flew glittering across the room and alighted whole and untarnished upon a desk rips cracks and holes healed everywhere and the walls wiped themselves clean 
 
 what kind of blood was that incidentally asked dumbledore loudly over the chiming of the newly unsmashed grandfather flock 
 
 on the walls dragon shouted the wizard called horace as with a deafening grinding and tinkling the chandelier screwed itself back into the ceiling 
 
 there was a final plunk from the piano and silence 
 
 yes dragon repeated the wizard conversationally my last bottle and prices are at the moment still it might be reusable 
 
 he stumped over to a small crystal bottle standing on top of a sideboard and held it up to the light examining the thick liquid within 
 
 hmm bit dusty 
 
 he set the bottle back on the sideboard and sighed it was then that his gaze fell upon harry 
 
 oho he said his large round eyes flying to forehead and the scar it bore oho 
 
 this said dumbledore moving forward to make the introduction is harry potter harry this is an old friend and colleague of mine horace slughorn 
 
 slughorn turned on dumbledore his expression shrewd 
 
 so how you thought persuade me is it well the no albus 
 
 he pushed past harry his face turned resolutely away with the air of a man trying to resist temptation 
 
 i suppose we can have a drink at least asked dumbledore for old sake 
 
 slughorn hesitated 
 
 all right then one drink he said ungraciously 
 
 dumbledore smiled at harry and directed him toward a chair not unlike the one that slughorn had so recently impersonated which stood right beside the newly burning fire and a brightly glowing oil lamp harry took the seat with the distinct impression that dumbledore for some reason wanted to keep him as visible as possible certainly when slughorn who had been busy with decanters and glasses turned to face the room again his eyes fell immediately upon harry 
 
 hmpf he said looking away quickly as though frightened of hurting his eyes here he gave a drink to dumbledore who had sat down without invitation thrust the tray at harry and then sank into the cushions of the repaired sofa and a disgruntled silence his legs were so short they did not touch the floor 
 
 well how have you been keeping horace dumbledore asked 
 
 not so well said slughorn at once weak chest wheezy rheumatism too move like i used to well to be expected old age fatigue 
 
 and yet you must have moved fairly quickly to prepare such a welcome for us at such short notice said dumbledore you have had more than three minutes warning 
 
 slughorn said half irritably half proudly two hear my intruder charm go off i was taking a bath still he added sternly seeming to pull himself back together again the fact remains that an old man albus a tired old man earned the right to a quiet life and a few creature comforts 
 
 he certainly had those thought harry looking around the room it was stuffy and cluttered yet nobody could say it was uncomfortable there were soft chairs and footstools drinks and books boxes of chocolates and plump cushions if harry had not known who lived there he would have guessed at a rich fussy old lady 
 
 not yet as old as i am horace said dumbledore 
 
 well maybe you ought to think about retirement yourself said slughorn bluntly his pale gooseberry eyes had found injured hand reactions not what they were i see 
 
 quite right said dumbledore serenely shaking back his sleeve to reveal the tips of those burned and blackened fingers the sight of them made the back of neck prickle unpleasantly i am undoubtedly slower than i was but on the other hand 
 
 he shrugged and spread his hands wide as though to say that age had its compensations and harry noticed a ring on his uninjured hand that he had never seen dumbledore wear before it was large rather clumsily made of what looked like gold and was set with a heavy black stone that had cracked down the middle eyes lingered for a moment on the ring too and harry saw a tiny frown momentarily crease his wide forehead 
 
 so all these precautions against intruders horace are they for the death eaters benefit or mine asked dumbledore 
 
 what would the death eaters want with a poor old buffer like me demanded slughorn 
 
 i imagine that they would want you to turn your considerable talents to coercion torture and murder said dumbledore are you really telling me that they come recruiting yet 
 
 slughorn eyed dumbledore balefully for a moment then muttered i given them the chance been on the move for a year never stay in one place more than a week move from muggle house to muggle housethe owners of this place are on holiday in the canary been very pleasant be sorry to leave quite easy once you know how one simple freezing charm on these absurd burglar alarms they use instead of sneakoscopes and make sure the neighbors spot you bringing in the piano 
 
 ingenious said dumbledore but it sounds a rather tiring existence for a old buffer in search of a quiet life now if you were to return to hogwarts 
 
 if going to tell me my life would be more peaceful at that pestilential school you can save your breath albus i might have been in hiding but some funny rumors have reached me since dolores umbridge left if how you treat teachers these days 
 
 professor umbridge ran afoul of our centaur herd said dumbledore i think you horace would have known better than to stride into the forest and call a horde of angry centaurs filthy 
 
 what she did did she said slughorn idiotic woman never liked her 
 
 harry chuckled and both dumbledore and slughorn looked round at him 
 
 sorry harry said hastily justi like her either 
 
 dumbledore stood up rather suddenly 
 
 are you leaving asked slughorn at once looking hopeful 
 
 no i was wondering whether i might use your bathroom said dumbledore 
 
 oh said slughorn clearly disappointed second on the left down the hall 
 
 dumbledore strode from the room once the door had closed behind him there was silence after a few moments slughorn got to his feet but seemed uncertain what to do with himself he shot a furtive look at harry then crossed to the fire and turned his back on it warming his wide behind 
 
 think i know why brought you he said abruptly 
 
 harry merely looked at slughorn watery eyes slid over scar this time taking in the rest of his face 
 
 you look very like your father 
 
 yeah been told said harry 
 
 except for your eyes got 
 
 my eyes yeah harry had heard it so often he found it a bit wearing 
 
 hmpf yes well you have favorites as a teacher of course but she was one of mine your mother slughorn added in answer to questioning look lily evans one of the brightest i ever taught vivacious you know charming girl i used to tell her she ought to have been in my house very cheeky answers i used to get back too 
 
 which was your house 
 
 i was head of slytherin said slughorn oh now he went on quickly seeing the expression on face and wagging a stubby ringer at him go holding that against me be gryffindor like her i suppose yes it usually goes in families not always though ever heard of sirius black you must have donebeen in the papers for the last couple of yearsdied a few weeks ago 
 
 it was as though an invisible hand had twisted intestines and held them tight 
 
 well anyway he was a big pal of your at school the whole black family had been in my house but sirius ended up in gryffindor shamehe was a talented boy i got his brother regulus when he came along but have liked the set 
 
 he sounded like an enthusiastic collector who had been outbid at auction apparently lost in memories he gazed at the opposite wall turning idly on the spot to ensure an even heat on his backside 
 
 your mother was of course believe it when i found out thought she must have been she was so good 
 
 one of my best friends is said harry and the best in our year 
 
 funny how that sometimes happens it said slughorn 
 
 not really said harry coldly 
 
 slughorn looked down at him in surprise 
 
 you think prejudiced he said no no no i just said your mother was one of my favorite students and there was dirk cresswell in the year after her toonow head of the goblin liaison office of courseanother a very gifted student and still gives me excellent inside information on the at gringotts 
 
 he bounced up and down a little smiling in a way and pointed at the many glittering photograph frames on the dresser each peopled with tiny moving occupants 
 
 all all signed notice barnabas cuffe editor of the daily prophet always interested to hear my take on the news and ambrosius flume of honeydukesa hamper every birthday and all because i was able to give him an introduction to ciceron harkisss who gave him his first job and at the back see her if you just crane your gwenog jones who of course captains the holyhead harpies people are always astonished to hear on terms with the harpies and free tickets whenever i want them 
 
 this thought seemed to cheer him up enormously 
 
 and all these people know where to find you to send you stuff asked harry who could not help wondering why the death eaters had not yet tracked down slughorn if hampers of sweets quidditch tickets and visitors craving his advice and opinions could find him 
 
 the smile slid from face as quickly as the blood from his walls 
 
 of course not he said looking down at harry i have been out of touch with everybody for a year 
 
 harry had the impression that the words shocked slughorn himself he looked quite unsettled for a moment then he shrugged 
 
 still the prudent wizard keeps his head down in such times all very well for dumbledore to talk but taking up a post at hogwarts just now would be tantamount to declaring my public allegiance to the order of the phoenix and while sure very admirable and brave and all the rest of it i personally fancy the mortality rate 
 
 you have to join the order to teach at hogwarts said harry who could not quite keep a note of derision out of his voice it was hard to sympathize with cosseted existence when he remembered sirius crouching in a cave and living on rats most of the teachers in it and none of them has ever been killedwell unless you count quirrell and he got what he deserved seeing as he was working with voldemort 
 
 harry had been sure slughorn would be one of those wizards who could not bear to hear name spoken aloud and was not disappointed slughorn gave a shudder and a squawk of protest which harry ignored 
 
 i reckon the staff are safer than most people while headmaster supposed to be the only one voldemort ever feared he harry went on 
 
 slughorn gazed into space for a moment or two he seemed to be thinking over words 
 
 well yes it is true that has never sought a fight with dumbledore he muttered grudgingly and i suppose one could argue that as i have not joined the death eaters can hardly count me a friend in which case i might well be safer a little closer to albus i cannot pretend that amelia death did not shake me if she with all her ministry contacts and protection 
 
 dumbledore the room and slughorn jumped as though he had forgotten he was in the house 
 
 oh there you are albus he said been a very long time upset stomach 
 
 no i was merely reading the muggle magazines said dumbledore i do love knitting patterns well harry we have trespassed upon hospitality quite long enough i think it is time for us to leave 
 
 not at all reluctant to obey harry jumped to his feet slughorn seemed taken aback 
 
 leaving 
 
 yes indeed i think i know a lost cause when i see one 
 
 lost 
 
 slughorn seemed agitated he twiddled his fat thumbs and fidgeted as he watched dumbledore fasten his traveling cloak and harry zip up his jacket 
 
 well sorry you want the job horace said dumbledore raising his uninjured hand in a farewell salute hogwarts would have been glad to see you back again our greatly increased security notwithstanding you will always be welcome to visit should you wish to 
 
 yes well very gracious as i say 
 
 goodbye then 
 
 bye said harry 
 
 they were at the front door when there was a shout from behind them 
 
 all right all right do it 
 
 dumbledore turned to see slughorn standing breathless in the doorway to the sitting room 
 
 you will come out of retirement 
 
 yes yes said slughorn impatiently i must be mad but yes 
 
 wonderful said dumbledore beaming then horace we shall see you on the first of september 
 
 yes i daresay you will grunted slughorn 
 
 as they set off down the garden path voice floated after them want a pay rise dumbledore 
 
 dumbledore chuckled the garden gate swung shut behind them and they set off back down the hill through the dark and the swirling mist 
 
 well done harry said dumbledore 
 
 i do anything said harry in surprise 
 
 oh yes you did you showed horace exactly how much he stands to gain by returning to hogwarts did you like him 
 
 er 
 
 harry sure whether he liked slughorn or not he supposed he had been pleasant in his way but he had also seemed vain and whatever he said to the contrary much too surprised that a should make a good witch 
 
 horace said dumbledore relieving harry of the responsibility to say any of this likes his comfort he also likes the company of the famous the successful and the powerful he enjoys the feeling that he influences these people he has never wanted to occupy the throne himself he prefers the backseatmore room to spread out you see he used to handpick favorites at hogwarts sometimes for their ambition or their brains sometimes for their charm or their talent and he had an uncanny knack for choosing those who would go on to become outstanding in their various fields horace formed a kind of club of his favorites with himself at the center making introductions forging useful contacts between members and always reaping some kind of benefit in return whether a free box of his favorite crystallized pineapple or the chance to recommend the next junior member of the goblin liaison office 
 
 harry had a sudden and vivid mental image of a great swollen spider spinning a web around it twitching a thread here and there to bring its large and juicy flies a little closer 
 
 i tell you all this dumbledore continued not to turn you against horaceor as we must now call him professor slughornbut to put you on your guard he will undoubtedly try to collect you harry you would be the jewel of his collection the boy who lived or as they call you these days the chosen one 
 
 at these words a chill that had nothing to do with the surrounding mist stole over harry he was reminded of words he had heard a few weeks ago words that had a horrible and particular meaning to him 
 
 neither can live while the other survives 
 
 dumbledore had stopped walking level with the church they had passed earlier 
 
 this will do harry if you will grasp my arm 
 
 braced this time harry was ready for the apparition but still found it unpleasant when the pressure disappeared and he found himself able to breathe again he was standing in a country lane beside dumbledore and looking ahead to the crooked silhouette of his second favorite building in the world the burrow in spite of the feeling of dread that had just swept through him his spirits could not help but lift at the sight of it ron was in there and so was mrs weasley who could cook better than anyone he knew 
 
 if you mind harry said dumbledore as they passed through the gate like a few words with you before we part in private perhaps in here 
 
 dumbledore pointed toward a stone outhouse where the weasleys kept their broomsticks a little puzzled harry followed dumbledore through the creaking door into a space a little smaller than the average cupboard dumbledore illuminated the tip of his wand so that it glowed like a torch and smiled down at harry 
 
 i hope you will forgive me for mentioning it harry but i am pleased and a little proud at how well you seem to be coping after everything that happened at the ministry permit me to say that i think sirius would have been proud of you 
 
 harry swallowed his voice seemed to have deserted him he did not think he could stand to discuss sirius it had been painful enough to hear uncle vernon say his dead and even worse to hear name thrown out casually by slughorn 
 
 it was cruel said dumbledore softly that you and sirius had such a short time together a brutal ending to what should have been a long and happy relationship 
 
 harry nodded his eyes fixed resolutely on the spider now climbing hat he could tell that dumbledore understood that he might even suspect that until his letter arrived harry had spent nearly all his time at the dursleys lying on his bed refusing meals and staring at the misted window full of the chill emptiness that he had come to associate with dementors 
 
 just hard harry said finally in a low voice to realize he write to me again 
 
 his eyes burned suddenly and he blinked he felt stupid for admitting it but the fact that he had had someone outside hogwarts who cared what happened to him almost like a parent had been one of the best things about discovering his godfather and now the post owls would never bring him that comfort again 
 
 sirius represented much to you that you had never known before said dumbledore gently naturally the loss is devastating 
 
 but while i was at the dursleys interrupted harry his voice growing stronger i realized i shut myself away oror crack up sirius have wanted that would he and anyway too short look at madam bones look at emmeline vance it could be me next it but if it is he said fiercely now looking straight into blue eyes gleaming in the wandlight make sure i take as many death eaters with me as i can and voldemort too if i can manage it 
 
 spoken both like your mother and son and true godson said dumbledore with an approving pat on back i take my hat off to youor i would if i were not afraid of showering you in spiders 
 
 and now harry on a closely related subject i gather that you have been taking the daily prophet over the last two weeks 
 
 yes said harry and his heart beat a little faster 
 
 then you will have seen that there have been not so much leaks as floods concerning your adventure in the hall of prophecy 
 
 yes said harry again and now everyone knows that the one 
 
 no they do not interrupted dumbledore there are only two people in the whole world who know the full contents of the prophecy made about you and lord voldemort and they are both standing in this smelly spidery broom shed it is true however that many have guessed correctly that voldemort sent his death eaters to steal a prophecy and that the prophecy concerned you 
 
 now i think i am correct in saying that you have not told anybody that you know what the prophecy said 
 
 no said harry 
 
 a wise decision on the whole said dumbledore although i think you ought to relax it in favor of your friends mr ronald weasley and miss hermione granger yes he continued when harry looked startled i think they ought to know you do them a disservice by not confiding something this important to them 
 
 i want 
 
 to worry or frighten them said dumbledore surveying harry over the top of his spectacles or perhaps to confess that you yourself are worried and frightened you need your friends harry as you so rightly said sirius would not have wanted you to shut yourself away 
 
 harry said nothing but dumbledore did not seem to require an answer he continued on a different though related subject it is my wish that you take private lessons with me this year 
 
 privatewith you said harry surprised out of his preoccupied silence 
 
 yes i think it is time that i took a greater hand in your education 
 
 what will you be teaching me sir 
 
 oh a little of this a little of that said dumbledore airily 
 
 harry waited hopefully but dumbledore did not elaborate so he asked something else that had been bothering him slightly 
 
 if having lessons with you i have to do occlumency lessons with snape will i 
 
 professor snape harryand no you will not 
 
 good said harry in relief because they were a 
 
 he stopped careful not to say what he really thought 
 
 i think the word fiasco would be a good one here said dumbledore nodding 
 
 harry laughed 
 
 well that means i see much of professor snape from now on he said because he let me carry on potions unless i get outstanding in my which i know i 
 
 count your owls before they are delivered said dumbledore gravely which now i think of it ought to be some time later today now two more things harry before we part 
 
 firstly i wish you to keep your invisibility cloak with you at all times from this moment onward even within hogwarts itself just in case you understand me 
 
 harry nodded 
 
 and lastly while you stay here the burrow has been given the highest security the ministry of magic can provide these measures have caused a certain amount of inconvenience to arthur and mollyall their post for instance is being searched at the ministry before being sent on they do not mind in the slightest for their only concern is your safety however it would be poor repayment if you risked your neck while staying with them 
 
 i understand said harry quickly 
 
 very well then said dumbledore pushing open the broom shed door and stepping out into the yard i see a light in the kitchen let us not deprive molly any longer of the chance to deplore how thin you are 
 
 rowling

lionfish nov chapter four the seven potterscontents prev chapter next chapter 
 harry ran back upstairs to his bedroom arriving at the window just in time to see the dursleys car swinging out of the drive and off up the road dedaluss top hat was visible between aunt petunia and dudley in the backseat the car turned right at the end of privet drive its windows burned scarlet for a moment in the now setting sun and then it was gone 
 
 harry picked up hedwigs cage his firebolt and his rucksack gave his unnaturally tidy bedroom one last sweeping look and then made his ungainly way back downstairs to the hall where he deposited cage broomstick and bag near the foot of the stairs the light was fading rapidly the hall full of shadows in the evening light it felt most strange to stand here in the silence and know that he was about to leave the house for the last time long ago when he had been left alone while the dursleys went out to enjoy themselves the hours of solitude had been a rare treat pausing only to sneak something tasty from the fridge he had rushed upstairs to play on dudleys computer or put on the television and flicked through the channels to his hearts content it gave him an odd empty feeling remembering those times it was like remembering a younger brother whom he had lost 
 
 dont you want to take a last look at the place he asked hedwig who was still sulking with her head under her wing well never be here again dont you want to remember all the good times i mean look at this doormat what memories dudley sobbed on it after i saved him from the dementors turns out he was grateful after all can you believe it and last summer dumbledore walked through that front door 
 
 harry lost the thread of his thoughts for a moment and hedwig did nothing to help him retrieve it but continued to sit with her head under her wing harry turned his back on the front door 
 
 and under here hedwig c harry pulled open a door under the stairs c is where i used to sleep you never knew me then c blimey its small id forgotten 
 
 harry looked around at the stacked shoes and umbrellas remembering how he used to wake every morning looking up at the underside of the staircase which was more often than not adorned with a spider or two those had been the days before he had known anything about his true identity before he had found out how his parents had died or why such strange things often happened around him but harry could still remember the dreams that had dogged him even in those days confused dreams involving flashes of green light and once c uncle vernon had nearly crashed the car when harry had recounted it c a flying motorbike 
 
 there was a sudden deafening roar from somewhere nearby harry straightened up with a jerk and smacked the top of his head on the low door frame pausing only to employ a few of uncle vernons choicest swear words he staggered back into the kitchen clutching his head and staring out of the window into the back garden 
 
 the darkness seemed to be rippling the air itself quivering then one by one figures began to pop into sight as their disillusionment charms lifted dominating the scene was hagrid wearing a helmet and goggles and sitting astride an enormous motorbike with a black sidecar attached all around him other people were dismounting from brooms and in two cases skeletal black winged horses 
 
 wrenching open the back door harry hurtled into their midst there was a general cry of greeting as hermione flung her arms around him ron clapped him on the back and hagrid said all righ harry ready fer the off 
 
 definitely said harry beaming around at them all but i wasnt expecting this many of you 
 
 change of plan growled who was holding two enormous bulging sacks and whose magical eye was spinning from darkening sky to house to garden with dizzying rapidity lets get undercover before we talk you through it 
 
 harry led them all back into the kitchen where laughing and chattering they settled on chairs sat themselves upon aunt petunias gleaming work surfaces or leaned up against her spotless appliances ron long and lanky hermione her bushy hair tied back in a long plait fred and george grinning identically bill badly scarred and longhaired mr weasley balding his spectacles a little awry his bright blue magical eye whizzing in its socket tonks whose short hair was her favorite shade of bright pink lupin grayer more lined fleur slender and beautiful with her long silvery blonde hair kingsley bald and hagrid with his wild hair and beard standing hunchbacked to avoid hitting his head on the ceiling and mundungus fletcher small dirty and hangdog with his droopy beady hounds eyes and matted hair harrys heart seemed to expand and glow at the sight he felt incredibly fond of all of them even mundungus whom he had tried to strangle the last time they had met 
 
 kingsley i thought you were looking after the muggle prime minister he called across the room 
 
 he can get along without me for one night said kingsley youre more important 
 
 harry guess what said tonks from her perch on top of the washing machine and she wiggled her left hand at him a ring glistened there 
 
 you got married harry yelped looking from her to lupin 
 
 im sorry you couldnt be there harry it was very quiet 
 
 thats brilliant congrat c 
 
 all right all right well have time for a cozy later roared moody over the hubbub and silence fell in the kitchen moody dropped his sacks at his feet and turned to harry as dedalus probably told you we had to abandon plan a pius thicknesse has gone over which gives us a big problem hes made it an imprisonable offense to connect this house to the floo network place a portkey here or apparate in or out all done in the name of your protection to prevent getting in at you absolutely pointless seeing as your mothers charm does that already what hes really done is to stop you getting out of here safely 
 
 second problem youre underage which means youve still got the trace on you 
 
 i dont c 
 
 the trace the trace said impatiently the charm that detects magical activity around the way the ministry finds out about underage magic if you or anyone around you casts a spell to get you out of here thicknesse is going to know about it and so will the death eaters 
 
 we cant wait for the trace to break because the moment you turn seventeen youll lose all the protection your mother gave you in short pius thicknesse thinks hes got you cornered good and proper 
 
 harry could not help but agree with the unknown thicknesse 
 
 so what are we going to do 
 
 were going to use the only means of transport left to us the only ones the trace cant detect because we dont need to cast spells to use them brooms thestrals and hagrids motorbike 
 
 harry could see flaws in this plan however he held his tongue to give the chance to address them 
 
 now your mothers charm will only break under two conditions when you come of age or c moody gestured around the pristine kitchen c you no longer call this place home you and your aunt and uncle are going your separate ways tonight in the full understanding that youre never going to live together again correct 
 
 harry nodded 
 
 so this time when you leave therell be no going back and the charm will break the moment you get outside its range were choosing to break it early because the alternative is waiting for to come and seize you the moment you turn seventeen 
 
 the one thing weve got on our side is that doesnt know were moving you tonight weve leaked a fake trail to the ministry they think youre not leaving until the thirtieth however this is were dealing with so we cant rely on him getting the date wrong hes bound to have a couple of death eaters patrolling the skies in this general area just in case so weve given a dozen different houses every protection we can throw at them they all look like they could be the place were going to hide you theyve all got some connection with the order my house kingsleys place mollys auntie muriels c you get the idea 
 
 yeah said harry not entirely truthfully because he could still spot a gaping hole in the plan 
 
 youll be going to tonkss parents once youre within the boundaries of the protective enchantments weve put on their house youll be able to use a portkey to the burrow any questions 
 
 er c yes said harry maybe they wont know which of the twelve secure houses im heading for at first but wont it be sort of obvious once c he performed a quick headcount c fourteen of us fly off toward tonkss parents 
 
 ah said moody i forgot to mention the key point fourteen of us wont be flying to tonkss parents there will be seven harry potters moving through the skies tonight each of them with a companion each pair heading for a different safe house 
 
 from inside his cloak moody now withdrew a flask of what looked like mud there was no need for him to say another word harry understood the rest of the plan immediately 
 
 no he said loudly his voice ringing through the kitchen no way 
 
 i told them youd take it like this said hermione with a hint of complacency 
 
 if you think im going to let six people risk their lives c 
 
 c because its the first time for all of us said ron 
 
 this is different pretending to be me c 
 
 well none of us really fancy it harry said fred earnestly imagine if something went wrong and we were stuck as specky scrawny gits forever 
 
 harry did not smile 
 
 you cant do it if i dont cooperate you need me to give you some hair 
 
 well thats the plan scuppered said george obviously theres no chance at all of us getting a bit of your hair unless you cooperate 
 
 yeah thirteen of us against one bloke whos not allowed to use magic weve got no chance said fred 
 
 funny said harry really amusing 
 
 if it has to come to force then it will growled moody his magical eye now quivering a little in its socket as he glared at harry everyone heres overage potter and theyre all prepared to take the risk 
 
 mundungus shrugged and grimaced the magical eye swerved sideways to glance at him out of the side of moodys head 
 
 lets have no more arguments times wearing on i want a few of your hairs boy now 
 
 but this is mad theres no need c 
 
 no need snarled moody with out there and half the ministry on his side potter if were lucky hell have swallowed the fake bait and hell be planning to ambush you on the thirtieth but hed be mad not to have a death eater or two keeping an eye out its what id do they might not be able to get at you or this house while your mothers charm holds but its about to break and they know the rough position of the place our only chance is to use decoys even cant split himself into seven 
 
 harry caught hermiones eye and looked away at once 
 
 so potter c some of your hair if you please 
 
 harry glanced at ron who grimaced at him in a sort of way 
 
 now barked moody 
 
 with all of their eyes upon him harry reached up to the top of his head grabbed a hank of hair and pulled 
 
 good said moody limping forward as he pulled the stopper out of the flask of potion straight in here if you please 
 
 harry dropped the hair into the mudlike liquid the moment it made contact with its surface the potion began to froth and smoke then all at once it turned a clear bright gold 
 
 ooh you look much tastier than crabbe and goyle harry said hermione before catching sight of rons raised eyebrows blushing slightly and saying oh you know what i mean c goyles potion tasted like bogies 
 
 right then fake potters line up over here please said moody 
 
 ron hermione fred george and fleur lined up in front of aunt petunias gleaming sink 
 
 were one short said lupin 
 
 here said hagrid gruffly and he lifted mundungus by the scruff of the neck and dropped him down beside fleur who wrinkled her nose pointedly and moved along to stand between fred and george instead 
 
 im a soldier id sooner be a protector said mundungus 
 
 shut it growled moody as ive already told you you spineless worm any death eaters we run into will be aiming to capture potter not kill him dumbledore always said would want to finish potter in person itll be the protectors who have got the most to worry about the death eatersll want to kill them 
 
 mundungus did not look particularly reassured but moody was already pulling half a dozen glasses from inside his cloak which he handed out before pouring a little polyjuice potion into each one 
 
 altogether then 
 
 ron hermione fred george fleur and mundungus drank all of them gasped and grimaced as the potion hit their throats at once their features began to bubble and distort like hot wax hermione and mundungus were shooting upward ron fred and george were shrinking their hair was darkening hermiones and fleurs appearing to shoot backward into their skulls 
 
 moody quite unconcerned was now loosening the ties of the large sacks he had brought with him when he straightened up again there were six harry potters gasping and panting in front of him 
 
 fred and george turned to each other and said together wow c were identical 
 
 i dunno though i think im still said fred examining his reflection in the kettle 
 
 bah said fleur checking herself in the microwave door bill dont look at me c im ideous 
 
 those whose clothes are a bit roomy ive got smaller here said moody indicating the first sack and vice versa dont forget the glasses theres six pairs in the side pocket and when youre dressed theres luggage in the other sack 
 
 the real harry thought that this might just be the most bizarre thing he had ever seen and he had seen some extremely odd things he watched as his six doppelgangers rummaged in the sacks pulling out sets of clothes putting on glasses stuffing their own things away he felt like asking them to show a little more respect for privacy as they all began stripping off with impunity clearly more at ease with displaying his body than they would have been with their own 
 
 i knew ginny was lying about that tattoo said ron looking down at his bare chest 
 
 harry your eyesight really is awful said hermione as she put on glasses 
 
 once dressed the fake harrys took rucksacks and owl cages each containing a stuffed snowy owl from the second sack 
 
 good said moody as at last seven dressed bespectacled and harrys faced him the pairs will be as follows mundungus will be traveling with me by broom c 
 
 whym i with you grunted the harry nearest the back door 
 
 because youre the one that needs watching growled moody and sure enough his magical eye did not waver from mundungus as he continued arthur and fred c 
 
 im george said the twin at whom moody was pointing cant you even tell us apart when were harry 
 
 sorry george c 
 
 im only yanking your wand im fred really c 
 
 enough messing around snarled moody the other one c george or fred or whoever you are c youre with remus miss delacour c 
 
 im taking fleur on a thestral said bill shes not that fond of brooms 
 
 fleur walked over to stand beside him giving him a soppy slavish look that harry hoped with all his heart would never appear on his face again 
 
 miss granger with kingsley again by thestral c 
 
 hermione looked reassured as she answered kingsleys smile harry knew that hermione too lacked confidence on a broomstick 
 
 which leaves you and me ron said tonks brightly knocking over a mug tree as she waved at him 
 
 ron did not look quite as pleased as hermione 
 
 an youre with me harry that all righ said hagrid looking a little anxious well be on the bike brooms an thestrals cant take me weight see not a lot o room on the seat with me on it though so youll be in the sidecar 
 
 thats great said harry not altogether truthfully 
 
 we think the death eaters will expect you to be on a broom said moody who seemed to guess how harry was feeling snapes had plenty of time to tell them everything about you hes never mentioned before so if we do run into any death eaters were betting theyll choose one of the potters who looks at home on a broomstick all right then he went on tying up the sack with the fake potters clothes in it and leading the way back to the door i make it three minutes until were supposed to leave no point locking the back door it wont keep the death eaters out when they come looking come on 
 
 harry hurried to gather his rucksack firebolt and hedwigs cage and followed the group to the dark back garden 
 
 on every side broomsticks were leaping into hands hermione had already been helped up onto a great black thestral by kingsley fleur onto the other by bill hagrid was standing ready beside the motorbike goggles on 
 
 is this it is this siriuss bike 
 
 the very same said hagrid beaming down at harry an the last time yeh was on it harry i could fit yeh in one hand 
 
 harry could not help but feel a little humiliated as he got into the sidecar it placed him several feet below everybody else ron smirked at the sight of him sitting there like a child in a bumper car harry stuffed his rucksack and broomstick down by his feet and rammed hedwigs cage between his knees he was extremely uncomfortable 
 
 arthurs done a bit o tinkerin said hagrid quite oblivious to harrys discomfort he settled himself astride the motorcycle which creaked slightly and sank inches into the ground its got a few tricks up its sleeves now tha one was my idea he pointed a thick finger at a purple button near the speedometer 
 
 please be careful hagrid said mr weasley who was standing beside them holding his broomstick im still not sure that was advisable and its certainly only to be used in emergencies 
 
 all right then said moody everyone ready please i want us all to leave at exactly the same time or the whole point of the diversions lost 
 
 everybody motioned their heads hold tight now ron said tonks and harry saw ron throw a forcing guilty look at lupin before placing his hands on each side of her waist hagrid kicked the motorbike into life it roared like a dragon and the sidecar began to vibrate 
 
 good luck everyone shouted moody see you all in about an hour at the burrow on the count of three one two three 
 
 there was a great roar from the motorbike and harry felt the sidecar give a nasty lurch he was rising through the air fast his eyes watering slightly hair whipped back off his face around him brooms were soaring upward too the long black tail of a thestral flicked past his legs jammed into the sidecar by hedwigs cage and his rucksack were already sore and starting to go numb so great was his discomfort that he almost forgot to take a last glimpse of number four privet drive by the time he looked over the edge of the sidecar he could no longer tell which one it was 
 
 and then out of nowhere out of nothing they were surrounded at least thirty hooded figures suspended in midair formed a vast circle in the middle of which the order members had risen oblivious c screams a blaze of green light on every side hagrid gave a yell and the motorbike rolled over harry lost any sense of where they were streetlights above him yells around him he was clinging to the sidecar for dear life hedwigs cage the firebolt and his rucksack slipped from beneath his knees c 
 
 no c help 
 
 the broomstick spun too but he just managed to seize the strap of his rucksack and the top of the cage as the motorbike swung the right way up again a seconds relief and then another burst of green light the owl screeched and fell to the floor of the cage 
 
 no c no 
 
 the motorbike zoomed forward harry glimpsed hooded death eaters scattering as hagrid blasted through their circle 
 
 hedwig c hedwig c 
 
 but the owl lay motionless and pathetic as a toy on the floor of her cage he could not take it in and his terror for the others was paramount he glanced over his shoulder and saw a mass of people moving flares of green light two pairs of people on brooms soaring off into the distance but he could not tell who they were c 
 
 hagrid weve got to go back weve got to go back he yelled over the thunderous roar of the engine pulling out his wand ramming hedwigs cage into the floor refusing to believe that she was dead hagrid turn around 
 
 my jobs ter get you there safe harry bellow hagrid and he opened the throttle stop c stop harry shouted but as he looked back again two jets of green light flew past his left ear four death eaters had broken away from the circle and were pursuing them aiming for hagrids broad back hagrid swerved but the death eaters were keeping up with the bike more curses shot after them and harry had to sink low into the sidecar to avoid them wriggling around he cried stupefy and a red bolt of light shot from his own wand cleaving a gap between the four pursuing death eaters as they scattered to avoid it 
 
 hold on harry thisll do for em roared hagrid and harry looked up just in time to see hagrid slamming a thick finger into a green button near the fuel gauge a wall a solid black wall erupted out of the exhaust pipe craning his neck harry saw it expand into being in midair three of the death eaters swerved and avoided it but the fourth was not so lucky he vanished from view and then dropped like a boulder from behind it his broomstick broken into pieces one of his fellows slowed up to save him but they and the airborne wall were swallowed by darkness as hagrid leaned low over the handlebars and sped up 
 
 more killing curses flew past harrys head from the two remaining death eaters wands they were aiming for hagrid harry responded with further stunning spells red and green collided in midair in a shower of multicolored sparks and harry thought wildly of fireworks and the muggles below who would have no idea what was happening c 
 
 here we go again harry hold on yelled hagrid and he jabbed at a second button this time a great net burst from the bikes exhaust but the death eaters were ready for it not only did they swerve to avoid it but the companion who had slowed to save their unconscious friend had caught up he bloomed suddenly out of the darkness and now three of them were pursuing the motorbike all shooting curses after it 
 
 thisll do it harry hold on tight yelled hagrid and harry saw him slam his whole hand onto the purple button beside the speedometer 
 
 with an unmistakable bellowing roar dragon fire burst from the exhaust and blue and the motorbike shot forward like a bullet with a sound of wrenching metal harry saw the death eaters swerve out of sight to avoid the deadly trail of flame and at the same time felt the sidecar sway ominously its metal connections to the bike had splintered with the force of acceleration 
 
 its all righ harry bellowed hagrid now thrown flat onto the back by the surge of speed nobody was steering now and the sidecar was starting to twist violently in the bikes slipstream 
 
 im on it harry don worry hagrid yelled and from inside his jacket pocket he pulled his flowery pink umbrella 
 
 hagrid no let me 
 
 reparo 
 
 there was a deafening bang and the sidecar broke away from the bike completely harry sped forward propelled by the impetus of the bikes flight then the sidecar began to lose height c 
 
 in desperation harry pointed his wand at the sidecar and shouted wingardium leviosa 
 
 the sidecar rose like a cork unsteerable but at least still airborne he had but a split seconds relief however as more curses streaked past him the three death eaters were closing in 
 
 im comin harry hagrid yelled from out of the darkness but harry could feel the sidecar beginning to sink again crouching as low as he could he pointed at the middle of the oncoming figures and yelled impedimenta 
 
 the jinx hit the middle death eater in the chest for a moment the man was absurdly in midair as though he had hit an invisible barrier one of his fellows almost collided with him c then the sidecar began to fall in earnest and the remaining death eater shot a curse so close to harry that he had to duck below the rim of the car knocking out a tooth on the edge of his seat c 
 
 im comin harry im comin 
 
 a huge hand seized the back of harrys robes and hoisted him out of the plummeting sidecar harry pulled his rucksack with him as he dragged himself onto the motorbikes seat and found himself with hagrid as they soared upward away from the two remaining death eaters harry spat blood out of his mouth pointed his wand at the falling sidecar and yelled confringo 
 
 he knew a dreadful pang for hedwig as it exploded the death eater nearest it was blasted off his broom and fell from sight his companion fell back and vanished 
 
 harry im sorry im sorry moaned hagrid i shouldnta tried ter repair it meself c yehve got no room c 
 
 its not a problem just keep flying harry shouted back as two more death eaters emerged out of the darkness drawing closer 
 
 as the curses came shooting across the intervening space again hagrid swerved and zigzagged harry knew that hagrid did not dare use the button again with harry seated so insecurely harry sent stunning spell after stunning spell back at their pursuers barely holding them off he shot another blocking jinx at them the closest death eater swerved to avoid it and his hood slipped and by the red light of his next stunning spell harry saw the strangely blank face of stanley shunpike c stan c 
 
 expelliarmus harry yelled 
 
 thats him its him its the real one 
 
 the hooded death eaters shout reached harry even above the thunder of the motorbikes engine next moment both pursuers had fallen back and disappeared from view 
 
 harry whats happened bellowed hagrid whereve they gone 
 
 i dont know 
 
 but harry was afraid the hooded death eater had shouted its the real one how had he known he gazed around at the apparently empty darkness and felt its menace where were they 
 
 he clambered around on the seat to face forward and seized hold of the back of hagrids jacket 
 
 hagrid do the thing again lets get out of here 
 
 hold on tight then harry 
 
 there was a deafening screeching roar again and the fire shot from the exhaust harry felt himself slipping backwards off what little of the seat he had hagrid flung backward upon him barely maintaining his grip on the handlebars c i think weve lost em harry i think weve done it yelled hagrid 
 
 but harry was not convinced fear lapped at him as he looked left and right for pursuers he was sure would come why had they fallen back one of them had still had a wand its him its the real one they had said it right after he had tried to disarm stan 
 
 were nearly there harry weve nearly made it shouted hagrid 
 
 harry felt the bike drop a little though the lights down on the ground still seemed remote as stars 
 
 then the scar on his forehead burned like fire as a death eater appeared on either side of the bike two killing curses missed harry by millimeters cast from behind c and then harry saw him voldemort was flying like smoke on the wind without broomstick or thestral to hold him his face gleaming out of the blackness his white fingers raising his wand again c 
 
 hagrid let out a bellow of fear and steered the motorbike into a vertical dive clinging on for dear life harry sent stunning spells flying at random into the whirling night he saw a body fly past him and knew he had hit one of them but then he heard a bang and saw sparks from the engine the motorbike spiraled through the air completely out of control c 
 
 green jets of light shot past them again harry had no idea which way was up which down his scar was still burning he expected to die at any second a hooded figure on a broomstick was feet from him he saw it raise its arm c 
 
 no 
 
 with a shout of fury hagrid launched himself off the bike at the death eater to his horror harry saw both hagrid and the death eater falling out of sight their combined weight too much for the broomstick c 
 
 barely gripping the plummeting bike with his knees harry heard voldemort scream mine 
 
 it was over he could not see or hear where voldemort was he glimpsed another death eater swooping out of the way and heard avada c 
 
 as the pain from harrys scar forced his eyes shut his wand acted of its own accord he felt it drag his hand around like some great magnet saw a spurt of golden fire through his eyelids heard a crack and a scream of fury the remaining death eater yelled voldemort screamed no somehow harry found his nose an inch from the button he punched it with his hand and the bike shot more flames into the air hurtling straight toward the ground 
 
 hagrid harry called holding on to the bike for dear life hagrid c accio hagrid 
 
 the motorbike sped up sucked towards the earth face level with the handlebars harry could see nothing but distant lights growing nearer and nearer he was going to crash and there was nothing he could do about it behind him came another scream your wand selwyn give me your wand 
 
 he felt voldemort before he saw him looking sideways he stared into the red eyes and was sure they would be the last thing he ever saw voldemort preparing to curse him once more c 
 
 and then voldemort vanished harry looked down and saw hagrid on the ground below him he pulled hard at the handlebars to avoid hitting him groped for the brake but with an earsplitting ground trembling crash he smashed into a muddy pond 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the deathly hallows 
 

lionfish nov chapter four the seven potterscontents prev chapter next chapter 
 harry ran back upstairs to his bedroom arriving at the window just in time to see the dursleys car swinging out of the drive and off up the road dedaluss top hat was visible between aunt petunia and dudley in the backseat the car turned right at the end of privet drive its windows burned scarlet for a moment in the now setting sun and then it was gone 
 
 harry picked up hedwigs cage his firebolt and his rucksack gave his unnaturally tidy bedroom one last sweeping look and then made his ungainly way back downstairs to the hall where he deposited cage broomstick and bag near the foot of the stairs the light was fading rapidly the hall full of shadows in the evening light it felt most strange to stand here in the silence and know that he was about to leave the house for the last time long ago when he had been left alone while the dursleys went out to enjoy themselves the hours of solitude had been a rare treat pausing only to sneak something tasty from the fridge he had rushed upstairs to play on dudleys computer or put on the television and flicked through the channels to his hearts content it gave him an odd empty feeling remembering those times it was like remembering a younger brother whom he had lost 
 
 dont you want to take a last look at the place he asked hedwig who was still sulking with her head under her wing well never be here again dont you want to remember all the good times i mean look at this doormat what memories dudley sobbed on it after i saved him from the dementors turns out he was grateful after all can you believe it and last summer dumbledore walked through that front door 
 
 harry lost the thread of his thoughts for a moment and hedwig did nothing to help him retrieve it but continued to sit with her head under her wing harry turned his back on the front door 
 
 and under here hedwig c harry pulled open a door under the stairs c is where i used to sleep you never knew me then c blimey its small id forgotten 
 
 harry looked around at the stacked shoes and umbrellas remembering how he used to wake every morning looking up at the underside of the staircase which was more often than not adorned with a spider or two those had been the days before he had known anything about his true identity before he had found out how his parents had died or why such strange things often happened around him but harry could still remember the dreams that had dogged him even in those days confused dreams involving flashes of green light and once c uncle vernon had nearly crashed the car when harry had recounted it c a flying motorbike 
 
 there was a sudden deafening roar from somewhere nearby harry straightened up with a jerk and smacked the top of his head on the low door frame pausing only to employ a few of uncle vernons choicest swear words he staggered back into the kitchen clutching his head and staring out of the window into the back garden 
 
 the darkness seemed to be rippling the air itself quivering then one by one figures began to pop into sight as their disillusionment charms lifted dominating the scene was hagrid wearing a helmet and goggles and sitting astride an enormous motorbike with a black sidecar attached all around him other people were dismounting from brooms and in two cases skeletal black winged horses 
 
 wrenching open the back door harry hurtled into their midst there was a general cry of greeting as hermione flung her arms around him ron clapped him on the back and hagrid said all righ harry ready fer the off 
 
 definitely said harry beaming around at them all but i wasnt expecting this many of you 
 
 change of plan growled who was holding two enormous bulging sacks and whose magical eye was spinning from darkening sky to house to garden with dizzying rapidity lets get undercover before we talk you through it 
 
 harry led them all back into the kitchen where laughing and chattering they settled on chairs sat themselves upon aunt petunias gleaming work surfaces or leaned up against her spotless appliances ron long and lanky hermione her bushy hair tied back in a long plait fred and george grinning identically bill badly scarred and longhaired mr weasley balding his spectacles a little awry his bright blue magical eye whizzing in its socket tonks whose short hair was her favorite shade of bright pink lupin grayer more lined fleur slender and beautiful with her long silvery blonde hair kingsley bald and hagrid with his wild hair and beard standing hunchbacked to avoid hitting his head on the ceiling and mundungus fletcher small dirty and hangdog with his droopy beady hounds eyes and matted hair harrys heart seemed to expand and glow at the sight he felt incredibly fond of all of them even mundungus whom he had tried to strangle the last time they had met 
 
 kingsley i thought you were looking after the muggle prime minister he called across the room 
 
 he can get along without me for one night said kingsley youre more important 
 
 harry guess what said tonks from her perch on top of the washing machine and she wiggled her left hand at him a ring glistened there 
 
 you got married harry yelped looking from her to lupin 
 
 im sorry you couldnt be there harry it was very quiet 
 
 thats brilliant congrat c 
 
 all right all right well have time for a cozy later roared moody over the hubbub and silence fell in the kitchen moody dropped his sacks at his feet and turned to harry as dedalus probably told you we had to abandon plan a pius thicknesse has gone over which gives us a big problem hes made it an imprisonable offense to connect this house to the floo network place a portkey here or apparate in or out all done in the name of your protection to prevent getting in at you absolutely pointless seeing as your mothers charm does that already what hes really done is to stop you getting out of here safely 
 
 second problem youre underage which means youve still got the trace on you 
 
 i dont c 
 
 the trace the trace said impatiently the charm that detects magical activity around the way the ministry finds out about underage magic if you or anyone around you casts a spell to get you out of here thicknesse is going to know about it and so will the death eaters 
 
 we cant wait for the trace to break because the moment you turn seventeen youll lose all the protection your mother gave you in short pius thicknesse thinks hes got you cornered good and proper 
 
 harry could not help but agree with the unknown thicknesse 
 
 so what are we going to do 
 
 were going to use the only means of transport left to us the only ones the trace cant detect because we dont need to cast spells to use them brooms thestrals and hagrids motorbike 
 
 harry could see flaws in this plan however he held his tongue to give the chance to address them 
 
 now your mothers charm will only break under two conditions when you come of age or c moody gestured around the pristine kitchen c you no longer call this place home you and your aunt and uncle are going your separate ways tonight in the full understanding that youre never going to live together again correct 
 
 harry nodded 
 
 so this time when you leave therell be no going back and the charm will break the moment you get outside its range were choosing to break it early because the alternative is waiting for to come and seize you the moment you turn seventeen 
 
 the one thing weve got on our side is that doesnt know were moving you tonight weve leaked a fake trail to the ministry they think youre not leaving until the thirtieth however this is were dealing with so we cant rely on him getting the date wrong hes bound to have a couple of death eaters patrolling the skies in this general area just in case so weve given a dozen different houses every protection we can throw at them they all look like they could be the place were going to hide you theyve all got some connection with the order my house kingsleys place mollys auntie muriels c you get the idea 
 
 yeah said harry not entirely truthfully because he could still spot a gaping hole in the plan 
 
 youll be going to tonkss parents once youre within the boundaries of the protective enchantments weve put on their house youll be able to use a portkey to the burrow any questions 
 
 er c yes said harry maybe they wont know which of the twelve secure houses im heading for at first but wont it be sort of obvious once c he performed a quick headcount c fourteen of us fly off toward tonkss parents 
 
 ah said moody i forgot to mention the key point fourteen of us wont be flying to tonkss parents there will be seven harry potters moving through the skies tonight each of them with a companion each pair heading for a different safe house 
 
 from inside his cloak moody now withdrew a flask of what looked like mud there was no need for him to say another word harry understood the rest of the plan immediately 
 
 no he said loudly his voice ringing through the kitchen no way 
 
 i told them youd take it like this said hermione with a hint of complacency 
 
 if you think im going to let six people risk their lives c 
 
 c because its the first time for all of us said ron 
 
 this is different pretending to be me c 
 
 well none of us really fancy it harry said fred earnestly imagine if something went wrong and we were stuck as specky scrawny gits forever 
 
 harry did not smile 
 
 you cant do it if i dont cooperate you need me to give you some hair 
 
 well thats the plan scuppered said george obviously theres no chance at all of us getting a bit of your hair unless you cooperate 
 
 yeah thirteen of us against one bloke whos not allowed to use magic weve got no chance said fred 
 
 funny said harry really amusing 
 
 if it has to come to force then it will growled moody his magical eye now quivering a little in its socket as he glared at harry everyone heres overage potter and theyre all prepared to take the risk 
 
 mundungus shrugged and grimaced the magical eye swerved sideways to glance at him out of the side of moodys head 
 
 lets have no more arguments times wearing on i want a few of your hairs boy now 
 
 but this is mad theres no need c 
 
 no need snarled moody with out there and half the ministry on his side potter if were lucky hell have swallowed the fake bait and hell be planning to ambush you on the thirtieth but hed be mad not to have a death eater or two keeping an eye out its what id do they might not be able to get at you or this house while your mothers charm holds but its about to break and they know the rough position of the place our only chance is to use decoys even cant split himself into seven 
 
 harry caught hermiones eye and looked away at once 
 
 so potter c some of your hair if you please 
 
 harry glanced at ron who grimaced at him in a sort of way 
 
 now barked moody 
 
 with all of their eyes upon him harry reached up to the top of his head grabbed a hank of hair and pulled 
 
 good said moody limping forward as he pulled the stopper out of the flask of potion straight in here if you please 
 
 harry dropped the hair into the mudlike liquid the moment it made contact with its surface the potion began to froth and smoke then all at once it turned a clear bright gold 
 
 ooh you look much tastier than crabbe and goyle harry said hermione before catching sight of rons raised eyebrows blushing slightly and saying oh you know what i mean c goyles potion tasted like bogies 
 
 right then fake potters line up over here please said moody 
 
 ron hermione fred george and fleur lined up in front of aunt petunias gleaming sink 
 
 were one short said lupin 
 
 here said hagrid gruffly and he lifted mundungus by the scruff of the neck and dropped him down beside fleur who wrinkled her nose pointedly and moved along to stand between fred and george instead 
 
 im a soldier id sooner be a protector said mundungus 
 
 shut it growled moody as ive already told you you spineless worm any death eaters we run into will be aiming to capture potter not kill him dumbledore always said would want to finish potter in person itll be the protectors who have got the most to worry about the death eatersll want to kill them 
 
 mundungus did not look particularly reassured but moody was already pulling half a dozen glasses from inside his cloak which he handed out before pouring a little polyjuice potion into each one 
 
 altogether then 
 
 ron hermione fred george fleur and mundungus drank all of them gasped and grimaced as the potion hit their throats at once their features began to bubble and distort like hot wax hermione and mundungus were shooting upward ron fred and george were shrinking their hair was darkening hermiones and fleurs appearing to shoot backward into their skulls 
 
 moody quite unconcerned was now loosening the ties of the large sacks he had brought with him when he straightened up again there were six harry potters gasping and panting in front of him 
 
 fred and george turned to each other and said together wow c were identical 
 
 i dunno though i think im still said fred examining his reflection in the kettle 
 
 bah said fleur checking herself in the microwave door bill dont look at me c im ideous 
 
 those whose clothes are a bit roomy ive got smaller here said moody indicating the first sack and vice versa dont forget the glasses theres six pairs in the side pocket and when youre dressed theres luggage in the other sack 
 
 the real harry thought that this might just be the most bizarre thing he had ever seen and he had seen some extremely odd things he watched as his six doppelgangers rummaged in the sacks pulling out sets of clothes putting on glasses stuffing their own things away he felt like asking them to show a little more respect for privacy as they all began stripping off with impunity clearly more at ease with displaying his body than they would have been with their own 
 
 i knew ginny was lying about that tattoo said ron looking down at his bare chest 
 
 harry your eyesight really is awful said hermione as she put on glasses 
 
 once dressed the fake harrys took rucksacks and owl cages each containing a stuffed snowy owl from the second sack 
 
 good said moody as at last seven dressed bespectacled and harrys faced him the pairs will be as follows mundungus will be traveling with me by broom c 
 
 whym i with you grunted the harry nearest the back door 
 
 because youre the one that needs watching growled moody and sure enough his magical eye did not waver from mundungus as he continued arthur and fred c 
 
 im george said the twin at whom moody was pointing cant you even tell us apart when were harry 
 
 sorry george c 
 
 im only yanking your wand im fred really c 
 
 enough messing around snarled moody the other one c george or fred or whoever you are c youre with remus miss delacour c 
 
 im taking fleur on a thestral said bill shes not that fond of brooms 
 
 fleur walked over to stand beside him giving him a soppy slavish look that harry hoped with all his heart would never appear on his face again 
 
 miss granger with kingsley again by thestral c 
 
 hermione looked reassured as she answered kingsleys smile harry knew that hermione too lacked confidence on a broomstick 
 
 which leaves you and me ron said tonks brightly knocking over a mug tree as she waved at him 
 
 ron did not look quite as pleased as hermione 
 
 an youre with me harry that all righ said hagrid looking a little anxious well be on the bike brooms an thestrals cant take me weight see not a lot o room on the seat with me on it though so youll be in the sidecar 
 
 thats great said harry not altogether truthfully 
 
 we think the death eaters will expect you to be on a broom said moody who seemed to guess how harry was feeling snapes had plenty of time to tell them everything about you hes never mentioned before so if we do run into any death eaters were betting theyll choose one of the potters who looks at home on a broomstick all right then he went on tying up the sack with the fake potters clothes in it and leading the way back to the door i make it three minutes until were supposed to leave no point locking the back door it wont keep the death eaters out when they come looking come on 
 
 harry hurried to gather his rucksack firebolt and hedwigs cage and followed the group to the dark back garden 
 
 on every side broomsticks were leaping into hands hermione had already been helped up onto a great black thestral by kingsley fleur onto the other by bill hagrid was standing ready beside the motorbike goggles on 
 
 is this it is this siriuss bike 
 
 the very same said hagrid beaming down at harry an the last time yeh was on it harry i could fit yeh in one hand 
 
 harry could not help but feel a little humiliated as he got into the sidecar it placed him several feet below everybody else ron smirked at the sight of him sitting there like a child in a bumper car harry stuffed his rucksack and broomstick down by his feet and rammed hedwigs cage between his knees he was extremely uncomfortable 
 
 arthurs done a bit o tinkerin said hagrid quite oblivious to harrys discomfort he settled himself astride the motorcycle which creaked slightly and sank inches into the ground its got a few tricks up its sleeves now tha one was my idea he pointed a thick finger at a purple button near the speedometer 
 
 please be careful hagrid said mr weasley who was standing beside them holding his broomstick im still not sure that was advisable and its certainly only to be used in emergencies 
 
 all right then said moody everyone ready please i want us all to leave at exactly the same time or the whole point of the diversions lost 
 
 everybody motioned their heads hold tight now ron said tonks and harry saw ron throw a forcing guilty look at lupin before placing his hands on each side of her waist hagrid kicked the motorbike into life it roared like a dragon and the sidecar began to vibrate 
 
 good luck everyone shouted moody see you all in about an hour at the burrow on the count of three one two three 
 
 there was a great roar from the motorbike and harry felt the sidecar give a nasty lurch he was rising through the air fast his eyes watering slightly hair whipped back off his face around him brooms were soaring upward too the long black tail of a thestral flicked past his legs jammed into the sidecar by hedwigs cage and his rucksack were already sore and starting to go numb so great was his discomfort that he almost forgot to take a last glimpse of number four privet drive by the time he looked over the edge of the sidecar he could no longer tell which one it was 
 
 and then out of nowhere out of nothing they were surrounded at least thirty hooded figures suspended in midair formed a vast circle in the middle of which the order members had risen oblivious c screams a blaze of green light on every side hagrid gave a yell and the motorbike rolled over harry lost any sense of where they were streetlights above him yells around him he was clinging to the sidecar for dear life hedwigs cage the firebolt and his rucksack slipped from beneath his knees c 
 
 no c help 
 
 the broomstick spun too but he just managed to seize the strap of his rucksack and the top of the cage as the motorbike swung the right way up again a seconds relief and then another burst of green light the owl screeched and fell to the floor of the cage 
 
 no c no 
 
 the motorbike zoomed forward harry glimpsed hooded death eaters scattering as hagrid blasted through their circle 
 
 hedwig c hedwig c 
 
 but the owl lay motionless and pathetic as a toy on the floor of her cage he could not take it in and his terror for the others was paramount he glanced over his shoulder and saw a mass of people moving flares of green light two pairs of people on brooms soaring off into the distance but he could not tell who they were c 
 
 hagrid weve got to go back weve got to go back he yelled over the thunderous roar of the engine pulling out his wand ramming hedwigs cage into the floor refusing to believe that she was dead hagrid turn around 
 
 my jobs ter get you there safe harry bellow hagrid and he opened the throttle stop c stop harry shouted but as he looked back again two jets of green light flew past his left ear four death eaters had broken away from the circle and were pursuing them aiming for hagrids broad back hagrid swerved but the death eaters were keeping up with the bike more curses shot after them and harry had to sink low into the sidecar to avoid them wriggling around he cried stupefy and a red bolt of light shot from his own wand cleaving a gap between the four pursuing death eaters as they scattered to avoid it 
 
 hold on harry thisll do for em roared hagrid and harry looked up just in time to see hagrid slamming a thick finger into a green button near the fuel gauge a wall a solid black wall erupted out of the exhaust pipe craning his neck harry saw it expand into being in midair three of the death eaters swerved and avoided it but the fourth was not so lucky he vanished from view and then dropped like a boulder from behind it his broomstick broken into pieces one of his fellows slowed up to save him but they and the airborne wall were swallowed by darkness as hagrid leaned low over the handlebars and sped up 
 
 more killing curses flew past harrys head from the two remaining death eaters wands they were aiming for hagrid harry responded with further stunning spells red and green collided in midair in a shower of multicolored sparks and harry thought wildly of fireworks and the muggles below who would have no idea what was happening c 
 
 here we go again harry hold on yelled hagrid and he jabbed at a second button this time a great net burst from the bikes exhaust but the death eaters were ready for it not only did they swerve to avoid it but the companion who had slowed to save their unconscious friend had caught up he bloomed suddenly out of the darkness and now three of them were pursuing the motorbike all shooting curses after it 
 
 thisll do it harry hold on tight yelled hagrid and harry saw him slam his whole hand onto the purple button beside the speedometer 
 
 with an unmistakable bellowing roar dragon fire burst from the exhaust and blue and the motorbike shot forward like a bullet with a sound of wrenching metal harry saw the death eaters swerve out of sight to avoid the deadly trail of flame and at the same time felt the sidecar sway ominously its metal connections to the bike had splintered with the force of acceleration 
 
 its all righ harry bellowed hagrid now thrown flat onto the back by the surge of speed nobody was steering now and the sidecar was starting to twist violently in the bikes slipstream 
 
 im on it harry don worry hagrid yelled and from inside his jacket pocket he pulled his flowery pink umbrella 
 
 hagrid no let me 
 
 reparo 
 
 there was a deafening bang and the sidecar broke away from the bike completely harry sped forward propelled by the impetus of the bikes flight then the sidecar began to lose height c 
 
 in desperation harry pointed his wand at the sidecar and shouted wingardium leviosa 
 
 the sidecar rose like a cork unsteerable but at least still airborne he had but a split seconds relief however as more curses streaked past him the three death eaters were closing in 
 
 im comin harry hagrid yelled from out of the darkness but harry could feel the sidecar beginning to sink again crouching as low as he could he pointed at the middle of the oncoming figures and yelled impedimenta 
 
 the jinx hit the middle death eater in the chest for a moment the man was absurdly in midair as though he had hit an invisible barrier one of his fellows almost collided with him c then the sidecar began to fall in earnest and the remaining death eater shot a curse so close to harry that he had to duck below the rim of the car knocking out a tooth on the edge of his seat c 
 
 im comin harry im comin 
 
 a huge hand seized the back of harrys robes and hoisted him out of the plummeting sidecar harry pulled his rucksack with him as he dragged himself onto the motorbikes seat and found himself with hagrid as they soared upward away from the two remaining death eaters harry spat blood out of his mouth pointed his wand at the falling sidecar and yelled confringo 
 
 he knew a dreadful pang for hedwig as it exploded the death eater nearest it was blasted off his broom and fell from sight his companion fell back and vanished 
 
 harry im sorry im sorry moaned hagrid i shouldnta tried ter repair it meself c yehve got no room c 
 
 its not a problem just keep flying harry shouted back as two more death eaters emerged out of the darkness drawing closer 
 
 as the curses came shooting across the intervening space again hagrid swerved and zigzagged harry knew that hagrid did not dare use the button again with harry seated so insecurely harry sent stunning spell after stunning spell back at their pursuers barely holding them off he shot another blocking jinx at them the closest death eater swerved to avoid it and his hood slipped and by the red light of his next stunning spell harry saw the strangely blank face of stanley shunpike c stan c 
 
 expelliarmus harry yelled 
 
 thats him its him its the real one 
 
 the hooded death eaters shout reached harry even above the thunder of the motorbikes engine next moment both pursuers had fallen back and disappeared from view 
 
 harry whats happened bellowed hagrid whereve they gone 
 
 i dont know 
 
 but harry was afraid the hooded death eater had shouted its the real one how had he known he gazed around at the apparently empty darkness and felt its menace where were they 
 
 he clambered around on the seat to face forward and seized hold of the back of hagrids jacket 
 
 hagrid do the thing again lets get out of here 
 
 hold on tight then harry 
 
 there was a deafening screeching roar again and the fire shot from the exhaust harry felt himself slipping backwards off what little of the seat he had hagrid flung backward upon him barely maintaining his grip on the handlebars c i think weve lost em harry i think weve done it yelled hagrid 
 
 but harry was not convinced fear lapped at him as he looked left and right for pursuers he was sure would come why had they fallen back one of them had still had a wand its him its the real one they had said it right after he had tried to disarm stan 
 
 were nearly there harry weve nearly made it shouted hagrid 
 
 harry felt the bike drop a little though the lights down on the ground still seemed remote as stars 
 
 then the scar on his forehead burned like fire as a death eater appeared on either side of the bike two killing curses missed harry by millimeters cast from behind c and then harry saw him voldemort was flying like smoke on the wind without broomstick or thestral to hold him his face gleaming out of the blackness his white fingers raising his wand again c 
 
 hagrid let out a bellow of fear and steered the motorbike into a vertical dive clinging on for dear life harry sent stunning spells flying at random into the whirling night he saw a body fly past him and knew he had hit one of them but then he heard a bang and saw sparks from the engine the motorbike spiraled through the air completely out of control c 
 
 green jets of light shot past them again harry had no idea which way was up which down his scar was still burning he expected to die at any second a hooded figure on a broomstick was feet from him he saw it raise its arm c 
 
 no 
 
 with a shout of fury hagrid launched himself off the bike at the death eater to his horror harry saw both hagrid and the death eater falling out of sight their combined weight too much for the broomstick c 
 
 barely gripping the plummeting bike with his knees harry heard voldemort scream mine 
 
 it was over he could not see or hear where voldemort was he glimpsed another death eater swooping out of the way and heard avada c 
 
 as the pain from harrys scar forced his eyes shut his wand acted of its own accord he felt it drag his hand around like some great magnet saw a spurt of golden fire through his eyelids heard a crack and a scream of fury the remaining death eater yelled voldemort screamed no somehow harry found his nose an inch from the button he punched it with his hand and the bike shot more flames into the air hurtling straight toward the ground 
 
 hagrid harry called holding on to the bike for dear life hagrid c accio hagrid 
 
 the motorbike sped up sucked towards the earth face level with the handlebars harry could see nothing but distant lights growing nearer and nearer he was going to crash and there was nothing he could do about it behind him came another scream your wand selwyn give me your wand 
 
 he felt voldemort before he saw him looking sideways he stared into the red eyes and was sure they would be the last thing he ever saw voldemort preparing to curse him once more c 
 
 and then voldemort vanished harry looked down and saw hagrid on the ground below him he pulled hard at the handlebars to avoid hitting him groped for the brake but with an earsplitting ground trembling crash he smashed into a muddy pond

 fairy tales of hans christian andersen 
 a rose from grave 
 by hans christian andersen 
 
 all the songs of the east speak of the love of the nightingale for the rose in the silent starlight night the winged songster serenades the fragrant flowers 
 
 not far from smyrna where the merchant drives his loaded 
 camels proudly arching their long necks as they journey beneath the 
 lofty pines over holy ground i saw a hedge of roses the 
 flew among the branches of the tall trees and as the 
 sunbeams fell upon her wings they glistened as if they were 
 on the grew a flower more beautiful than 
 them all and to her the nightingale sung of his woes but the rose 
 remained silent not even a dewdrop lay like a tear of sympathy on her 
 leaves at last she bowed her head over a heap of stones and said 
 here rests the greatest singer in the world over his tomb will i 
 spread my fragrance and on it i will let my leaves fall when the 
 storm scatters them he who sung of troy became earth and from that earth i have sprung i a rose from the grave of homer am too lofty to bloom for a nightingale then the nightingale sung himself to 
 death a came by with his loaded camels and his black 
 slaves his little son found the dead bird and buried the lovely 
 songster in the grave of the great homer while the rose trembled in 
 the wind 
 
 the evening came and the rose wrapped her leaves more closely 
 round her and dreamed and this was her dream 
 
 it was a fair sunshiny day a crowd of strangers drew near who had 
 undertaken a pilgrimage to the grave of homer among the strangers was a minstrel from the north the home of the clouds and the brilliant 
 lights of the aurora borealis he plucked the rose and placed it in 
 a book and carried it away into a distant part of the world his 
 fatherland the rose faded with grief and lay between the leaves of 
 the book which he opened in his own home saying here is a rose 
 from the grave of homer 
 
 then the flower awoke from her dream and trembled in the wind 
 a drop of dew fell from the leaves upon the grave the sun 
 rose and the flower bloomed more beautiful than ever the day was 
 hot and she was still in her own warm asia then footsteps 
 approached strangers such as the rose had seen in her dream came 
 by and among them was a poet from the north he plucked the rose 
 pressed a kiss upon her fresh mouth and carried her away to the 
 home of the clouds and the northern lights like a mummy the flower 
 now rests in his iliad and as in her dream she hears him say 
 as he opens the book here is a rose from the grave of homer

 red 
 i could see why some of the boys took him for snobby he had a quiet way about him a walk and a talk that just normal around 
 here he strolled like a man in a park without a care or worry like 
 he had on an invisible coat that would shield him from this place 
 resumes playing catch 
 yes i think it would be fair to say i liked andy from the start 
 int mess hall day 
 red gets his breakfast and heads for a table andy falls in step slips him a square of paper 
 int cell night 
 lying on his bunk red unfolds the square a ten dollar bill 
 red 
 he was a man who adapted fast 
 ext loading dock day 
 under watchful supervision cons are bags of dirty 
 laundry from an eliot nursing home truck 
 red 
 years later i found out brought in quite a bit more than just ten dollars 
 a certain bag hits the ground the truck driver shoots a look 
 at a black con leonard then ambles over to a guard to shoot 
 the shit leonard loads the bag onto a cart 
 int prison laundry day 
 bags are being unloaded we find leonard working the line 
 red 
 when they check you into this hotel one of the bellhops bends you over and looks up your works just to make sure not carrying anything but a truly determined man can get an object quite a ways up there 
 leonard slips a small package out of the laundry bag hides it under his apron and keeps sorting 
 l int prison laundry exchange day 
 red deposits his dirty bundle and moves down the line to where the clean sheets are being handed out 
 red 
 how andy joined our happy little shawshank family with more 
 than five hundred dollars on his person determination 
 leonard catches eye turns and grabs a specific stack of clean sheets he hands it across to red 
 tight angle 
 and more than clean laundry changes hands two packs of cigarettes slide out of hand into 
 int cell day 
 red slips the package out of his sheets carefully checks to make sure coming then rips it open he pulls out the just as andy described red laughs softly 
 red 
 andy was right i finally got the joke it would take a man about six 
 hundred years to tunnel under the wall with one of these

 sophist 
 
 by plato 
 
 translated by benjamin jowett 
 book i 
 
 persons of the dialogue theodorus theaetetus socrates 
 an eleatic stranger whom theodorus and theaetetus bring 
 with them the younger socrates who is a silent auditor 
 
 theodorus here we are socrates true to our agreement of 
 yesterday and we bring with us a stranger from elea who is a 
 disciple of parmenides and zeno and a true philosopher 
 
 socrates is he not rather a god theodorus who comes to us in 
 the disguise of a stranger for homer says that all the gods and 
 especially the god of strangers are companions of the meek and 
 just and visit the good and evil among men and may not your 
 companion be one of those higher powers a deity 
 who has come to spy out our weakness in argument and to 
 us 
 
 theod nay socrates he is not one of the disputatious is 
 too good for that and in my opinion he is not a god at all but 
 divine he certainly is for this is a title which i should 
 give to all philosophers 
 
 soc capital my friend and i may add that they are almost as 
 hard to be discerned as the gods for the true philosophers and 
 such as are not merely made up for the occasion appear in various 
 forms unrecognized by the ignorance of men and they hover about 
 cities as homer declares looking from above upon human life and 
 some think nothing of them and others can never think enough and 
 sometimes they appear as statesmen and sometimes as sophists and 
 then again to many they seem to be no better than madmen i should 
 like to ask our eleatic friend if he would tell us what is thought 
 about them in italy and to whom the terms are applied 
 
 theod what terms 
 
 soc sophist statesman philosopher 
 
 theod what is your difficulty about them and what made you ask 
 
 soc i want to know whether by his countrymen they are regarded as 
 one or two or do they as the names are three distinguish 
 also three kinds and assign one to each name 
 
 theod i dare say that the stranger will not object to discuss the 
 question what do you say stranger 
 
 stranger i am far from objecting theodorus nor have i any 
 difficulty in replying that by us they are regarded as three but to 
 define precisely the nature of each of them is by no means a 
 slight or easy task 
 
 theod you have happened to light socrates almost on the very 
 question which we were asking our friend before we came 
 hither and he excused himself to us as he does now you although he admitted that the matter had been fully discussed and that he remembered the answer 
 
 soc then do not stranger deny us the first favour which 
 we ask of you i am sure that you will not and therefore i shall only beg of you to say whether you like and are accustomed to make a long oration on a subject which you want to explain to another or to 
 proceed by the method of question and answer i remember hearing a 
 very noble discussion in which parmenides employed the latter of the 
 two methods when i was a young man and he was far advanced 
 in years 
 
 str i prefer to talk with another when he responds pleasantly 
 and is light in hand if not i would rather have my own say 
 soc any one of the present company will respond kindly to you 
 and you can choose whom you like of them i should recommend you to take a young for you have a preference for some one else 
 
 str i feel ashamed socrates being a new comer into your 
 society instead of talking a little and hearing others talk to be 
 spinning out a long soliloquy or address as if i wanted to show 
 off for the true answer will certainly be a very long one a great 
 deal longer than might be expected from such a short and simple 
 question at the same time i fear that i may seem rude and 
 ungracious if i refuse your courteous request especially after what you have said for i certainly cannot object to your proposal that 
 theaetetus should respond having already conversed with him myself and being recommended by you to take him 
 theaetetus but are you sure stranger that this will be quite so 
 acceptable to the rest of the company as socrates imagines 
 
 str you hear them applauding theaetetus after that there is 
 nothing more to be said well then i am to argue with you 
 and if you tire of the argument you may complain of your friends and not of me 
 
 theaet i do not think that i shall tire and if i do i shall get 
 my friend here young socrates the namesake of the elder 
 socrates to help he is about my own age and my partner at the gymnasium and is constantly accustomed to work with me 
 
 str very good you can decide about that for yourself as we 
 proceed meanwhile you and i will begin together and enquire into 
 the nature of the sophist first of the three i should like you to 
 make out what he is and bring him to light in a discussion for at 
 present we are only agreed about the name but of the thing to which 
 we both apply the name possibly you have one notion and i another 
 whereas we ought always to come to an understanding about the thing 
 itself in terms of a definition and not merely about the name minus 
 the definition now the tribe of sophists which we are investigating 
 is not easily caught or defined and the world has long ago agreed 
 that if great subjects are to be adequately treated they must be 
 studied in the lesser and easier instances of them before we proceed 
 to the greatest of all and as i know that the tribe of sophists is 
 troublesome and hard to be caught i should recommend that 
 we practise beforehand the method which is to be applied to him on some simple and smaller thing unless you can suggest a better way 
 theaet indeed i cannot 
 
 str then suppose that we work out some lesser example 
 which will be a pattern of the greater 
 
 theaet good 
 
 str what is there which is well known and not great and is yet 
 as susceptible of definition as any larger thing shall i say an 
 angler he is familiar to all of us and not a very interesting or 
 important person 
 
 theaet he is not 
 
 str yet i suspect that he will furnish us with the sort of 
 definition and line of enquiry which we want 
 
 theaet very good 
 
 str let us begin by asking whether he is a man having art or not 
 having art but some other power 
 
 theaet he is clearly a man of art 
 
 str and of arts there are two kinds 
 
 theaet what are they 
 
 str there is agriculture and the tending of mortal creatures 
 and the art of constructing or moulding vessels and there is the 
 art of these may be appropriately called by a single 
 name 
 
 theaet what do you mean and what is the name 
 
 str he who brings into existence something that did not exist 
 before is said to be a producer and that which is brought into 
 existence is said to be produced 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str and all the arts which were just now mentioned are 
 characterized by this power of producing 
 
 theaet they are 
 
 str then let us sum them up under the name of productive or 
 creative art 
 
 theaet very good 
 
 str next follows the whole class of learning and cognition then 
 comes trade fighting hunting and since none of these produces 
 anything but is only engaged in conquering by word or deed or in 
 preventing others from conquering things which exist and have been 
 already each and all of these branches there 
 appears to be an art which may be called acquisitive 
 
 theaet yes that is the proper name 
 
 str seeing then that all arts are either acquisitive or 
 creative in which class shall we place the art of the angler 
 
 theaet clearly in the acquisitive class 
 
 str and the acquisitive may be subdivided into two parts there 
 is exchange which is voluntary and is effected by gifts hire 
 purchase and the other part of acquisitive which takes by force of 
 word or deed may be termed conquest 
 
 theaet that is implied in what has been said 
 
 str and may not conquest be again subdivided 
 theaet how 
 
 str open force may be called fighting and secret force may have 
 the general name of hunting 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str and there is no reason why the art of hunting should not be 
 further divided 
 
 theaet how would you make the division 
 
 str into the hunting of living and of lifeless prey 
 
 theaet yes if both kinds exist 
 
 str of course they exist but the hunting after lifeless things 
 having no special name except some sorts of diving and other small 
 matters may be omitted the hunting after living things may 
 be called animal hunting 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str and animal hunting may be truly said to have two divisions 
 hunting which has many kinds and names and 
 
 hunting or the hunting after animals who swim 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str and of swimming animals one class lives on the wing and the 
 other in the water 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str fowling is the general term under which the hunting of all 
 birds is included 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str the hunting of animals who live in the water has the general 
 name of fishing 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str and this sort of hunting may be further divided also into two 
 principal kinds 
 
 theaet what are they 
 
 str there is one kind which takes them in nets another 
 which takes them by a blow 
 
 theaet what do you mean and how do you distinguish them 
 
 str as to the first that surrounds and encloses anything 
 to prevent egress may be rightly called an enclosure 
 
 theaet very true 
 str for which reason twig baskets casting nets nooses creels 
 and the like may all be termed enclosures 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str and therefore this first kind of capture may be called by us 
 capture with enclosures or something of that sort 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str the other kind which is practised by a blow with hooks and 
 three pronged spears when summed up under one name may be called striking unless you theaetetus can find some better name 
 
 theaet never mind the you suggest will do very well 
 
 str there is one mode of striking which is done at night and by 
 the light of a fire and is by the hunters themselves called firing 
 or spearing by firelight 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str and the fishing by day is called by the general name 
 of barbing because the spears too are barbed at the point 
 
 theaet yes that is the term 
 
 str of this that which strikes the fish who is 
 below from above is called spearing because this is the way in 
 which the spears are mostly used 
 
 theaet yes it is often called so 
 
 str then now there is only one kind remaining 
 
 theaet what is that 
 
 str when a hook is used and the fish is not struck in any chance 
 part of his as be is with the spear but only about the head 
 and mouth and is then drawn out from below upwards with reeds and is the right name of that mode of fish theaetetus 
 
 theaet i suspect that we have now discovered the object of our 
 search 
 
 str then now you and i have come to an understanding not 
 only about the name of the art but about the definition of the thing itself one half of all art was of all the art 
 acquisitive art was conquest or taking by force half of this was 
 hunting and half of hunting was hunting animals half of this was 
 hunting water this again the under half was fishing 
 half of fishing was striking a part of striking was fishing with a 
 barb and one half of this again being the kind which strikes with 
 a hook and draws the fish from below upwards is the art 
 which we have been seeking and which from the nature of the operation is denoted angling or drawing up aspalienutike anaspasthai 
 
 theaet the result has been quite satisfactorily brought out 
 
 str and now following this pattern let us endeavour to find out 
 what a sophist is 
 
 theaet by all means 
 
 str the first question about the angler was whether he was a 
 skilled artist or unskilled 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str and shall we call our new friend unskilled or a thorough 
 master of his craft 
 
 theaet certainly not unskilled for his name as indeed you 
 imply must surely express his nature 
 
 str then he must be supposed to have some art 
 
 theaet what art 
 
 str by heaven they are cousins it never occurred to us 
 
 theaet who are cousins 
 
 str the angler and the sophist 
 
 theaet in what way are they related 
 
 str they both appear to me to be hunters 
 
 theaet how the sophist of the other we have spoken 
 
 str you remember our division of hunting into hunting after 
 swimming animals and land animals 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str and you remember that we subdivided the swimming and left the 
 land animals saying that there were many kinds of them 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str thus far then the sophist and the angler starting from the 
 art of acquiring take the same road 
 
 theaet so it would appear 
 
 str their paths diverge when they reach the art of animal 
 hunting the one going to the seashore and to the rivers and to the 
 lakes and angling for the animals which are in them 
 
 theaet very true 
 
 str while the other goes to land and water of another 
 of wealth and broad of generous youth and he also is 
 intending to take the animals which are in them 
 
 theaet what do you mean 
 
 str of hunting on land there are two principal divisions 
 
 theaet what are they 
 
 str one is the hunting of tame and the other of wild animals 
 
 theaet but are tame animals ever hunted 
 
 str yes if you include man under tame animals but if 
 you like you may say that there are no tame animals or that if there are man is not among them or you may say that man is a tame animal 
 but is not shall decide which of these alternatives you prefer 
 
 theaet i should say stranger that man is a tame animal and i 
 admit that he is hunted 
 
 str then let us divide the hunting of tame animals into two parts 
 theaet how shall we make the division 
 
 str let us define piracy tyranny the 
 whole military art by one name as hunting with violence 
 
 theaet very good 
 
 str but the art of the lawyer of the popular orator and the art 
 of conversation may be called in one word the art of persuasion 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str and of persuasion there may be said to be two kinds 
 
 theaet what are they 
 
 str one is private and the other public 
 
 theaet yes each of them forms a class 
 
 str and of private hunting one sort receives hire and the other 
 brings gifts 
 
 theaet i do not understand you 
 
 str you seem never to have observed the manner in which lovers 
 hunt 
 
 theaet to what do you refer 
 
 str i mean that they lavish gifts on those whom they hunt in 
 addition to other inducements 
 
 theaet most true 
 
 str let us admit this then to be the amatory art 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str but that sort of hireling whose conversation is pleasing and 
 who baits his hook only with pleasure and exacts nothing but his 
 maintenance in return we should all if i am not mistaken describe 
 as possessing flattery or an art of making things pleasant 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str and that sort which professes to form acquaintances only for 
 the sake of virtue and demands a reward in the shape of 
 money may be fairly called by another name 
 
 theaet to be sure 
 
 str and what is the name will you tell me 
 
 theaet it is obvious enough for i believe that we have 
 discovered the sophist which is as i conceive the proper name for 
 the class described 
 
 str then now theaetetus his art may be traced as a branch of 
 the appropriative acquisitive hunts 
 animals which hunts 
 money in the semblance of education 
 and this is termed sophistry and is a hunt after young men of 
 wealth and is the conclusion 
 
 theaet just so 
 
 str let us take another branch of his genealogy for he is a 
 professor of a great and many sided art and if we look back at what 
 has preceded we see that he presents another aspect besides that of 
 which we are speaking 
 
 theaet in what respect 
 
 str there were two sorts of acquisitive art the one 
 concerned with hunting the other with exchange 
 
 theaet there were 
 
 str and of the art of exchange there are two divisions the one 
 of giving and the other of selling 
 
 theaet let us assume that 
 
 str next will suppose the art of selling to be divided into two 
 parts 
 
 theaet how 
 
 str there is one part which is distinguished as the sale 
 of a own productions another which is the exchange of the works of others 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str and is not that part of exchange which takes place in 
 the about half of the whole termed retailing 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str and that which exchanges the goods of one city for those of 
 another by selling and buying is the exchange of the merchant 
 
 theaet to be sure 
 
 str and you are aware that this exchange of the merchant is of 
 two kinds it is partly concerned with food for the use of the body 
 and partly with the food of the soul which is bartered and 
 received in exchange for money 
 
 theaet what do you mean 
 
 str you want to know what is the meaning of food for the soul 
 the other kind you surely understand 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str take music in general and painting and marionette playing and 
 many other things which are purchased in one city and carried away 
 and sold in of the soul which are hawked about either 
 for the sake of instruction or not he who takes them 
 about and sells them be quite as truly called a merchant as he who 
 sells meats and drinks 
 
 theaet to be sure he may 
 
 str and would you not call by the same name him who buys up 
 knowledge and goes about from city to city exchanging his wares for 
 money 
 
 theaet certainly i should 
 
 str of this merchandise of the soul may not one part be fairly 
 termed the art of display and there is another part which is 
 certainly not less ridiculous but being a trade in learning must be 
 called by some name germane to the matter 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str the latter should have two descriptive of the sale 
 of the knowledge of virtue and the other of the sale of other kinds 
 of knowledge 
 
 theaet of course 
 
 str the name of corresponds well enough to the latter 
 but you must try and tell me the name of the other 
 
 theaet he must be the sophist whom we are seeking no other name 
 can possibly be right 
 
 str no other and so this trader in virtue again turns out to be 
 our friend the sophist whose art may now be traced from the art of 
 acquisition through exchange trade merchandise to a merchandise 
 of the soul which is concerned with speech and the knowledge of 
 virtue 
 
 theaet quite true 
 
 str and there may be a third reappearance of he may have 
 settled down in a city and may fabricate as well as buy these same 
 wares intending to live by selling them and he would still 
 be called a sophist 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str then that part of acquisitive art which exchanges and of 
 exchange which either sells a own productions or retails those 
 of others as the case may be and in either way sells the knowledge 
 of virtue you would again term sophistry 
 
 theaet i must if i am to keep pace with the argument 
 
 str let us consider once more whether there may not be yet 
 another aspect of sophistry 
 
 theaet what is it 
 
 str in the acquisitive there was a subdivision of the combative 
 or fighting art 
 
 theaet there was 
 
 str perhaps we had better divide it 
 
 theaet what shall be the divisions 
 
 str there shall be one division of the competitive and another 
 of the pugnacious 
 
 theaet very good 
 
 str that part of the pugnacious which is contest of 
 bodily strength may be properly called by some such name as violent 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str and when the war is one of words it may be termed 
 controversy 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str and controversy may be of two kinds 
 
 theaet what are they 
 
 str when long speeches are answered by long speeches and there 
 is public discussion about the just and unjust that is forensic 
 controversy 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str and there is a private sort of controversy which is cut up 
 into questions and answers and this is commonly called disputation 
 
 theaet yes that is the name 
 
 str and of disputation that sort which is only a discussion 
 about contracts and is carried on at random and without 
 is recognized by the reasoning faculty to be a distinct 
 class but has hitherto had no distinctive name and does not deserve to receive one from us 
 
 theaet no for the different sorts of it are too minute and 
 heterogeneous 
 
 str but that which proceeds by rules of art to dispute about 
 justice and injustice in their own nature and about things in 
 general we have been accustomed to call argumentation eristic 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str and of argumentation one sort wastes money and the other 
 makes money 
 
 theaet very true 
 
 str suppose we try and give to each of these two classes a name 
 
 theaet let us do so 
 
 str i should say that the habit which leads a man to neglect his 
 own affairs for the pleasure of conversation of which the style is 
 far from being agreeable to the majority of his hearers may 
 be fairly termed loquacity such is my opinion 
 
 theaet that is the common name for it 
 
 str but now who the other is who makes money out of private 
 disputation it is your turn to say 
 
 theaet there is only one true answer he is the wonderful 
 sophist of whom we are in pursuit and who reappears again for the 
 fourth time 
 
 str yes and with a fresh pedigree for he is the 
 species of the eristic disputatious controversial pugnacious 
 combative acquisitive family as the argument has already proven 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str how true was the observation that he was a animal 
 and not to be caught with one hand as they say 
 
 theaet then you must catch him with two 
 
 str yes we must if we can and therefore let us try another 
 track in our pursuit of him you are aware that there are certain 
 menial occupations which have names among servants 
 
 theaet yes there are many such which of them do you mean 
 
 str i mean such as sifting straining winnowing threshing 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str and besides these there are a great many more such 
 as carding spinning adjusting the warp and the woof and thousands of similar expressions are used in the arts 
 
 theaet of what are they to be patterns and what are we 
 going to do with them all 
 
 str i think that in all of these there is implied a notion of 
 division 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str then if as i was saying there is one art which includes all 
 of them ought not that art to have one name 
 
 theaes and what is the name of the art 
 
 str the art of discerning or discriminating 
 
 theaet very good 
 
 str think whether you cannot divide this 
 
 theaet i should have to think a long while 
 
 str in all the previously named processes either like has been 
 separated from like or the better from the worse 
 
 theaet i see now what you mean 
 
 str there is no name for the first kind of separation of the 
 second which throws away the worse and preserves the better i do 
 know a name 
 
 theaet what is it 
 
 str every discernment or discrimination of that kind as i have 
 observed is called a purification 
 
 theaet yes that is the usual expression 
 
 str and any one may see that purification is of two kinds 
 
 theaet perhaps so if he were allowed time to think but i do not 
 see at this moment 
 
 str there are many purifications of bodies which may with 
 propriety be comprehended under a single name 
 
 theaet what are they and what is their name 
 
 str there is the purification of living bodies in their inward 
 and in their outward parts of which the former is duly effected by 
 medicine and gymnastic the latter by the not very dignified art of 
 the and there is the purification of inanimate 
 this the arts of fulling and of furbishing in general attend in a number of minute particulars having a variety of names which are thought ridiculous 
 
 theaet very true 
 
 str there can be no doubt that they are thought ridiculous 
 
 theaetetus but then the dialectical art never considers whether the 
 benefit to be derived from the purge is greater or less than that to 
 be derived from the sponge and has not more interest in the one 
 than in the other her endeavour is to know what is and is 
 not kindred in all arts with a view to the acquisition of intelligence and having this in view she honours them all alike and when she makes comparisons she counts one of them not a whit more ridiculous than another nor does she esteem him who adduces as his example of hunting the art at all more decorous than another who cites that of the but only as the greater 
 pretender of the two and as to your question concerning the name 
 which was to comprehend all these arts of purification whether of 
 animate or inanimate bodies the art of dialectic is in no wise 
 particular about fine words if she maybe only allowed to have a 
 general name for all other purifications binding them up 
 together and separating them off from the purification of the soul or intellect for this is the purification at which she wants to arrive 
 and this we should understand to be her aim 
 
 theaet yes i understand and i agree that there are two sorts of 
 purification and that one of them is concerned with the 
 soul and that there is another which is concerned with the body 
 
 str excellent and now listen to what i am going to say 
 and try to divide further the first of the two 
 
 theaet whatever line of division you suggest i will endeavour to 
 assist you 
 
 str do we admit that virtue is distinct from vice in the soul 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str and purification was to leave the good and to cast 
 out whatever is bad 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str then any taking away of evil from the soul may be properly 
 called purification 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str and in the soul there are two kinds of evil 
 
 theaet what are they 
 
 str the one may be compared to disease in the body the other to 
 deformity 
 
 theaet i do not understand 
 
 str perhaps you have never reflected that disease and discord are 
 the same 
 
 theaet to this again i know not what i should reply 
 
 str do you not conceive discord to be a dissolution of kindred 
 clements originating in some disagreement 
 
 theaet just that 
 
 str and is deformity anything but the want of measure which is 
 always unsightly 
 
 theaet exactly 
 
 str and do we not see that opinion is opposed to desire pleasure 
 to anger reason to pain and that all these elements are opposed to 
 one another in the souls of bad men 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str and yet they must all be akin 
 
 theaet of course 
 
 str then we shall be right in calling vice a discord and 
 disease of the soul 
 
 theaet most true 
 
 str and when things having motion an aiming at an appointed 
 mark continually miss their aim and glance aside shall we say that 
 this is the effect of symmetry among them or of the want of 
 symmetry 
 
 theaet clearly of the want of symmetry 
 
 str but surely we know that no soul is voluntarily ignorant of 
 anything 
 
 theaet certainly not 
 
 str and what is ignorance but the aberration of a mind which is 
 bent on truth and in which the process of understanding is 
 perverted 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str then we are to regard an unintelligent soul as deformed and 
 devoid of symmetry 
 
 theaet very true 
 
 str then there are these two kinds of evil in the one 
 which is generally called vice and is obviously a disease of the 
 soul 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str and there is the other which they call ignorance and which 
 because existing only in the soul they will not allow to be vice 
 
 theaet i certainly admit what i at first there are 
 two kinds of vice in the soul and that we ought to consider 
 cowardice intemperance and injustice to be alike forms of 
 disease in the soul and ignorance of which there are all sorts of 
 varieties to be deformity 
 
 str and in the case of the body are there not two arts which 
 have to do with the two bodily states 
 
 theaet what are they 
 
 str there is gymnastic which has to do with deformity and 
 medicine which has to do with disease 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str and where there is insolence and injustice and cowardice is 
 not chastisement the art which is most required 
 
 theaet that certainly appears to be the opinion of mankind 
 
 str again of the various kinds of ignorance may not instruction 
 be rightly said to be the remedy 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str and of the art of instruction shall we say that there is one 
 or many kinds at any rate there are two principal ones think 
 
 theaet i will 
 
 str i believe that i can see how we shall soonest arrive at the 
 answer to this question 
 
 theaet how 
 
 str if we can discover a line which divides ignorance into two 
 halves for a division of ignorance into two parts will certainly 
 imply that the art of instruction is also twofold answering to the 
 two divisions of ignorance 
 
 theaet well and do you see what you are looking for 
 
 str i do seem to myself to see one very large and bad sort of 
 ignorance which is quite separate and may be weighed in the scale 
 against all other sorts of ignorance put together 
 
 theaet what is it 
 
 str when a person supposes that he knows and does not know this 
 appears to be the great source of all the errors of the intellect 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str and this if i am not mistaken is the kind of ignorance 
 which specially earns the title of stupidity 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str what name then shall be given to the sort of instruction 
 which gets rid of this 
 
 theaet the instruction which you mean stranger is i should 
 imagine not the teaching of handicraft arts but what thanks to 
 us has been termed education in this part the world 
 
 str yes theaetetus and by nearly all hellenes but we have 
 still to consider whether education admits of any further division 
 
 theaet we have 
 
 str i think that there is a point at which such a division is 
 possible 
 
 theaet where 
 
 str of education one method appears to be rougher and another 
 smoother 
 
 theaet how are we to distinguish the two 
 
 str there is the mode which our fathers commonly 
 practised towards their sons and which is still adopted by 
 of roughly reproving their errors or of gently advising 
 them which varieties may be correctly included under the 
 general term of admonition 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str but whereas some appear to have arrived at the conclusion 
 that all ignorance is involuntary and that no one who thinks 
 himself wise is willing to learn any of those things in which he is 
 conscious of his own cleverness and that the admonitory sort of 
 instruction gives much trouble and does little good 
 
 theaet there they are quite right 
 
 str accordingly they set to work to eradicate the spirit of 
 conceit in another way 
 
 theaet in what way 
 
 str they a words when he thinks that he is 
 saying something and is really saying nothing and easily convict 
 him of inconsistencies in his opinions these they then 
 collect by the dialectical process and placing them side by side show that they contradict one another about the same things in relation to the same things and in the same respect he seeing this is angry with himself and grows gentle towards others and thus is entirely delivered from great prejudices and harsh notions in a way which is most amusing to the hearer and produces the most lasting good effect on the person who is the subject of the operation for as the physician considers that the body will receive no benefit from 
 taking food until the internal obstacles have been removed so the 
 purifier of the soul is conscious that his patient will receive no 
 benefit from the application of knowledge until he is refuted and 
 from refutation learns modesty he must be purged of his prejudices 
 first and made to think that he knows only what he knows 
 and no more 
 
 theaet that is certainly the best and wisest state of mind 
 
 str for all these reasons theaetetus we must admit that 
 refutation is the greatest and chiefest of purifications and he who 
 has not been refuted though he be the great king himself is in an 
 awful state of impurity he is uninstructed and deformed in those 
 things in which he who would be truly blessed ought to be fairest 
 and purest 
 
 theaet very true 
 
 str and who are the ministers of this art 
 i am afraid to say the sophists 
 
 theaet why 
 
 str lest we should assign to them too high a prerogative 
 
 theaet yet the sophist has a certain likeness to our minister of 
 purification 
 
 str yes the same sort of likeness which a wolf who is the 
 fiercest of animals has to a dog who is the gentlest but he who 
 would not be found tripping ought to be very careful in this matter 
 of comparisons for they are most slippery things nevertheless let 
 us assume that the sophists are the men i say this 
 provisionally for i think that the line which divides them will be marked enough if proper care is taken 
 
 theaet likely enough 
 
 str let us grant then that from the discerning art comes 
 purification and from purification let there be separated off a 
 part which is concerned with the soul of this mental purification 
 instruction is a portion and of instruction education and of 
 education that refutation of vain conceit which has been discovered 
 in the present argument and let this be called by you and me the 
 art of sophistry 
 
 theaet very well and yet considering the number of 
 forms in which he has presented himself i begin to doubt how i can with any truth or confidence describe the real nature of the sophist 
 
 str you naturally feel perplexed and yet i think that he must be 
 still more perplexed in his attempt to escape us for as the proverb 
 says when every way is blocked there is no escape now 
 then is the time of all others to set upon him 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str first let us wait a moment and recover breath and 
 while we are resting we may reckon up in how many forms he has appeared in the first place he was discovered to be a paid hunter after wealth and youth 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str in the second place he was a merchant in the goods of the 
 soul 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str in the third place he has turned out to be a retailer of the 
 same sort of wares 
 
 theaet yes and in the fourth place he himself manufactured the 
 learned wares which he sold 
 
 str quite right i will try and remember the fifth myself he 
 belonged to the fighting class and was further distinguished as a 
 hero of debate who professed the eristic art 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str the sixth point was doubtful and yet we at last 
 agreed that he was a purger of souls who cleared away notions obstructive to knowledge 
 
 theaet very true 
 
 str do you not see that when the professor of any art has one 
 name and many kinds of knowledge there must be something wrong the multiplicity of names which is applied to him shows that the common principle to which all these branches of knowledge are 
 tending is not understood 
 
 theaet i should imagine this to be the case 
 
 str at any rate we will understand him and no indolence shall 
 prevent us let us begin again then and some of our 
 statements concerning the sophist there was one thing which 
 appeared to me especially characteristic of him 
 
 theaet to what are you referring 
 
 str we were saying of him if i am not mistaken that he was a 
 disputer 
 
 theaet we were 
 
 str and does he not also teach others the art of disputation 
 
 theaet certainly he does 
 
 str and about what does he profess that he teaches men to 
 dispute to begin at the he make them able to dispute about divine things which are invisible to men in general 
 
 theaet at any rate he is said to do so 
 
 str and what do you say of the visible things in heaven and 
 earth and the like 
 
 theaet certainly he disputes and teaches to dispute about them 
 
 str then again in private conversation when any universal 
 assertion is made about generation and essence we know that such 
 persons are tremendous argufiers and are able to impart their own 
 skill to others 
 
 theaet undoubtedly 
 
 str and do they not profess to make men able to dispute about law 
 and about politics in general 
 
 theaet why no one would have anything to say to them if they 
 did not make these professions 
 
 str in all and every art what the craftsman ought to say 
 in answer to any question is written down in a popular form and he who likes may learn 
 
 theaet i suppose that you are referring to the precepts of 
 protagoras about wrestling and the other arts 
 
 str yes my friend and about a good many other things in a 
 word is not the art of disputation a power of disputing about all 
 things 
 
 theaet certainly there does not seem to be much which is 
 left out 
 
 str but oh my dear youth do you suppose this possible for 
 perhaps your young eyes may see things which to our duller sight do 
 not appear 
 
 theaet to what are you alluding i do not think that i understand 
 your present question 
 
 str i ask whether anybody can understand all things 
 
 theaet happy would mankind be if such a thing were possible 
 
 soc but how can any one who is ignorant dispute in a rational 
 manner against him who knows 
 
 theaet he cannot 
 
 str then why has the sophistical art such a mysterious power 
 
 theaet to what do you refer 
 
 str how do the sophists make young men believe in their 
 supreme and universal wisdom for if they neither disputed nor were thought to dispute rightly or being thought to do so were deemed no wiser for their controversial skill then to quote your own 
 observation no one would give them money or be willing to learn their art 
 
 theaet they certainly would not 
 
 str but they are willing 
 
 theaet yes they are 
 
 str yes and the reason as i should imagine is that they are 
 supposed to have knowledge of those things about which they dispute 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str and they dispute about all things 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str and therefore to their disciples they appear to be 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str but they are not for that was shown to be impossible 
 
 theaet impossible of course 
 
 str then the sophist has been shown to have a sort of conjectural 
 or apparent knowledge only of all things which is not the truth 
 
 theaet exactly no better description of him could be given 
 
 str let us now take an illustration which will still more 
 clearly explain his nature 
 
 theaet what is it 
 
 str i will tell you and you shall answer me giving your very 
 closest attention suppose that a person were to profess not that 
 he could speak or dispute but that he knew how to make and do all 
 things by a single art 
 
 theaet all things 
 
 str i see that you do not understand the first word that i utter 
 for you do not understand the meaning of all 
 
 theaet no i do not 
 
 str under all things i include you and me and also animals and 
 trees 
 
 theaet what do you mean 
 
 str suppose a person to say that he will make you and me and all 
 creatures 
 
 theaet what would he mean by making he cannot be a 
 you said that he is a maker of animals 
 
 str yes and i say that he is also the maker of the sea and the 
 earth and the heavens and the gods and of all other things and 
 further that he can make them in no time and sell them for a few 
 pence 
 
 theaet that must be a jest 
 
 str and when a man says that he knows all things and can teach 
 them to another at a small cost and in a short time is not that a 
 jest 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str and is there any more artistic or graceful form of jest than 
 imitation 
 
 theaet certainly not and imitation is a very comprehensive term 
 which includes under one class the most diverse sorts of things 
 
 str we know of course that he who professes by one art to make 
 all things is really a painter and by the art makes 
 resemblances of real things which have the same name with 
 them and he can deceive the less intelligent sort of young children to whom he shows his pictures at a distance into the belief that he has the absolute power of making whatever he likes 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str and may there not be supposed to be an imitative art of 
 reasoning is it not possible to enchant the hearts of young men by 
 words poured through their ears when they are still at a distance 
 from the truth of facts by exhibiting to them fictitious arguments 
 and making them think that they are true and that the speaker is 
 the wisest of men in all things 
 
 theaet yes why should there not be another such art 
 
 str but as time goes on and their hearers advance in years and 
 come into closer contact with realities and have learnt by sad 
 experience to see and feel the truth of things are not the greater 
 part of them compelled to change many opinions which they formerly 
 entertained so that the great appears small to them and the easy 
 difficult and all their dreamy speculations are overturned by the 
 facts of life 
 
 theaet that is my view as far as i can judge although 
 at my age i may be one of those who see things at a distance only 
 
 str and the wish of all of us who are your friends is and 
 always will be to bring you as near to the truth as we can 
 without the sad reality and now i should like you to tell me whether 
 the sophist is not visibly a magician and imitator of true being or are we still disposed to think that he may have a true knowledge of the 
 various matters about which he disputes 
 
 theaet but how can he stranger is there any doubt 
 after what has been said that he is to be located in one of the divisions of play 
 
 str then we must place him in the class of magicians and mimics 
 
 theaet certainly we must 
 
 str and now our business is not to let the animal out for we 
 have got him in a sort of dialectical net and there is one thing 
 which he decidedly will not escape 
 
 theaet what is that 
 
 str the inference that he is a juggler 
 
 theaet precisely my own opinion of him 
 
 str then clearly we ought as soon as possible to divide the 
 art and go down into the net and if the sophist does 
 not run away from us to seize him according to orders and 
 deliver him over to reason who is the lord of the hunt and proclaim the capture of him and if he creeps into the recesses of the imitative 
 art and secretes himself in one of them to divide again and follow 
 him up until in some of imitation he is caught for our 
 method of tackling each and all is one which neither he nor any 
 other creature will ever escape in triumph 
 
 theaet well said and let us do as you propose 
 
 str well then pursuing the same analytic method as before i 
 think that i can discern two divisions of the imitative art but i 
 am not as yet able to see in which of them the desired form is to be 
 found 
 
 theaet will you tell me first what are two divisions of which you 
 are speaking 
 
 str one is the art of a likeness of 
 anything is made by producing a copy which is executed according to the proportions of the original similar in length and breadth and 
 depth each thing receiving also its appropriate colour 
 
 theaet is not this always the aim of imitation 
 
 str not always in works either of sculpture or of painting 
 which are of any magnitude there is a certain degree of deception 
 for artists were to give the true proportions of their fair works 
 the upper part which is farther off would appear to be out of 
 proportion in comparison with the lower which is nearer and so 
 they give up the truth in their images and make only the proportions 
 which appear to be beautiful disregarding the real ones 
 
 theaet quite true 
 
 str and that which being other is also like may we not 
 fairly call a likeness or image 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str and may we not as i did just now call that part of the 
 imitative art which is concerned with making such images the art of 
 likeness making 
 
 theaet let that be the name 
 
 str and what shall we call those resemblances of the beautiful 
 which appear such owing to the unfavourable position of the 
 spectator whereas if a person had the power of getting a correct view of works of such magnitude they would appear not even like that to which they profess to be like may we not call these appearances since they appear only and are not really like 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str there is a great deal of this kind of thing in 
 painting and in all imitation 
 
 theaet of course 
 
 str and may we not fairly call the sort of art which produces an 
 appearance and not an image phantastic art 
 
 theaet most fairly 
 
 str these then are the two kinds of image art of 
 making likenesses and phantastic or the art of making appearances 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str i was doubtful before in which of them i should place the 
 sophist nor am i even now able to see clearly verily he is a 
 wonderful and inscrutable creature and now in the cleverest 
 manner he has got into an impossible place 
 
 theaet yes he has 
 
 str do you speak advisedly or are you carried away at the moment 
 by the habit of assenting into giving a hasty answer 
 
 theaet may i ask to what you are referring 
 
 str my dear friend we are engaged in a very difficult 
 can be no doubt of that for how a thing can 
 appear and seem and not be or how a man can say a thing 
 which is not true has always been and still remains a very perplexing question can any one say or think that falsehood really exists and 
 avoid being caught in a contradiction indeed theaetetus the task is a difficult one 
 
 theaet why 
 
 str he who says that falsehood exists has the audacity to assert 
 the being of for this is implied in the possibility of 
 falsehood but my boy in the days when i was a boy the great 
 parmenides protested against this doctrine and to the end 
 of his life he continued to inculcate the same repeating both in verse and out of your mind from this way of enquiry for never will you show that is 
 such is his testimony which is confirmed by the very expression 
 when sifted a little would you object to begin with the 
 consideration of the words themselves 
 
 theaet never mind about me i am only desirous that you should 
 carry on the argument in the best way and that you should take me 
 with you 
 
 str very good and now say do we venture to utter the forbidden 
 word 
 
 theaet certainly we do 
 
 str let us be serious then and consider the question neither in 
 strife nor play suppose that one of the hearers of parmenides was 
 asked to is the term to be you know what 
 sort of object he would single out in reply and what answer he 
 would make to the enquirer 
 
 theaet that is a difficult question and one not to be answered 
 at all by a person like myself 
 
 str there is at any rate no difficulty in seeing that the 
 predicate is not applicable to any being 
 
 theaet none certainly 
 
 str and if not to being then not to something 
 
 theaet of course not 
 
 str it is also plain that in speaking of something we speak of 
 being for to speak of an abstract something naked and isolated from 
 all being is impossible 
 
 theaet impossible 
 
 str you mean by assenting to imply that he who says something 
 must say some one thing 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str some in the singular ti you would say is the sign of one 
 some in the dual tine of two some in the plural tines of many 
 
 theaet exactly 
 
 str then he who says not something must say absolutely nothing 
 theaet most assuredly 
 
 str and as we cannot admit that a man speaks and says nothing he 
 who says does not speak at all 
 
 theaet the difficulty of the argument can no further go 
 
 str not yet my friend is the time for such a word for there 
 still remains of all perplexities the first and greatest 
 touching the very foundation of the matter 
 
 theaet what do you mean do not be afraid to speak 
 
 str to that which is may be attributed some other thing which is 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str but can anything which is be attributed to that which is not 
 
 theaet impossible 
 
 str and all number is to be reckoned among things which are 
 
 theaet yes surely number if anything has a real existence 
 
 str then we must not attempt to attribute to number 
 either in the singular or plural 
 
 theaet the argument implies that we should be wrong in doing so 
 
 str but how can a man either express in words or even conceive in 
 thought things which are not or a thing which is not without number 
 
 theaet how indeed 
 
 str when we speak of things which are not attributing plurality 
 to 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str but on the other hand when we say what is not do we not 
 attribute unity 
 
 theaet manifestly 
 
 str nevertheless we maintain that you may not and ought not to 
 attribute being to 
 
 theaet most true 
 
 str do you see then that in itself can neither be 
 spoken uttered or thought but that it is unthinkable 
 unutterable unspeakable indescribable 
 
 theaet quite true 
 
 str but if so i was wrong in telling you just now that the 
 difficulty which was coming is the greatest of all 
 
 theaet what is there a greater still behind 
 
 str well i am surprised after what has been said already that 
 you do not see the difficulty in which he who would refute the 
 notion of is involved for he is compelled to contradict 
 himself as soon as he makes the attempt 
 
 theaet what do you mean speak more clearly 
 
 str do not expect clearness from me for i who maintain that 
 has no part either in the one or many just now 
 spoke and am still speaking of as one for i say do you understand 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str and a little while ago i said that is unutterable 
 unspeakable indescribable do you follow 
 
 theaet i do after a fashion 
 
 str when i introduced the word is did i not contradict what i 
 said before 
 
 theaet clearly 
 
 str and in using the singular verb did i not speak of 
 as one 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str and when i spoke of as indescribable and 
 unspeakable and unutterable in using each of these words in the 
 singular did i not refer to as one 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str and yet we say that strictly speaking it should not be 
 defined as one or many and should not even be called it for the 
 use of the word it would imply a form of unity 
 
 theaet quite true 
 
 str how then can any one put any faith in me for now 
 as always i am unequal to the refutation of and therefore as i was saying do not look to me for the right way of speaking about but come let us try the experiment with you 
 
 theaet what do you mean 
 
 str make a noble effort as becomes youth and endeavour with all 
 your might to speak of in a right manner without 
 introducing into it either existence or unity or plurality 
 
 theaet it would be a strange boldness in me which would 
 attempt the task when i see you thus discomfited 
 
 str say no more of ourselves but until we find some one or other 
 who can speak of without number we must acknowledge that the sophist is a clever rogue who will not be got out of his hole 
 
 theaet most true 
 
 str and if we say to him that he professes an art of making 
 appearances he will grapple with us and retort our argument upon 
 ourselves and when we call him an he will say 
 pray what do you mean at all by an image and i should like to know theaetetus how we can possibly answer the question 
 
 theaet we shall doubtless tell him of the images which are 
 reflected in water or in mirrors also of sculptures pictures and 
 other duplicates 
 
 str i see theaetetus that you have never made the 
 acquaintance of the sophist 
 
 theaet why do you think so 
 
 str he will make believe to have his eyes shut or to have none 
 
 theaet what do you mean 
 
 str when you tell him of something existing in a mirror or in 
 sculpture and address him as though he had eyes he will 
 laugh you to scorn and will pretend that he knows nothing of mirrors and streams or of sight at all he will say that he is asking about an 
 idea 
 
 theaet what can he mean 
 
 str the common notion pervading all these objects which you 
 speak of as many and yet call by the single name of image as 
 though it were the unity under which they were all included how 
 will you maintain your ground against him 
 
 theaet how stranger can i describe an image except as something 
 fashioned in the likeness of the true 
 
 str and do you mean this something to be some other true thing 
 or what do you mean 
 
 theaet certainly not another true thing but only a resemblance 
 
 str and you mean by true that which really is 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str and the not true is that which is the opposite of the true 
 
 theaet exactly 
 
 str a resemblance then is not really real if as you say not 
 true 
 
 theaet nay but it is in a certain sense 
 
 str you mean to say not in a true sense 
 
 theaet yes it is in reality only an image 
 
 str then what we call an image is in reality really unreal 
 
 theaet in what a strange complication of being and 
 we are involved 
 
 str strange i should think so see how by his reciprocation of 
 opposites the sophist has compelled us quite 
 against our will to admit the existence of 
 
 theaet yes indeed i see 
 
 str the difficulty is how to define his art without falling into 
 a contradiction 
 
 theaet how do you mean and where does the danger lie 
 
 str when we say that he deceives us with an illusion and that 
 his art is illusory do we mean that our soul is led by his art to 
 think falsely or what do we mean 
 
 theaet there is nothing else to be said 
 
 str again false opinion is that form of opinion which thinks the 
 opposite of the would assent 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str you mean to say that false opinion thinks what is not 
 
 theaet of course 
 
 str does false opinion think that things which are not are not 
 or that in a certain sense they are 
 
 theaet things that are not must be imagined to exist in a certain 
 sense if any degree of falsehood is to be possible 
 
 str and does not false opinion also think that things which most 
 certainly exist do not exist at all 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str and here again is falsehood 
 
 theaet 
 
 str and in like manner a false proposition will be deemed to be 
 one which are the nonexistence of things which are and the 
 existence of things which are not 
 
 theaet there is no other way in which a false proposition can 
 arise 
 
 str there is not but the sophist will deny these statements and 
 indeed how can any rational man assent to them when the very 
 expressions which we have just used were before acknowledged by us to be unutterable unspeakable indescribable unthinkable 
 do you see his point theaetetus 
 
 theaet of course he will say that we are contradicting ourselves 
 when we hazard the assertion that falsehood exists in opinion and 
 in words for in maintaining this we are compelled over and over 
 again to assert being of which we admitted just now to be 
 an utter impossibility 
 
 str how well you remember and now it is high time to hold a 
 consultation as to what we ought to do about the sophist for if we 
 persist in looking for him in the class of false workers and 
 magicians you see that the handles for objection and the 
 difficulties which will arise are very numerous and obvious 
 
 theaet they are indeed 
 
 str we have gone through but a very small portion of 
 them and they are really infinite 
 
 theaet if that is the case we cannot possibly catch the sophist 
 
 str shall we then be so as to give him up 
 
 theaet certainly not i should say if we can get the slightest 
 hold upon him 
 
 str will you then forgive me and as your words imply not be 
 altogether displeased if i flinch a little from the grasp of such a 
 sturdy argument 
 
 theaet to be sure i will 
 
 str i have a yet more urgent request to make 
 
 theaet which is 
 
 str that you will promise not to regard me as a parricide 
 
 theaet and why 
 
 str because in i must test the philosophy of my 
 father parmenides and try to prove by main force that in a certain 
 sense is and that being on the other hand is not 
 
 theaet some attempt of the kind is clearly needed 
 
 str yes a blind man as they say might see that and unless 
 these questions are decided in one way or another no one when he 
 speaks false words or false opinion or idols or images or 
 imitations or appearances or about the arts which are concerned 
 with them can avoid falling into ridiculous contradictions 
 
 theaet most true 
 
 str and therefore i must venture to lay hands on my 
 argument for if i am to be i shall have to give 
 the matter up 
 
 theaet nothing in the world should ever induce us to do so 
 
 str i have a third little request which i wish to make 
 
 theaet what is it 
 
 str you heard have always felt and still 
 i have no heart for this argument 
 
 theaet i did 
 
 str i tremble at the thought of what i have said and expect that 
 you will deem me mad when you hear of my sudden changes and 
 shiftings let me therefore observe that i am examining the 
 question entirely out of regard for you 
 
 theaet there is no reason for you to fear that i shall impute any 
 impropriety to you if you attempt this refutation and proof take 
 heart therefore and proceed 
 
 str and where shall i begin the perilous enterprise i think that 
 the road which i must take is 
 
 theaet me hear 
 
 str i think that we had better first of all consider the points 
 which at present are regard as lest we may have fallen 
 into some confusion and be too ready to assent to one another 
 fancying that we are quite clear about them 
 theaet say more distinctly what you mean 
 
 str i think that parmenides and all ever yet undertook to 
 determine the number and nature of existences talked to us in 
 rather a light and easy strain 
 
 theaet how 
 
 str as if we had been children to whom they repeated each his 
 own mythus or said that there were three principles and 
 that at one time there was war between certain of them and 
 then again there was peace and they were married and begat children 
 and brought them up and another spoke of two moist and a dry or a hot and a cold and made them marry and cohabit the eleatics however in our part of the world say that things are many in name but in nature one this is their mythus which goes back to xenophanes and is even older then there are ionian and in more 
 recent times sicilian muses who have arrived at the conclusion that 
 to unite the two principles is safer and to say that being is one and 
 many and that these are held together by enmity and friendship 
 ever parting ever meeting as muses assert while the 
 gentler ones do not insist on the perpetual strife and peace but 
 admit a relaxation and alternation of them peace and unity sometimes prevailing under the sway of aphrodite and then again plurality and war by reason of a principle of strife whether any of them spoke the truth in all this is hard to determine besides antiquity and famous men should have reverence and not be liable to accusations so serious yet one thing may be said of them without offence 
 
 theaet what thing 
 
 str that they went on their several ways disdaining to notice 
 people like ourselves they did not care whether they took us with 
 them or left us behind them 
 
 theaet how do you mean 
 
 str i mean to say that when they talk of one two or more 
 elements which are or have become or are becoming or again of heat 
 mingling with cold assuming in some other part of their works 
 separations and me theaetetus do you understand 
 what they mean by these expressions when i was a younger man i 
 used to fancy that i understood quite well what was meant by the 
 term which is our present subject of dispute 
 and now you see in what a fix we are about it 
 
 theaet i see 
 
 str and very likely we have been getting into the same perplexity 
 about being and yet may fancy that when anybody utters 
 the word we understand him quite easily although we do not know about but we may be equally ignorant of both 
 
 theaet i dare say 
 
 str and the same may be said of all the terms just mentioned 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str the consideration of most of them may be deferred but we had 
 better now discuss the chief captain and leader of them 
 
 theaet of what are you speaking you clearly think that we must 
 first investigate what people mean by the word being 
 
 str you follow close at heels theaetetus for the right method 
 i conceive will be to call into our presence the dualistic 
 philosophers and to interrogate them come we will say ye who 
 affirm that hot and cold or any other two principles are the 
 universe 
 what is this term which you apply to both of them and what do you 
 mean when you say that both and each of them are how are we to 
 understand the word are upon your view are we to suppose that 
 there is a third principle over and above the other in 
 all and not two for clearly you cannot say that one of the two 
 principles is being and yet attribute being equally to both of 
 them for if you did whichever of the two is identified with 
 being will comprehend the other and so they will be one and not 
 two

 sophist 
 
 by plato 
 
 translated by benjamin jowett 
 book i 
 
 persons of the dialogue theodorus theaetetus socrates 
 an eleatic stranger whom theodorus and theaetetus bring 
 with them the younger socrates who is a silent auditor 
 
 theodorus here we are socrates true to our agreement of 
 yesterday and we bring with us a stranger from elea who is a 
 disciple of parmenides and zeno and a true philosopher 
 
 socrates is he not rather a god theodorus who comes to us in 
 the disguise of a stranger for homer says that all the gods and 
 especially the god of strangers are companions of the meek and 
 just and visit the good and evil among men and may not your 
 companion be one of those higher powers a deity 
 who has come to spy out our weakness in argument and to 
 us 
 
 theod nay socrates he is not one of the disputatious is 
 too good for that and in my opinion he is not a god at all but 
 divine he certainly is for this is a title which i should 
 give to all philosophers 
 
 soc capital my friend and i may add that they are almost as 
 hard to be discerned as the gods for the true philosophers and 
 such as are not merely made up for the occasion appear in various 
 forms unrecognized by the ignorance of men and they hover about 
 cities as homer declares looking from above upon human life and 
 some think nothing of them and others can never think enough and 
 sometimes they appear as statesmen and sometimes as sophists and 
 then again to many they seem to be no better than madmen i should 
 like to ask our eleatic friend if he would tell us what is thought 
 about them in italy and to whom the terms are applied 
 
 theod what terms 
 
 soc sophist statesman philosopher 
 
 theod what is your difficulty about them and what made you ask 
 
 soc i want to know whether by his countrymen they are regarded as 
 one or two or do they as the names are three distinguish 
 also three kinds and assign one to each name 
 
 theod i dare say that the stranger will not object to discuss the 
 question what do you say stranger 
 
 stranger i am far from objecting theodorus nor have i any 
 difficulty in replying that by us they are regarded as three but to 
 define precisely the nature of each of them is by no means a 
 slight or easy task 
 
 theod you have happened to light socrates almost on the very 
 question which we were asking our friend before we came 
 hither and he excused himself to us as he does now you although he admitted that the matter had been fully discussed and that he remembered the answer 
 
 soc then do not stranger deny us the first favour which 
 we ask of you i am sure that you will not and therefore i shall only beg of you to say whether you like and are accustomed to make a long oration on a subject which you want to explain to another or to 
 proceed by the method of question and answer i remember hearing a 
 very noble discussion in which parmenides employed the latter of the 
 two methods when i was a young man and he was far advanced 
 in years 
 
 str i prefer to talk with another when he responds pleasantly 
 and is light in hand if not i would rather have my own say 
 soc any one of the present company will respond kindly to you 
 and you can choose whom you like of them i should recommend you to take a young for you have a preference for some one else 
 
 str i feel ashamed socrates being a new comer into your 
 society instead of talking a little and hearing others talk to be 
 spinning out a long soliloquy or address as if i wanted to show 
 off for the true answer will certainly be a very long one a great 
 deal longer than might be expected from such a short and simple 
 question at the same time i fear that i may seem rude and 
 ungracious if i refuse your courteous request especially after what you have said for i certainly cannot object to your proposal that 
 theaetetus should respond having already conversed with him myself and being recommended by you to take him 
 theaetetus but are you sure stranger that this will be quite so 
 acceptable to the rest of the company as socrates imagines 
 
 str you hear them applauding theaetetus after that there is 
 nothing more to be said well then i am to argue with you 
 and if you tire of the argument you may complain of your friends and not of me 
 
 theaet i do not think that i shall tire and if i do i shall get 
 my friend here young socrates the namesake of the elder 
 socrates to help he is about my own age and my partner at the gymnasium and is constantly accustomed to work with me 
 
 str very good you can decide about that for yourself as we 
 proceed meanwhile you and i will begin together and enquire into 
 the nature of the sophist first of the three i should like you to 
 make out what he is and bring him to light in a discussion for at 
 present we are only agreed about the name but of the thing to which 
 we both apply the name possibly you have one notion and i another 
 whereas we ought always to come to an understanding about the thing 
 itself in terms of a definition and not merely about the name minus 
 the definition now the tribe of sophists which we are investigating 
 is not easily caught or defined and the world has long ago agreed 
 that if great subjects are to be adequately treated they must be 
 studied in the lesser and easier instances of them before we proceed 
 to the greatest of all and as i know that the tribe of sophists is 
 troublesome and hard to be caught i should recommend that 
 we practise beforehand the method which is to be applied to him on some simple and smaller thing unless you can suggest a better way 
 theaet indeed i cannot 
 
 str then suppose that we work out some lesser example 
 which will be a pattern of the greater 
 
 theaet good 
 
 str what is there which is well known and not great and is yet 
 as susceptible of definition as any larger thing shall i say an 
 angler he is familiar to all of us and not a very interesting or 
 important person 
 
 theaet he is not 
 
 str yet i suspect that he will furnish us with the sort of 
 definition and line of enquiry which we want 
 
 theaet very good 
 
 str let us begin by asking whether he is a man having art or not 
 having art but some other power 
 
 theaet he is clearly a man of art 
 
 str and of arts there are two kinds 
 
 theaet what are they 
 
 str there is agriculture and the tending of mortal creatures 
 and the art of constructing or moulding vessels and there is the 
 art of these may be appropriately called by a single 
 name 
 
 theaet what do you mean and what is the name 
 
 str he who brings into existence something that did not exist 
 before is said to be a producer and that which is brought into 
 existence is said to be produced 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str and all the arts which were just now mentioned are 
 characterized by this power of producing 
 
 theaet they are 
 
 str then let us sum them up under the name of productive or 
 creative art 
 
 theaet very good 
 
 str next follows the whole class of learning and cognition then 
 comes trade fighting hunting and since none of these produces 
 anything but is only engaged in conquering by word or deed or in 
 preventing others from conquering things which exist and have been 
 already each and all of these branches there 
 appears to be an art which may be called acquisitive 
 
 theaet yes that is the proper name 
 
 str seeing then that all arts are either acquisitive or 
 creative in which class shall we place the art of the angler 
 
 theaet clearly in the acquisitive class 
 
 str and the acquisitive may be subdivided into two parts there 
 is exchange which is voluntary and is effected by gifts hire 
 purchase and the other part of acquisitive which takes by force of 
 word or deed may be termed conquest 
 
 theaet that is implied in what has been said 
 
 str and may not conquest be again subdivided 
 theaet how 
 
 str open force may be called fighting and secret force may have 
 the general name of hunting 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str and there is no reason why the art of hunting should not be 
 further divided 
 
 theaet how would you make the division 
 
 str into the hunting of living and of lifeless prey 
 
 theaet yes if both kinds exist 
 
 str of course they exist but the hunting after lifeless things 
 having no special name except some sorts of diving and other small 
 matters may be omitted the hunting after living things may 
 be called animal hunting 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str and animal hunting may be truly said to have two divisions 
 hunting which has many kinds and names and 
 
 hunting or the hunting after animals who swim 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str and of swimming animals one class lives on the wing and the 
 other in the water 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str fowling is the general term under which the hunting of all 
 birds is included 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str the hunting of animals who live in the water has the general 
 name of fishing 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str and this sort of hunting may be further divided also into two 
 principal kinds 
 
 theaet what are they 
 
 str there is one kind which takes them in nets another 
 which takes them by a blow 
 
 theaet what do you mean and how do you distinguish them 
 
 str as to the first that surrounds and encloses anything 
 to prevent egress may be rightly called an enclosure 
 
 theaet very true 
 str for which reason twig baskets casting nets nooses creels 
 and the like may all be termed enclosures 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str and therefore this first kind of capture may be called by us 
 capture with enclosures or something of that sort 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str the other kind which is practised by a blow with hooks and 
 three pronged spears when summed up under one name may be called striking unless you theaetetus can find some better name 
 
 theaet never mind the you suggest will do very well 
 
 str there is one mode of striking which is done at night and by 
 the light of a fire and is by the hunters themselves called firing 
 or spearing by firelight 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str and the fishing by day is called by the general name 
 of barbing because the spears too are barbed at the point 
 
 theaet yes that is the term 
 
 str of this that which strikes the fish who is 
 below from above is called spearing because this is the way in 
 which the spears are mostly used 
 
 theaet yes it is often called so 
 
 str then now there is only one kind remaining 
 
 theaet what is that 
 
 str when a hook is used and the fish is not struck in any chance 
 part of his as be is with the spear but only about the head 
 and mouth and is then drawn out from below upwards with reeds and is the right name of that mode of fish theaetetus 
 
 theaet i suspect that we have now discovered the object of our 
 search 
 
 str then now you and i have come to an understanding not 
 only about the name of the art but about the definition of the thing itself one half of all art was of all the art 
 acquisitive art was conquest or taking by force half of this was 
 hunting and half of hunting was hunting animals half of this was 
 hunting water this again the under half was fishing 
 half of fishing was striking a part of striking was fishing with a 
 barb and one half of this again being the kind which strikes with 
 a hook and draws the fish from below upwards is the art 
 which we have been seeking and which from the nature of the operation is denoted angling or drawing up aspalienutike anaspasthai 
 
 theaet the result has been quite satisfactorily brought out 
 
 str and now following this pattern let us endeavour to find out 
 what a sophist is 
 
 theaet by all means 
 
 str the first question about the angler was whether he was a 
 skilled artist or unskilled 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str and shall we call our new friend unskilled or a thorough 
 master of his craft 
 
 theaet certainly not unskilled for his name as indeed you 
 imply must surely express his nature 
 
 str then he must be supposed to have some art 
 
 theaet what art 
 
 str by heaven they are cousins it never occurred to us 
 
 theaet who are cousins 
 
 str the angler and the sophist 
 
 theaet in what way are they related 
 
 str they both appear to me to be hunters 
 
 theaet how the sophist of the other we have spoken 
 
 str you remember our division of hunting into hunting after 
 swimming animals and land animals 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str and you remember that we subdivided the swimming and left the 
 land animals saying that there were many kinds of them 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str thus far then the sophist and the angler starting from the 
 art of acquiring take the same road 
 
 theaet so it would appear 
 
 str their paths diverge when they reach the art of animal 
 hunting the one going to the seashore and to the rivers and to the 
 lakes and angling for the animals which are in them 
 
 theaet very true 
 
 str while the other goes to land and water of another 
 of wealth and broad of generous youth and he also is 
 intending to take the animals which are in them 
 
 theaet what do you mean 
 
 str of hunting on land there are two principal divisions 
 
 theaet what are they 
 
 str one is the hunting of tame and the other of wild animals 
 
 theaet but are tame animals ever hunted 
 
 str yes if you include man under tame animals but if 
 you like you may say that there are no tame animals or that if there are man is not among them or you may say that man is a tame animal 
 but is not shall decide which of these alternatives you prefer 
 
 theaet i should say stranger that man is a tame animal and i 
 admit that he is hunted 
 
 str then let us divide the hunting of tame animals into two parts 
 theaet how shall we make the division 
 
 str let us define piracy tyranny the 
 whole military art by one name as hunting with violence 
 
 theaet very good 
 
 str but the art of the lawyer of the popular orator and the art 
 of conversation may be called in one word the art of persuasion 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str and of persuasion there may be said to be two kinds 
 
 theaet what are they 
 
 str one is private and the other public 
 
 theaet yes each of them forms a class 
 
 str and of private hunting one sort receives hire and the other 
 brings gifts 
 
 theaet i do not understand you 
 
 str you seem never to have observed the manner in which lovers 
 hunt 
 
 theaet to what do you refer 
 
 str i mean that they lavish gifts on those whom they hunt in 
 addition to other inducements 
 
 theaet most true 
 
 str let us admit this then to be the amatory art 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str but that sort of hireling whose conversation is pleasing and 
 who baits his hook only with pleasure and exacts nothing but his 
 maintenance in return we should all if i am not mistaken describe 
 as possessing flattery or an art of making things pleasant 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str and that sort which professes to form acquaintances only for 
 the sake of virtue and demands a reward in the shape of 
 money may be fairly called by another name 
 
 theaet to be sure 
 
 str and what is the name will you tell me 
 
 theaet it is obvious enough for i believe that we have 
 discovered the sophist which is as i conceive the proper name for 
 the class described 
 
 str then now theaetetus his art may be traced as a branch of 
 the appropriative acquisitive hunts 
 animals which hunts 
 money in the semblance of education 
 and this is termed sophistry and is a hunt after young men of 
 wealth and is the conclusion 
 
 theaet just so 
 
 str let us take another branch of his genealogy for he is a 
 professor of a great and many sided art and if we look back at what 
 has preceded we see that he presents another aspect besides that of 
 which we are speaking 
 
 theaet in what respect 
 
 str there were two sorts of acquisitive art the one 
 concerned with hunting the other with exchange 
 
 theaet there were 
 
 str and of the art of exchange there are two divisions the one 
 of giving and the other of selling 
 
 theaet let us assume that 
 
 str next will suppose the art of selling to be divided into two 
 parts 
 
 theaet how 
 
 str there is one part which is distinguished as the sale 
 of a own productions another which is the exchange of the works of others 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str and is not that part of exchange which takes place in 
 the about half of the whole termed retailing 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str and that which exchanges the goods of one city for those of 
 another by selling and buying is the exchange of the merchant 
 
 theaet to be sure 
 
 str and you are aware that this exchange of the merchant is of 
 two kinds it is partly concerned with food for the use of the body 
 and partly with the food of the soul which is bartered and 
 received in exchange for money 
 
 theaet what do you mean 
 
 str you want to know what is the meaning of food for the soul 
 the other kind you surely understand 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str take music in general and painting and marionette playing and 
 many other things which are purchased in one city and carried away 
 and sold in of the soul which are hawked about either 
 for the sake of instruction or not he who takes them 
 about and sells them be quite as truly called a merchant as he who 
 sells meats and drinks 
 
 theaet to be sure he may 
 
 str and would you not call by the same name him who buys up 
 knowledge and goes about from city to city exchanging his wares for 
 money 
 
 theaet certainly i should 
 
 str of this merchandise of the soul may not one part be fairly 
 termed the art of display and there is another part which is 
 certainly not less ridiculous but being a trade in learning must be 
 called by some name germane to the matter 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str the latter should have two descriptive of the sale 
 of the knowledge of virtue and the other of the sale of other kinds 
 of knowledge 
 
 theaet of course 
 
 str the name of corresponds well enough to the latter 
 but you must try and tell me the name of the other 
 
 theaet he must be the sophist whom we are seeking no other name 
 can possibly be right 
 
 str no other and so this trader in virtue again turns out to be 
 our friend the sophist whose art may now be traced from the art of 
 acquisition through exchange trade merchandise to a merchandise 
 of the soul which is concerned with speech and the knowledge of 
 virtue 
 
 theaet quite true 
 
 str and there may be a third reappearance of he may have 
 settled down in a city and may fabricate as well as buy these same 
 wares intending to live by selling them and he would still 
 be called a sophist 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str then that part of acquisitive art which exchanges and of 
 exchange which either sells a own productions or retails those 
 of others as the case may be and in either way sells the knowledge 
 of virtue you would again term sophistry 
 
 theaet i must if i am to keep pace with the argument 
 
 str let us consider once more whether there may not be yet 
 another aspect of sophistry 
 
 theaet what is it 
 
 str in the acquisitive there was a subdivision of the combative 
 or fighting art 
 
 theaet there was 
 
 str perhaps we had better divide it 
 
 theaet what shall be the divisions 
 
 str there shall be one division of the competitive and another 
 of the pugnacious 
 
 theaet very good 
 
 str that part of the pugnacious which is contest of 
 bodily strength may be properly called by some such name as violent 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str and when the war is one of words it may be termed 
 controversy 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str and controversy may be of two kinds 
 
 theaet what are they 
 
 str when long speeches are answered by long speeches and there 
 is public discussion about the just and unjust that is forensic 
 controversy 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str and there is a private sort of controversy which is cut up 
 into questions and answers and this is commonly called disputation 
 
 theaet yes that is the name 
 
 str and of disputation that sort which is only a discussion 
 about contracts and is carried on at random and without 
 is recognized by the reasoning faculty to be a distinct 
 class but has hitherto had no distinctive name and does not deserve to receive one from us 
 
 theaet no for the different sorts of it are too minute and 
 heterogeneous 
 
 str but that which proceeds by rules of art to dispute about 
 justice and injustice in their own nature and about things in 
 general we have been accustomed to call argumentation eristic 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str and of argumentation one sort wastes money and the other 
 makes money 
 
 theaet very true 
 
 str suppose we try and give to each of these two classes a name 
 
 theaet let us do so 
 
 str i should say that the habit which leads a man to neglect his 
 own affairs for the pleasure of conversation of which the style is 
 far from being agreeable to the majority of his hearers may 
 be fairly termed loquacity such is my opinion 
 
 theaet that is the common name for it 
 
 str but now who the other is who makes money out of private 
 disputation it is your turn to say 
 
 theaet there is only one true answer he is the wonderful 
 sophist of whom we are in pursuit and who reappears again for the 
 fourth time 
 
 str yes and with a fresh pedigree for he is the 
 species of the eristic disputatious controversial pugnacious 
 combative acquisitive family as the argument has already proven 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str how true was the observation that he was a animal 
 and not to be caught with one hand as they say 
 
 theaet then you must catch him with two 
 
 str yes we must if we can and therefore let us try another 
 track in our pursuit of him you are aware that there are certain 
 menial occupations which have names among servants 
 
 theaet yes there are many such which of them do you mean 
 
 str i mean such as sifting straining winnowing threshing 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str and besides these there are a great many more such 
 as carding spinning adjusting the warp and the woof and thousands of similar expressions are used in the arts 
 
 theaet of what are they to be patterns and what are we 
 going to do with them all 
 
 str i think that in all of these there is implied a notion of 
 division 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str then if as i was saying there is one art which includes all 
 of them ought not that art to have one name 
 
 theaes and what is the name of the art 
 
 str the art of discerning or discriminating 
 
 theaet very good 
 
 str think whether you cannot divide this 
 
 theaet i should have to think a long while 
 
 str in all the previously named processes either like has been 
 separated from like or the better from the worse 
 
 theaet i see now what you mean 
 
 str there is no name for the first kind of separation of the 
 second which throws away the worse and preserves the better i do 
 know a name 
 
 theaet what is it 
 
 str every discernment or discrimination of that kind as i have 
 observed is called a purification 
 
 theaet yes that is the usual expression 
 
 str and any one may see that purification is of two kinds 
 
 theaet perhaps so if he were allowed time to think but i do not 
 see at this moment 
 
 str there are many purifications of bodies which may with 
 propriety be comprehended under a single name 
 
 theaet what are they and what is their name 
 
 str there is the purification of living bodies in their inward 
 and in their outward parts of which the former is duly effected by 
 medicine and gymnastic the latter by the not very dignified art of 
 the and there is the purification of inanimate 
 this the arts of fulling and of furbishing in general attend in a number of minute particulars having a variety of names which are thought ridiculous 
 
 theaet very true 
 
 str there can be no doubt that they are thought ridiculous 
 
 theaetetus but then the dialectical art never considers whether the 
 benefit to be derived from the purge is greater or less than that to 
 be derived from the sponge and has not more interest in the one 
 than in the other her endeavour is to know what is and is 
 not kindred in all arts with a view to the acquisition of intelligence and having this in view she honours them all alike and when she makes comparisons she counts one of them not a whit more ridiculous than another nor does she esteem him who adduces as his example of hunting the art at all more decorous than another who cites that of the but only as the greater 
 pretender of the two and as to your question concerning the name 
 which was to comprehend all these arts of purification whether of 
 animate or inanimate bodies the art of dialectic is in no wise 
 particular about fine words if she maybe only allowed to have a 
 general name for all other purifications binding them up 
 together and separating them off from the purification of the soul or intellect for this is the purification at which she wants to arrive 
 and this we should understand to be her aim 
 
 theaet yes i understand and i agree that there are two sorts of 
 purification and that one of them is concerned with the 
 soul and that there is another which is concerned with the body 
 
 str excellent and now listen to what i am going to say 
 and try to divide further the first of the two 
 
 theaet whatever line of division you suggest i will endeavour to 
 assist you 
 
 str do we admit that virtue is distinct from vice in the soul 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str and purification was to leave the good and to cast 
 out whatever is bad 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str then any taking away of evil from the soul may be properly 
 called purification 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str and in the soul there are two kinds of evil 
 
 theaet what are they 
 
 str the one may be compared to disease in the body the other to 
 deformity 
 
 theaet i do not understand 
 
 str perhaps you have never reflected that disease and discord are 
 the same 
 
 theaet to this again i know not what i should reply 
 
 str do you not conceive discord to be a dissolution of kindred 
 clements originating in some disagreement 
 
 theaet just that 
 
 str and is deformity anything but the want of measure which is 
 always unsightly 
 
 theaet exactly 
 
 str and do we not see that opinion is opposed to desire pleasure 
 to anger reason to pain and that all these elements are opposed to 
 one another in the souls of bad men 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str and yet they must all be akin 
 
 theaet of course 
 
 str then we shall be right in calling vice a discord and 
 disease of the soul 
 
 theaet most true 
 
 str and when things having motion an aiming at an appointed 
 mark continually miss their aim and glance aside shall we say that 
 this is the effect of symmetry among them or of the want of 
 symmetry 
 
 theaet clearly of the want of symmetry 
 
 str but surely we know that no soul is voluntarily ignorant of 
 anything 
 
 theaet certainly not 
 
 str and what is ignorance but the aberration of a mind which is 
 bent on truth and in which the process of understanding is 
 perverted 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str then we are to regard an unintelligent soul as deformed and 
 devoid of symmetry 
 
 theaet very true 
 
 str then there are these two kinds of evil in the one 
 which is generally called vice and is obviously a disease of the 
 soul 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str and there is the other which they call ignorance and which 
 because existing only in the soul they will not allow to be vice 
 
 theaet i certainly admit what i at first there are 
 two kinds of vice in the soul and that we ought to consider 
 cowardice intemperance and injustice to be alike forms of 
 disease in the soul and ignorance of which there are all sorts of 
 varieties to be deformity 
 
 str and in the case of the body are there not two arts which 
 have to do with the two bodily states 
 
 theaet what are they 
 
 str there is gymnastic which has to do with deformity and 
 medicine which has to do with disease 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str and where there is insolence and injustice and cowardice is 
 not chastisement the art which is most required 
 
 theaet that certainly appears to be the opinion of mankind 
 
 str again of the various kinds of ignorance may not instruction 
 be rightly said to be the remedy 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str and of the art of instruction shall we say that there is one 
 or many kinds at any rate there are two principal ones think 
 
 theaet i will 
 
 str i believe that i can see how we shall soonest arrive at the 
 answer to this question 
 
 theaet how 
 
 str if we can discover a line which divides ignorance into two 
 halves for a division of ignorance into two parts will certainly 
 imply that the art of instruction is also twofold answering to the 
 two divisions of ignorance 
 
 theaet well and do you see what you are looking for 
 
 str i do seem to myself to see one very large and bad sort of 
 ignorance which is quite separate and may be weighed in the scale 
 against all other sorts of ignorance put together 
 
 theaet what is it 
 
 str when a person supposes that he knows and does not know this 
 appears to be the great source of all the errors of the intellect 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str and this if i am not mistaken is the kind of ignorance 
 which specially earns the title of stupidity 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str what name then shall be given to the sort of instruction 
 which gets rid of this 
 
 theaet the instruction which you mean stranger is i should 
 imagine not the teaching of handicraft arts but what thanks to 
 us has been termed education in this part the world 
 
 str yes theaetetus and by nearly all hellenes but we have 
 still to consider whether education admits of any further division 
 
 theaet we have 
 
 str i think that there is a point at which such a division is 
 possible 
 
 theaet where 
 
 str of education one method appears to be rougher and another 
 smoother 
 
 theaet how are we to distinguish the two 
 
 str there is the mode which our fathers commonly 
 practised towards their sons and which is still adopted by 
 of roughly reproving their errors or of gently advising 
 them which varieties may be correctly included under the 
 general term of admonition 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str but whereas some appear to have arrived at the conclusion 
 that all ignorance is involuntary and that no one who thinks 
 himself wise is willing to learn any of those things in which he is 
 conscious of his own cleverness and that the admonitory sort of 
 instruction gives much trouble and does little good 
 
 theaet there they are quite right 
 
 str accordingly they set to work to eradicate the spirit of 
 conceit in another way 
 
 theaet in what way 
 
 str they a words when he thinks that he is 
 saying something and is really saying nothing and easily convict 
 him of inconsistencies in his opinions these they then 
 collect by the dialectical process and placing them side by side show that they contradict one another about the same things in relation to the same things and in the same respect he seeing this is angry with himself and grows gentle towards others and thus is entirely delivered from great prejudices and harsh notions in a way which is most amusing to the hearer and produces the most lasting good effect on the person who is the subject of the operation for as the physician considers that the body will receive no benefit from 
 taking food until the internal obstacles have been removed so the 
 purifier of the soul is conscious that his patient will receive no 
 benefit from the application of knowledge until he is refuted and 
 from refutation learns modesty he must be purged of his prejudices 
 first and made to think that he knows only what he knows 
 and no more 
 
 theaet that is certainly the best and wisest state of mind 
 
 str for all these reasons theaetetus we must admit that 
 refutation is the greatest and chiefest of purifications and he who 
 has not been refuted though he be the great king himself is in an 
 awful state of impurity he is uninstructed and deformed in those 
 things in which he who would be truly blessed ought to be fairest 
 and purest 
 
 theaet very true 
 
 str and who are the ministers of this art 
 i am afraid to say the sophists 
 
 theaet why 
 
 str lest we should assign to them too high a prerogative 
 
 theaet yet the sophist has a certain likeness to our minister of 
 purification 
 
 str yes the same sort of likeness which a wolf who is the 
 fiercest of animals has to a dog who is the gentlest but he who 
 would not be found tripping ought to be very careful in this matter 
 of comparisons for they are most slippery things nevertheless let 
 us assume that the sophists are the men i say this 
 provisionally for i think that the line which divides them will be marked enough if proper care is taken 
 
 theaet likely enough 
 
 str let us grant then that from the discerning art comes 
 purification and from purification let there be separated off a 
 part which is concerned with the soul of this mental purification 
 instruction is a portion and of instruction education and of 
 education that refutation of vain conceit which has been discovered 
 in the present argument and let this be called by you and me the 
 art of sophistry 
 
 theaet very well and yet considering the number of 
 forms in which he has presented himself i begin to doubt how i can with any truth or confidence describe the real nature of the sophist 
 
 str you naturally feel perplexed and yet i think that he must be 
 still more perplexed in his attempt to escape us for as the proverb 
 says when every way is blocked there is no escape now 
 then is the time of all others to set upon him 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str first let us wait a moment and recover breath and 
 while we are resting we may reckon up in how many forms he has appeared in the first place he was discovered to be a paid hunter after wealth and youth 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str in the second place he was a merchant in the goods of the 
 soul 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str in the third place he has turned out to be a retailer of the 
 same sort of wares 
 
 theaet yes and in the fourth place he himself manufactured the 
 learned wares which he sold 
 
 str quite right i will try and remember the fifth myself he 
 belonged to the fighting class and was further distinguished as a 
 hero of debate who professed the eristic art 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str the sixth point was doubtful and yet we at last 
 agreed that he was a purger of souls who cleared away notions obstructive to knowledge 
 
 theaet very true 
 
 str do you not see that when the professor of any art has one 
 name and many kinds of knowledge there must be something wrong the multiplicity of names which is applied to him shows that the common principle to which all these branches of knowledge are 
 tending is not understood 
 
 theaet i should imagine this to be the case 
 
 str at any rate we will understand him and no indolence shall 
 prevent us let us begin again then and some of our 
 statements concerning the sophist there was one thing which 
 appeared to me especially characteristic of him 
 
 theaet to what are you referring 
 
 str we were saying of him if i am not mistaken that he was a 
 disputer 
 
 theaet we were 
 
 str and does he not also teach others the art of disputation 
 
 theaet certainly he does 
 
 str and about what does he profess that he teaches men to 
 dispute to begin at the he make them able to dispute about divine things which are invisible to men in general 
 
 theaet at any rate he is said to do so 
 
 str and what do you say of the visible things in heaven and 
 earth and the like 
 
 theaet certainly he disputes and teaches to dispute about them 
 
 str then again in private conversation when any universal 
 assertion is made about generation and essence we know that such 
 persons are tremendous argufiers and are able to impart their own 
 skill to others 
 
 theaet undoubtedly 
 
 str and do they not profess to make men able to dispute about law 
 and about politics in general 
 
 theaet why no one would have anything to say to them if they 
 did not make these professions 
 
 str in all and every art what the craftsman ought to say 
 in answer to any question is written down in a popular form and he who likes may learn 
 
 theaet i suppose that you are referring to the precepts of 
 protagoras about wrestling and the other arts 
 
 str yes my friend and about a good many other things in a 
 word is not the art of disputation a power of disputing about all 
 things 
 
 theaet certainly there does not seem to be much which is 
 left out 
 
 str but oh my dear youth do you suppose this possible for 
 perhaps your young eyes may see things which to our duller sight do 
 not appear 
 
 theaet to what are you alluding i do not think that i understand 
 your present question 
 
 str i ask whether anybody can understand all things 
 
 theaet happy would mankind be if such a thing were possible 
 
 soc but how can any one who is ignorant dispute in a rational 
 manner against him who knows 
 
 theaet he cannot 
 
 str then why has the sophistical art such a mysterious power 
 
 theaet to what do you refer 
 
 str how do the sophists make young men believe in their 
 supreme and universal wisdom for if they neither disputed nor were thought to dispute rightly or being thought to do so were deemed no wiser for their controversial skill then to quote your own 
 observation no one would give them money or be willing to learn their art 
 
 theaet they certainly would not 
 
 str but they are willing 
 
 theaet yes they are 
 
 str yes and the reason as i should imagine is that they are 
 supposed to have knowledge of those things about which they dispute 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str and they dispute about all things 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str and therefore to their disciples they appear to be 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str but they are not for that was shown to be impossible 
 
 theaet impossible of course 
 
 str then the sophist has been shown to have a sort of conjectural 
 or apparent knowledge only of all things which is not the truth 
 
 theaet exactly no better description of him could be given 
 
 str let us now take an illustration which will still more 
 clearly explain his nature 
 
 theaet what is it 
 
 str i will tell you and you shall answer me giving your very 
 closest attention suppose that a person were to profess not that 
 he could speak or dispute but that he knew how to make and do all 
 things by a single art 
 
 theaet all things 
 
 str i see that you do not understand the first word that i utter 
 for you do not understand the meaning of all 
 
 theaet no i do not 
 
 str under all things i include you and me and also animals and 
 trees 
 
 theaet what do you mean 
 
 str suppose a person to say that he will make you and me and all 
 creatures 
 
 theaet what would he mean by making he cannot be a 
 you said that he is a maker of animals 
 
 str yes and i say that he is also the maker of the sea and the 
 earth and the heavens and the gods and of all other things and 
 further that he can make them in no time and sell them for a few 
 pence 
 
 theaet that must be a jest 
 
 str and when a man says that he knows all things and can teach 
 them to another at a small cost and in a short time is not that a 
 jest 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str and is there any more artistic or graceful form of jest than 
 imitation 
 
 theaet certainly not and imitation is a very comprehensive term 
 which includes under one class the most diverse sorts of things 
 
 str we know of course that he who professes by one art to make 
 all things is really a painter and by the art makes 
 resemblances of real things which have the same name with 
 them and he can deceive the less intelligent sort of young children to whom he shows his pictures at a distance into the belief that he has the absolute power of making whatever he likes 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str and may there not be supposed to be an imitative art of 
 reasoning is it not possible to enchant the hearts of young men by 
 words poured through their ears when they are still at a distance 
 from the truth of facts by exhibiting to them fictitious arguments 
 and making them think that they are true and that the speaker is 
 the wisest of men in all things 
 
 theaet yes why should there not be another such art 
 
 str but as time goes on and their hearers advance in years and 
 come into closer contact with realities and have learnt by sad 
 experience to see and feel the truth of things are not the greater 
 part of them compelled to change many opinions which they formerly 
 entertained so that the great appears small to them and the easy 
 difficult and all their dreamy speculations are overturned by the 
 facts of life 
 
 theaet that is my view as far as i can judge although 
 at my age i may be one of those who see things at a distance only 
 
 str and the wish of all of us who are your friends is and 
 always will be to bring you as near to the truth as we can 
 without the sad reality and now i should like you to tell me whether 
 the sophist is not visibly a magician and imitator of true being or are we still disposed to think that he may have a true knowledge of the 
 various matters about which he disputes 
 
 theaet but how can he stranger is there any doubt 
 after what has been said that he is to be located in one of the divisions of play 
 
 str then we must place him in the class of magicians and mimics 
 
 theaet certainly we must 
 
 str and now our business is not to let the animal out for we 
 have got him in a sort of dialectical net and there is one thing 
 which he decidedly will not escape 
 
 theaet what is that 
 
 str the inference that he is a juggler 
 
 theaet precisely my own opinion of him 
 
 str then clearly we ought as soon as possible to divide the 
 art and go down into the net and if the sophist does 
 not run away from us to seize him according to orders and 
 deliver him over to reason who is the lord of the hunt and proclaim the capture of him and if he creeps into the recesses of the imitative 
 art and secretes himself in one of them to divide again and follow 
 him up until in some of imitation he is caught for our 
 method of tackling each and all is one which neither he nor any 
 other creature will ever escape in triumph 
 
 theaet well said and let us do as you propose 
 
 str well then pursuing the same analytic method as before i 
 think that i can discern two divisions of the imitative art but i 
 am not as yet able to see in which of them the desired form is to be 
 found 
 
 theaet will you tell me first what are two divisions of which you 
 are speaking 
 
 str one is the art of a likeness of 
 anything is made by producing a copy which is executed according to the proportions of the original similar in length and breadth and 
 depth each thing receiving also its appropriate colour 
 
 theaet is not this always the aim of imitation 
 
 str not always in works either of sculpture or of painting 
 which are of any magnitude there is a certain degree of deception 
 for artists were to give the true proportions of their fair works 
 the upper part which is farther off would appear to be out of 
 proportion in comparison with the lower which is nearer and so 
 they give up the truth in their images and make only the proportions 
 which appear to be beautiful disregarding the real ones 
 
 theaet quite true 
 
 str and that which being other is also like may we not 
 fairly call a likeness or image 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str and may we not as i did just now call that part of the 
 imitative art which is concerned with making such images the art of 
 likeness making 
 
 theaet let that be the name 
 
 str and what shall we call those resemblances of the beautiful 
 which appear such owing to the unfavourable position of the 
 spectator whereas if a person had the power of getting a correct view of works of such magnitude they would appear not even like that to which they profess to be like may we not call these appearances since they appear only and are not really like 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str there is a great deal of this kind of thing in 
 painting and in all imitation 
 
 theaet of course 
 
 str and may we not fairly call the sort of art which produces an 
 appearance and not an image phantastic art 
 
 theaet most fairly 
 
 str these then are the two kinds of image art of 
 making likenesses and phantastic or the art of making appearances 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str i was doubtful before in which of them i should place the 
 sophist nor am i even now able to see clearly verily he is a 
 wonderful and inscrutable creature and now in the cleverest 
 manner he has got into an impossible place 
 
 theaet yes he has 
 
 str do you speak advisedly or are you carried away at the moment 
 by the habit of assenting into giving a hasty answer 
 
 theaet may i ask to what you are referring 
 
 str my dear friend we are engaged in a very difficult 
 can be no doubt of that for how a thing can 
 appear and seem and not be or how a man can say a thing 
 which is not true has always been and still remains a very perplexing question can any one say or think that falsehood really exists and 
 avoid being caught in a contradiction indeed theaetetus the task is a difficult one 
 
 theaet why 
 
 str he who says that falsehood exists has the audacity to assert 
 the being of for this is implied in the possibility of 
 falsehood but my boy in the days when i was a boy the great 
 parmenides protested against this doctrine and to the end 
 of his life he continued to inculcate the same repeating both in verse and out of your mind from this way of enquiry for never will you show that is 
 such is his testimony which is confirmed by the very expression 
 when sifted a little would you object to begin with the 
 consideration of the words themselves 
 
 theaet never mind about me i am only desirous that you should 
 carry on the argument in the best way and that you should take me 
 with you 
 
 str very good and now say do we venture to utter the forbidden 
 word 
 
 theaet certainly we do 
 
 str let us be serious then and consider the question neither in 
 strife nor play suppose that one of the hearers of parmenides was 
 asked to is the term to be you know what 
 sort of object he would single out in reply and what answer he 
 would make to the enquirer 
 
 theaet that is a difficult question and one not to be answered 
 at all by a person like myself 
 
 str there is at any rate no difficulty in seeing that the 
 predicate is not applicable to any being 
 
 theaet none certainly 
 
 str and if not to being then not to something 
 
 theaet of course not 
 
 str it is also plain that in speaking of something we speak of 
 being for to speak of an abstract something naked and isolated from 
 all being is impossible 
 
 theaet impossible 
 
 str you mean by assenting to imply that he who says something 
 must say some one thing 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str some in the singular ti you would say is the sign of one 
 some in the dual tine of two some in the plural tines of many 
 
 theaet exactly 
 
 str then he who says not something must say absolutely nothing 
 theaet most assuredly 
 
 str and as we cannot admit that a man speaks and says nothing he 
 who says does not speak at all 
 
 theaet the difficulty of the argument can no further go 
 
 str not yet my friend is the time for such a word for there 
 still remains of all perplexities the first and greatest 
 touching the very foundation of the matter 
 
 theaet what do you mean do not be afraid to speak 
 
 str to that which is may be attributed some other thing which is 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str but can anything which is be attributed to that which is not 
 
 theaet impossible 
 
 str and all number is to be reckoned among things which are 
 
 theaet yes surely number if anything has a real existence 
 
 str then we must not attempt to attribute to number 
 either in the singular or plural 
 
 theaet the argument implies that we should be wrong in doing so 
 
 str but how can a man either express in words or even conceive in 
 thought things which are not or a thing which is not without number 
 
 theaet how indeed 
 
 str when we speak of things which are not attributing plurality 
 to 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str but on the other hand when we say what is not do we not 
 attribute unity 
 
 theaet manifestly 
 
 str nevertheless we maintain that you may not and ought not to 
 attribute being to 
 
 theaet most true 
 
 str do you see then that in itself can neither be 
 spoken uttered or thought but that it is unthinkable 
 unutterable unspeakable indescribable 
 
 theaet quite true 
 
 str but if so i was wrong in telling you just now that the 
 difficulty which was coming is the greatest of all 
 
 theaet what is there a greater still behind 
 
 str well i am surprised after what has been said already that 
 you do not see the difficulty in which he who would refute the 
 notion of is involved for he is compelled to contradict 
 himself as soon as he makes the attempt 
 
 theaet what do you mean speak more clearly 
 
 str do not expect clearness from me for i who maintain that 
 has no part either in the one or many just now 
 spoke and am still speaking of as one for i say do you understand 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str and a little while ago i said that is unutterable 
 unspeakable indescribable do you follow 
 
 theaet i do after a fashion 
 
 str when i introduced the word is did i not contradict what i 
 said before 
 
 theaet clearly 
 
 str and in using the singular verb did i not speak of 
 as one 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str and when i spoke of as indescribable and 
 unspeakable and unutterable in using each of these words in the 
 singular did i not refer to as one 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str and yet we say that strictly speaking it should not be 
 defined as one or many and should not even be called it for the 
 use of the word it would imply a form of unity 
 
 theaet quite true 
 
 str how then can any one put any faith in me for now 
 as always i am unequal to the refutation of and therefore as i was saying do not look to me for the right way of speaking about but come let us try the experiment with you 
 
 theaet what do you mean 
 
 str make a noble effort as becomes youth and endeavour with all 
 your might to speak of in a right manner without 
 introducing into it either existence or unity or plurality 
 
 theaet it would be a strange boldness in me which would 
 attempt the task when i see you thus discomfited 
 
 str say no more of ourselves but until we find some one or other 
 who can speak of without number we must acknowledge that the sophist is a clever rogue who will not be got out of his hole 
 
 theaet most true 
 
 str and if we say to him that he professes an art of making 
 appearances he will grapple with us and retort our argument upon 
 ourselves and when we call him an he will say 
 pray what do you mean at all by an image and i should like to know theaetetus how we can possibly answer the question 
 
 theaet we shall doubtless tell him of the images which are 
 reflected in water or in mirrors also of sculptures pictures and 
 other duplicates 
 
 str i see theaetetus that you have never made the 
 acquaintance of the sophist 
 
 theaet why do you think so 
 
 str he will make believe to have his eyes shut or to have none 
 
 theaet what do you mean 
 
 str when you tell him of something existing in a mirror or in 
 sculpture and address him as though he had eyes he will 
 laugh you to scorn and will pretend that he knows nothing of mirrors and streams or of sight at all he will say that he is asking about an 
 idea 
 
 theaet what can he mean 
 
 str the common notion pervading all these objects which you 
 speak of as many and yet call by the single name of image as 
 though it were the unity under which they were all included how 
 will you maintain your ground against him 
 
 theaet how stranger can i describe an image except as something 
 fashioned in the likeness of the true 
 
 str and do you mean this something to be some other true thing 
 or what do you mean 
 
 theaet certainly not another true thing but only a resemblance 
 
 str and you mean by true that which really is 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str and the not true is that which is the opposite of the true 
 
 theaet exactly 
 
 str a resemblance then is not really real if as you say not 
 true 
 
 theaet nay but it is in a certain sense 
 
 str you mean to say not in a true sense 
 
 theaet yes it is in reality only an image 
 
 str then what we call an image is in reality really unreal 
 
 theaet in what a strange complication of being and 
 we are involved 
 
 str strange i should think so see how by his reciprocation of 
 opposites the sophist has compelled us quite 
 against our will to admit the existence of 
 
 theaet yes indeed i see 
 
 str the difficulty is how to define his art without falling into 
 a contradiction 
 
 theaet how do you mean and where does the danger lie 
 
 str when we say that he deceives us with an illusion and that 
 his art is illusory do we mean that our soul is led by his art to 
 think falsely or what do we mean 
 
 theaet there is nothing else to be said 
 
 str again false opinion is that form of opinion which thinks the 
 opposite of the would assent 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str you mean to say that false opinion thinks what is not 
 
 theaet of course 
 
 str does false opinion think that things which are not are not 
 or that in a certain sense they are 
 
 theaet things that are not must be imagined to exist in a certain 
 sense if any degree of falsehood is to be possible 
 
 str and does not false opinion also think that things which most 
 certainly exist do not exist at all 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str and here again is falsehood 
 
 theaet 
 
 str and in like manner a false proposition will be deemed to be 
 one which are the nonexistence of things which are and the 
 existence of things which are not 
 
 theaet there is no other way in which a false proposition can 
 arise 
 
 str there is not but the sophist will deny these statements and 
 indeed how can any rational man assent to them when the very 
 expressions which we have just used were before acknowledged by us to be unutterable unspeakable indescribable unthinkable 
 do you see his point theaetetus 
 
 theaet of course he will say that we are contradicting ourselves 
 when we hazard the assertion that falsehood exists in opinion and 
 in words for in maintaining this we are compelled over and over 
 again to assert being of which we admitted just now to be 
 an utter impossibility 
 
 str how well you remember and now it is high time to hold a 
 consultation as to what we ought to do about the sophist for if we 
 persist in looking for him in the class of false workers and 
 magicians you see that the handles for objection and the 
 difficulties which will arise are very numerous and obvious 
 
 theaet they are indeed 
 
 str we have gone through but a very small portion of 
 them and they are really infinite 
 
 theaet if that is the case we cannot possibly catch the sophist 
 
 str shall we then be so as to give him up 
 
 theaet certainly not i should say if we can get the slightest 
 hold upon him 
 
 str will you then forgive me and as your words imply not be 
 altogether displeased if i flinch a little from the grasp of such a 
 sturdy argument 
 
 theaet to be sure i will 
 
 str i have a yet more urgent request to make 
 
 theaet which is 
 
 str that you will promise not to regard me as a parricide 
 
 theaet and why 
 
 str because in i must test the philosophy of my 
 father parmenides and try to prove by main force that in a certain 
 sense is and that being on the other hand is not 
 
 theaet some attempt of the kind is clearly needed 
 
 str yes a blind man as they say might see that and unless 
 these questions are decided in one way or another no one when he 
 speaks false words or false opinion or idols or images or 
 imitations or appearances or about the arts which are concerned 
 with them can avoid falling into ridiculous contradictions 
 
 theaet most true 
 
 str and therefore i must venture to lay hands on my 
 argument for if i am to be i shall have to give 
 the matter up 
 
 theaet nothing in the world should ever induce us to do so 
 
 str i have a third little request which i wish to make 
 
 theaet what is it 
 
 str you heard have always felt and still 
 i have no heart for this argument 
 
 theaet i did 
 
 str i tremble at the thought of what i have said and expect that 
 you will deem me mad when you hear of my sudden changes and 
 shiftings let me therefore observe that i am examining the 
 question entirely out of regard for you 
 
 theaet there is no reason for you to fear that i shall impute any 
 impropriety to you if you attempt this refutation and proof take 
 heart therefore and proceed 
 
 str and where shall i begin the perilous enterprise i think that 
 the road which i must take is 
 
 theaet me hear 
 
 str i think that we had better first of all consider the points 
 which at present are regard as lest we may have fallen 
 into some confusion and be too ready to assent to one another 
 fancying that we are quite clear about them 
 theaet say more distinctly what you mean 
 
 str i think that parmenides and all ever yet undertook to 
 determine the number and nature of existences talked to us in 
 rather a light and easy strain 
 
 theaet how 
 
 str as if we had been children to whom they repeated each his 
 own mythus or said that there were three principles and 
 that at one time there was war between certain of them and 
 then again there was peace and they were married and begat children 
 and brought them up and another spoke of two moist and a dry or a hot and a cold and made them marry and cohabit the eleatics however in our part of the world say that things are many in name but in nature one this is their mythus which goes back to xenophanes and is even older then there are ionian and in more 
 recent times sicilian muses who have arrived at the conclusion that 
 to unite the two principles is safer and to say that being is one and 
 many and that these are held together by enmity and friendship 
 ever parting ever meeting as muses assert while the 
 gentler ones do not insist on the perpetual strife and peace but 
 admit a relaxation and alternation of them peace and unity sometimes prevailing under the sway of aphrodite and then again plurality and war by reason of a principle of strife whether any of them spoke the truth in all this is hard to determine besides antiquity and famous men should have reverence and not be liable to accusations so serious yet one thing may be said of them without offence 
 
 theaet what thing 
 
 str that they went on their several ways disdaining to notice 
 people like ourselves they did not care whether they took us with 
 them or left us behind them 
 
 theaet how do you mean 
 
 str i mean to say that when they talk of one two or more 
 elements which are or have become or are becoming or again of heat 
 mingling with cold assuming in some other part of their works 
 separations and me theaetetus do you understand 
 what they mean by these expressions when i was a younger man i 
 used to fancy that i understood quite well what was meant by the 
 term which is our present subject of dispute 
 and now you see in what a fix we are about it 
 
 theaet i see 
 
 str and very likely we have been getting into the same perplexity 
 about being and yet may fancy that when anybody utters 
 the word we understand him quite easily although we do not know about but we may be equally ignorant of both 
 
 theaet i dare say 
 
 str and the same may be said of all the terms just mentioned 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str the consideration of most of them may be deferred but we had 
 better now discuss the chief captain and leader of them 
 
 theaet of what are you speaking you clearly think that we must 
 first investigate what people mean by the word being 
 
 str you follow close at heels theaetetus for the right method 
 i conceive will be to call into our presence the dualistic 
 philosophers and to interrogate them come we will say ye who 
 affirm that hot and cold or any other two principles are the 
 universe 
 what is this term which you apply to both of them and what do you 
 mean when you say that both and each of them are how are we to 
 understand the word are upon your view are we to suppose that 
 there is a third principle over and above the other in 
 all and not two for clearly you cannot say that one of the two 
 principles is being and yet attribute being equally to both of 
 them for if you did whichever of the two is identified with 
 being will comprehend the other and so they will be one and not 
 two 
 
 theaet very true

 book 
 str but perhaps you mean to give the name of being to both of 
 them together 
 
 theaet quite likely 
 
 str then friends we shall reply to them the answer 
 is plainly that the two will still be resolved into one 
 
 theaet most true 
 
 str since then we are in a difficulty please to tell 
 us what you mean when you speak of being for there can be no doubt that you always from the first understood your own meaning whereas we once thought that we understood you but now we are in a great strait please to begin by explaining this matter to us and let us no longer fancy that we understand you when we entirely misunderstand you there will be no impropriety in our demanding an answer to this question either of the dualists or of the pluralists 
 
 theaet certainly not 
 
 str and what about the assertors of the oneness of the 
 we not endeavour to ascertain from them what they mean by being 
 
 theaet by all means 
 
 str then let them answer this question one you say alone is 
 yes they will reply 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str and there is something which you call being 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str and is being the same as one and do you apply two 
 names to the same thing 
 
 theaet what will be their answer stranger 
 
 str it is clear theaetetus that he who asserts the 
 unity of being will find a difficulty in answering this or any other question 
 
 theaet why so 
 
 str to admit of two names and to affirm that there is nothing 
 but unity is surely ridiculous 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str and equally irrational to admit that a name is anything 
 
 theaet how so 
 
 str to distinguish the name from the thing implies duality 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str and yet he who identifies the name with the thing will be 
 compelled to say that it is the name of nothing or if he 
 says that it is the name of something even then the name will only be the name of a name and of nothing else 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str and the one will turn out to be only one of one and being 
 absolute unity will represent a mere name 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str and would they say that the whole is other than the one that 
 is or the same with it 
 
 theaet to be sure they would and they actually say so 
 
 str if being is a whole as parmenides sings 
 every way like unto the fullness of a sphere 
 evenly balanced from the centre on every side 
 and must needs be neither greater nor less in any way 
 neither on this side nor on that 
 then being has a centre and extremes and having these must also 
 have parts 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str yet that which has parts may have the attribute of 
 unity in all the parts and in this way being all and a whole may be one 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str but that of which this is the condition cannot be absolute 
 unity 
 
 theaet why not 
 
 str because according to right reason that which is truly one 
 must be affirmed to be absolutely indivisible 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str but this indivisible if made up of many parts will 
 contradict reason 
 
 theaet i understand 
 
 str shall we say that being is one and a whole because it has 
 the attribute of unity or shall we say that being is not a whole at 
 all 
 
 theaet that is a hard alternative to offer 
 
 str most true for being having in a certain sense the attribute 
 of one is yet proved not to be the same as one and the all is 
 therefore more than one 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str and yet if being be not a whole through having the attribute 
 of unity and there be such a thing as an absolute whole being 
 lacks something of its own nature 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str upon this view again being having a defect of being will 
 become 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str and again the all becomes more than one for being and the 
 whole will each have their separate nature 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str but if the whole does not exist at all all the previous 
 difficulties remain the same and there will be the further 
 difficulty that besides having no being being can never have come 
 into being 
 
 theaet why so 
 
 str because that which comes into being always comes into being 
 as a whole so that he who does not give whole a place among beings cannot speak either of essence or generation as existing 
 
 theaet yes that certainly appears to be true 
 
 str again how can that which is not a whole have any 
 quantity for that which is of a certain quantity must necessarily be the whole of that quantity 
 
 theaet exactly 
 
 str and there will be innumerable other points each of them 
 causing infinite trouble to him who says that being is either one 
 or two 
 
 theaet the difficulties which are dawning upon us prove this for 
 one objection connects with another and they are always involving 
 what has preceded in a greater and worse perplexity 
 
 str we are far from having exhausted the more exact thinkers who 
 treat of being and but let us be content to leave 
 them and proceed to view those who speak less precisely and we shall find as the result of all that the nature of being is quite as difficult to comprehend as that of 
 
 theaet then now we will go to the others 
 
 str there appears to be a sort of war of giants and gods going on 
 amongst them they are fighting with one another about the nature of 
 essence 
 
 theaet how is that 
 
 str some of them are dragging down all things from heaven and 
 from the unseen to earth and they literally grasp in their hands 
 rocks and oaks of these they lay hold and obstinately 
 maintain that the things only which can be touched or handled have being or essence because they define being and body as one and if any one else says that what is not a body exists they altogether despise him and will hear of nothing but body 
 
 theaet i have often met with such men and terrible fellows they 
 are 
 
 str and that is the reason why their opponents cautiously defend 
 themselves from above out of an unseen world mightily contending 
 that true essence consists of certain intelligible and incorporeal 
 ideas the bodies of the materialists which by them are 
 maintained to be the very truth they break up into little bits by their 
 arguments and affirm them to be not essence but generation and 
 motion between the two armies theaetetus there is always 
 an endless conflict raging concerning these matters 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str let us ask each party in turn to give an account of 
 that which they call essence 
 
 theaet how shall we get it out of them 
 
 str with those who make being to consist in ideas there will be 
 less difficulty for they are civil people enough but there will be 
 very great difficulty or rather an absolute impossibility 
 in getting an opinion out of those who drag everything down to matter shall i tell you what we must do 
 
 theaet what 
 
 str let us if we can really improve them but if this is not 
 possible let us imagine them to be better than they are and more 
 willing to answer in accordance with the rules of argument and then 
 their opinion will be more worth having for that which better men 
 acknowledge has more weight than that which is acknowledged by 
 inferior men moreover we are no respecters of persons but seekers 
 after time 
 
 theaet very good 
 
 str then now on the supposition that they are improved 
 let us ask them to state their views and do you interpret them 
 
 theaet agreed 
 
 str let them say whether they would admit that there is such a 
 thing as a mortal animal 
 
 theaet of course they would 
 
 str and do they not acknowledge this to be a body having a soul 
 
 theaet certainly they do 
 
 str meaning to say the soul is something which exists 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str and do they not say that one soul is just and another 
 unjust and that one soul is wise and another foolish 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str and that the just and wise soul becomes just and wise by the 
 possession of justice and wisdom and the opposite under opposite 
 circumstances 
 
 theaet yes they do 
 
 str but surely that which may be present or may be absent will be 
 admitted by them to exist 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str and allowing that justice wisdom the other virtues and 
 their opposites exist as well as a soul in which they inhere do they 
 affirm any of them to be visible and tangible or are they all 
 invisible 
 
 theaet they would say that hardly any of them are visible 
 
 str and would they say that they are corporeal 
 
 theaet they would distinguish the soul would be said by them to 
 have a body but as to the other qualities of justice 
 wisdom and the like about which you asked they would not venture either to deny their existence or to maintain that they were all corporeal 
 
 str verily theaetetus i perceive a great improvement in 
 them the real aborigines children of the teeth would have been deterred by no shame at all but would have obstinately asserted 
 that nothing is which they are not able to squeeze in their hands 
 
 theaet that is pretty much their notion 
 
 str let us push the question for if they will admit that 
 any even the smallest particle of being is incorporeal it is enough they must then say what that nature is which is common to both the 
 corporeal and incorporeal and which they have in their eye 
 when they say of both of them that they are perhaps they may be 
 in a difficulty and if this is the case there is a possibility 
 that they may accept a notion of ours respecting the nature of 
 being having nothing of their own to offer 
 
 theaet what is the notion tell me and we shall soon see 
 str my notion would be that anything which possesses any sort of 
 power to affect another or to be affected by another if only for a 
 single moment however trifling the cause and however slight the 
 effect has real existence and i hold that the definition 
 of being is simply power of theaet they accept your suggestion having nothing better of their own to offer 
 
 str very good perhaps we as well as they may one day change 
 our minds but for the present this may be regarded as the 
 understanding which is established with them 
 
 theaet agreed 
 
 str let us now go to the friends of ideas of their opinions 
 too you shall be the interpreter 
 
 theaet i will 
 
 str to them we would distinguish essence from generation 
 
 theaet yes they reply 
 
 str and you would allow that we participate in 
 generation with the body and through perception but we participate with the soul through in true essence and essence you would affirm to be always the same and immutable whereas generation or becoming varies 
 
 theaet yes that is what we should affirm 
 
 str well fair sirs we say to them what is this participation 
 which you assert of both do you agree with our recent definition 
 
 theaet what definition 
 
 str we said that being was an active or passive energy 
 arising out of a certain power which proceeds from elements meeting with one another perhaps your cars theaetetus may fail to catch their answer which i recognize because i have been accustomed to hear it 
 
 theaet and what is their answer 
 
 str they deny the truth of what we were just now saying to the 
 aborigines about existence 
 
 theaet what was that 
 
 str any power of doing or suffering in a degree however slight 
 was held by us to be a sufficient definition of being 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str they deny this and say that the power of doing or 
 suffering is confined to becoming and that neither power is applicable to being 
 
 theaet and is there not some truth in what they say 
 
 str yes but our reply will be that we want to ascertain from 
 them more distinctly whether they further admit that the soul 
 knows and that being or essence is known 
 
 theaet there can be no doubt that they say so 
 
 str and is knowing and being known doing or suffering 
 or both or is the one doing and the other suffering or has neither any share in either 
 
 theaet clearly neither has any share in either for if they say 
 anything else they will contradict themselves 
 
 str i understand but they will allow that if to know is active 
 then of course to be known is passive and on this view 
 being in so far as it is known is acted upon by knowledge and is therefore in motion for that which is in a state of rest cannot be acted upon as we affirm 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str and o heavens can we ever be made to believe that motion 
 and life and soul and mind are not present with perfect being can 
 we imagine that being is devoid of life and mind and 
 exists in awful unmeaningness an everlasting fixture 
 
 theaet that would be a dreadful thing to admit stranger 
 
 str but shall we say that has mind and not life 
 
 theaet how is that possible 
 
 str or shall we say that both inhere in perfect being but that 
 it has no soul which contains them 
 
 theaet and in what other way can it contain them 
 
 str or that being has mind and life and soul but although 
 endowed with soul remains absolutely unmoved 
 
 theaet all three suppositions appear to me to be irrational 
 
 str under being then we must include motion and that which is 
 moved 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str then theaetetus our inference is that if there is 
 no motion neither is there any mind anywhere or about anything or belonging to any one 
 
 theaet quite true 
 
 str and yet this equally follows if we grant that all things are 
 in this view too mind has no existence 
 
 theaet how so 
 
 str do you think that sameness of condition and mode and subject 
 could ever exist without a principle of rest 
 
 theaet certainly not 
 
 str can you see how without them mind could exist or come into 
 existence anywhere 
 
 theaet no 
 
 str and surely contend we must in every possible way against him 
 who would annihilate knowledge and reason and mind and yet ventures to speak confidently about anything 
 
 theaet yes with all our might 
 
 str then the philosopher who has the truest reverence for these 
 qualities cannot possibly accept the notion of those who 
 say that the whole is at rest either as unity or in many forms and he will be utterly deaf to those who assert universal motion as children say entreatingly give us both so he will include both the moveable 
 and immoveable in his definition of being and all 
 
 theaet most true 
 
 str and now do we seem to have gained a fair notion of being 
 
 theaet yes truly 
 
 str alas theaetetus methinks that we are now only beginning to 
 see the real difficulty of the enquiry into the nature of it 
 
 theaet what do you mean 
 
 str o my friend do you not see that nothing can exceed out 
 ignorance and yet we fancy that we are saying something good 
 
 theaet i certainly thought that we were and i do not at all 
 understand how we never found out our desperate case 
 
 str reflect after having made these admissions may we not be 
 justly asked the same questions which we ourselves were asking of 
 those who said that all was hot and cold 
 
 theaet what were they will you recall them to my mind 
 
 str to be sure i will remind you of them by putting the same 
 questions to you which i did to them and then we shall get on 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str would you not say that rest and motion are in the most entire 
 opposition to one another 
 
 theaet of course 
 
 str and yet you would say that both and either of them 
 equally are 
 
 theaet i should 
 
 str and when you admit that both or either of them are 
 do you mean to say that both or either of them are in motion 
 
 theaet certainly not 
 
 str or do you wish to imply that they are both at rest when you 
 say that they are 
 
 theaet of course not 
 
 str then you conceive of being as some third and distinct nature 
 under which rest and motion are alike included and observing that 
 they both participate in being you declare that they are 
 
 theaet truly we seem to have an intimation that being is 
 some third thing when we say that rest and motion are 
 
 str then being is not the combination of rest and motion but 
 something different from them 
 
 theaet so it would appear 
 
 str being then according to its own nature is neither in 
 motion nor at rest 
 
 theaet that is very much the truth 
 
 str where then is a man to look for help who would have 
 any clear or fixed notion of being in his mind 
 
 theaet where indeed 
 
 str i scarcely think that he can look anywhere for that which is 
 not in motion must be at rest and again that which is not at rest 
 must be in motion but being is placed outside of both these 
 classes is this possible 
 
 theaet utterly impossible 
 
 str here then is another thing which we ought to bear in mind 
 
 theaet what 
 
 str when we were asked to what we were to assign the 
 appellation of we were in the greatest you remember 
 
 theaet to be sure 
 
 str and are we not now in as a difficulty about being 
 
 theaes i should say stranger that we are in one which is if 
 possible even greater 
 
 str then let us acknowledge the difficulty and as being and 
 are involved in the same perplexity there is hope 
 that when the one appears more or less distinctly the other will equally appear and if we are able to see neither there may still be a 
 chance of steering our way in between them without any great 
 discredit 
 theaet very good 
 
 str let us enquire then how we come to predicate many names of 
 the same thing 
 
 theaet give an example 
 
 str i mean that we speak of man for example under many 
 we attribute to him colours and forms and magnitudes and virtues and vices in all of which instances and in ten thousand others we not only speak of him as a man but also as good and having other attributes and in the same way anything else which we originally supposed to be one is described by us as many and under many names 
 
 theaet that is true 
 
 str and thus we provide a rich feast for tyros whether young or 
 old for there is nothing easier than to argue that the one cannot 
 be many or the many one and great is their delight in 
 denying that a man is good for man they insist is man and good is good i dare say that you have met with persons who interest in such are often elderly men whose meagre sense is thrown into amazement by these discoveries of theirs which they believe to be the height of wisdom 
 
 theaet certainly i have 
 
 str then not to exclude any one who has ever speculated at all 
 upon the nature of being let us put our questions to them as well 
 as to our former friends 
 
 theaet what questions 
 
 str shall we refuse to attribute being to motion and rest or 
 anything to anything and assume that they do not mingle and are 
 incapable of participating in one another or shall we 
 gather all into one class of things communicable with one another or are some things communicable and others of these alternatives 
 
 theaetetus will they prefer 
 
 theaet i have nothing to answer on their behalf suppose that you 
 take all these hypotheses in turn and see what are the consequences 
 which follow from each of them 
 
 str very good and first let us assume them to say that nothing 
 is capable of participating in anything else in any respect in that 
 case rest and motion cannot participate in being at all 
 
 theaet they cannot 
 
 str but would either of them be if not participating in being 
 
 theaet no 
 
 str then by this admission everything is instantly overturned as 
 well the doctrine of universal motion as of universal rest and also 
 the doctrine of those who distribute being into immutable and 
 everlasting kinds for all these add on a notion of being some 
 affirming that things are truly in motion and others that they 
 are truly at rest 
 
 theaes just so 
 
 str again those who would at one time compound and at another 
 resolve all things whether making them into one and out of one 
 creating infinity or dividing them into finite clements and 
 forming compounds out of these whether they suppose the processes of creation to be successive or continuous would be talking nonsense in all this if there were no admixture 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str most ridiculous of all will the men themselves be who want to 
 carry out the argument and yet forbid us to call anything because 
 participating in some affection from another by the name of that 
 other 
 
 theaet why so 
 
 str why because they are compelled to use the words to be 
 apart from others in itself and ten thousand more which 
 they cannot give up but must make the connecting links of 
 discourse and therefore they do not require to be refuted by 
 others but their enemy as the saying is inhabits the same house 
 with them they are always carrying about with them an 
 adversary like the wonderful ventriloquist eurycles who out of their own bellies audibly contradicts them 
 
 theaet precisely so a very true and exact illustration 
 
 str and now if we suppose that all things have the power of 
 communion with one another what will follow 
 
 theaet even i can solve that riddle 
 
 str how 
 
 theaet why because motion itself would be at rest and rest 
 again in motion if they could be attributed to one another 
 
 str but this is utterly impossible 
 
 theaet of course 
 
 str then only the third hypothesis remains 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str for surely either all things have communion with all or 
 nothing with any other thing or some things communicate with some 
 things and others not 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str and two out of these three suppositions have been found to be 
 impossible 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str every one then who desires to answer truly will adopt the 
 third and remaining hypothesis of the communion of some with some 
 
 theaet quite true 
 
 str this communion of some with some may be illustrated 
 by the caseof letters for some letters do not fit each other while others do 
 
 theaet of course 
 
 str and the vowels especially are a sort of bond which pervades 
 all the other letters so that without a vowel one consonant 
 cannot be joined to another 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str but does every one know what letters will unite with what or 
 is art required in order to do so 
 
 theaet what is required 
 
 str what art 
 
 theaet the art of grammar 
 
 str and is not this also true of sounds high and 
 not he who has the art to know what sounds mingle a musician and he who is ignorant not a musician 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str and we shall find this to be generally true of art or the 
 absence of art 
 
 theaet of course 
 
 str and as classes are admitted by us in like manner to be some 
 of them capable and others incapable of intermixture must not he 
 who would rightly show what kinds will unite and what will not 
 proceed by the help of science in the path of argument and will he 
 not ask if the connecting links are universal and so capable of 
 intermixture with all things and again in divisions whether there 
 are not other universal classes which make them possible 
 
 theaet to be sure he will require science and if i am not 
 mistaken the very greatest of all sciences 
 
 str how are we to call it by zeus have we not lighted 
 unwittingly upon our free and noble science and in looking for the sophist have we not entertained the philosopher unawares 
 
 theaet what do you mean 
 
 str should we not say that the division according to 
 classes which neither makes the same other nor makes other the same is the business of the dialectical science 
 
 theaet that is what we should say 
 
 str then surely he who can divide rightly is able to see 
 clearly one form pervading a scattered multitude and many different 
 forms contained under one higher form and again one form knit 
 together into a single whole and pervading many such wholes and 
 many forms existing only in separation and isolation this is the 
 knowledge of classes which determines where they can have communion with one another and where not 
 
 theaet quite true 
 
 str and the art of dialectic would be attributed by you 
 only to the philosopher pure and true 
 
 theaet who but he can be worthy 
 
 str in this region we shall always discover the philosopher if 
 we look for him like the sophist he is not easily discovered but 
 for a different reason 
 
 theaet for what reason 
 
 str because the sophist runs away into the darkness of 
 in which he has learned by habit to feel about and cannot be 
 discovered because of the darkness of the place is not that true 
 
 theaet it seems to be so 
 
 str and the philosopher always holding converse through reason 
 with the idea of being is also dark from excess of light for the 
 souls of the many have no eye which can endure the vision of the 
 divine 
 
 theaet yes that seems to be quite as true as the other 
 
 str well the philosopher may hereafter be more fully 
 considered by us if we are disposed but the sophist must clearly not be allowed to escape until we have had a good look at him 
 
 theaet very good 
 
 str since then we are agreed that some classes have a communion 
 with one another and others not and some have communion with a few and others with many and that there is no reason why some should not have universal communion with all let us now pursue the 
 enquiry as the argument suggests not in relation to all ideas 
 lest the multitude of them should confuse us but let us select a 
 few of those which are reckoned to be the principal ones 
 and consider their several natures and their capacity of communion with one another in order that if we are not able to apprehend with perfect clearness the notions of being and we may at 
 least not fall short in the consideration of them so far as they come within the scope of the present enquiry if peradventure we may be allowed to assert the reality of and yet escape unscathed 
 
 theaet we must do so 
 
 str the most important of all the genera are those which we were 
 just now and rest and motion 
 
 theaet yes by far 
 
 str and two of these are as we affirm incapable of 
 communion with one another 
 
 theaet quite incapable 
 
 str whereas being surely has communion with both of them for 
 both of them are 
 
 theaet of course 
 
 str that makes up three of them 
 
 theaet to be sure 
 
 str and each of them is other than the remaining two but the 
 same with itself 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str but then what is the meaning of these two words same and 
 other are they two new kinds other than the three and yet always 
 of necessity intermingling with them and are we to have five kinds 
 instead of three or when we speak of the same and other are we 
 unconsciously speaking of one of the three first kinds 
 
 theaet very likely we are 
 
 str but surely motion and rest are neither the other nor the 
 same 
 
 theaet how is that 
 
 str whatever we attribute to motion and rest in common cannot be 
 either of them 
 
 theaet why not 
 
 str because motion would be at rest and rest in motion for 
 either of them being predicated of both will compel the other to 
 change into the opposite of its own nature because partaking of its 
 opposite 
 
 theaet quite true 
 
 str yet they surely both partake of the same and of the other 
 theaet yes 
 
 str then we must not assert that motion any more than rest is 
 either the same or the other 
 
 theaet no we must not 
 
 str but are we to conceive that being and the same are identical 
 
 theaet possibly 
 
 str but if they are identical then again in saying that 
 motion and rest have being we should also be saying that they are the same 
 
 theaet which surely cannot be 
 
 str then being and same cannot be one 
 
 theaet scarcely 
 
 str then we may suppose the same to be a fourth class 
 which is now to be added to the three others 
 
 theaet quite true 
 
 str and shall we call the other a fifth class or should we 
 consider being and other to be two names of the same class 
 
 theaet very likely 
 
 str but you would agree if i am not mistaken that existences 
 are relative as well as absolute 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str and the other is always relative to other 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str but this would not be the case unless being and the other 
 entirely differed for if the other like being were absolute as 
 well as relative then there would have been a kind of other 
 which was not other than other and now we find that what is other must of necessity be what it is in relation to some other 
 
 theaet that is the true state of the case 
 
 str then we must admit the other as the fifth of our selected 
 classes 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str and the fifth class pervades all classes for they all differ 
 from one another not by reason of their own nature but because 
 they partake of the idea of the other 
 
 theaet quite true 
 
 str then let us now put the case with reference to each of the 
 five 
 
 theaet how 
 
 str first there is motion which we affirm to be 
 absolutely rest what else can we say 
 
 theaet it is so 
 
 str and therefore is not rest 
 
 theaet certainly not 
 
 str and yet is because partaking of being 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str again motion is other than the same 
 
 theaet just so 
 
 str and is therefore not the same 
 
 theaet it is not 
 
 str yet surely motion is the same because all things partake 
 of the same 
 
 theaet very true 
 
 str then we must admit and not object to say that motion is the 
 same and is not the same for we do not apply the terms same and 
 not the same in the same sense but we call it the same in 
 relation to itself because partaking of the same and not the same 
 because having communion with the other it is thereby severed from 
 the same and has become not that but other and is therefore 
 rightly spoken of as not the same 
 
 theaet to be sure 
 
 str and if absolute motion in any point of view partook of rest 
 there would be no absurdity in calling motion stationary 
 
 theaet quite right that is on the supposition that some 
 classes mingle with one another and others not 
 
 str that such a communion of kinds is according to nature we had 
 already proved before we arrived at this part of our discussion 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str let us proceed then we not say that motion is other than 
 the other having been also proved by us to be other than 
 the same and other than rest 
 
 theaet that is certain 
 
 str then according to this view motion is other and also not 
 other 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str what is the next step shall we say that motion is other than 
 the three and not other than the we agreed that there are 
 five classes about and in the sphere of which we proposed to make 
 enquiry 
 
 theaet surely we cannot admit that the number is less than it 
 appeared to be just now 
 
 str then we may without fear contend that motion is other than 
 being 
 
 theaet without the least fear 
 
 str the plain result is that motion since it partakes of being 
 really is and also is not 
 
 theaet nothing can be plainer 
 
 str then necessarily exists in the case of motion and 
 of every class for the nature of the other entering into them all 
 makes each of them other than being and so and 
 therefore of all of them in like manner we may truly say that they 
 are again inasmuch as they partake of being that they are 
 and are existent 
 
 theaet so we may assume 
 
 str every class then has plurality of being and infinity of 
 
 
 theaet so we must infer 
 
 str and being itself may be said to be other than the other kinds 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str then we may infer that being is not in respect of as many 
 other things as there are for these it is itself one and 
 is not the other things which are infinite in number 
 
 theaet that is not far from the truth 
 
 str and we must not quarrel with this result since it is of the 
 nature of classes to have communion with one another and if any one 
 denies our present statement viz that being is not etc let 
 him first argue with our former conclusion respecting the 
 communion of ideas and then he may proceed to argue with what 
 follows 
 
 theaet nothing can be fairer 
 
 str let me ask you to consider a further question 
 
 theaet what question 
 
 str when we speak of we speak i suppose not of 
 something opposed to being but only different 
 
 theaet what do you mean 
 
 str when we speak of something as not great does the expression 
 seem to you to imply what is little any more than what is equal 
 
 theaet certainly not 
 
 str the negative particles ou and me when prefixed to words do 
 not imply opposition but only difference from the words or more 
 correctly from the things represented by the words which 
 follow them 
 
 theaet quite true 
 
 str there is another point to be considered if you do not object 
 
 theaet what is it 
 
 str the nature of the other appears to me to be divided into 
 fractions like knowledge 
 
 theaet how so 
 
 str knowledge like the other is one and yet the 
 various parts of knowledge have each of them their own particular name and hence there are many arts and kinds of knowledge 
 
 theaet quite true 
 
 str and is not the case the same with the parts of the 
 other which is also one 
 
 theaet very likely but will you tell me how 
 
 str there is some part of the other which is opposed to the 
 beautiful 
 
 theaet there is 
 
 str shall we say that this has or has not a name 
 
 theaet it has for whatever we call not beautiful is 
 other than the beautiful not than something else 
 
 str and now tell me another thing 
 
 theaet what 
 
 str is the anything but existence parted 
 off from a certain kind of existence and again from another point 
 of view opposed to an existing something 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str then the turns out to be the opposition of 
 being to being 
 
 theaet very true 
 
 str but upon this view is the beautiful a more real and the 
 a less real existence 
 
 theaet not at all 
 
 str and the may be said to exist equally with 
 the great 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str and in the same way the just must be placed in the same 
 category with the the one cannot be said to have any more 
 existence than the other 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str the same may be said of other things seeing that the 
 nature of the other has a real existence the parts of this nature must 
 equally be supposed to exist 
 
 theaet of course 
 
 str then as would appear the opposition of a part of the other 
 and of a part of being to one another is if i may venture to say 
 so as truly essence as being itself and implies not the opposite 
 of being but only what is other than being 
 
 theaet beyond question 
 
 str what then shall we call it 
 
 theaet clearly and this is the very nature for which 
 the sophist compelled us to search 
 
 str and has not this as you were saying as real an existence as 
 any other class may i not say with confidence that has an 
 assured existence and a nature of its own just as the great was 
 found to be great and the beautiful beautiful and the 
 and the in the same manner 
 has been found to be and is and is to 
 be reckoned one among the many classes of being do you theaetetus still feel any doubt of this 
 
 theaet none whatever 
 
 str do you observe that our scepticism has carried us beyond the 
 range of parmenides prohibition 
 
 theaet in what 
 
 str we have advanced to a further point and shown him 
 more than he for bad us to investigate 
 
 theaet how is that 
 
 str why because he never is and do thou keep thy thoughts from this way of enquiry 
 theaet yes he says so 
 
 str whereas we have not only proved that things which 
 are not are but we have shown what form of being is for we have shown that the nature of the other is and is distributed over all things in their relations to one another and whatever part of the other is contrasted with being this is precisely what we have 
 ventured to call 
 
 theaet and surely stranger we were quite right 
 
 str let not any one say then that while affirming the 
 opposition of to being we still assert the being of 
 for as to whether there is an opposite of being to that 
 enquiry we have long said may or may not be and may or may not be capable of definition but as touching our present 
 account of let a man either convince us of error or so 
 long as he cannot he too must say as we are saying that there is 
 a communion of classes and that being and difference or other 
 traverse all things and mutually interpenetrate so that the other 
 partakes of being and by reason of this participation is and yet 
 is not that of which it partakes but other and being other than 
 being it is clearly a necessity that should be again 
 being through partaking of the other becomes a class other than 
 the remaining classes and being other than all of them is not each 
 one of them and is not all the rest so that undoubtedly there are 
 thousands upon thousands of cases in which being is not and 
 all other things whether regarded individually or collectively in many 
 respects are and in many respects are not 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str and he who is sceptical of this contradiction must think how 
 he can find something better to say or if he sees a puzzle and 
 his pleasure is to drag words this way and that the argument will 
 prove to him that he is not making a worthy use of his 
 faculties for there is no charm in such puzzles and there is no difficulty in detecting them but we can tell him of something else the pursuit of which is noble and also difficult 
 
 theaet what is it 
 
 str a thing of which i have already alone these 
 puzzles as involving no difficulty he should be able to follow and 
 criticize in detail every argument and when a man says that the 
 same is in a manner other or that other is the same to understand 
 and refute him from his own point of view and in the same respect 
 in which he asserts either of these affections but to show that 
 somehow and in some sense the same is other or the other 
 same or the great small or the like unlike and to delight in always bringing forward such contradictions is no real refutation but is 
 clearly the babe of some one who is only beginning to approach the problem of being 
 
 theaet to be sure 
 
 str for certainly my friend the attempt to separate all 
 existences from one another is a barbarism and utterly unworthy of 
 an educated or philosophical mind 
 
 theaet why so 
 
 str the attempt at universal separation is the final annihilation 
 of all reasoning for only by the union of conceptions with one 
 another do we attain to discourse of reason 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str and observe that we were only just in time in making a 
 resistance to such separatists and compelling them to admit that 
 one thing mingles with another 
 
 theaet why so 
 
 str why that we might be able to assert discourse to be a kind 
 of being for if we could not the worst of all consequences would 
 follow we should have no philosophy moreover the necessity for 
 determining the nature of discourse presses upon us at this 
 moment if utterly deprived of it we could no more hold discourse and deprived of it we should be if we admitted that there was no 
 admixture of natures at all 
 
 theaet very true but i do not understand why at this moment we 
 must determine the nature of discourse 
 
 str perhaps you will see more clearly by the help of the 
 following explanation 
 
 theaet what explanation 
 
 str has been acknowledged by us to be one among many 
 classes diffused over all being 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str and thence arises the question whether mingles 
 with opinion and language 
 
 theaet how so 
 
 str if has no part in the proposition then all things 
 must be true but if has a part then false opinion and 
 false speech are possible for think or to say what is 
 falsehood which thus arises in the region of thought and in speech 
 
 theaet that is quite true 
 
 str and where there is falsehood surely there must be deceit 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str and if there is deceit then all things must be full of idols 
 and images and fancies 
 
 theaet to be sure 
 
 str into that region the sophist as we said made his 
 escape and when he had got there denied the very possibility of falsehood no one he argued either conceived or uttered falsehood inasmuch as did not in any way partake of being 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str and now has been shown to partake of being and 
 therefore he will not continue fighting in this direction 
 but he will probably say that some ideas partake of and some not and that language and opinion are of the class and he will still fight to the death against the existence of the 
 and phantastic art in which we have placed 
 him he will say opinion and language do not partake of and unless this participation exists there can be no such thing as falsehood and with the view of meeting this evasion we must begin by enquiring into the nature of language opinion and 
 imagination in order that when we find them we may find also that they have communion with and having made out the connection of them may thus prove that falsehood exists and therein we will imprison the sophist if he deserves it or if not we will let him go again and look for him in another class 
 
 theaet certainly stranger there appears to be truth in what was 
 said about the sophist at first that he was of a class not easily 
 caught for he seems to have abundance of defences which he throws up and which must every one of them be stormed before we can reach the man himself and even now we have with difficulty got 
 through his first defence which is the of and lo here is another for we have still to show that falsehood exists in 
 the sphere of language and opinion and there will be another and 
 another line of defence without end 
 
 str any one theaetetus who is able to advance even a 
 little ought to be of good cheer for what would he who is dispirited at a little progress do if he were making none at all or even undergoing a repulse such a faint heart as the proverb says will never take a city but now that we have succeeded thus far the citadel is ours and what remains is easier 
 
 theaet very true 
 
 str then as i was saying let us first of all obtain a 
 conception of language and opinion in order that we may have 
 clearer grounds for determining whether has any concern 
 with them or whether they are both always true and neither of them 
 ever false 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str then now let us speak of names as before we were 
 speaking of ideas and letters for that is the direction in which the answer may be expected 
 
 theaet and what is the question at issue about names 
 
 str the question at issue is whether all names may be connected 
 with one another or none or only some of them 
 
 theaet clearly the last is true 
 
 str i understand you to say that words which have a 
 meaning when in sequence may be connected but that words which have no meaning when in sequence cannot be connected 
 
 theaet what are you saying 
 
 str what i thought that you intended when you gave your 
 assent for there are two sorts of intimation of being which are given by the voice 
 
 theaet what are they 
 
 str one of them is called nouns and the other verbs 
 
 theaet describe them 
 
 str that which denotes action we call a verb 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str and the other which is an articulate mark set on those who 
 do the actions we call a noun 
 
 theaet quite true 
 
 str a succession of nouns only is not a sentence any more than of 
 verbs without nouns 
 
 theaet i do not understand you 
 
 str i see that when you gave your assent you had something else 
 in your mind but what i intended to say was that a mere succession 
 of nouns or of verbs is not discourse 
 
 theaet what do you mean 
 
 str i mean that words like walks runs sleeps or any 
 other words which denote action however many of them you string 
 together do not make discourse 
 
 theaet how can they 
 
 str or again when you say lion stag horse or any other 
 words which denote agents neither in this way of stringing words 
 together do you attain to discourse for there is no expression of 
 action or inaction or of the existence of existence or 
 indicated by the sounds until verbs are mingled with 
 nouns then the words fit and the smallest combination of them 
 forms language and is the simplest and least form of discourse 
 
 theaet again i ask what do you mean 
 
 str when any one says a man learns should you not call this 
 the simplest and least of sentences 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str yes for he now arrives at the point of giving an intimation 
 about something which is or is becoming or has become or will be 
 and he not only names but he does something by connecting 
 verbs with nouns and therefore we say that he discourses and to this 
 connection of words we give the name of discourse 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str and as there are some things which fit one another and other 
 things which do not fit so there are some vocal signs which do and 
 others which do not combine and form discourse 
 
 theaet quite true 
 
 str there is another small matter 
 
 theaet what is it 
 
 str a sentence must and cannot help having a subject 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str and must be of a certain quality 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str and now let us mind what we are about 
 
 theaet we must do so 
 
 str i will repeat a sentence to you in which a thing and an 
 action are combined by the help of a noun and a verb and you shall 
 tell me of whom the sentence speaks 
 
 theaet i will to the best my power 
 
 str theaetetus a very long sentence 
 
 theaet not very 
 
 str of whom does the sentence speak and who is the 
 subject that is what you have to tell 
 
 theaet of me i am the subject 
 
 str or this sentence again 
 
 theaet what sentence 
 
 str theaetetus with whom i am now speaking is flying 
 
 theaet that also is a sentence which will be admitted by every 
 one to speak of me and to apply to me 
 
 str we agreed that every sentence must necessarily have a certain 
 quality 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str and what is the quality of each of these two sentences 
 
 theaet the one as i imagine is false and the other true 
 
 str the true says what is true about you 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str and the false says what is other than true 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str and therefore speaks of things which are not as if they were 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str and say that things are real of you which are not for as we 
 were saying in regard to each thing or person there is much that 
 is and much that is not 
 
 theaet quite true 
 
 str the second of the two sentences which related to you was 
 first of all an example of the shortest form consistent with our 
 definition 
 
 theaet yes this was implied in recent admission 
 
 str and in the second place it related to a subject 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str who must be you and can be nobody else 
 theaet unquestionably 
 
 str and it would be no sentence at all if there were no subject 
 for as we proved a sentence which has no subject is impossible 
 
 theaet quite true 
 
 str when other then is asserted of you as the same and 
 as being such a combination of nouns and verbs is really and truly false discourse 
 
 theaet most true 
 
 str and therefore thought opinion and imagination are now 
 proved to exist in our minds both as true and false 
 
 theaet how so 
 
 str you will know better if you first gain a knowledge of 
 what they are and in what they severally differ from one another 
 theaet give me the knowledge which you would wish me to gain 
 str are not thought and speech the same with this exception 
 that what is called thought is the unuttered conversation of the 
 soul with herself 
 
 theaet quite true 
 
 str but the stream of thought which flows through the lips and is 
 audible is called speech 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str and we know that there exists in speech 
 
 theaet what exists 
 
 str affirmation 
 
 theaet yes we know it 
 
 str when the affirmation or denial takes place in silence and in 
 the mind only have you any other name by which to call it but 
 opinion 
 
 theaet there can be no other name 
 
 str and when opinion is presented not simply but in some form 
 of sense would you not call it imagination 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str and seeing that language is true and false and that 
 thought is the conversation of the soul with herself and opinion is the end of thinking and imagination or phantasy is the union of sense and 
 opinion the inference is that some of them since they are akin to 
 language should have an element of falsehood as well as of truth 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str do you perceive then that false opinion and speech have 
 been discovered sooner than we just now we seemed to be undertaking a task which would never be accomplished 
 
 theaet i perceive 
 
 str then let us not be discouraged about the future but 
 now having made this discovery let us go back to our previous classification 
 theaet what classification 
 
 str we divided into two sorts the one 
 the other imaginative or phantastic 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str and we said that we were uncertain in which we should 
 place the sophist 
 
 theaet we did say so 
 
 str and our heads began to go round more and more when it was 
 asserted that there is no such thing as an image or idol or 
 appearance because in no manner or time or place can there ever be 
 such a thing as falsehood 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str and now since there has been shown to be false speech and 
 false opinion there may be imitations of real existences and out 
 of this condition of the mind an art of deception may arise 
 
 theaet quite possible 
 
 str and we have already admitted in what preceded that the 
 sophist was lurking in one of the divisions of the 
 art 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str let us then renew the attempt and in dividing any class 
 always take the part to the right holding fast to that which holds 
 the sophist until we have stripped him of all his common 
 properties and reached his difference or peculiar then we may 
 exhibit him in his true nature first to ourselves and then 
 to kindred dialectical spirits 
 
 theaet very good 
 
 str you may remember that all art was originally divided 
 by us into creative and acquisitive 
 
 theaet yes 
 str and the sophist was flitting before us in the acquisitiveclass in the subdivisions of hunting contests merchandise and the like 
 
 theaet very true 
 
 str but now that the imitative art has enclosed him it is clear 
 that we must begin by dividing the art of creation for 
 imitation is a kind of creation of images however as we affirm and not of real things 
 
 theaet quite true 
 
 str in the first place there are two kinds of creation 
 
 theaet what are they 
 
 str one of them is human and the other divine 
 
 theaet i do not follow 
 
 str every power as you may remember our saying originally which 
 causes things to exist not previously existing was defined by us 
 as creative 
 
 theaet i remember 
 
 str looking now at the world and all the animals and plants at 
 things which grow upon the earth from seeds and roots as well as at 
 inanimate substances which are formed within the earth fusile or 
 shall we say that they come into having 
 existed the creation of god or shall we agree with 
 vulgar opinion about them 
 
 theaet what is it 
 
 str the opinion that nature brings them into being from some 
 spontaneous and unintelligent cause or shall we say that they are 
 created by a divine reason and a knowledge which comes from god 
 
 theaet i dare say that owing to my youth i may often waver in 
 my view but now when i look at you and see that you incline to 
 refer them to god i defer to your authority 
 
 str nobly said theaetetus and if i thought that you were one of 
 those who would hereafter change your mind i would have 
 gently argued with you and forced you to assent but as i perceive that you will come of yourself and without any argument of mine to that belief which as you say attracts you i will not forestall the work of time let me suppose then that things which are said to be made by nature are the work of divine art and that things which are made by man out of these are work of human art and so there are two kinds of making and production the one human and the other divine 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str then now subdivide each of the two sections which we have 
 already 
 
 theaet how do you mean 
 
 str i mean to say that you should make a vertical division of 
 production or invention as you have already made a lateral one 
 
 theaet i have done so 
 
 str then now there are in all four parts or of 
 them have reference to us and are human and two of them have 
 reference to the gods and are divine 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str and again in the division which was supposed to be made in 
 the other way one part in each subdivision is the making of the 
 things themselves but the two remaining parts may be called the 
 making of likenesses and so the productive art is again divided 
 into two parts 
 
 theaet tell me the divisions once more 
 
 str i suppose that we and the other animals and the elements 
 out of which things are water and the 
 known by us to be each and all the creation and work of god 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str and there are images of them which are not them but which 
 correspond to them and these are also the creation of a wonderful 
 skill 
 
 theaet what are they 
 
 str the appearances which spring up of themselves in sleep or by 
 day such as a shadow when darkness arises in a fire or the 
 reflection which is produced when the light in bright and smooth 
 objects meets on their surface with an external light and creates a 
 perception the opposite of our ordinary sight 
 
 theaet yes and the images as well as the creation are equally 
 the work of a divine hand 
 
 str and what shall we say of human art do we not make 
 one house by the art of building and another by the art of drawing which is a sort of dream created by man for those who are awake 
 
 theaet quite true 
 
 str and other products of human creation are twofold and go in 
 pairs there is the thing with which the art of making the thing is 
 concerned and the image with which imitation is concerned 
 
 theaet now i begin to understand and am ready to acknowledge 
 that there are two kinds of production and each of them two fold 
 in the lateral division there is both a divine and a human 
 production in the vertical there are realities and a creation of a kind of 
 similitudes 
 
 str and let us not forget that of the imitative class the one 
 part to have been likeness making and the other phantastic if it 
 could be shown that falsehood is a reality and belongs to 
 the class of real being 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str and this appeared to be the case and therefore now without 
 hesitation we shall number the different kinds as two 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str then now let us again divide the phantastic art 
 
 theaet where shall we make the division 
 
 str there is one kind which is produced by an instrument and 
 another in which the creator of the appearance is himself the 
 instrument 
 
 theaet what do you mean 
 
 str when any one makes himself appear like another in his 
 figure or his voice imitation is the name for this part of the phantastic art 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str let this then be named the art of mimicry and this the 
 province assigned to it as for the other division we are weary and 
 will give that up leaving to some one else the duty of making the 
 class and giving it a suitable name 
 
 theaet let us do as you a sphere to the one and leave 
 the other 
 
 str there is a further distinction theaetetus which is worthy 
 of our consideration and for a reason which i will tell you 
 
 theaet let me hear 
 
 str there are some who imitate knowing what they 
 imitate and some who do not know and what line of distinction can there possibly be greater than that which divides ignorance from knowledge 
 
 theaet there can be no greater 
 
 str was not the sort of imitation of which we spoke just now the 
 imitation of those who know for he who would imitate you 
 would surely know you and your figure 
 
 theaet naturally 
 
 str and what would you say of the figure or form of justice or of 
 virtue in general are we not well aware that many having no 
 knowledge of either but only a sort of opinion do their 
 best to show that this opinion is really entertained by them by expressing it as far as they can in word and deed 
 
 theaet yes that is very common 
 
 str and do they always fail in their attempt to be thought just 
 when they are not or is not the very opposite true 
 
 theaet the very opposite 
 
 str such a one then should be described as an be 
 distinguished from the other as he who is ignorant is distinguished 
 from him who knows 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str can we find a suitable name for each of them this is clearly 
 not an easy task for among the ancients there was some confusion of 
 ideas which prevented them from attempting to divide genera into 
 species wherefore there is no great abundance of names yet for 
 the sake of distinctness i will make bold to call the imitation which coexists with opinion the imitation of which coexists with science a scientific or learned imitation 
 
 theaet granted 
 
 str the former is our present concern for the sophist was 
 classed with imitators indeed but not among those who have 
 knowledge 
 
 theaet very true 
 
 str let us then examine our imitator of appearance and see 
 whether he is sound like a piece of iron or whether there is still 
 some crack in him 
 
 theaet let us examine him 
 
 str indeed there is a very considerable crack for if you 
 look you find that one of the two classes of imitators is a simple creature who thinks that he knows that which he only fancies the other sort has knocked about among arguments until he suspects and 
 fears that he is ignorant of that which to the many he pretends to know 
 theaet there are certainly the two kinds which you describe 
 
 str shall we regard one as the simple other as the 
 dissembling or ironical imitator 
 
 theaet very good 
 
 str and shall we further speak of this latter class as having one 
 or two divisions 
 
 theaet answer yourself 
 
 str upon consideration then there appear to me to be two there 
 is the dissembler who harangues a multitude in public in a long 
 speech and the dissembler who in private and in short speeches 
 compels the person who is conversing with him to contradict himself 
 
 theaet what you say is most true 
 
 str and who is the maker of the longer speeches is he the 
 statesman or the popular orator 
 
 theaet the latter 
 
 str and what shall we call the other is he the philosopher or 
 the sophist 
 
 theaet the philosopher he cannot be for upon our view he is 
 ignorant but since he is an imitator of the wise he will have a 
 name which is formed by an adaptation of the word sothos what shall we name him i am pretty sure that i cannot be mistaken in 
 terming him the true and very sophist 
 
 str shall we bind up his name as we did before making a 
 chain from one end of his genealogy to the other 
 
 theaet by all means 
 
 str he then who traces the pedigree of his art as 
 belonging to the conscious or dissembling section of the art of 
 causing is an imitator of appearance and is 
 separated from the class of phantastic which is a branch of 
 into that further division of creation the juggling of 
 words a creation human and not one who affirms the real 
 sophist to be of this blood and lineage will say the very truth 
 
 theaet undoubtedly 
 
 the end

 book 
 str but perhaps you mean to give the name of being to both of 
 them together 
 
 theaet quite likely 
 
 str then friends we shall reply to them the answer 
 is plainly that the two will still be resolved into one 
 
 theaet most true 
 
 str since then we are in a difficulty please to tell 
 us what you mean when you speak of being for there can be no doubt that you always from the first understood your own meaning whereas we once thought that we understood you but now we are in a great strait please to begin by explaining this matter to us and let us no longer fancy that we understand you when we entirely misunderstand you there will be no impropriety in our demanding an answer to this question either of the dualists or of the pluralists 
 
 theaet certainly not 
 
 str and what about the assertors of the oneness of the 
 we not endeavour to ascertain from them what they mean by being 
 
 theaet by all means 
 
 str then let them answer this question one you say alone is 
 yes they will reply 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str and there is something which you call being 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str and is being the same as one and do you apply two 
 names to the same thing 
 
 theaet what will be their answer stranger 
 
 str it is clear theaetetus that he who asserts the 
 unity of being will find a difficulty in answering this or any other question 
 
 theaet why so 
 
 str to admit of two names and to affirm that there is nothing 
 but unity is surely ridiculous 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str and equally irrational to admit that a name is anything 
 
 theaet how so 
 
 str to distinguish the name from the thing implies duality 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str and yet he who identifies the name with the thing will be 
 compelled to say that it is the name of nothing or if he 
 says that it is the name of something even then the name will only be the name of a name and of nothing else 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str and the one will turn out to be only one of one and being 
 absolute unity will represent a mere name 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str and would they say that the whole is other than the one that 
 is or the same with it 
 
 theaet to be sure they would and they actually say so 
 
 str if being is a whole as parmenides sings 
 every way like unto the fullness of a sphere 
 evenly balanced from the centre on every side 
 and must needs be neither greater nor less in any way 
 neither on this side nor on that 
 then being has a centre and extremes and having these must also 
 have parts 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str yet that which has parts may have the attribute of 
 unity in all the parts and in this way being all and a whole may be one 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str but that of which this is the condition cannot be absolute 
 unity 
 
 theaet why not 
 
 str because according to right reason that which is truly one 
 must be affirmed to be absolutely indivisible 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str but this indivisible if made up of many parts will 
 contradict reason 
 
 theaet i understand 
 
 str shall we say that being is one and a whole because it has 
 the attribute of unity or shall we say that being is not a whole at 
 all 
 
 theaet that is a hard alternative to offer 
 
 str most true for being having in a certain sense the attribute 
 of one is yet proved not to be the same as one and the all is 
 therefore more than one 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str and yet if being be not a whole through having the attribute 
 of unity and there be such a thing as an absolute whole being 
 lacks something of its own nature 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str upon this view again being having a defect of being will 
 become 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str and again the all becomes more than one for being and the 
 whole will each have their separate nature 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str but if the whole does not exist at all all the previous 
 difficulties remain the same and there will be the further 
 difficulty that besides having no being being can never have come 
 into being 
 
 theaet why so 
 
 str because that which comes into being always comes into being 
 as a whole so that he who does not give whole a place among beings cannot speak either of essence or generation as existing 
 
 theaet yes that certainly appears to be true 
 
 str again how can that which is not a whole have any 
 quantity for that which is of a certain quantity must necessarily be the whole of that quantity 
 
 theaet exactly 
 
 str and there will be innumerable other points each of them 
 causing infinite trouble to him who says that being is either one 
 or two 
 
 theaet the difficulties which are dawning upon us prove this for 
 one objection connects with another and they are always involving 
 what has preceded in a greater and worse perplexity 
 
 str we are far from having exhausted the more exact thinkers who 
 treat of being and but let us be content to leave 
 them and proceed to view those who speak less precisely and we shall find as the result of all that the nature of being is quite as difficult to comprehend as that of 
 
 theaet then now we will go to the others 
 
 str there appears to be a sort of war of giants and gods going on 
 amongst them they are fighting with one another about the nature of 
 essence 
 
 theaet how is that 
 
 str some of them are dragging down all things from heaven and 
 from the unseen to earth and they literally grasp in their hands 
 rocks and oaks of these they lay hold and obstinately 
 maintain that the things only which can be touched or handled have being or essence because they define being and body as one and if any one else says that what is not a body exists they altogether despise him and will hear of nothing but body 
 
 theaet i have often met with such men and terrible fellows they 
 are 
 
 str and that is the reason why their opponents cautiously defend 
 themselves from above out of an unseen world mightily contending 
 that true essence consists of certain intelligible and incorporeal 
 ideas the bodies of the materialists which by them are 
 maintained to be the very truth they break up into little bits by their 
 arguments and affirm them to be not essence but generation and 
 motion between the two armies theaetetus there is always 
 an endless conflict raging concerning these matters 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str let us ask each party in turn to give an account of 
 that which they call essence 
 
 theaet how shall we get it out of them 
 
 str with those who make being to consist in ideas there will be 
 less difficulty for they are civil people enough but there will be 
 very great difficulty or rather an absolute impossibility 
 in getting an opinion out of those who drag everything down to matter shall i tell you what we must do 
 
 theaet what 
 
 str let us if we can really improve them but if this is not 
 possible let us imagine them to be better than they are and more 
 willing to answer in accordance with the rules of argument and then 
 their opinion will be more worth having for that which better men 
 acknowledge has more weight than that which is acknowledged by 
 inferior men moreover we are no respecters of persons but seekers 
 after time 
 
 theaet very good 
 
 str then now on the supposition that they are improved 
 let us ask them to state their views and do you interpret them 
 
 theaet agreed 
 
 str let them say whether they would admit that there is such a 
 thing as a mortal animal 
 
 theaet of course they would 
 
 str and do they not acknowledge this to be a body having a soul 
 
 theaet certainly they do 
 
 str meaning to say the soul is something which exists 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str and do they not say that one soul is just and another 
 unjust and that one soul is wise and another foolish 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str and that the just and wise soul becomes just and wise by the 
 possession of justice and wisdom and the opposite under opposite 
 circumstances 
 
 theaet yes they do 
 
 str but surely that which may be present or may be absent will be 
 admitted by them to exist 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str and allowing that justice wisdom the other virtues and 
 their opposites exist as well as a soul in which they inhere do they 
 affirm any of them to be visible and tangible or are they all 
 invisible 
 
 theaet they would say that hardly any of them are visible 
 
 str and would they say that they are corporeal 
 
 theaet they would distinguish the soul would be said by them to 
 have a body but as to the other qualities of justice 
 wisdom and the like about which you asked they would not venture either to deny their existence or to maintain that they were all corporeal 
 
 str verily theaetetus i perceive a great improvement in 
 them the real aborigines children of the teeth would have been deterred by no shame at all but would have obstinately asserted 
 that nothing is which they are not able to squeeze in their hands 
 
 theaet that is pretty much their notion 
 
 str let us push the question for if they will admit that 
 any even the smallest particle of being is incorporeal it is enough they must then say what that nature is which is common to both the 
 corporeal and incorporeal and which they have in their eye 
 when they say of both of them that they are perhaps they may be 
 in a difficulty and if this is the case there is a possibility 
 that they may accept a notion of ours respecting the nature of 
 being having nothing of their own to offer 
 
 theaet what is the notion tell me and we shall soon see 
 str my notion would be that anything which possesses any sort of 
 power to affect another or to be affected by another if only for a 
 single moment however trifling the cause and however slight the 
 effect has real existence and i hold that the definition 
 of being is simply power of theaet they accept your suggestion having nothing better of their own to offer 
 
 str very good perhaps we as well as they may one day change 
 our minds but for the present this may be regarded as the 
 understanding which is established with them 
 
 theaet agreed 
 
 str let us now go to the friends of ideas of their opinions 
 too you shall be the interpreter 
 
 theaet i will 
 
 str to them we would distinguish essence from generation 
 
 theaet yes they reply 
 
 str and you would allow that we participate in 
 generation with the body and through perception but we participate with the soul through in true essence and essence you would affirm to be always the same and immutable whereas generation or becoming varies 
 
 theaet yes that is what we should affirm 
 
 str well fair sirs we say to them what is this participation 
 which you assert of both do you agree with our recent definition 
 
 theaet what definition 
 
 str we said that being was an active or passive energy 
 arising out of a certain power which proceeds from elements meeting with one another perhaps your cars theaetetus may fail to catch their answer which i recognize because i have been accustomed to hear it 
 
 theaet and what is their answer 
 
 str they deny the truth of what we were just now saying to the 
 aborigines about existence 
 
 theaet what was that 
 
 str any power of doing or suffering in a degree however slight 
 was held by us to be a sufficient definition of being 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str they deny this and say that the power of doing or 
 suffering is confined to becoming and that neither power is applicable to being 
 
 theaet and is there not some truth in what they say 
 
 str yes but our reply will be that we want to ascertain from 
 them more distinctly whether they further admit that the soul 
 knows and that being or essence is known 
 
 theaet there can be no doubt that they say so 
 
 str and is knowing and being known doing or suffering 
 or both or is the one doing and the other suffering or has neither any share in either 
 
 theaet clearly neither has any share in either for if they say 
 anything else they will contradict themselves 
 
 str i understand but they will allow that if to know is active 
 then of course to be known is passive and on this view 
 being in so far as it is known is acted upon by knowledge and is therefore in motion for that which is in a state of rest cannot be acted upon as we affirm 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str and o heavens can we ever be made to believe that motion 
 and life and soul and mind are not present with perfect being can 
 we imagine that being is devoid of life and mind and 
 exists in awful unmeaningness an everlasting fixture 
 
 theaet that would be a dreadful thing to admit stranger 
 
 str but shall we say that has mind and not life 
 
 theaet how is that possible 
 
 str or shall we say that both inhere in perfect being but that 
 it has no soul which contains them 
 
 theaet and in what other way can it contain them 
 
 str or that being has mind and life and soul but although 
 endowed with soul remains absolutely unmoved 
 
 theaet all three suppositions appear to me to be irrational 
 
 str under being then we must include motion and that which is 
 moved 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str then theaetetus our inference is that if there is 
 no motion neither is there any mind anywhere or about anything or belonging to any one 
 
 theaet quite true 
 
 str and yet this equally follows if we grant that all things are 
 in this view too mind has no existence 
 
 theaet how so 
 
 str do you think that sameness of condition and mode and subject 
 could ever exist without a principle of rest 
 
 theaet certainly not 
 
 str can you see how without them mind could exist or come into 
 existence anywhere 
 
 theaet no 
 
 str and surely contend we must in every possible way against him 
 who would annihilate knowledge and reason and mind and yet ventures to speak confidently about anything 
 
 theaet yes with all our might 
 
 str then the philosopher who has the truest reverence for these 
 qualities cannot possibly accept the notion of those who 
 say that the whole is at rest either as unity or in many forms and he will be utterly deaf to those who assert universal motion as children say entreatingly give us both so he will include both the moveable 
 and immoveable in his definition of being and all 
 
 theaet most true 
 
 str and now do we seem to have gained a fair notion of being 
 
 theaet yes truly 
 
 str alas theaetetus methinks that we are now only beginning to 
 see the real difficulty of the enquiry into the nature of it 
 
 theaet what do you mean 
 
 str o my friend do you not see that nothing can exceed out 
 ignorance and yet we fancy that we are saying something good 
 
 theaet i certainly thought that we were and i do not at all 
 understand how we never found out our desperate case 
 
 str reflect after having made these admissions may we not be 
 justly asked the same questions which we ourselves were asking of 
 those who said that all was hot and cold 
 
 theaet what were they will you recall them to my mind 
 
 str to be sure i will remind you of them by putting the same 
 questions to you which i did to them and then we shall get on 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str would you not say that rest and motion are in the most entire 
 opposition to one another 
 
 theaet of course 
 
 str and yet you would say that both and either of them 
 equally are 
 
 theaet i should 
 
 str and when you admit that both or either of them are 
 do you mean to say that both or either of them are in motion 
 
 theaet certainly not 
 
 str or do you wish to imply that they are both at rest when you 
 say that they are 
 
 theaet of course not 
 
 str then you conceive of being as some third and distinct nature 
 under which rest and motion are alike included and observing that 
 they both participate in being you declare that they are 
 
 theaet truly we seem to have an intimation that being is 
 some third thing when we say that rest and motion are 
 
 str then being is not the combination of rest and motion but 
 something different from them 
 
 theaet so it would appear 
 
 str being then according to its own nature is neither in 
 motion nor at rest 
 
 theaet that is very much the truth 
 
 str where then is a man to look for help who would have 
 any clear or fixed notion of being in his mind 
 
 theaet where indeed 
 
 str i scarcely think that he can look anywhere for that which is 
 not in motion must be at rest and again that which is not at rest 
 must be in motion but being is placed outside of both these 
 classes is this possible 
 
 theaet utterly impossible 
 
 str here then is another thing which we ought to bear in mind 
 
 theaet what 
 
 str when we were asked to what we were to assign the 
 appellation of we were in the greatest you remember 
 
 theaet to be sure 
 
 str and are we not now in as a difficulty about being 
 
 theaes i should say stranger that we are in one which is if 
 possible even greater 
 
 str then let us acknowledge the difficulty and as being and 
 are involved in the same perplexity there is hope 
 that when the one appears more or less distinctly the other will equally appear and if we are able to see neither there may still be a 
 chance of steering our way in between them without any great 
 discredit 
 theaet very good 
 
 str let us enquire then how we come to predicate many names of 
 the same thing 
 
 theaet give an example 
 
 str i mean that we speak of man for example under many 
 we attribute to him colours and forms and magnitudes and virtues and vices in all of which instances and in ten thousand others we not only speak of him as a man but also as good and having other attributes and in the same way anything else which we originally supposed to be one is described by us as many and under many names 
 
 theaet that is true 
 
 str and thus we provide a rich feast for tyros whether young or 
 old for there is nothing easier than to argue that the one cannot 
 be many or the many one and great is their delight in 
 denying that a man is good for man they insist is man and good is good i dare say that you have met with persons who interest in such are often elderly men whose meagre sense is thrown into amazement by these discoveries of theirs which they believe to be the height of wisdom 
 
 theaet certainly i have 
 
 str then not to exclude any one who has ever speculated at all 
 upon the nature of being let us put our questions to them as well 
 as to our former friends 
 
 theaet what questions 
 
 str shall we refuse to attribute being to motion and rest or 
 anything to anything and assume that they do not mingle and are 
 incapable of participating in one another or shall we 
 gather all into one class of things communicable with one another or are some things communicable and others of these alternatives 
 
 theaetetus will they prefer 
 
 theaet i have nothing to answer on their behalf suppose that you 
 take all these hypotheses in turn and see what are the consequences 
 which follow from each of them 
 
 str very good and first let us assume them to say that nothing 
 is capable of participating in anything else in any respect in that 
 case rest and motion cannot participate in being at all 
 
 theaet they cannot 
 
 str but would either of them be if not participating in being 
 
 theaet no 
 
 str then by this admission everything is instantly overturned as 
 well the doctrine of universal motion as of universal rest and also 
 the doctrine of those who distribute being into immutable and 
 everlasting kinds for all these add on a notion of being some 
 affirming that things are truly in motion and others that they 
 are truly at rest 
 
 theaes just so 
 
 str again those who would at one time compound and at another 
 resolve all things whether making them into one and out of one 
 creating infinity or dividing them into finite clements and 
 forming compounds out of these whether they suppose the processes of creation to be successive or continuous would be talking nonsense in all this if there were no admixture 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str most ridiculous of all will the men themselves be who want to 
 carry out the argument and yet forbid us to call anything because 
 participating in some affection from another by the name of that 
 other 
 
 theaet why so 
 
 str why because they are compelled to use the words to be 
 apart from others in itself and ten thousand more which 
 they cannot give up but must make the connecting links of 
 discourse and therefore they do not require to be refuted by 
 others but their enemy as the saying is inhabits the same house 
 with them they are always carrying about with them an 
 adversary like the wonderful ventriloquist eurycles who out of their own bellies audibly contradicts them 
 
 theaet precisely so a very true and exact illustration 
 
 str and now if we suppose that all things have the power of 
 communion with one another what will follow 
 
 theaet even i can solve that riddle 
 
 str how 
 
 theaet why because motion itself would be at rest and rest 
 again in motion if they could be attributed to one another 
 
 str but this is utterly impossible 
 
 theaet of course 
 
 str then only the third hypothesis remains 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str for surely either all things have communion with all or 
 nothing with any other thing or some things communicate with some 
 things and others not 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str and two out of these three suppositions have been found to be 
 impossible 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str every one then who desires to answer truly will adopt the 
 third and remaining hypothesis of the communion of some with some 
 
 theaet quite true 
 
 str this communion of some with some may be illustrated 
 by the caseof letters for some letters do not fit each other while others do 
 
 theaet of course 
 
 str and the vowels especially are a sort of bond which pervades 
 all the other letters so that without a vowel one consonant 
 cannot be joined to another 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str but does every one know what letters will unite with what or 
 is art required in order to do so 
 
 theaet what is required 
 
 str what art 
 
 theaet the art of grammar 
 
 str and is not this also true of sounds high and 
 not he who has the art to know what sounds mingle a musician and he who is ignorant not a musician 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str and we shall find this to be generally true of art or the 
 absence of art 
 
 theaet of course 
 
 str and as classes are admitted by us in like manner to be some 
 of them capable and others incapable of intermixture must not he 
 who would rightly show what kinds will unite and what will not 
 proceed by the help of science in the path of argument and will he 
 not ask if the connecting links are universal and so capable of 
 intermixture with all things and again in divisions whether there 
 are not other universal classes which make them possible 
 
 theaet to be sure he will require science and if i am not 
 mistaken the very greatest of all sciences 
 
 str how are we to call it by zeus have we not lighted 
 unwittingly upon our free and noble science and in looking for the sophist have we not entertained the philosopher unawares 
 
 theaet what do you mean 
 
 str should we not say that the division according to 
 classes which neither makes the same other nor makes other the same is the business of the dialectical science 
 
 theaet that is what we should say 
 
 str then surely he who can divide rightly is able to see 
 clearly one form pervading a scattered multitude and many different 
 forms contained under one higher form and again one form knit 
 together into a single whole and pervading many such wholes and 
 many forms existing only in separation and isolation this is the 
 knowledge of classes which determines where they can have communion with one another and where not 
 
 theaet quite true 
 
 str and the art of dialectic would be attributed by you 
 only to the philosopher pure and true 
 
 theaet who but he can be worthy 
 
 str in this region we shall always discover the philosopher if 
 we look for him like the sophist he is not easily discovered but 
 for a different reason 
 
 theaet for what reason 
 
 str because the sophist runs away into the darkness of 
 in which he has learned by habit to feel about and cannot be 
 discovered because of the darkness of the place is not that true 
 
 theaet it seems to be so 
 
 str and the philosopher always holding converse through reason 
 with the idea of being is also dark from excess of light for the 
 souls of the many have no eye which can endure the vision of the 
 divine 
 
 theaet yes that seems to be quite as true as the other 
 
 str well the philosopher may hereafter be more fully 
 considered by us if we are disposed but the sophist must clearly not be allowed to escape until we have had a good look at him 
 
 theaet very good 
 
 str since then we are agreed that some classes have a communion 
 with one another and others not and some have communion with a few and others with many and that there is no reason why some should not have universal communion with all let us now pursue the 
 enquiry as the argument suggests not in relation to all ideas 
 lest the multitude of them should confuse us but let us select a 
 few of those which are reckoned to be the principal ones 
 and consider their several natures and their capacity of communion with one another in order that if we are not able to apprehend with perfect clearness the notions of being and we may at 
 least not fall short in the consideration of them so far as they come within the scope of the present enquiry if peradventure we may be allowed to assert the reality of and yet escape unscathed 
 
 theaet we must do so 
 
 str the most important of all the genera are those which we were 
 just now and rest and motion 
 
 theaet yes by far 
 
 str and two of these are as we affirm incapable of 
 communion with one another 
 
 theaet quite incapable 
 
 str whereas being surely has communion with both of them for 
 both of them are 
 
 theaet of course 
 
 str that makes up three of them 
 
 theaet to be sure 
 
 str and each of them is other than the remaining two but the 
 same with itself 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str but then what is the meaning of these two words same and 
 other are they two new kinds other than the three and yet always 
 of necessity intermingling with them and are we to have five kinds 
 instead of three or when we speak of the same and other are we 
 unconsciously speaking of one of the three first kinds 
 
 theaet very likely we are 
 
 str but surely motion and rest are neither the other nor the 
 same 
 
 theaet how is that 
 
 str whatever we attribute to motion and rest in common cannot be 
 either of them 
 
 theaet why not 
 
 str because motion would be at rest and rest in motion for 
 either of them being predicated of both will compel the other to 
 change into the opposite of its own nature because partaking of its 
 opposite 
 
 theaet quite true 
 
 str yet they surely both partake of the same and of the other 
 theaet yes 
 
 str then we must not assert that motion any more than rest is 
 either the same or the other 
 
 theaet no we must not 
 
 str but are we to conceive that being and the same are identical 
 
 theaet possibly 
 
 str but if they are identical then again in saying that 
 motion and rest have being we should also be saying that they are the same 
 
 theaet which surely cannot be 
 
 str then being and same cannot be one 
 
 theaet scarcely 
 
 str then we may suppose the same to be a fourth class 
 which is now to be added to the three others 
 
 theaet quite true 
 
 str and shall we call the other a fifth class or should we 
 consider being and other to be two names of the same class 
 
 theaet very likely 
 
 str but you would agree if i am not mistaken that existences 
 are relative as well as absolute 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str and the other is always relative to other 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str but this would not be the case unless being and the other 
 entirely differed for if the other like being were absolute as 
 well as relative then there would have been a kind of other 
 which was not other than other and now we find that what is other must of necessity be what it is in relation to some other 
 
 theaet that is the true state of the case 
 
 str then we must admit the other as the fifth of our selected 
 classes 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str and the fifth class pervades all classes for they all differ 
 from one another not by reason of their own nature but because 
 they partake of the idea of the other 
 
 theaet quite true 
 
 str then let us now put the case with reference to each of the 
 five 
 
 theaet how 
 
 str first there is motion which we affirm to be 
 absolutely rest what else can we say 
 
 theaet it is so 
 
 str and therefore is not rest 
 
 theaet certainly not 
 
 str and yet is because partaking of being 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str again motion is other than the same 
 
 theaet just so 
 
 str and is therefore not the same 
 
 theaet it is not 
 
 str yet surely motion is the same because all things partake 
 of the same 
 
 theaet very true 
 
 str then we must admit and not object to say that motion is the 
 same and is not the same for we do not apply the terms same and 
 not the same in the same sense but we call it the same in 
 relation to itself because partaking of the same and not the same 
 because having communion with the other it is thereby severed from 
 the same and has become not that but other and is therefore 
 rightly spoken of as not the same 
 
 theaet to be sure 
 
 str and if absolute motion in any point of view partook of rest 
 there would be no absurdity in calling motion stationary 
 
 theaet quite right that is on the supposition that some 
 classes mingle with one another and others not 
 
 str that such a communion of kinds is according to nature we had 
 already proved before we arrived at this part of our discussion 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str let us proceed then we not say that motion is other than 
 the other having been also proved by us to be other than 
 the same and other than rest 
 
 theaet that is certain 
 
 str then according to this view motion is other and also not 
 other 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str what is the next step shall we say that motion is other than 
 the three and not other than the we agreed that there are 
 five classes about and in the sphere of which we proposed to make 
 enquiry 
 
 theaet surely we cannot admit that the number is less than it 
 appeared to be just now 
 
 str then we may without fear contend that motion is other than 
 being 
 
 theaet without the least fear 
 
 str the plain result is that motion since it partakes of being 
 really is and also is not 
 
 theaet nothing can be plainer 
 
 str then necessarily exists in the case of motion and 
 of every class for the nature of the other entering into them all 
 makes each of them other than being and so and 
 therefore of all of them in like manner we may truly say that they 
 are again inasmuch as they partake of being that they are 
 and are existent 
 
 theaet so we may assume 
 
 str every class then has plurality of being and infinity of 
 
 
 theaet so we must infer 
 
 str and being itself may be said to be other than the other kinds 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str then we may infer that being is not in respect of as many 
 other things as there are for these it is itself one and 
 is not the other things which are infinite in number 
 
 theaet that is not far from the truth 
 
 str and we must not quarrel with this result since it is of the 
 nature of classes to have communion with one another and if any one 
 denies our present statement viz that being is not etc let 
 him first argue with our former conclusion respecting the 
 communion of ideas and then he may proceed to argue with what 
 follows 
 
 theaet nothing can be fairer 
 
 str let me ask you to consider a further question 
 
 theaet what question 
 
 str when we speak of we speak i suppose not of 
 something opposed to being but only different 
 
 theaet what do you mean 
 
 str when we speak of something as not great does the expression 
 seem to you to imply what is little any more than what is equal 
 
 theaet certainly not 
 
 str the negative particles ou and me when prefixed to words do 
 not imply opposition but only difference from the words or more 
 correctly from the things represented by the words which 
 follow them 
 
 theaet quite true 
 
 str there is another point to be considered if you do not object 
 
 theaet what is it 
 
 str the nature of the other appears to me to be divided into 
 fractions like knowledge 
 
 theaet how so 
 
 str knowledge like the other is one and yet the 
 various parts of knowledge have each of them their own particular name and hence there are many arts and kinds of knowledge 
 
 theaet quite true 
 
 str and is not the case the same with the parts of the 
 other which is also one 
 
 theaet very likely but will you tell me how 
 
 str there is some part of the other which is opposed to the 
 beautiful 
 
 theaet there is 
 
 str shall we say that this has or has not a name 
 
 theaet it has for whatever we call not beautiful is 
 other than the beautiful not than something else 
 
 str and now tell me another thing 
 
 theaet what 
 
 str is the anything but existence parted 
 off from a certain kind of existence and again from another point 
 of view opposed to an existing something 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str then the turns out to be the opposition of 
 being to being 
 
 theaet very true 
 
 str but upon this view is the beautiful a more real and the 
 a less real existence 
 
 theaet not at all 
 
 str and the may be said to exist equally with 
 the great 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str and in the same way the just must be placed in the same 
 category with the the one cannot be said to have any more 
 existence than the other 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str the same may be said of other things seeing that the 
 nature of the other has a real existence the parts of this nature must 
 equally be supposed to exist 
 
 theaet of course 
 
 str then as would appear the opposition of a part of the other 
 and of a part of being to one another is if i may venture to say 
 so as truly essence as being itself and implies not the opposite 
 of being but only what is other than being 
 
 theaet beyond question 
 
 str what then shall we call it 
 
 theaet clearly and this is the very nature for which 
 the sophist compelled us to search 
 
 str and has not this as you were saying as real an existence as 
 any other class may i not say with confidence that has an 
 assured existence and a nature of its own just as the great was 
 found to be great and the beautiful beautiful and the 
 and the in the same manner 
 has been found to be and is and is to 
 be reckoned one among the many classes of being do you theaetetus still feel any doubt of this 
 
 theaet none whatever 
 
 str do you observe that our scepticism has carried us beyond the 
 range of parmenides prohibition 
 
 theaet in what 
 
 str we have advanced to a further point and shown him 
 more than he for bad us to investigate 
 
 theaet how is that 
 
 str why because he never is and do thou keep thy thoughts from this way of enquiry 
 theaet yes he says so 
 
 str whereas we have not only proved that things which 
 are not are but we have shown what form of being is for we have shown that the nature of the other is and is distributed over all things in their relations to one another and whatever part of the other is contrasted with being this is precisely what we have 
 ventured to call 
 
 theaet and surely stranger we were quite right 
 
 str let not any one say then that while affirming the 
 opposition of to being we still assert the being of 
 for as to whether there is an opposite of being to that 
 enquiry we have long said may or may not be and may or may not be capable of definition but as touching our present 
 account of let a man either convince us of error or so 
 long as he cannot he too must say as we are saying that there is 
 a communion of classes and that being and difference or other 
 traverse all things and mutually interpenetrate so that the other 
 partakes of being and by reason of this participation is and yet 
 is not that of which it partakes but other and being other than 
 being it is clearly a necessity that should be again 
 being through partaking of the other becomes a class other than 
 the remaining classes and being other than all of them is not each 
 one of them and is not all the rest so that undoubtedly there are 
 thousands upon thousands of cases in which being is not and 
 all other things whether regarded individually or collectively in many 
 respects are and in many respects are not 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str and he who is sceptical of this contradiction must think how 
 he can find something better to say or if he sees a puzzle and 
 his pleasure is to drag words this way and that the argument will 
 prove to him that he is not making a worthy use of his 
 faculties for there is no charm in such puzzles and there is no difficulty in detecting them but we can tell him of something else the pursuit of which is noble and also difficult 
 
 theaet what is it 
 
 str a thing of which i have already alone these 
 puzzles as involving no difficulty he should be able to follow and 
 criticize in detail every argument and when a man says that the 
 same is in a manner other or that other is the same to understand 
 and refute him from his own point of view and in the same respect 
 in which he asserts either of these affections but to show that 
 somehow and in some sense the same is other or the other 
 same or the great small or the like unlike and to delight in always bringing forward such contradictions is no real refutation but is 
 clearly the babe of some one who is only beginning to approach the problem of being 
 
 theaet to be sure 
 
 str for certainly my friend the attempt to separate all 
 existences from one another is a barbarism and utterly unworthy of 
 an educated or philosophical mind 
 
 theaet why so 
 
 str the attempt at universal separation is the final annihilation 
 of all reasoning for only by the union of conceptions with one 
 another do we attain to discourse of reason 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str and observe that we were only just in time in making a 
 resistance to such separatists and compelling them to admit that 
 one thing mingles with another 
 
 theaet why so 
 
 str why that we might be able to assert discourse to be a kind 
 of being for if we could not the worst of all consequences would 
 follow we should have no philosophy moreover the necessity for 
 determining the nature of discourse presses upon us at this 
 moment if utterly deprived of it we could no more hold discourse and deprived of it we should be if we admitted that there was no 
 admixture of natures at all 
 
 theaet very true but i do not understand why at this moment we 
 must determine the nature of discourse 
 
 str perhaps you will see more clearly by the help of the 
 following explanation 
 
 theaet what explanation 
 
 str has been acknowledged by us to be one among many 
 classes diffused over all being 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str and thence arises the question whether mingles 
 with opinion and language 
 
 theaet how so 
 
 str if has no part in the proposition then all things 
 must be true but if has a part then false opinion and 
 false speech are possible for think or to say what is 
 falsehood which thus arises in the region of thought and in speech 
 
 theaet that is quite true 
 
 str and where there is falsehood surely there must be deceit 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str and if there is deceit then all things must be full of idols 
 and images and fancies 
 
 theaet to be sure 
 
 str into that region the sophist as we said made his 
 escape and when he had got there denied the very possibility of falsehood no one he argued either conceived or uttered falsehood inasmuch as did not in any way partake of being 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str and now has been shown to partake of being and 
 therefore he will not continue fighting in this direction 
 but he will probably say that some ideas partake of and some not and that language and opinion are of the class and he will still fight to the death against the existence of the 
 and phantastic art in which we have placed 
 him he will say opinion and language do not partake of and unless this participation exists there can be no such thing as falsehood and with the view of meeting this evasion we must begin by enquiring into the nature of language opinion and 
 imagination in order that when we find them we may find also that they have communion with and having made out the connection of them may thus prove that falsehood exists and therein we will imprison the sophist if he deserves it or if not we will let him go again and look for him in another class 
 
 theaet certainly stranger there appears to be truth in what was 
 said about the sophist at first that he was of a class not easily 
 caught for he seems to have abundance of defences which he throws up and which must every one of them be stormed before we can reach the man himself and even now we have with difficulty got 
 through his first defence which is the of and lo here is another for we have still to show that falsehood exists in 
 the sphere of language and opinion and there will be another and 
 another line of defence without end 
 
 str any one theaetetus who is able to advance even a 
 little ought to be of good cheer for what would he who is dispirited at a little progress do if he were making none at all or even undergoing a repulse such a faint heart as the proverb says will never take a city but now that we have succeeded thus far the citadel is ours and what remains is easier 
 
 theaet very true 
 
 str then as i was saying let us first of all obtain a 
 conception of language and opinion in order that we may have 
 clearer grounds for determining whether has any concern 
 with them or whether they are both always true and neither of them 
 ever false 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str then now let us speak of names as before we were 
 speaking of ideas and letters for that is the direction in which the answer may be expected 
 
 theaet and what is the question at issue about names 
 
 str the question at issue is whether all names may be connected 
 with one another or none or only some of them 
 
 theaet clearly the last is true 
 
 str i understand you to say that words which have a 
 meaning when in sequence may be connected but that words which have no meaning when in sequence cannot be connected 
 
 theaet what are you saying 
 
 str what i thought that you intended when you gave your 
 assent for there are two sorts of intimation of being which are given by the voice 
 
 theaet what are they 
 
 str one of them is called nouns and the other verbs 
 
 theaet describe them 
 
 str that which denotes action we call a verb 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str and the other which is an articulate mark set on those who 
 do the actions we call a noun 
 
 theaet quite true 
 
 str a succession of nouns only is not a sentence any more than of 
 verbs without nouns 
 
 theaet i do not understand you 
 
 str i see that when you gave your assent you had something else 
 in your mind but what i intended to say was that a mere succession 
 of nouns or of verbs is not discourse 
 
 theaet what do you mean 
 
 str i mean that words like walks runs sleeps or any 
 other words which denote action however many of them you string 
 together do not make discourse 
 
 theaet how can they 
 
 str or again when you say lion stag horse or any other 
 words which denote agents neither in this way of stringing words 
 together do you attain to discourse for there is no expression of 
 action or inaction or of the existence of existence or 
 indicated by the sounds until verbs are mingled with 
 nouns then the words fit and the smallest combination of them 
 forms language and is the simplest and least form of discourse 
 
 theaet again i ask what do you mean 
 
 str when any one says a man learns should you not call this 
 the simplest and least of sentences 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str yes for he now arrives at the point of giving an intimation 
 about something which is or is becoming or has become or will be 
 and he not only names but he does something by connecting 
 verbs with nouns and therefore we say that he discourses and to this 
 connection of words we give the name of discourse 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str and as there are some things which fit one another and other 
 things which do not fit so there are some vocal signs which do and 
 others which do not combine and form discourse 
 
 theaet quite true 
 
 str there is another small matter 
 
 theaet what is it 
 
 str a sentence must and cannot help having a subject 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str and must be of a certain quality 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str and now let us mind what we are about 
 
 theaet we must do so 
 
 str i will repeat a sentence to you in which a thing and an 
 action are combined by the help of a noun and a verb and you shall 
 tell me of whom the sentence speaks 
 
 theaet i will to the best my power 
 
 str theaetetus a very long sentence 
 
 theaet not very 
 
 str of whom does the sentence speak and who is the 
 subject that is what you have to tell 
 
 theaet of me i am the subject 
 
 str or this sentence again 
 
 theaet what sentence 
 
 str theaetetus with whom i am now speaking is flying 
 
 theaet that also is a sentence which will be admitted by every 
 one to speak of me and to apply to me 
 
 str we agreed that every sentence must necessarily have a certain 
 quality 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str and what is the quality of each of these two sentences 
 
 theaet the one as i imagine is false and the other true 
 
 str the true says what is true about you 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str and the false says what is other than true 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str and therefore speaks of things which are not as if they were 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str and say that things are real of you which are not for as we 
 were saying in regard to each thing or person there is much that 
 is and much that is not 
 
 theaet quite true 
 
 str the second of the two sentences which related to you was 
 first of all an example of the shortest form consistent with our 
 definition 
 
 theaet yes this was implied in recent admission 
 
 str and in the second place it related to a subject 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str who must be you and can be nobody else 
 theaet unquestionably 
 
 str and it would be no sentence at all if there were no subject 
 for as we proved a sentence which has no subject is impossible 
 
 theaet quite true 
 
 str when other then is asserted of you as the same and 
 as being such a combination of nouns and verbs is really and truly false discourse 
 
 theaet most true 
 
 str and therefore thought opinion and imagination are now 
 proved to exist in our minds both as true and false 
 
 theaet how so 
 
 str you will know better if you first gain a knowledge of 
 what they are and in what they severally differ from one another 
 theaet give me the knowledge which you would wish me to gain 
 str are not thought and speech the same with this exception 
 that what is called thought is the unuttered conversation of the 
 soul with herself 
 
 theaet quite true 
 
 str but the stream of thought which flows through the lips and is 
 audible is called speech 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str and we know that there exists in speech 
 
 theaet what exists 
 
 str affirmation 
 
 theaet yes we know it 
 
 str when the affirmation or denial takes place in silence and in 
 the mind only have you any other name by which to call it but 
 opinion 
 
 theaet there can be no other name 
 
 str and when opinion is presented not simply but in some form 
 of sense would you not call it imagination 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str and seeing that language is true and false and that 
 thought is the conversation of the soul with herself and opinion is the end of thinking and imagination or phantasy is the union of sense and 
 opinion the inference is that some of them since they are akin to 
 language should have an element of falsehood as well as of truth 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str do you perceive then that false opinion and speech have 
 been discovered sooner than we just now we seemed to be undertaking a task which would never be accomplished 
 
 theaet i perceive 
 
 str then let us not be discouraged about the future but 
 now having made this discovery let us go back to our previous classification 
 theaet what classification 
 
 str we divided into two sorts the one 
 the other imaginative or phantastic 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str and we said that we were uncertain in which we should 
 place the sophist 
 
 theaet we did say so 
 
 str and our heads began to go round more and more when it was 
 asserted that there is no such thing as an image or idol or 
 appearance because in no manner or time or place can there ever be 
 such a thing as falsehood 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str and now since there has been shown to be false speech and 
 false opinion there may be imitations of real existences and out 
 of this condition of the mind an art of deception may arise 
 
 theaet quite possible 
 
 str and we have already admitted in what preceded that the 
 sophist was lurking in one of the divisions of the 
 art 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str let us then renew the attempt and in dividing any class 
 always take the part to the right holding fast to that which holds 
 the sophist until we have stripped him of all his common 
 properties and reached his difference or peculiar then we may 
 exhibit him in his true nature first to ourselves and then 
 to kindred dialectical spirits 
 
 theaet very good 
 
 str you may remember that all art was originally divided 
 by us into creative and acquisitive 
 
 theaet yes 
 str and the sophist was flitting before us in the acquisitiveclass in the subdivisions of hunting contests merchandise and the like 
 
 theaet very true 
 
 str but now that the imitative art has enclosed him it is clear 
 that we must begin by dividing the art of creation for 
 imitation is a kind of creation of images however as we affirm and not of real things 
 
 theaet quite true 
 
 str in the first place there are two kinds of creation 
 
 theaet what are they 
 
 str one of them is human and the other divine 
 
 theaet i do not follow 
 
 str every power as you may remember our saying originally which 
 causes things to exist not previously existing was defined by us 
 as creative 
 
 theaet i remember 
 
 str looking now at the world and all the animals and plants at 
 things which grow upon the earth from seeds and roots as well as at 
 inanimate substances which are formed within the earth fusile or 
 shall we say that they come into having 
 existed the creation of god or shall we agree with 
 vulgar opinion about them 
 
 theaet what is it 
 
 str the opinion that nature brings them into being from some 
 spontaneous and unintelligent cause or shall we say that they are 
 created by a divine reason and a knowledge which comes from god 
 
 theaet i dare say that owing to my youth i may often waver in 
 my view but now when i look at you and see that you incline to 
 refer them to god i defer to your authority 
 
 str nobly said theaetetus and if i thought that you were one of 
 those who would hereafter change your mind i would have 
 gently argued with you and forced you to assent but as i perceive that you will come of yourself and without any argument of mine to that belief which as you say attracts you i will not forestall the work of time let me suppose then that things which are said to be made by nature are the work of divine art and that things which are made by man out of these are work of human art and so there are two kinds of making and production the one human and the other divine 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str then now subdivide each of the two sections which we have 
 already 
 
 theaet how do you mean 
 
 str i mean to say that you should make a vertical division of 
 production or invention as you have already made a lateral one 
 
 theaet i have done so 
 
 str then now there are in all four parts or of 
 them have reference to us and are human and two of them have 
 reference to the gods and are divine 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str and again in the division which was supposed to be made in 
 the other way one part in each subdivision is the making of the 
 things themselves but the two remaining parts may be called the 
 making of likenesses and so the productive art is again divided 
 into two parts 
 
 theaet tell me the divisions once more 
 
 str i suppose that we and the other animals and the elements 
 out of which things are water and the 
 known by us to be each and all the creation and work of god 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str and there are images of them which are not them but which 
 correspond to them and these are also the creation of a wonderful 
 skill 
 
 theaet what are they 
 
 str the appearances which spring up of themselves in sleep or by 
 day such as a shadow when darkness arises in a fire or the 
 reflection which is produced when the light in bright and smooth 
 objects meets on their surface with an external light and creates a 
 perception the opposite of our ordinary sight 
 
 theaet yes and the images as well as the creation are equally 
 the work of a divine hand 
 
 str and what shall we say of human art do we not make 
 one house by the art of building and another by the art of drawing which is a sort of dream created by man for those who are awake 
 
 theaet quite true 
 
 str and other products of human creation are twofold and go in 
 pairs there is the thing with which the art of making the thing is 
 concerned and the image with which imitation is concerned 
 
 theaet now i begin to understand and am ready to acknowledge 
 that there are two kinds of production and each of them two fold 
 in the lateral division there is both a divine and a human 
 production in the vertical there are realities and a creation of a kind of 
 similitudes 
 
 str and let us not forget that of the imitative class the one 
 part to have been likeness making and the other phantastic if it 
 could be shown that falsehood is a reality and belongs to 
 the class of real being 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str and this appeared to be the case and therefore now without 
 hesitation we shall number the different kinds as two 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str then now let us again divide the phantastic art 
 
 theaet where shall we make the division 
 
 str there is one kind which is produced by an instrument and 
 another in which the creator of the appearance is himself the 
 instrument 
 
 theaet what do you mean 
 
 str when any one makes himself appear like another in his 
 figure or his voice imitation is the name for this part of the phantastic art 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str let this then be named the art of mimicry and this the 
 province assigned to it as for the other division we are weary and 
 will give that up leaving to some one else the duty of making the 
 class and giving it a suitable name 
 
 theaet let us do as you a sphere to the one and leave 
 the other 
 
 str there is a further distinction theaetetus which is worthy 
 of our consideration and for a reason which i will tell you 
 
 theaet let me hear 
 
 str there are some who imitate knowing what they 
 imitate and some who do not know and what line of distinction can there possibly be greater than that which divides ignorance from knowledge 
 
 theaet there can be no greater 
 
 str was not the sort of imitation of which we spoke just now the 
 imitation of those who know for he who would imitate you 
 would surely know you and your figure 
 
 theaet naturally 
 
 str and what would you say of the figure or form of justice or of 
 virtue in general are we not well aware that many having no 
 knowledge of either but only a sort of opinion do their 
 best to show that this opinion is really entertained by them by expressing it as far as they can in word and deed 
 
 theaet yes that is very common 
 
 str and do they always fail in their attempt to be thought just 
 when they are not or is not the very opposite true 
 
 theaet the very opposite 
 
 str such a one then should be described as an be 
 distinguished from the other as he who is ignorant is distinguished 
 from him who knows 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str can we find a suitable name for each of them this is clearly 
 not an easy task for among the ancients there was some confusion of 
 ideas which prevented them from attempting to divide genera into 
 species wherefore there is no great abundance of names yet for 
 the sake of distinctness i will make bold to call the imitation which coexists with opinion the imitation of which coexists with science a scientific or learned imitation 
 
 theaet granted 
 
 str the former is our present concern for the sophist was 
 classed with imitators indeed but not among those who have 
 knowledge 
 
 theaet very true 
 
 str let us then examine our imitator of appearance and see 
 whether he is sound like a piece of iron or whether there is still 
 some crack in him 
 
 theaet let us examine him 
 
 str indeed there is a very considerable crack for if you 
 look you find that one of the two classes of imitators is a simple creature who thinks that he knows that which he only fancies the other sort has knocked about among arguments until he suspects and 
 fears that he is ignorant of that which to the many he pretends to know 
 theaet there are certainly the two kinds which you describe 
 
 str shall we regard one as the simple other as the 
 dissembling or ironical imitator 
 
 theaet very good 
 
 str and shall we further speak of this latter class as having one 
 or two divisions 
 
 theaet answer yourself 
 
 str upon consideration then there appear to me to be two there 
 is the dissembler who harangues a multitude in public in a long 
 speech and the dissembler who in private and in short speeches 
 compels the person who is conversing with him to contradict himself 
 
 theaet what you say is most true 
 
 str and who is the maker of the longer speeches is he the 
 statesman or the popular orator 
 
 theaet the latter 
 
 str and what shall we call the other is he the philosopher or 
 the sophist 
 
 theaet the philosopher he cannot be for upon our view he is 
 ignorant but since he is an imitator of the wise he will have a 
 name which is formed by an adaptation of the word sothos what shall we name him i am pretty sure that i cannot be mistaken in 
 terming him the true and very sophist 
 
 str shall we bind up his name as we did before making a 
 chain from one end of his genealogy to the other 
 
 theaet by all means 
 
 str he then who traces the pedigree of his art as 
 belonging to the conscious or dissembling section of the art of 
 causing is an imitator of appearance and is 
 separated from the class of phantastic which is a branch of 
 into that further division of creation the juggling of 
 words a creation human and not one who affirms the real 
 sophist to be of this blood and lineage will say the very truth 
 
 theaet undoubtedly 
 
 the end

 book just man 
 chapter iv 
 
 works corresponding to words 
 his conversation was gay and affable 
 he put himself on a level with the two old women who had passed their lives beside him when he laughed it was the laugh of a schoolboy 
 madame magloire liked to call him your grace votre grandeur one day he rose from his and went to his library in search of a book this book was on one of the upper shelves 
 as the bishop was rather short of stature he could not reach it 
 madame magloire said he fetch me a chair 
 my greatness grandeur does not reach as far as that shelf 
 one of his distant relatives madame la comtesse de lo rarely allowed an opportunity to escape of enumerating in his presence what she designated as the expectations of her three sons she had numerous relatives who were very old and near to death and of whom her sons were the natural heirs 
 the youngest of the three was to receive from a a good hundred thousand livres of income the second was the heir by entail to the title of the duke his uncle the eldest was to succeed to the peerage of his grandfather 
 the bishop was accustomed to listen in silence to these innocent and pardonable maternal boasts 
 on one occasion however he appeared to be more thoughtful than usual while madame de lo was relating once again the details of all these inheritances and all these expectations 
 she interrupted herself impatiently mon dieu cousin 
 what are you thinking about 
 i am thinking replied the bishop of a singular remark which is to be found i believe in st your hopes in the man from whom you do not inherit 
 at another time on receiving a notification of the decease of a gentleman of the wherein not only the dignities of the dead man but also the feudal and noble qualifications of all his relatives spread over an entire page 
 what a stout back death has he exclaimed 
 what a strange burden of titles is cheerfully imposed on him and how much wit must men have in order thus to press the tomb into the service of vanity 
 he was gifted on occasion with a gentle raillery which almost always concealed a serious meaning 
 in the course of one lent a youthful vicar came to d and preached in the cathedral he was tolerably eloquent 
 the subject of his sermon was charity he urged the rich to give to the poor in order to avoid hell which he depicted in the most frightful manner of which he was capable and to win paradise which he represented as charming and desirable among the audience there was a wealthy retired merchant who was somewhat of a usurer named m geborand who had amassed two millions in the manufacture of coarse cloth serges and woollen galloons never in his whole life had m geborand bestowed alms on any poor wretch after the delivery of that sermon it was observed that he gave a sou every sunday to the poor old at the door of the cathedral there were six of them to share it 
 one day the bishop caught sight of him in the act of bestowing this charity and said to his sister with a smile there is m geborand purchasing paradise for a sou 
 when it was a question of charity he was not to be rebuffed even by a refusal and on such occasions he gave utterance to remarks which induced reflection 
 once he was begging for the poor in a of the town there was present the marquis de champtercier a wealthy and avaricious old man who contrived to be at one and the same time an and an this variety of man has actually existed 
 when the bishop came to him he touched his arm you must give me something m le marquis the marquis turned round and answered dryly i have poor people of my own monseigneur 
 give them to me replied the bishop 
 one day he preached the following sermon in the cathedral 
 my very dear brethren my good friends there are thirteen hundred and twenty thousand peasants dwellings in france which have but three openings eighteen hundred and seventeen thousand hovels which have but two openings the door and one window and three hundred and thousand cabins besides which have but one opening the door 
 and this arises from a thing which is called the tax on doors and windows 
 just put poor families old women and little children in those buildings and behold the fevers and maladies which result 
 alas 
 god gives air to men the law sells it to them i do not blame the law but i bless god 
 in the department of the isere in the var in the two departments of the alpes the hautes and the basses the peasants have not even wheelbarrows they transport their manure on the backs of men they have no candles and they burn resinous sticks and bits of rope dipped in pitch that is the state of affairs throughout the whole of the hilly country of dauphine 
 they make bread for six months at one time they bake it with dried in the winter they break this bread up with an axe and they soak it for hours in order to render it eatable 
 my brethren have pity behold the suffering on all sides of you 
 born a provencal he easily familiarized himself with the dialect of the south 
 he said en be moussu ses sage as in lower languedoc onte anaras passa as in the puerte un bouen moutu embe un bouen fromage grase as in upper dauphine 
 this pleased the people extremely and contributed not a little to win him access to all spirits 
 he was perfectly at home in the thatched cottage and in the mountains 
 he understood how to say the grandest things in the most vulgar of idioms 
 as he spoke all tongues he entered into all hearts 
 moreover he was the same towards people of the world and towards the lower classes 
 he condemned nothing in haste and without taking circumstances into account 
 he said examine the road over which the fault has passed 
 being as he described himself with a smile an he had none of the asperities of austerity and he professed with a good deal of distinctness and without the frown of the ferociously virtuous a doctrine which may be summed up as follows 
 man has upon him his flesh which is at once his burden and his temptation 
 he drags it with him and yields to it he must watch it cheek it repress it and obey it only at the last extremity 
 there may be some fault even in this obedience but the fault thus committed is venial it is a fall but a fall on the knees which may terminate in prayer 
 to be a saint is the exception to be an upright man is the rule err fall sin if you will but be upright 
 the least possible sin is the law of man 
 no sin at all is the dream of the angel 
 all which is terrestrial is subject to sin sin is a gravitation 
 when he saw everyone exclaiming very loudly and growing angry very quickly oh oh he said with a smile to all appearance this is a great crime which all the world commits 
 these are hypocrisies which have taken fright and are in haste to make protest and to put themselves under shelter 
 he was indulgent towards women and poor people on whom the burden of human society rest 
 he said the faults of women of children of the feeble the indigent and the ignorant are the fault of the husbands the fathers the masters the strong the rich and the wise 
 he said moreover teach those who are ignorant as many things as possible society is culpable in that it does not afford instruction gratis it is responsible for the night which it produces this soul is full of shadow sin is therein committed 
 the guilty one is not the person who has committed the sin but the person who has created the shadow 
 it will be perceived that he had a peculiar manner of his own of judging things 
 i suspect that he obtained it from the gospel 
 one day he heard a criminal case which was in preparation and on the point of trial discussed in a a wretched man being at the end of his resources had coined counterfeit money out of love for a woman and for the child which he had had by her counterfeiting was still punishable with death at that epoch the woman had been arrested in the act of passing the first false piece made by the man 
 she was held but there were no proofs except against her 
 she alone could accuse her lover and destroy him by her confession 
 she denied they insisted 
 she persisted in her denial 
 thereupon an idea occurred to the attorney for the crown he invented an infidelity on the part of the lover and succeeded by means of fragments of letters cunningly presented in persuading the unfortunate woman that she had a rival and that the man was deceiving her 
 thereupon exasperated by jealousy she denounced her lover confessed all proved all 
 the man was ruined 
 he was shortly to be tried at aix with his accomplice 
 they were relating the matter and each one was expressing enthusiasm over the cleverness of the magistrate by bringing jealousy into play he had caused the truth to burst forth in wrath he had educed the justice of revenge 
 the bishop listened to all this in silence 
 when they had finished he inquired 
 where are this man and woman to be tried 
 at the court of assizes 
 he went on and where will the advocate of the crown be tried 
 a tragic event occurred at d a man was condemned to death for murder 
 he was a wretched fellow not exactly educated not exactly ignorant who had been a mountebank at fairs and a writer for the public 
 the town took a great interest in the trial on the eve of the day fixed for the execution of the condemned man the chaplain of the prison fell ill 
 a priest was needed to attend the criminal in his last moments 
 they sent for the cure it seems that he refused to come saying that is no affair of mine 
 i have nothing to do with that unpleasant task and with that mountebank 
 i too am ill and besides it is not my place this reply was reported to the bishop who said monsieur le cure is right 
 it is not his place it is mine 
 he went instantly to the prison descended to the cell of the mountebank called him by name took him by the hand and spoke to him he passed the entire day with him forgetful of food and sleep praying to god for the soul of the condemned man and praying the condemned man for his own 
 he told him the best truths which are also the most simple 
 he was father brother friend he was bishop only to bless 
 he taught him everything encouraged and consoled him the man was on the point of dying in despair 
 death was an abyss to him as he stood trembling on its mournful brink he recoiled with horror he was not sufficiently ignorant to be absolutely indifferent his condemnation which had been a profound shock had in a manner broken through here and there that wall which separates us from the mystery of things and which we call life 
 he gazed incessantly beyond this world through these fatal breaches and beheld only darkness 
 the bishop made him see light 
 on the following day when they came to fetch the unhappy wretch the bishop was still there 
 he followed him and exhibited himself to the eyes of the crowd in his purple camail and with his episcopal cross upon his neck side by side with the criminal bound with cords 
 he mounted the tumbril with him he mounted the scaffold with him the sufferer who had been so gloomy and cast down on the preceding day was radiant 
 he felt that his soul was reconciled and he hoped in god 
 the bishop embraced him and at the moment when the knife was about to fall he said to him 
 god raises from the dead him whom man slays he whom his brothers have rejected finds his father once more 
 pray believe enter into life 
 the father is there when he descended from the scaffold there was something in his look which made the people draw aside to let him pass 
 they did not know which was most worthy of admiration his pallor or his serenity on his return to the humble dwelling which he designated with a smile as his palace he said to his sister i have just officiated pontifically 
 since the most sublime things are often those which are the least understood there were people in the town who said when commenting on this conduct of the bishop it is affectation 
 this however was a remark which was confined to the the populace which perceives no jest in holy deeds was touched and admired him 
 as for the bishop it was a shock to him to have beheld the guillotine and it was a long time before he recovered from it 
 in fact when the scaffold is there all erected and prepared it has something about it which produces hallucination one may feel a certain indifference to the death penalty one may refrain from pronouncing upon it from saying yes or no so long as one has not seen a guillotine with own eyes but if one encounters one of them the shock is violent one is forced to decide and to take part for or against some admire it like de maistre others execrate it like beccaria the guillotine is the concretion of the law it is called vindicte it is not neutral and it does not permit you to remain neutral he who sees it shivers with the most mysterious of shivers all social problems erect their interrogation point around this the scaffold is a vision 
 the scaffold is not a piece of carpentry the scaffold is not a machine the scaffold is not an inert bit of mechanism constructed of wood iron and cords 
 it seems as though it were a being possessed of i know not what sombre initiative one would say that this piece of work saw that this machine heard that this mechanism understood that this wood this iron and these cords were possessed of will in the frightful meditation into which its presence casts the soul the scaffold appears in terrible guise and as though taking part in what is going on 
 the scaffold is the accomplice of the executioner it devours it eats flesh it drinks blood the scaffold is a sort of monster fabricated by the judge and the carpenter a spectre which seems to live with a horrible vitality composed of all the death which it has inflicted 
 therefore the impression was terrible and profound on the day following the execution and on many succeeding days the bishop appeared to be crushed 
 the almost violent serenity of the funereal moment had disappeared the phantom of social justice tormented him 
 he who generally returned from all his deeds with a radiant satisfaction seemed to be reproaching himself at times he talked to himself and stammered lugubrious monologues in a low voice 
 this is one which his sister overheard one evening and preserved 
 i did not think that it was so monstrous it is wrong to become absorbed in the divine law to such a degree as not to perceive human law 
 death belongs to god alone by what right do men touch that unknown thing 
 in course of time these impressions weakened and probably vanished nevertheless it was observed that the bishop thenceforth avoided passing the place of execution 
 m myriel could be summoned at any hour to the bedside of the sick and dying 
 he did not ignore the fact that therein lay his greatest duty and his greatest labor 
 widowed and orphaned families had no need to summon him he came of his own accord 
 he understood how to sit down and hold his peace for long hours beside the man who had lost the wife of his love of the mother who had lost her child 
 as he knew the moment for silence he knew also the moment for speech 
 oh admirable consoler 
 he sought not to efface sorrow by forgetfulness but to magnify and dignify it by hope 
 he said 
 have a care of the manner in which you turn towards the dead think not of that which perishes 
 gaze steadily 
 you will perceive the living light of your dead in the depths of heaven he knew that faith is wholesome 
 he sought to counsel and calm the despairing man by pointing out to him the resigned man and to transform the grief which gazes upon a grave by showing him the grief which fixes its gaze upon a star

 book just man 
 chapter iv 
 
 works corresponding to words 
 his conversation was gay and affable 
 he put himself on a level with the two old women who had passed their lives beside him when he laughed it was the laugh of a schoolboy 
 madame magloire liked to call him your grace votre grandeur one day he rose from his and went to his library in search of a book this book was on one of the upper shelves 
 as the bishop was rather short of stature he could not reach it 
 madame magloire said he fetch me a chair 
 my greatness grandeur does not reach as far as that shelf 
 one of his distant relatives madame la comtesse de lo rarely allowed an opportunity to escape of enumerating in his presence what she designated as the expectations of her three sons she had numerous relatives who were very old and near to death and of whom her sons were the natural heirs 
 the youngest of the three was to receive from a a good hundred thousand livres of income the second was the heir by entail to the title of the duke his uncle the eldest was to succeed to the peerage of his grandfather 
 the bishop was accustomed to listen in silence to these innocent and pardonable maternal boasts 
 on one occasion however he appeared to be more thoughtful than usual while madame de lo was relating once again the details of all these inheritances and all these expectations 
 she interrupted herself impatiently mon dieu cousin 
 what are you thinking about 
 i am thinking replied the bishop of a singular remark which is to be found i believe in st your hopes in the man from whom you do not inherit 
 at another time on receiving a notification of the decease of a gentleman of the wherein not only the dignities of the dead man but also the feudal and noble qualifications of all his relatives spread over an entire page 
 what a stout back death has he exclaimed 
 what a strange burden of titles is cheerfully imposed on him and how much wit must men have in order thus to press the tomb into the service of vanity 
 he was gifted on occasion with a gentle raillery which almost always concealed a serious meaning 
 in the course of one lent a youthful vicar came to d and preached in the cathedral he was tolerably eloquent 
 the subject of his sermon was charity he urged the rich to give to the poor in order to avoid hell which he depicted in the most frightful manner of which he was capable and to win paradise which he represented as charming and desirable among the audience there was a wealthy retired merchant who was somewhat of a usurer named m geborand who had amassed two millions in the manufacture of coarse cloth serges and woollen galloons never in his whole life had m geborand bestowed alms on any poor wretch after the delivery of that sermon it was observed that he gave a sou every sunday to the poor old at the door of the cathedral there were six of them to share it 
 one day the bishop caught sight of him in the act of bestowing this charity and said to his sister with a smile there is m geborand purchasing paradise for a sou 
 when it was a question of charity he was not to be rebuffed even by a refusal and on such occasions he gave utterance to remarks which induced reflection 
 once he was begging for the poor in a of the town there was present the marquis de champtercier a wealthy and avaricious old man who contrived to be at one and the same time an and an this variety of man has actually existed 
 when the bishop came to him he touched his arm you must give me something m le marquis the marquis turned round and answered dryly i have poor people of my own monseigneur 
 give them to me replied the bishop 
 one day he preached the following sermon in the cathedral 
 my very dear brethren my good friends there are thirteen hundred and twenty thousand peasants dwellings in france which have but three openings eighteen hundred and seventeen thousand hovels which have but two openings the door and one window and three hundred and thousand cabins besides which have but one opening the door 
 and this arises from a thing which is called the tax on doors and windows 
 just put poor families old women and little children in those buildings and behold the fevers and maladies which result 
 alas 
 god gives air to men the law sells it to them i do not blame the law but i bless god 
 in the department of the isere in the var in the two departments of the alpes the hautes and the basses the peasants have not even wheelbarrows they transport their manure on the backs of men they have no candles and they burn resinous sticks and bits of rope dipped in pitch that is the state of affairs throughout the whole of the hilly country of dauphine 
 they make bread for six months at one time they bake it with dried in the winter they break this bread up with an axe and they soak it for hours in order to render it eatable 
 my brethren have pity behold the suffering on all sides of you 
 born a provencal he easily familiarized himself with the dialect of the south 
 he said en be moussu ses sage as in lower languedoc onte anaras passa as in the puerte un bouen moutu embe un bouen fromage grase as in upper dauphine 
 this pleased the people extremely and contributed not a little to win him access to all spirits 
 he was perfectly at home in the thatched cottage and in the mountains 
 he understood how to say the grandest things in the most vulgar of idioms 
 as he spoke all tongues he entered into all hearts 
 moreover he was the same towards people of the world and towards the lower classes 
 he condemned nothing in haste and without taking circumstances into account 
 he said examine the road over which the fault has passed 
 being as he described himself with a smile an he had none of the asperities of austerity and he professed with a good deal of distinctness and without the frown of the ferociously virtuous a doctrine which may be summed up as follows 
 man has upon him his flesh which is at once his burden and his temptation 
 he drags it with him and yields to it he must watch it cheek it repress it and obey it only at the last extremity 
 there may be some fault even in this obedience but the fault thus committed is venial it is a fall but a fall on the knees which may terminate in prayer 
 to be a saint is the exception to be an upright man is the rule err fall sin if you will but be upright 
 the least possible sin is the law of man 
 no sin at all is the dream of the angel 
 all which is terrestrial is subject to sin sin is a gravitation 
 when he saw everyone exclaiming very loudly and growing angry very quickly oh oh he said with a smile to all appearance this is a great crime which all the world commits 
 these are hypocrisies which have taken fright and are in haste to make protest and to put themselves under shelter 
 he was indulgent towards women and poor people on whom the burden of human society rest 
 he said the faults of women of children of the feeble the indigent and the ignorant are the fault of the husbands the fathers the masters the strong the rich and the wise 
 he said moreover teach those who are ignorant as many things as possible society is culpable in that it does not afford instruction gratis it is responsible for the night which it produces this soul is full of shadow sin is therein committed 
 the guilty one is not the person who has committed the sin but the person who has created the shadow 
 it will be perceived that he had a peculiar manner of his own of judging things 
 i suspect that he obtained it from the gospel 
 one day he heard a criminal case which was in preparation and on the point of trial discussed in a a wretched man being at the end of his resources had coined counterfeit money out of love for a woman and for the child which he had had by her counterfeiting was still punishable with death at that epoch the woman had been arrested in the act of passing the first false piece made by the man 
 she was held but there were no proofs except against her 
 she alone could accuse her lover and destroy him by her confession 
 she denied they insisted 
 she persisted in her denial 
 thereupon an idea occurred to the attorney for the crown he invented an infidelity on the part of the lover and succeeded by means of fragments of letters cunningly presented in persuading the unfortunate woman that she had a rival and that the man was deceiving her 
 thereupon exasperated by jealousy she denounced her lover confessed all proved all 
 the man was ruined 
 he was shortly to be tried at aix with his accomplice 
 they were relating the matter and each one was expressing enthusiasm over the cleverness of the magistrate by bringing jealousy into play he had caused the truth to burst forth in wrath he had educed the justice of revenge 
 the bishop listened to all this in silence 
 when they had finished he inquired 
 where are this man and woman to be tried 
 at the court of assizes 
 he went on and where will the advocate of the crown be tried 
 a tragic event occurred at d a man was condemned to death for murder 
 he was a wretched fellow not exactly educated not exactly ignorant who had been a mountebank at fairs and a writer for the public 
 the town took a great interest in the trial on the eve of the day fixed for the execution of the condemned man the chaplain of the prison fell ill 
 a priest was needed to attend the criminal in his last moments 
 they sent for the cure it seems that he refused to come saying that is no affair of mine 
 i have nothing to do with that unpleasant task and with that mountebank 
 i too am ill and besides it is not my place this reply was reported to the bishop who said monsieur le cure is right 
 it is not his place it is mine 
 he went instantly to the prison descended to the cell of the mountebank called him by name took him by the hand and spoke to him he passed the entire day with him forgetful of food and sleep praying to god for the soul of the condemned man and praying the condemned man for his own 
 he told him the best truths which are also the most simple 
 he was father brother friend he was bishop only to bless 
 he taught him everything encouraged and consoled him the man was on the point of dying in despair 
 death was an abyss to him as he stood trembling on its mournful brink he recoiled with horror he was not sufficiently ignorant to be absolutely indifferent his condemnation which had been a profound shock had in a manner broken through here and there that wall which separates us from the mystery of things and which we call life 
 he gazed incessantly beyond this world through these fatal breaches and beheld only darkness 
 the bishop made him see light 
 on the following day when they came to fetch the unhappy wretch the bishop was still there 
 he followed him and exhibited himself to the eyes of the crowd in his purple camail and with his episcopal cross upon his neck side by side with the criminal bound with cords 
 he mounted the tumbril with him he mounted the scaffold with him the sufferer who had been so gloomy and cast down on the preceding day was radiant 
 he felt that his soul was reconciled and he hoped in god 
 the bishop embraced him and at the moment when the knife was about to fall he said to him 
 god raises from the dead him whom man slays he whom his brothers have rejected finds his father once more 
 pray believe enter into life 
 the father is there when he descended from the scaffold there was something in his look which made the people draw aside to let him pass 
 they did not know which was most worthy of admiration his pallor or his serenity on his return to the humble dwelling which he designated with a smile as his palace he said to his sister i have just officiated pontifically

 this however was a remark which was confined to the the populace which perceives no jest in holy deeds was touched and admired him 
 as for the bishop it was a shock to him to have beheld the guillotine and it was a long time before he recovered from it 
 in fact when the scaffold is there all erected and prepared it has something about it which produces hallucination one may feel a certain indifference to the death penalty one may refrain from pronouncing upon it from saying yes or no so long as one has not seen a guillotine with own eyes but if one encounters one of them the shock is violent one is forced to decide and to take part for or against some admire it like de maistre others execrate it like beccaria the guillotine is the concretion of the law it is called vindicte it is not neutral and it does not permit you to remain neutral he who sees it shivers with the most mysterious of shivers all social problems erect their interrogation point around this the scaffold is a vision 
 the scaffold is not a piece of carpentry the scaffold is not a machine the scaffold is not an inert bit of mechanism constructed of wood iron and cords 
 it seems as though it were a being possessed of i know not what sombre initiative one would say that this piece of work saw that this machine heard that this mechanism understood that this wood this iron and these cords were possessed of will in the frightful meditation into which its presence casts the soul the scaffold appears in terrible guise and as though taking part in what is going on 
 the scaffold is the accomplice of the executioner it devours it eats flesh it drinks blood the scaffold is a sort of monster fabricated by the judge and the carpenter a spectre which seems to live with a horrible vitality composed of all the death which it has inflicted 
 therefore the impression was terrible and profound on the day following the execution and on many succeeding days the bishop appeared to be crushed

 m myriel could be summoned at any hour to the bedside of the sick and dying 
 he did not ignore the fact that therein lay his greatest duty and his greatest labor 
 widowed and orphaned families had no need to summon him he came of his own accord 
 he understood how to sit down and hold his peace for long hours beside the man who had lost the wife of his love of the mother who had lost her child 
 as he knew the moment for silence he knew also the moment for speech 
 oh admirable consoler 
 he sought not to efface sorrow by forgetfulness but to magnify and dignify it by hope 
 he said 
 have a care of the manner in which you turn towards the dead think not of that which perishes 
 gaze steadily 
 you will perceive the living light of your dead in the depths of heaven he knew that faith is wholesome 
 he sought to counsel and calm the despairing man by pointing out to him the resigned man and to transform the grief which gazes upon a grave by showing him the grief which fixes its gaze upon a star

 aunt beru was filling a pitcher with blue liquid from a refrigerated her in the dining area a steady buzz of conversation reached to the kitchen 
 she sighed sadly the mealtime discussions between her husband and lukehad grown steadily more acrimonious as the restlessness pulled him indirections other than farming directions for which owen a stolid man of the soil ifthere ever was one had absolutely no sympathy 
 returning the bulk container to the refrigerator unit she placed the pitcher on atray and hurried back to the dining room beru was not a brilliant woman but shepossessed an instinctive understanding of her important position in this functioned like the damping rods in a nuclear reactor as long as she waspresent owen and luke would continue to generate a lot of heat but if she was out oftheir presence for too 
 condenser units built into the bottom of each plate kept the food on the table hot as she hurried in immediately both men lowered their voices tosomething civilized and shifted the subject beru pretended not to notice the change 
 i think that artoo unit might have been stolen uncle owen luke was if that had been the topic of conversation all along 
 his uncle helped himself to the milk pitcher mumbling his reply around amouthful of food the jawas have a tendency to pick up anything not tieddown luke but remember basically afraid of their own shadows to resortto outright theft have to have considered the consequences of being pursuedand punished theoretically their minds be capable of that what makesyou think the droid is stolen 
 for one thing in awfully good shape for a discard it generated ahologram recording while i was cleaning luke tried to conceal his horror at theslip he added hastily but not important the reason i think it might bestolen is because it claims to be the property of someone it calls kenobi 
 maybe something in the food or perhaps the milk caused uncle to again it might have been an expression of disgust which was way ofindicating his opinion of that peculiar personage in any case he continued eatingwithout looking up at his nephew 
 luke pretended the display of graphic dislike had never happened i continued determinedly it might have meant old ben the first name is the last is identical 
 when his uncle steadfastly maintained his silence luke prompted him you know who talking about uncle owen 
 surprisingly his uncle looked uncomfortable instead of angry mumbled still not meeting gaze a name from another time hesquirmed nervously in his seat a name that can only mean trouble 
 luke refused to heed the implied warning and pressed on is it someonerelated to old ben then i know he had any relatives 
 you stay away from that old wizard he hear me his uncle substituting threat for reason 
 owen aunt beru started to interject gently but the big farmer cut her offsternly 
 now this is important beru he turned his attention back to his told you about kenobi before a crazy old man dangerous and fullof mischief and the best left well along 
 pleading gaze caused him to quiet somewhat that droid has nothingto do with him have he grumbled half to himself tomorrow i want you to take the unit into anchorhead and have its memoryflushed 
 snorting owen bent to his meal with determination that will bethe end of this foolishness i care where that machine thinks it came from ipaid hard credit for it and it belongs to us now 
 but suppose it does belong to someone else luke wondered what if person comes looking for his droid 
 an expression between sorrow and a sneer crossed his seamed face at aremembrance he i think that man exists anymore he died aboutthe same time as your father a huge mouthful of hot food was shoveled forget about it 
 then it was a real person luke murmured staring down at his plate headded slowly did he know my father 
 i said forge about it owen snapped your only worry as far as thosetwo droids are concerned is having them ready for work tomorrow remember thelast of our saving is tied up in those two even have bought them if so near harvest he shook a spoon at his nephew in the morning i wantyou to have them working with the irrigation units up on the south ridge 
 you know luke replied distantly i think these droids are going to work outfine in fact i he hesitated shooting his uncle a surreptitious glare i wasthinking about our agreement about me staying on for another season 
 his uncle failed to react so luke rushed on before his nerve failed if thesenew droids do work out i want to transmit my application to enter the academy fornext year 
 owen scowled trying to hide his displeasure with food you mean you wantto transmit application next the harvest 
 you have more than enough droids now and in good last 
 droids yes his uncle agreed but droids replace a man luke youknow that the harvest is when i need you the most just for one more seasonafter this one he looked away bluster and anger gone now 
 luke toyed with his food not eating saying nothing 
 listen his uncle told him for the first time got a chance for a realfortune make enough to hire some extra hands for next time not then you can go to the academy he fumbled over words unaccustomedto pleading i need you here luke you understand that you 
 another year his nephew objected sullenly another year 
 how many times had he heard that before how many times had theyrepeated this identical charade with the same result 
 convinced once more that luke had come round to his way of thinking owenshrugged the objection off time will pass before you know it 
 abruptly luke rose shoving his barely touched plate of food aside you said last year when biggs left he spun and half ran from the room 
 where are you going luke his aunt yelled worriedly after him 
 reply was bleak bitter looks like going nowhere then headded out of consideration for his sensibilities i have to finish cleaningthose droids if going to be ready to work tomorrow 
 silence hung in the air of the dining room after luke departed husband andwife ate mechanically eventually aunt beru stopped shoving her food around herplate looked up and pointed out earnestly owen you keep him here of his friends are gone the people he grew up with the academy means somuch to him 
 listlessly her husband replied make it up to him next year i have maybe the year after that 
 just not a farmer owen she continued firmly he never will be nomatter how hard you try to make him one she shook her head slowly gottoo much of his father in him 
 for the first time all evening owen lars looked thoughtful as well as concernedas he gazed down the passage luke had taken what afraid of hewhispered 
 luke had gone topside he stood on the sand watching the double sunset asfirst one and then the other of twin suns sank slowly behind the distantrange of dunes in the fading light the sands turned gold russet and flaming before advancing night put the bright colors to sleep for another day the first time those sands would blossom with food plants this formerwasteland would see and eruption of green 
 the thought ought to have sent a thrill of anticipation through luke he shouldhave been as flushed with excitement as his uncle was whenever he described thecoming harvest instead luke felt nothing but a vast indifferent emptiness noteven the prospect of having a lot of money for the first time in his life excited was there to do with money in on tatooine for thatmatter 
 part of him an increasingly large part was growing more and more restless atremaining unfulfilled this was not an uncommon feeling in youths his age but forreasons luke did not understand it was much stronger in him than in any of hisfriends 
 as the night cold came creeping over the sand and up his legs he brushed thegrit from his trousers and descended into the garage maybe working on the droidswould bury some of the remorse a little deeper in his mind a quick survey of thechamber showed no movement neither of the new machines was in slightly luke took a small control box from his belt and activated a coupleof switches set into the plastic 
 a low him came from the box the caller produced the taller of the two in fact he gave a yell of surprise as he jumped up behind the skyhopper 
 luke started toward him openly puzzled what are you hiding back therefor 
 the robot came stumbling around the prow of the craft he attitude one ofdesperation it occurred to luke then that despite his activating the caller the artoounit was still nowhere to be seen 
 the reason for his something related to pouring unbiddenfrom threepio it my fault the robot begged frantically please me i told him not to go but faulty he must be has totally boiled his logic circuits he kept babbling on about some sortof mission sir i never heard a robot with delusions of grandeur before suchthings even be within the cogitative theory units of one as basic as anartoo unit and 
 you mean luke started to gape 
 yes gone 
 and i removed his restraining coupling myself luke muttered he could visualize his face the last of their savings tied up inthese droids he had said 
 racing out of the garage luke hunted for reasons why the artoounit should go berserk threepio followed on his heels 
 from a small ridge which formed the highest point close by the homestead lukehad a panoramic view of the surrounding desert bringing out the preciousmacrobinoculars he scanned the rapidly darkening horizons for something and out of its mechanical mind 
 threepio fought his way up through the sand to stand beside luke that artoounit has always caused nothing but trouble he groaned astromech droids arebecoming too iconoclastic even for me to understand sometimes 
 the binoculars finally came down and luke commented nowhere in sight he kicked furiously at the ground damn could ihave been so stupid letting it trick me into removing that restrainer uncle to kill me 
 begging your pardon sir ventured a hopeful threepio visions of jawasdancing in his head but we go after him luke turned studiously he examined the wall of black advancing toward at night too dangerous with all the raiders around not too concernedabout the jawas but sandpeopleno not in the dark have to wait untilmorning to try to track him 
 a shout rose from the homestead below are you finished withthose droids yet turning down the power for the night 
 all right luke responded sidestepping the question be down in a fewminutes uncle owen turning he took one last look at the vanished am i in for it he muttered that little going to get me in a lot oftrouble 
 oh he excells at that sir threepio confirmed with mock cheerfulness lukethrew him a sour look and together they turned and descended into the garage 
 lukeluke still rubbing the morning sleep from his eyes owen glancedfrom side to side loosening his neck muscles where could that boy be loafingnow he wondered aloud at the lack of response there was no sign of movementin the homestead and he had already checked above 
 luke he yelled again luke luke lukethe name echoed teasing back athim from the homestead walls turning angrily he stalked back into the beru was preparing breakfast 
 have you seen luke this morning he asked as softly as he could manage 
 she glance briefly at him then returned to her cooking yes he said he hadsome things to do before he started out to the south ridge this morning so he leftearly 
 before breakfast owen frowned worriedly not like him did hetake the new droids with him 
 i think so i am sure i saw at least one of them with him 
 well owen mused uncomfortable but with nothing to really hangimprecations on better have those ridge units repaired by midday or behell to pay 
 an unseen face shielded by smooth white metal emerged from the pod that now formed the backbone of a dune slightly higher than its voice sounded efficient but tired 
 nothing the inspecting trooper muttered to his several companions notapes and no sign of habitation 
 powerful handguns lowered at the information that the pod was deserted oneof the armored men turned calling out to an officer standing some distance is definitely the pod that cleared the rebel ship sir but nothing onboard 
 yet it set down intact the officer was murmuring to himself it could havedone so on automatics but if it was a true malfunction then they have beenengaged something make sense 
 why nothing on board and no hint of life sir a voice declared 
 the officer turned and strode several paces to where another trooper waskneeling in the sand he held up an object for the inspection it shone inthe sun 
 droid plating the officer observed after a quick glance at the metal and underling exchanged a significant glance then their eyes turnedsimultaneously to the high mesas off to the north 
 gravel and fine sand formed a gritty fog beneath the landspeeder as it slid acrossthe rippling wasteland of tatooine on humming repulsors occasionally the craftwould jog slightly as it encountered a dip or slight rise to return to its smooth passageas its pilot compensated for the change in terrain 
 luke leaned back in the seat luxuriating in unaccustomed relaxation as threepioskillfully directed the powerful landcraft around dunes and rocky outcrops youhandle a landspeeder pretty well for a machine he noted admiringly 
 thank you sir a gratified threepio responded his eyes never moving from thelandscape ahead i was not lying to your uncle when i claimed versatility as mymiddle name in fact on occasion i have been called upon to perform unexpectedfunctions in circumstances which would have appalled my designers 
 something pinged behind them then pinged again 
 luke frowned and popped the speeder canopy a few moments of digging inthe motor casing eliminated the metallic bark 
 that he yelled forward 
 threepio signaled that the adjustment was satisfactory luke turned back intothe cockpit and closed the canopy over them again silently he brushed his hair back out of his eyes as his attention returned to the dry desert ahead ofthem 
 old ben kenobi is supposed to live out in this general direction even thoughnobody knows exactly where i see how that artoo unit could have come this farso quickly his expression was downcast we must have missed him back in thedunes somewhere he could be anywhere out here and uncle owen must bewondering why i called in from the south ridge by now 
 threepio considered a moment then ventured would it help sir if you toldhim that it was my fault 
 luke appeared to brighten at the suggestion surehe needs you twice asmuch now probably only deactivate you for a day or so or give you a partialmemory flush 
 deactivate memory flush threepio added hastily on second thought would still be around if you removed his restraining module 
 but something more important than fixing responsibility for the little was on mind at the moment wait a minute he advisedthreepio as he stared fixedly at the instrument panel something deadahead on the metal scanner distinguish outlines at this distance but judgingby size alone it could be our wandering droid hit it 
 the landspeeder jumped forward as threepio engaged the accelerator but itsoccupants were totally unaware that other eyes were watching as the craft increasedits speed 
 those eyes were not organic but then they wholly mechanical one could say for certain because no one had ever made that intimate a study ofthe tusken less formally to the margin farmers of tatooine simply asthe sandpeople 
 the tusken permit close study of themselves discouraging potentialobservers by methods as effective as they were uncivilized a few xenologiststhought they must be related to the jawas even fewer hypothesized that the jawaswere actually the mature form of the sandpeople but this theory was discounted bythe majority of serious scientists 
 both races affected tight clothing to shield them from twin dose ofsolar radiation but there most comparisons ended instead of heavy woven cloakslike the jawas wore the sandpeople wrapped themselves in endlessswathing and bandages and loose bits of cloth 
 where the jawas feared everything a tusken raider feared little thesandpeople were larger stronger and far more aggressive fortunately for thehuman colonists of tatooine they were not very numerous and elected to pursue theirnomadic existence in some of most desolate regions contact betweenhuman and tusken therefore was infrequent and uneasy and they murdered no morethan a handful of human per year since the human population had claimed its shareof tuskens not always with reason a peace of a sort existed between the as neither side gained an advantage 
 one of the pair felt that that unstable condition had temporarily shifted in hisfavor and he was about to take full advantage of it as he raised his rifle toward thelandspeeder but his companion grabbed the weapon and shoved down on it beforeit could be fired this set off a violent argument between the two and as theytraded vociferous opinions in a language consisting mostly of consonants thelandspeeder sped on its way 
 either because the speeder had passed out of range or because the second tuskenhad convinced the other the two broke off the discussion and scrambled down thebackside of the high ridge snuffling and a shifting of weight took place at the ridgebottom as the two banthas stirred at the approach of their masters each was aslarge as a small dinosaur with bright eyes and long thick fur they hissed anxiouslyas the two sandpeople approached then mounted them from knee to saddle 
 with a kick banthas rose moving slowly but with enormous strides the twomassive horned creatures swept down the back of the rugged bluff urged on by theiranxious equally outrageous mahouts 
 him all right luke declared with mixed anger and satisfaction as the tinytripodal form came into view the speeder banked and swung down onto the floorof a huge sandstone canyon luke slipped his rifle out from behind the seat andswung it over his shoulder come round in front of him threepio he instructed 
 with pleasure sir 
 the artoo unit obviously noted their approach but mad no move to escape itcould hardly have outrun the landspeeder anyway artoo simply halted as soon as itdetected them and waited until the craft swung around in a smooth arc threepiocame to a sharp halt sending up a low cloud of sand on the smaller the whine from the engine dropped to a low idling hum asthreepio put it in parking mode a last sigh and the craft stopped completely 
 after finishing a cautious survey of the canyon luke led his companion out ontothe gravelly surface and up to artoo detoo just where he inquired sharply didyou think you were going 
 a feeble whistle issued from the apologetic robot but it was threepio and notthe recalcitrant rover who was abruptly doing most of the talking 
 master luke here is now your rightful owner artoo how could you justamble away from him like this now found you have no more ofthis gibberish i know where picked that thatmelodramatic hologram either 
 artoo started to beep in protest but indignation was too great topermit excuses and talk to me about your mission what rot master luke blast you into a million pieces right here and now 
 not much chance of that admitted luke a bit overwhelmed by vindictiveness come getting late he eyed the rapidly risingsuns i just hope we can get back before uncle owen really lets go 
 if you mind my saying so threepio suggested apparently unwilling thatthe artoo unit should get off so easily i think you ought to deactivate the littlefugitive until gotten him safely back in the garage 
 no not going to try anything luke studied the softly beeping droidsternly i hope learned his lesson no need to 
 without warning the artoo unit suddenly leaped off the mean featconsidering the weakness of the spring mechanisms in his three thick legs hiscylindrical body was twisting and spinning as he let out a frantic symphony ofwhistles hoots and electronic exclamations 
 luke was tired not alarmed what is it wrong with him was beginning to see how patience could be worn thin he had hadabout enough of this addled instrument himself 
 undoubtedly the artoo unit had acquired the holo of the girl by accident thenused it to entice luke into removing his restraining module threepio probably hadthe right attitude still once luke got its circuits realigned and its logic couplingscleaned it would make a perfectly serviceable farm unit onlyif that was the why was threepio looking around so anxiously 
 oh my sir artoo claims there are several creatures of unknown typeapproaching from the southeast 
 that could be another attempt by artoo to distract them but luke takethe chance instantly he had his rifle off his shoulder and had activated the energycell he examined the horizon in the indicated direction and saw nothing but were experts at making themselves unseeable 
 luke suddenly realized exactly how far out they were how much ground thelandspeeder had covered that morning never been out in this direction this farfrom the farm before he informed threepio there are some awfully strangethings living out here not all of them have been classified better to treatanything as dangerous until determined otherwise of course if somethingutterly new his curiosity prodded him in any case this was probably justanother ruse of artoo take a look he decided 
 moving cautiously forward and keeping his rifle ready he led threepio towardthe crest of a nearby high dune at the same time he took care not to let artoo out ofhis sight 
 once at the top he lay flat and traded his rifle for the macrobinoculars canyon spread out before them rising to a wall of rust andocher advancing the binocs slowly across the canyon floor he settled unexpectedlyon two tethered shapes riderless 
 did you say something sir wheezed threepio struggling up behind locomotors were not designed for such outer climbing and scrambling 
 banthas all right luke whispered over his shoulder not considering in theexcitement of the moment that threepio might not know a bantha from a panda 
 he looked back into the eyepieces refocusing slightly i see one of them 
 something dark suddenly blocked his sight for a moment he thought that arock might have moved in front of them irritably he dropped the binoculars andreached out to move the blinding object aside his hand touched something like softmetal 
 it was a bandaged leg about as big around as both of together looked upand up the towering figure glaring down at him was no jawa ithad seemingly erupted straight from the sand 
 threepio took a startled step backward and found no footing as gyros whinedin protest the tall robot tumbled backward down the side of the dune frozen inplace luke heard steadily fading bangs and rattles as threepio bounced down thesteep slope behind him 
 as the moment of confrontation passed the tusken let out a terrifying grunt offury and pleasure and brought down his heavy gaderffii the axwould have cleaved skull neatly in two except that he threw the rifle up in agesture more instinctive than calculated his weapon deflected the blow but wouldnever do so again made from cannibalized freighter plating the huge ax shatteredthe barrel and made metallic confetti of the delicate insides 
 luke scrambled backward and found himself against a steep drop the raiderstalked him slowly weapon held high over its head it uttered agruesome chuckling laugh the sound made all the more inhuman by the distortioneffect of its sandfilter 
 luke tried to view his situation objectively as he had been instructed to do insurvival school trouble was his mouth was dry his hands were shaking and hewas paralyzed with fear with the raider in front of him and a probably fatal dropbehind something else in his mind took over and opted for the least painful fainted 
 none of the raiders notice artoo detoo as the tiny robot force himself into asmall alcove in the rocks near the landspeeder one of them was carrying the inertform of luke he dumped the unconscious youth in a heap next to the speeder thenjoined his fellows as they began swarming over the open craft 
 supplies and spare parts were thrown in all directions from time to time theplundering would be interrupted as several of them quibbled or fought over aparticularly choice bit of booty 
 unexpectedly distribution of the content ceased and withfrightening speed the raiders became part of the desertscape looking in all directions 
 a lost breeze idled absently down the canyon far off to the west somethinghowled a rolling booming drone ricocheted off canyon walls and crawlednervously up and down a gorgon scale 
 the sandpeople remained poised a moment longer then they were utteringloud grunts and moans of fright as they rushed to get away from the highly visiblelandspeeder 
 the shivering howl sounded again nearer this time bu now the sandpeoplewere halfway to their waiting banthas that were likewise lowing tensely and tuggingat their tethers 
 although the sound held no meaning for artoo detoo the little droid tried tosqueeze himself even deeper into the the booming howl came by the way the sandpeople had reacted something monstrous beyondimagining had to be behind that rolling cry something monstrous and might not have the sense to distinguish between edible organics and inediblemachines 
 not even the dust of their passing remained to mark where the tusken raidershad only minutes before been dismembering the interior of the landspeeder artoodetoo shut down all but vital functions trying to minimize noise and light as aswishing sound grew gradually audible moving toward the landspeeder thecreature appeared above the top of a nearby dune

 thank you sir a gratified threepio responded his eyes never moving from thelandscape ahead i was not lying to your uncle when i claimed versatility as mymiddle name in fact on occasion i have been called upon to perform unexpectedfunctions in circumstances which would have appalled my designers 
 something pinged behind them then pinged again 
 luke frowned and popped the speeder canopy a few moments of digging inthe motor casing eliminated the metallic bark 
 that he yelled forward 
 threepio signaled that the adjustment was satisfactory luke turned back intothe cockpit and closed the canopy over them again silently he brushed his hair back out of his eyes as his attention returned to the dry desert ahead ofthem 
 old ben kenobi is supposed to live out in this general direction even thoughnobody knows exactly where i see how that artoo unit could have come this farso quickly his expression was downcast we must have missed him back in thedunes somewhere he could be anywhere out here and uncle owen must bewondering why i called in from the south ridge by now 
 threepio considered a moment then ventured would it help sir if you toldhim that it was my fault 
 luke appeared to brighten at the suggestion surehe needs you twice asmuch now probably only deactivate you for a day or so or give you a partialmemory flush 
 deactivate memory flush threepio added hastily on second thought would still be around if you removed his restraining module 
 but something more important than fixing responsibility for the little was on mind at the moment wait a minute he advisedthreepio as he stared fixedly at the instrument panel something deadahead on the metal scanner distinguish outlines at this distance but judgingby size alone it could be our wandering droid hit it 
 the landspeeder jumped forward as threepio engaged the accelerator but itsoccupants were totally unaware that other eyes were watching as the craft increasedits speed 
 those eyes were not organic but then they wholly mechanical one could say for certain because no one had ever made that intimate a study ofthe tusken less formally to the margin farmers of tatooine simply asthe sandpeople 
 the tusken permit close study of themselves discouraging potentialobservers by methods as effective as they were uncivilized a few xenologiststhought they must be related to the jawas even fewer hypothesized that the jawaswere actually the mature form of the sandpeople but this theory was discounted bythe majority of serious scientists 
 both races affected tight clothing to shield them from twin dose ofsolar radiation but there most comparisons ended instead of heavy woven cloakslike the jawas wore the sandpeople wrapped themselves in endlessswathing and bandages and loose bits of cloth 
 where the jawas feared everything a tusken raider feared little thesandpeople were larger stronger and far more aggressive fortunately for thehuman colonists of tatooine they were not very numerous and elected to pursue theirnomadic existence in some of most desolate regions contact betweenhuman and tusken therefore was infrequent and uneasy and they murdered no morethan a handful of human per year since the human population had claimed its shareof tuskens not always with reason a peace of a sort existed between the as neither side gained an advantage 
 one of the pair felt that that unstable condition had temporarily shifted in hisfavor and he was about to take full advantage of it as he raised his rifle toward thelandspeeder but his companion grabbed the weapon and shoved down on it beforeit could be fired this set off a violent argument between the two and as theytraded vociferous opinions in a language consisting mostly of consonants thelandspeeder sped on its way 
 either because the speeder had passed out of range or because the second tuskenhad convinced the other the two broke off the discussion and scrambled down thebackside of the high ridge snuffling and a shifting of weight took place at the ridgebottom as the two banthas stirred at the approach of their masters each was aslarge as a small dinosaur with bright eyes and long thick fur they hissed anxiouslyas the two sandpeople approached then mounted them from knee to saddle 
 with a kick banthas rose moving slowly but with enormous strides the twomassive horned creatures swept down the back of the rugged bluff urged on by theiranxious equally outrageous mahouts 
 him all right luke declared with mixed anger and satisfaction as the tinytripodal form came into view the speeder banked and swung down onto the floorof a huge sandstone canyon luke slipped his rifle out from behind the seat andswung it over his shoulder come round in front of him threepio he instructed 
 with pleasure sir 
 the artoo unit obviously noted their approach but mad no move to escape itcould hardly have outrun the landspeeder anyway artoo simply halted as soon as itdetected them and waited until the craft swung around in a smooth arc threepiocame to a sharp halt sending up a low cloud of sand on the smaller the whine from the engine dropped to a low idling hum asthreepio put it in parking mode a last sigh and the craft stopped completely 
 after finishing a cautious survey of the canyon luke led his companion out ontothe gravelly surface and up to artoo detoo just where he inquired sharply didyou think you were going 
 a feeble whistle issued from the apologetic robot but it was threepio and notthe recalcitrant rover who was abruptly doing most of the talking 
 master luke here is now your rightful owner artoo how could you justamble away from him like this now found you have no more ofthis gibberish i know where picked that thatmelodramatic hologram either 
 artoo started to beep in protest but indignation was too great topermit excuses and talk to me about your mission what rot master luke blast you into a million pieces right here and now 
 not much chance of that admitted luke a bit overwhelmed by vindictiveness come getting late he eyed the rapidly risingsuns i just hope we can get back before uncle owen really lets go 
 if you mind my saying so threepio suggested apparently unwilling thatthe artoo unit should get off so easily i think you ought to deactivate the littlefugitive until gotten him safely back in the garage 
 no not going to try anything luke studied the softly beeping droidsternly i hope learned his lesson no need to 
 without warning the artoo unit suddenly leaped off the mean featconsidering the weakness of the spring mechanisms in his three thick legs hiscylindrical body was twisting and spinning as he let out a frantic symphony ofwhistles hoots and electronic exclamations 
 luke was tired not alarmed what is it wrong with him was beginning to see how patience could be worn thin he had hadabout enough of this addled instrument himself 
 undoubtedly the artoo unit had acquired the holo of the girl by accident thenused it to entice luke into removing his restraining module threepio probably hadthe right attitude still once luke got its circuits realigned and its logic couplingscleaned it would make a perfectly serviceable farm unit onlyif that was the why was threepio looking around so anxiously 
 oh my sir artoo claims there are several creatures of unknown typeapproaching from the southeast 
 that could be another attempt by artoo to distract them but luke takethe chance instantly he had his rifle off his shoulder and had activated the energycell he examined the horizon in the indicated direction and saw nothing but were experts at making themselves unseeable 
 luke suddenly realized exactly how far out they were how much ground thelandspeeder had covered that morning never been out in this direction this farfrom the farm before he informed threepio there are some awfully strangethings living out here not all of them have been classified better to treatanything as dangerous until determined otherwise of course if somethingutterly new his curiosity prodded him in any case this was probably justanother ruse of artoo take a look he decided 
 moving cautiously forward and keeping his rifle ready he led threepio towardthe crest of a nearby high dune at the same time he took care not to let artoo out ofhis sight 
 once at the top he lay flat and traded his rifle for the macrobinoculars canyon spread out before them rising to a wall of rust andocher advancing the binocs slowly across the canyon floor he settled unexpectedlyon two tethered shapes riderless 
 did you say something sir wheezed threepio struggling up behind locomotors were not designed for such outer climbing and scrambling 
 banthas all right luke whispered over his shoulder not considering in theexcitement of the moment that threepio might not know a bantha from a panda 
 he looked back into the eyepieces refocusing slightly i see one of them 
 something dark suddenly blocked his sight for a moment he thought that arock might have moved in front of them irritably he dropped the binoculars andreached out to move the blinding object aside his hand touched something like softmetal 
 it was a bandaged leg about as big around as both of together looked upand up the towering figure glaring down at him was no jawa ithad seemingly erupted straight from the sand 
 threepio took a startled step backward and found no footing as gyros whinedin protest the tall robot tumbled backward down the side of the dune frozen inplace luke heard steadily fading bangs and rattles as threepio bounced down thesteep slope behind him 
 as the moment of confrontation passed the tusken let out a terrifying grunt offury and pleasure and brought down his heavy gaderffii the axwould have cleaved skull neatly in two except that he threw the rifle up in agesture more instinctive than calculated his weapon deflected the blow but wouldnever do so again made from cannibalized freighter plating the huge ax shatteredthe barrel and made metallic confetti of the delicate insides 
 luke scrambled backward and found himself against a steep drop the raiderstalked him slowly weapon held high over its head it uttered agruesome chuckling laugh the sound made all the more inhuman by the distortioneffect of its sandfilter 
 luke tried to view his situation objectively as he had been instructed to do insurvival school trouble was his mouth was dry his hands were shaking and hewas paralyzed with fear with the raider in front of him and a probably fatal dropbehind something else in his mind took over and opted for the least painful fainted 
 none of the raiders notice artoo detoo as the tiny robot force himself into asmall alcove in the rocks near the landspeeder one of them was carrying the inertform of luke he dumped the unconscious youth in a heap next to the speeder thenjoined his fellows as they began swarming over the open craft 
 supplies and spare parts were thrown in all directions from time to time theplundering would be interrupted as several of them quibbled or fought over aparticularly choice bit of booty 
 unexpectedly distribution of the content ceased and withfrightening speed the raiders became part of the desertscape looking in all directions 
 a lost breeze idled absently down the canyon far off to the west somethinghowled a rolling booming drone ricocheted off canyon walls and crawlednervously up and down a gorgon scale 
 the sandpeople remained poised a moment longer then they were utteringloud grunts and moans of fright as they rushed to get away from the highly visiblelandspeeder 
 the shivering howl sounded again nearer this time bu now the sandpeoplewere halfway to their waiting banthas that were likewise lowing tensely and tuggingat their tethers 
 although the sound held no meaning for artoo detoo the little droid tried tosqueeze himself even deeper into the the booming howl came by the way the sandpeople had reacted something monstrous beyondimagining had to be behind that rolling cry something monstrous and might not have the sense to distinguish between edible organics and inediblemachines 
 not even the dust of their passing remained to mark where the tusken raidershad only minutes before been dismembering the interior of the landspeeder artoodetoo shut down all but vital functions trying to minimize noise and light as aswishing sound grew gradually audible moving toward the landspeeder thecreature appeared above the top of a nearby dune

 and what do you think of this latest comedy the coronation at milan asked anna pavlovna and of the comedy of the people of genoa and lucca laying their petitions before monsieur buonaparte and monsieur buonaparte sitting on a throne and granting the petitions of the nations adorable it is enough to make head whirl it is as if the whole world had gone crazy 
 prince andrew looked anna pavlovna straight in the face with a sarcastic smile 
 dieu me la donne gare a qui la touche they say he was very fine when he said that he remarked repeating the words in italian dio mi dato guai a chi la tocchi 
 god has given it to me let him who touches it beware 
 i hope this will prove the last drop that will make the glass run over anna pavlovna continued the sovereigns will not be able to endure this man who is a menace to everything 
 the sovereigns i do not speak of russia said the vicomte polite but hopeless the sovereigns madame what have they done for louis xvii for the queen or for madame elizabeth nothing and he became more animated and believe me they are reaping the reward of their betrayal of the bourbon cause the sovereigns why they are sending ambassadors to compliment the usurper 
 and sighing disdainfully he again changed his position 
 prince hippolyte who had been gazing at the vicomte for some time through his lorgnette suddenly turned completely round toward the little princess and having asked for a needle began tracing the conde coat of arms on the table he explained this to her with as much gravity as if she had asked him to do it 
 baton de gueules engrele de gueules d azur maison conde said he 
 the princess listened smiling 
 if buonaparte remains on the throne of france a year longer the vicomte continued with the air of a man who in a matter with which he is better acquainted than anyone else does not listen to others but follows the current of his own thoughts things will have gone too far by intrigues violence exile and executions french society i mean good french society will have been forever destroyed and then 
 he shrugged his shoulders and spread out his hands pierre wished to make a remark for the conversation interested him but anna pavlovna who had him under observation interrupted 
 the emperor alexander said she with the melancholy which always accompanied any reference of hers to the imperial family has declared that he will leave it to the french people themselves to choose their own form of government and i believe that once free from the usurper the whole nation will certainly throw itself into the arms of its rightful king she concluded trying to be amiable to the royalist emigrant 
 that is doubtful said prince andrew monsieur le vicomte quite rightly supposes that matters have already gone too far i think it will be difficult to return to the old regime 
 from what i have heard said pierre blushing and breaking into the conversation almost all the aristocracy has already gone over to side 
 it is the buonapartists who say that replied the vicomte without looking at pierre at the present time it is difficult to know the real state of french public opinion 
 bonaparte has said so remarked prince andrew with a sarcastic smile 
 it was evident that he did not like the vicomte and was aiming his remarks at him though without looking at him 
 i showed them the path to glory but they did not follow it prince andrew continued after a short silence again quoting words i opened my antechambers and they crowded in i do not know how far he was justified in saying so 
 not in the least replied the vicomte after the murder of the duc even the most partial ceased to regard him as a hero if to some people he went on turning to anna pavlovna he ever was a hero after the murder of the duc there was one martyr more in heaven and one hero less on earth 
 before anna pavlovna and the others had time to smile their appreciation of the epigram pierre again broke into the conversation and though anna pavlovna felt sure he would say something inappropriate she was unable to stop him 
 the execution of the duc declared monsieur pierre was a political necessity and it seems to me that napoleon showed greatness of soul by not fearing to take on himself the whole responsibility of that deed 
 dieu mon dieu muttered anna pavlovna in a terrified whisper 
 what monsieur pierre do you consider that assassination shows greatness of soul said the little princess smiling and drawing her work nearer to her 
 oh oh exclaimed several voices 
 capital said prince hippolyte in english and began slapping his knee with the palm of his hand 
 the vicomte merely shrugged his shoulders pierre looked solemnly at his audience over his spectacles and continued 
 i say so he continued desperately because the bourbons fled from the revolution leaving the people to anarchy and napoleon alone understood the revolution and quelled it and so for the general good he could not stop short for the sake of one life 
 you come over to the other table suggested anna pavlovna 
 but pierre continued his speech without heeding her 
 no cried he becoming more and more eager napoleon is great because he rose superior to the revolution suppressed its abuses preserved all that was good in it equality of citizenship and freedom of speech and of the press and only for that reason did he obtain power 
 yes if having obtained power without availing himself of it to commit murder he had restored it to the rightful king i should have called him a great man remarked the vicomte 
 he could not do that the people only gave him power that he might rid them of the bourbons and because they saw that he was a great man the revolution was a grand thing continued monsieur pierre betraying by this desperate and provocative proposition his extreme youth and his wish to express all that was in his mind 
 what revolution and regicide a grand thing well after that but you come to this other table repeated anna pavlovna 
 contrat social said the vicomte with a tolerant smile 
 i am not speaking of regicide i am speaking about ideas 
 yes ideas of robbery murder and regicide again interjected an ironical voice 
 those were extremes no doubt but they are not what is most important what is important are the rights of man emancipation from prejudices and equality of citizenship and all these ideas napoleon has retained in full force 
 liberty and equality said the vicomte contemptuously as if at last deciding seriously to prove to this youth how foolish his words were words which have long been discredited who does not love liberty and equality even our saviour preached liberty and equality have people since the revolution become happier on the contrary we wanted liberty but buonaparte has destroyed it 
 prince andrew kept looking with an amused smile from pierre to the vicomte and from the vicomte to their hostess in the first moment of outburst anna pavlovna despite her social experience was but when she saw that sacrilegious words had not exasperated the vicomte and had convinced herself that it was impossible to stop him she rallied her forces and joined the vicomte in a vigorous attack on the orator 
 but my dear monsieur pierre said she how do you explain the fact of a great man executing a duc or even an ordinary man who is innocent and untried 
 i should like said the vicomte to ask how monsieur explains the th brumaire was not that an imposture it was a swindle and not at all like the conduct of a great man 
 and the prisoners he killed in africa that was horrible said the little princess shrugging her shoulders 
 a low fellow say what you will remarked prince hippolyte 
 pierre not knowing whom to answer looked at them all and smiled his smile was unlike the of other people when he smiled his grave even rather gloomy look was instantaneously replaced by another a childlike kindly even rather silly look which seemed to ask forgiveness 
 the vicomte who was meeting him for the first time saw clearly that this young jacobin was not so terrible as his words suggested all were silent 
 how do you expect him to answer you all at once said prince andrew besides in the actions of a statesman one has to distinguish between his acts as a private person as a general and as an emperor so it seems to me 
 yes yes of course pierre chimed in pleased at the arrival of this reinforcement 
 one must admit continued prince andrew that napoleon as a man was great on the bridge of arcola and in the hospital at jaffa where he gave his hand to the but but there are other acts which it is difficult to justify 
 prince andrew who had evidently wished to tone down the awkwardness of remarks rose and made a sign to his wife that it was time to go 
 suddenly prince hippolyte started up making signs to everyone to attend and asking them all to be seated began 
 i was told a charming moscow story today and must treat you to it excuse me vicomte i must tell it in russian or the point will be lost and prince hippolyte began to tell his story in such russian as a frenchman would speak after spending about a year in russia everyone waited so emphatically and eagerly did he demand their attention to his story 
 there is in moscow a lady une dame and she is very stingy she must have two footmen behind her carriage and very big ones that was her taste and she had a maid also big she said 
 here prince hippolyte paused evidently collecting his ideas with difficulty 
 she said oh yes she said girl to the maid put on a livery get up behind the carriage and come with me while i make some calls 
 here prince hippolyte spluttered and burst out laughing long before his audience which produced an effect unfavorable to the narrator several persons among them the elderly lady and anna pavlovna did however smile 
 she went suddenly there was a great wind the girl lost her hat and her long hair came down here he could contain himself no longer and went on between gasps of laughter and the whole world knew 
 and so the anecdote ended though it was unintelligible why he had told it or why it had to be told in russian still anna pavlovna and the others appreciated prince social tact in so agreeably ending unpleasant and unamiable outburst after the anecdote the conversation broke up into insignificant small talk about the last and next balls about theatricals and who would meet whom and when and where

 chapter 
 
 in the course of time mr earnshaw began to fail he had been active and healthy yet his strength left him suddenly and when he was confined to the chimney comer he grew grievously irritable a nothing vexed him and suspected slights of his authority nearly threw him into fits this was especially to be remarked if anyone attempted to impose upon or domineer over his favourite he was painfully jealous lest a word should be spoken amiss to him seeming to have got into his head the notion that because he liked heathcliff all hated and longed to do him an ill turn it was a disadvantage to the lad for the kinder among us did not wish to fret the master so we humoured his partiality and that humouring was rich nourishment to the pride and black tempers still it became in a manner necessary twice or thrice manifestation of scorn while his father was near roused the old man to a fury he seized his stick to strike him and shook with rage that he could not do it 
 at last our curate we had a curate then who made the living answer by teaching the little lintons and earnshaws and farming his bit of land himself he advised that the young man should be sent to college and mr earnshaw agreed though with a heavy spirit for he was nought and would never thrive as where he wandered 
 i hoped heartily we should have peace now it hurt me to think the master should be made uncomfortable by his own good deed i fancied the discontent of age and disease arose from his family disagreements as he would have it that it did really you know sir it was in his sinking frame we might have got on tolerably notwithstanding but for two people miss cathy and joseph the servant you saw him i dare say up yonder he was and is yet most likely the wearisomest pharisee that ever ransacked a bible to rake the promises to himself and fling the curses on his neighbours by his knack of sermonizing and pious discoursing he contrived to make a great impression on mr earnshaw and the more feeble the master became the more influence he gained he was relentless in worrying him about his concerns and about ruling his children rigidly he encouraged him to regard hindley as a reprobate and night after night he regularly grumbled out a long string of tales against heathcliff and catherine always minding to flatter weakness by heaping the heaviest blame on the last

 chapter 
 
 in the course of time mr earnshaw began to fail he had been active and healthy yet his strength left him suddenly and when he was confined to the chimney comer he grew grievously irritable a nothing vexed him and suspected slights of his authority nearly threw him into fits this was especially to be remarked if anyone attempted to impose upon or domineer over his favourite he was painfully jealous lest a word should be spoken amiss to him seeming to have got into his head the notion that because he liked heathcliff all hated and longed to do him an ill turn it was a disadvantage to the lad for the kinder among us did not wish to fret the master so we humoured his partiality and that humouring was rich nourishment to the pride and black tempers still it became in a manner necessary twice or thrice manifestation of scorn while his father was near roused the old man to a fury he seized his stick to strike him and shook with rage that he could not do it 
 at last our curate we had a curate then who made the living answer by teaching the little lintons and earnshaws and farming his bit of land himself he advised that the young man should be sent to college and mr earnshaw agreed though with a heavy spirit for he was nought and would never thrive as where he wandered 
 i hoped heartily we should have peace now it hurt me to think the master should be made uncomfortable by his own good deed i fancied the discontent of age and disease arose from his family disagreements as he would have it that it did really you know sir it was in his sinking frame we might have got on tolerably notwithstanding but for two people miss cathy and joseph the servant you saw him i dare say up yonder he was and is yet most likely the wearisomest pharisee that ever ransacked a bible to rake the promises to himself and fling the curses on his neighbours by his knack of sermonizing and pious discoursing he contrived to make a great impression on mr earnshaw and the more feeble the master became the more influence he gained he was relentless in worrying him about his concerns and about ruling his children rigidly he encouraged him to regard hindley as a reprobate and night after night he regularly grumbled out a long string of tales against heathcliff and catherine always minding to flatter weakness by heaping the heaviest blame on the last 
 certainly she had ways with her such as i never saw a child take up before and she put all of us past our patience fifty times and oftener in a day from the hour she came downstairs till the hour she went to bed we had not a security that she be in mischief her spirits were always at mark her tongue always laughing and plaguing everybody who would not do the same a wild wicked slip she she had the bonniest eye the sweetest smile and lightest foot in the parish and after all i believe she meant no harm for when once she made you cry in good earnest it seldom happened that she would not keep you company and oblige you to be quiet that you might comfort her she was much too fond of heathcliff the greatest punishment we could invent for her was to keep her separate from him yet she got chided more than any of us on his account in play she liked exceedingly to act the little mistress using her hands freely and commanding her companions she did so to me but i would not bear shopping and ordering and so i let her know

 chapter five 
 
 what in the world are you going to do now jo asked 
 meg one snowy afternoon as her sister came tramping through the hall in rubber boots old sack and hood with a broom in one hand and a shovel in the other 
 going out for exercise answered jo with a mischievous twinkle in her eyes 
 i should think two long walks this morning would have been enough cold and dull out and i advise you to stay warm and dry by the fire as i do said meg with a shiver 
 never take advice keep still all day and not being a pussycat i like to doze by the fire i like adventures and going to find some 
 meg went back to toast her feet and read ivanhoe and jo began to dig paths with great energy the snow was light and with her broom she soon swept a path all round the garden for beth to walk in when the sun came out and the invalid dolls needed air now the garden separated the marches house from that of mr laurence both stood in a suburb of the city which was still countrylike with groves and lawns large gardens and quiet streets a low hedge parted the two estates on one side was an old brown house looking rather bare and shabby robbed of the vines that in summer covered its walls and the flowers which then surrounded it on the other side was a stately stone mansion plainly betokening every sort of comfort and luxury from the big coach house and grounds to the conservatory and the glimpses of lovely things one caught between the rich curtains 
 yet it seemed a lonely lifeless sort of house for no children frolicked on the lawn no motherly face ever smiled at the windows and few people went in and out except the old gentleman and his grandson 
 to lively fancy this fine house seemed a kind of enchanted palace full of splendors and delights which no one enjoyed she had long wanted to behold these hidden glories and to know the laurence boy who looked as if he would like to be known if he only knew how to begin since the party she had been more eager than ever and had planned many ways of making friends with him but he had not been seen lately and jo began to think he had gone away when she one day spied a brown face at an upper window looking wistfully down into their garden where beth and amy were one another 
 that boy is suffering for society and fun she said to herself his grandpa does not know good for him and keeps him shut up all alone he needs a party of jolly boys to play with or somebody young and lively a great mind to go over and tell the old gentleman so 
 the idea amused jo who liked to do daring things and was always scandalizing meg by her queer performances the plan of going over was not forgotten and when the snowy afternoon came jo resolved to try what could be done she saw mr lawrence drive off and then sallied out to dig her way down to the hedge where she paused and took a survey all quiet curtains down at the lower windows servants out of sight and nothing human visible but a curly black head leaning on a thin hand at the upper window 
 there he is thought jo poor boy all alone and sick this dismal day a shame toss up a snowball and make him look out and then say a kind word to him 
 up went a handful of soft snow and the head turned at once showing a face which lost its listless look in a minute as the big eyes brightened and the mouth began to smile jo nodded and laughed and flourished her broom as she called out 
 how do you do are you sick 
 laurie opened the window and croaked out as hoarsely as a raven 
 better thank you had a bad cold and been shut up a week 
 sorry what do you amuse yourself with 
 nothing dull as tombs up here 
 you read 
 not much they let me 
 somebody read to you 
 grandpa does sometimes but my books interest him and i hate to ask brooke all the time 
 have someone come and see you then 
 there anyone like to see boys make such a row and my head is weak 
 there some nice girl read and amuse you girls are quiet and like to play nurse 
 know any 
 you know us began jo then laughed and stopped 
 so i do will you come please cried laurie 
 not quiet and nice but come if mother will let me go ask her shut the window like a good boy and wait till i come 
 with that jo shouldered her broom and marched into the house wondering what they would all say to her laurie was in a flutter of excitement at the idea of having company and flew about to get ready for as mrs march said he was a little gentleman and did honor to the coming guest by brushing his curly pate putting on a fresh color and trying tidy up the room which in spite of half a dozen servants was anything but neat presently there came a loud ring than a decided voice asking for mr laurie and a surprised looking servant came running up to announce a young lady 
 all right show her up miss jo said laurie going to the door of his little parlor to meet jo who appeared looking rosy and quite at her ease with a covered dish in one hand and three kittens in the other 
 here i am bag and baggage she said briskly mother sent her love and was glad if i could do anything for you meg wanted me to bring some of her blancmange she makes it very nicely and beth thought her cats would be comforting i knew laugh at them but i refuse she was so anxious to do something 
 it so happened that funny loan was just the thing for in laughing over the kits laurie forgot his bashfulness and grew sociable at once 
 that looks too pretty to eat he said smiling with pleasure as jo uncovered the dish and showed the blancmange surrounded by a garland of green leaves and the scarlet flowers of pet geranium 
 it anything only they all felt kindly and wanted to show it tell the girl to put it away for your tea so simple you can eat it and being soft it will slip down without hurting your sore throat what a cozy room this is 
 it might be it it was kept nice but the maids are lazy and i know how to make them mind it worries me though 
 right it up in two minutes for it only needs to have the hearth brushed the things made straight on the mantelpiece the books put here and the bottles there and your sofa turned from the light and the pillows plumped up a bit now then fixed 
 and so he was for as she laughed and talked jo had whisked things into place and given quite a different air to the room laurie watched her in respectful silence and when she beckoned him to his sofa he sat down with a sigh of satisfaction saying gratefully 
 how kind you are yes what it wanted now please take the big chair and let me do something to amuse my company 
 no i came to amuse you shall i read aloud and jo looked affectionately toward some inviting books near by 
 thank you read all those and if you mind rather talk answered laurie 
 not a bit talk all day if only set me going beth says i never know when to stop 
 is beth the rosy one who stays at home good deal and sometimes goes out with a little basket asked laurie with interest 
 yes beth my girl and a regular good one she is too 
 the pretty one is meg and the one is amy i believe 
 laurie colored up but answered frankly why you see i often hear you calling to one another and when alone up here i help looking over at your house you always seem to be having such good times i beg your pardon for being so rude but sometimes you forget to put down the curtain at the window where the flowers are and when the lamps are lighted like looking at a picture to see the fire and you all around the table with your mother her face is right opposite and it looks so sweet behind the flowers i help watching it i got any mother you know and laurie poked the fire to hide a little twitching of the lips that he could not control 
 the solitary hungry look in his eyes went straight to warm heart she had been so simply taught that there was no nonsense in her head and at fifteen she was as innocent and frank as any child laurie was sick and lonely and feeling how rich she was in home and happiness she gladly tried to share it with him her face was very friendly and her sharp voice unusually gentle as she said 
 never draw that curtain any more and i give you leave to look as much as you like i just wish though instead of peeping come over and see us mother is so splendid do you heaps of good and beth would sing to you if i begged her to and amy would dance meg and i would make you laugh over our funny stage properties and have jolly times your grandpa let you 
 i think he would if your mother asked him very kind though he does not look so and he lets me do what i like pretty much only afraid i might be a bother to strangers began laurie brightening more and more 
 we are not strangers we are neighbors and you think be a bother we want to know you and been trying to do it this ever so long we been here a great while you know but we have got acquainted with all our neighbors but you 
 you see grandpa lives among his books and mind much what happens outside mr brooke my tutor stay here you know and i have no one to go about with me so i just stop at home and get on as i can 
 bad you ought to make an effort and go visiting everywhere you are asked then have plenty of friends andpleasant places to go to never mind being bashful it last long if you keep going 
 laurie turned red again but offended at being accused of bashfulness for there was so much good will in jo it was impossible not to take her blunt speeches as kindly as they were meant 
 do you like your school asked the boy changing the subject after a little pause during which he stared at the fire and jo looked about her well pleased 
 go to school a i mean i go to wait on my and a dear cross old soul she is too answered jo 
 laurie opened his mouth to ask another question but remembering just in time that it manners to make too many inquiries into affairs he shut it again and looked uncomfortable 
 jo liked his good breeding and mind having a laugh at aunt march so she gave him a lively description of the fidgety old lady her fat poodle the parrot that talked spanish and the library where she reveled 
 laurie enjoyed that immensely and when she told about the prim old gentleman who came once to woo aunt march and in the middle of a fine speech how poll had tweaked his wig off to his great dismay the boy lay back and laughed till the tears ran down his cheeks and a maid popped her head in to see what was the matter 
 oh that does me no end of good tell on please he said taking his face out of the sofa cushion red and shining with merriment 
 much elated with her success jo did tell on all about their plays and plans their hopes and fears for father and the most interesting events of the little world in which the sisters lived then they got to talking about books and to delight she found that laurie loved them as well as she did and had read even more than herself 
 if you like them so much come down and see ours grandfather is out so you be afraid said laurie getting up 
 not afraid of anything returned jo with a toss of the head 
 i believe you are exclaimed the boy looking at her with much admiration though he privately thought she would have good reason to be a trifle afraid of the old gentleman if she met hem in some of his moods 
 the atmosphere of the whole house being summerlike laurie led the way from room to room letting jo stop to examine whatever struck her fancy and so at last they came to the library where she clapped her hands and pranced as she always did when especially delighted it was lined with books and there were pictures and statues and distracting little cabinets full of coins and curiosities and sleepy hollow chairs and queer tables and bronzes and best of all a great open fireplace with quaint tiles all round it 
 what richness sighed jo sinking into the depth of a velour chair and gazing about her with an air of intense satisfaction theodore laurence you ought to be the happiest boy in the added impressively 
 a fellow live on books said laurie shaking his head as he perched on a table opposite 
 before he could more a bell rang and jo flew up exclaiming with alarm mercy me your grandpa 
 well what if it is you are not afraid of anything you know returned the boy looking wicked 
 i think i am a little bit afraid of him but i know why i should be marmee said i might come and i think any the worse for it said jo composing herself though she kept her eyes on the door 
 a great deal better for it and ever so much obliged only afraid you are very tired of talking to me it was so pleasant i bear to stop said laurie gratefully 
 the doctor to see you sir and the maid beckoned as she spoke 
 would you mind if i left you for a minute i suppose i must see him said laurie 
 mind me happy as a cricket here answered jo 
 laurie went away and his guest amused herself in her own way she was standing before a fine portrait of the old gentleman when the door opened again and without turning she said decidedly sure now that i be afraid of him for got kind eyes though his mouth is grim and he looks as if he had a tremendous will of hisown he as handsome as my grandfather but i like him 
 thank you said a gruff voice behind her and there to her great dismay stood old mr laurence 
 poor jo blushed till she blush any redder and her heart began to beat uncomfortably fast as she thought what she had said for a minute a wild desire to run away possessed her but that was cowardly and the girls would laugh at her so she resolved to stay and get out of the scrape as she could a second look showed her that the living eyes under the bushy eyebrows were kinder even than the painted ones and there was a sly twinkle in them which lessened her fear a good deal the gruff voice was gruffer than ever as the old gentleman said abruptly after the dreadful pause so not afraid of me hey 
 not much sir 
 and you think me as handsome as your grandfather 
 not quite sir 
 and got a tremendous will have i 
 i only said i thought so 
 but you like me in spite of it 
 yes i do sir 
 that answer pleased the old gentleman he gave a short laugh shook hands with her and putting his finger under her chin turned up her face examined it gravely and let it go saying with a nod got your spirit if you his face he was a fine man my dear but what is better he was a brave and an honest one and i was proud to be his friend 
 thank you sir and jo was quite comfortable after that for it suited her exactly 
 what have you been doing to this boy of mine hey was the next question sharply put 
 only trying to be neighborly sir and jo to how her visit came about 
 you think he needs cheering up a bit do you 
 yes sir he seems a little lonely and young folks would do him good perhaps we are only girls but we should be glad to help if we could for we forget the splendid christmas present you sent us said jo eagerly 
 tut tut tut that was the affair how is the poor woman 
 doing nicely sir and off went jo talking very fast as she told all about the hummels in whom her mother had interested richer friends than they were 
 just her way of doing good i shall come and see your mother some fine day tell her so the tea bell we have it early on the account come down and go on being neighborly 
 if like to have me sir 
 ask you if i and mr laurence offered her his arm with courtesy 
 what would meg say to this thought jo as she was marched away while her eyes danced with fun as she imagined herself telling the story at home 
 hey why what the dickens has come to the fellow said the old gentleman as laurie came running downstairs and brought up with a start of surprise at the astounding sight of jo arm in arm with his redoubtable grandfather 
 i know come sir he began as jo gave him a triumphant little glance 
 evident by the way you racket downstairs come to your tea sir and behave like a gentleman and having pulled the hair by way of a caress mr laurence walked on while laurie went through a series of comic evolutions behind their backs which nearly produced an explosion of laughter from jo 
 the old gentleman did not say much as he drank his four cups of tea but he watched the young people who soon chatted away like old friends and the change in his grandson did not escape him there was color light and life in the face now vivacity in his manner and genuine merriment in his laugh 
 right the lad is lonely see what these little girls can do for him thought mr laurence as he looked and listened he liked jo for her odd blunt ways suited him and she seemed to understand the boy almost as well as if she had been one herself 
 if the laurences had been what jo called prim and poky she would not have got on at all for such people always made her shy and awkward but finding them free and easy she was so herself and made a good impression when they rose she proposed to go but laurie said he had something more to show her and took her away to the conservatory which had been lighted for her benefit it seemed quite fairylike to jo as she went up and down the walks enjoying the blooming walls on either side the soft light the damp sweet air and the wonderful vines and trees that hung about her while her new friend cut the finest flowers till his hands were full then he tied them up saying with the happy look jo liked to see please give these to your mother and tell her i like the medicine she sent me very much 
 they found mr laurence standing before the fire in the great drawing room by attention was entirely absorbed by a grand piano which stood open 
 do you play she asked turning to laurie with a respectful expression 
 sometimes he answered modestly 
 please do now i want to hear it so i can tell beth 
 you first 
 know how too stupid to learn but i love music dearly 
 so laurie played and jo listened with her nose luxuriously buried in heliotrope and tea roses her respect and regard for the laurence boy increased very much for he played remarkably well and put on any airs she wished beth could hear him but she did not say so only praised him till he was quite abashed and his grandfather came to his rescue 
 that will do that will do young lady too many sugarplums are not good for him his music bad but i hope he will do as well in more important things going well much obliged to you and i hope come again my respects to your mother good night doctor jo 
 he shook hands kindly but looked as if something did not please him when they got into the hall jo asked laurie if she had said something amiss he shook his head 
 no it was me he like to hear me play 
 why not 
 tell you some day john is going home with you as i 
 no need of that i am not a young lady and only a step take care of yourself you 
 yes but you will come again i hope 
 if you promise to come and see us after you are well 
 i will 
 good night laurie 
 good night jo good night 
 when all the adventures had been told the family felt inclined to go visiting in a body for each found something very attractive in the big house on the other side of the hedge mrs march wanted to talk of her father with the old man who had not forgotten him meg longed to walk in the conservatory beth sighed for the grand piano and amy was eager to see the fine pictures and statues 
 mother why mr laurence like to have laurie play asked jo who was of an inquiring disposition 
 i am not sure but i think it was because his son father married an italian lady a musician which displeased the old man who is very proud the lady was good and lovely and accomplished but he did not like her and never saw his son after he married they both died when laurie was a little child and then his grandfather took him home i fancy the boy who was born in italy is not very strong and the old man is afraid of losing him which makes him so careful laurie comes naturally by his love of music for he is like his mother and i dare say his grandfather fears that he may want to be a musician at any rate his skill reminds him of the woman he did not like and so he glowered as jo said 
 dear me how romantic exclaimed meg 
 how silly said jo let him be a musician if he wants to and not plague his life out sending him to college when he hates to go 
 why he has such handsome black eyes and pretty manners i suppose italians are always nice said meg who was a little sentimental 
 what do you know about his eyes and his manners you never spoke to him hardly cried jo who was not sentimental 
 i saw him at the party and what you tell shows that he knows how to behave that was a nice little speech about the medicine mother sent him 
 he meant the blanc mange i suppose how stupid you are child he meant you of course 
 did he and jo opened her eyes as if it had never occurred to her before 
 i never saw such a girl you know a compliment when you get it said meg with the air of a young lady who knew all about the matter 
 i think they are great nonsense and thank you not to be silly and spoil my fun a nice boy and i like him and i have any sentimental stuff about compliments and such rubbish all be good to him because he got any mother and he may come over and see us he marmee 
 yes jo your little friend is very welcome and i hope meg will remember that children should be children as long as they can 
 i call myself a child and not in my teens yet observed amy what do you say beth 
 i was thinking about our progress answered beth who had not heard a word how we got out of the slough and through the wicket gate by resolving to be good and up the steep hill by trying and that maybe the house over there full of splendid things is going to be our palace beautiful 
 we have got to get by the lions first said jo as if she rather liked the prospect
